# NoFakeNews (NFN) (NO LONGER IN DEVELOPMENT)
NoFakeNews is an AI-powered browser extension that detects fake news.

This repository contains the code for the front-end parts of NoFakeNews, where we implement a browser extension for major web browsers such as Chrome and Firefox where we automatically scan the headlines and embeds of news articles and inform users of potential fake news, operating through an artificial intelligence model as our back-end system.

[NoFakeNewsApp](https://github.com/objecteds/NoFakeNewsApp) is the repository that contains the code for the back-end AI web application.

### Why?

Fake news can be extremely malicious, inculcating misinformation into those who believe it. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, fake news has spread rapidly within many communities. As more people pay attention to news, during the pandemic, the general population is more susceptible to the intake of fake news. 

Therefore, NoFakeNews was created to prevent the spreading of fake news and improve the quality of social perspectives held by social citzens.
