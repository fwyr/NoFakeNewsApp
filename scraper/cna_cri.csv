She sent most of it home to Indonesia and used a portion to buy clothes, cosmetics and mobile phones. Bela Kharisma Lut Fitriana made restitution of about S$3,500 using her salary that was kept by her employer. The court heard that she had no other finances to make up for the remainder. Bela pleaded guilty to one charge of theft, with another charge taken into consideration. The court heard that Bela began working for her employers in April 2020. She cooked for the family and did household chores, and was given access to the bedrooms of the first victim, a 42-year-old woman, as well as her 74-year-old father. She found that the victim had a safe in a cupboard in her room, and saw the password written in a book. She also noticed that the victim's father would often leave his wallet in an unlocked drawer. Between April and December 2021, Bela took at least S$1,468 from the safe and S$3,150 from the wallet. She roped in a friend of hers, who was also a domestic helper, to remit a total of S$3,390 to her family in Indonesia over multiple occasions. She also used the money to buy clothes, cosmetics, a watch and two mobile phones. Meanwhile, the victims began noticing the missing cash. On Dec 30, 2021, the first victim questioned Bela about the missing money from the safe and wallet, and Bela admitted to stealing. A police report was lodged and police seized 25 items that Bela had bought using the stolen money. These include jeans, jackets, shirts, liquid lipsticks, body lotion and night cream. The prosecutor asked for one to two months' jail, saying Bela had committed the offences over a significant period of time. However, he also considered that restitution had been made. Bela, who was unrepresented, asked for leniency through an interpreter. She said she would like to go home to Indonesia.  When the judge asked if she could make the rest of the restitution, Bela said she had no other resources and not enough money. Her jail term was backdated to her date of arrest in August this year. For theft in dwelling, she could have been jailed up to seven years and fined."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/secondary-school-discipline-master-took-upskirt-videos-students-teachers-2917416,Secondary school discipline master admits taking more than 100 upskirt videos of teachers and students,"SINGAPORE: For more than three years, the discipline master of a secondary school took more than 100 upskirt videos of his female colleagues and students. He took 12 upskirt videos of at least seven female students using modus operandi such as inviting them into the discipline room. On one occasion, he confiscated the phone of a student who had filmed upskirt videos of a teacher and used his own phone to record the videos for himself. The 49-year-old man, who is married with three children, pleaded guilty on Friday (Sep 2) to three charges of insulting a woman's modesty. Another five charges will be taken into consideration for sentencing. A gag order was imposed by the court barring the publication of his name, the victims' names and the school name. The court heard that the man had worked at the school since 2008 and was the discipline master since 2015. He also taught Mandarin. Between April 2015 and July 2018, he filmed 156 upskirt videos of at least 38 female colleagues, mostly teachers.  He would invite them to his work station for data entry purposes and would place his handphone under the victim's skirt while the victim was keying in data at his desk. He invited female colleagues wearing skirts or dresses but not those wearing pants, and seldom invited male teachers to his work station for data entry. The man also filmed 12 upskirt videos of at least seven female students between May 2015 and February 2018. He would take the student into the discipline room and film her while she was using the computer.  The court heard that the man would transfer the videos to an external hard disk via his office laptop. He did not share or publish the clips but ""used them for his own sexual pleasure"", the prosecutor said. On one occasion, a male student was caught and punished by the school for filming two upskirt videos of a female teacher. On the pretext of retrieving evidence, the accused confiscated the student's phone and used his own phone to film the videos before transferring them to his collection. His actions went on until July 2018, when a female teacher at the school lodged a police report, saying she suspected the accused had been taking upskirt videos of teachers including herself. Police seized his hard disk and found 173 upskirt videos in the accused's possession. He titled each clip with the victim's names or initials or with descriptions. Investigations also revealed that he had filmed an upskirt video of a female relative at a party his mother-in-law was hosting. The prosecutor asked for between 12 and 18 months' jail, saying that the accused abused the trust of his female colleagues and his position as discipline master. The victims who were students were especially vulnerable, and the accused exploited their deference to his authority as well as the trust their parents placed in the school and its faculty, she said. However, she accepted that the accused was suffering from major depressive disorder at the time, after losing his mother in 2015. His wife also underwent surgery for medical ailments in 2016, after which their frequency of sexual intimacy ""drastically diminished"". ""However, while these factors invite some sympathy, they do not excuse the accused's conduct,"" said the prosecutor. Defence lawyer Laurence Goh asked the court to order a mandatory treatment order suitability report. He said his client was suffering from ""double depression"" at the time of the offences. A doctor with the Institute of Mental Health had said his disorder contributed to his offences, said Mr Goh. The prosecutor objected to the defence's ""conclusion"" that the accused would not be able to undergo psychiatric treatment if he is sentenced to jail, calling this ""leaping to conclusions"". The prison is ""fully able to continue monitoring and treating his conditions"", and the psychiatric unit of the Changi Medical Complex is administered by IMH, she said. The judge noted the accused's mental conditions at the time and that there is a contributory link to his offending behaviour. She granted the defence's request to call for a mandatory treatment order suitability report, but stressed that even if he is found suitable, the court may not necessarily impose such an order. He will return to court for sentencing in November."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-related-charges-remanded-almost-year-arrest-warrant-2914931,Man facing COVID-19 related charges remanded almost a year after arrest warrant issued,"SINGAPORE: A man who skipped court in October last year over charges of exposing others to the risk of COVID-19 has been remanded and given new charges. Verner Chua Jun Jie, 22, was handed two new charges on Thursday (Sep 1) for cutting his GPS tag at a flat in Bukit Batok in September last year and for failing to report to Selarang Park Community Supervision Centre that same month. Chua was charged last year with two counts of exposing others to the risk of infection. He was accused of failing to stay home in August 2020 despite receiving a medical certificate ordering him to stay home for five days as he had an acute respiratory infection. Instead, he took a Grab vehicle to visit his grandmother in West Coast and another Grab vehicle to buy lunch before heading home, charge sheets stated. He is accused of repeating this offence in December 2020 while he was on medical leave for acute respiratory infection and had not yet received a negative COVID-19 test result. He allegedly took taxis to have dessert with a friend in Balestier Road and for frog porridge in Geylang. By his actions, Chua allegedly exposed his grandmother, his friend and other people at those locations to the risk of contracting COVID-19. Chua was set to plead guilty in October last year, but an arrest warrant was issued for him that month when he failed to turn up in court. He was remanded on Thursday and is set to plead guilty on Sep 13. If convicted under the Infectious Diseases Act, he could be jailed for up to six months, fined up to S$10,000, or both, per charge. For mischief, he could be jailed for up to a year, fined, or both. For failing to turn up at the supervision centre, he can be jailed for up to a month, fined up to S$1,500, or both. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/outrage-modesty-cases-molest-public-transport-singapore-police-force-2912566,"Outrage of modesty cases a key concern, say police amid push to fight such crimes on public transport","SINGAPORE: Crimes involving outrage of modesty continue to be a key concern for Singapore police amid a rise in the number of such cases. There were 773 outrage of modesty cases in the first half of this year, a 4.6 per cent increase from the figure of 739 in the same period in 2021, according to mid-year crime statistics released by the police. ""The number of outrage of modesty cases occurring within the public transport system, including public transportation nodes and on public transport, remains a concern,"" said the Singapore Police Force (SPF) on Wednesday (Aug 31). Among the cases on the public transport network, 63.8 per cent involved victims aged between 13 and 29. To raise awareness about such crimes, SPF said it will launch a new public education video at MRT stations. ""These advisories seek to educate the public on what they can do when they encounter such crime, and remind them to stay vigilant and report the matter to the police if they encounter anything suspicious,"" said SPF. For instance, the information provided by victims who were quick to report cases has helped to solve many cases, said the police, adding that useful details include descriptions of suspects and the direction in which they travelled. Giving an example of a case in March, SPF said a man was arrested two days after an incident at Woodlands MRT station.  A 23-year-old woman had made a police report at about 1.10am, saying she was molested by an unknown man. ""The woman managed to take a photo of the man, which was useful information that she provided to the police when she reported the incident,"" said SPF, adding that it worked with the public transport operator to establish the suspect's identity through his travel pattern. The man was sentenced to one week in jail on Mar 29. The offence of outrage of modesty carries a jail term of up to three years, a fine, caning, or any combination of such punishments. If the victim is under 14 years old, the maximum jail term could extend to five years. The police advised members of the public to move away if possible if someone gets ""uncomfortably close"". ""Whenever possible, you may also approach the bus captains or MRT station staff for assistance if you are commuting via public transport nodes,"" the police added. ""Outrage of modesty cases remain a key concern for the police,"" said SPF. ""The police have zero tolerance towards sexual offenders who threaten the personal safety of the community and offenders will be dealt with sternly in accordance with the law."""

Poh Zhenlong Caine had cheated 396 victims of more than S$108,000 on e-commerce platform Carousell, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) said on Wednesday.  SPF said it received numerous reports from victims who were cheated by purportedly different online sellers on Carousell from October 2018 to June 2020. ""These sellers advertised tickets for Universal Studios Singapore (USS), concerts, sporting events, and other items. ""After the victims had made payment via bank transfer, PayNow or Paylah, the sellers ceased communications and did not deliver the items."" Investigations revealed that Poh had posted advertisements on Carousell purporting to sell the products, said SPF. In particular, he had advertised tickets to USS, concerts and sporting events after noticing that there was a high demand for such tickets on Carousell. ""By such manner of deception, Poh dishonestly induced 396 victims to deliver $108,693.90 to various bank accounts,"" said SPF. Poh pleaded guilty to two charges of cheating, four charges of amalgamated unlawful remote gambling and one charge of unlawful remote gambling. SPF said it takes a serious view of persons who may be involved in scams and fraud, and perpetrators will be dealt with, in accordance with the law. It also advised members of the public to be very careful when making online purchases and to opt for buyer protection by using in-built payment options that release payment to the seller only upon delivery. ""Whenever possible, avoid making advance payments or direct bank transfers to the seller,"" said SPF. ""Scammers may entice buyers to contact them directly through messaging platforms such as WhatsApp or WeChat by offering a better or faster deal if bank transfer payments are made directly to them.  ""They may also use a local bank account or provide a copy of an NRIC/driver’s licence to make you believe that they are genuine sellers."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/jail-drunk-man-fight-commotion-elderly-father-call-police-thrice-2912201,"Man jailed after elderly father called police on him thrice for fighting, drunken behaviour","SINGAPORE: An elderly man called the police three times on his 50-year-old son, who fought and repeatedly caused a commotion while drunk.  The son, Tan Hock Lai, was on Wednesday (Aug 31) jailed for four weeks. He pleaded guilty to three charges of committing a public nuisance and disturbing the public peace. Another three charges were considered for sentencing. The court heard that Tan and his 70-year-old father lived together in a flat on the ground floor of a public housing block. Around 3am on Nov 2 last year, Tan returned home drunk and started throwing things around the flat.  Tan's father was irritated by this and chased him out of the unit. Tan repeatedly banged on the door and window and shouted loudly, demanding to be let in. His father called the police, telling them: ""My son every night drunk come and disturb me. I cannot stand it already."" The police also received calls from residents nearby. When they arrived, Tan was still banging on the door and shouting loudly, and the window had been smashed. They arrested him. Three days later, after drinking again, Tan got into a fight with a man at a ground floor staircase in Toa Payoh for no apparent reason, according to court documents. The man was helping Tan to his feet after he tried to stand up but stumbled. Tan's phone fell out in the process, and he suddenly punched the man's head several times. The man fended Tan off, but Tan adopted a boxing stance to challenge him. The man then retaliated by punching Tan's face. The fight continued for about five minutes until the police arrived. Tan was arrested again as he kept trying to confront the other man while their statements were being taken. In the last incident on Mar 24 this year, Tan returned home and asked his father for S$10. When his father refused, Tan started shouting loudly. Exiting the flat, Tan threw some bamboo laundry poles and a laundry rack on the ground, and kicked over a dustbin. The commotion attracted the neighbours' attention. When one of them told Tan to stop his antics, he went over to her flat and challenged her to a fight. Police arrived shortly after and it was observed that Tan reeked heavily of alcohol. Tan, who did not have a lawyer, was a food delivery rider at the time. He told the court that he was emotionally affected by his wife's sudden request for a divorce when he committed the offences. Tan asked for a lighter sentence and told the judge that he would not reoffend. The judge agreed with the prosecution on the length of the jail term to be imposed. Those who commit a public nuisance can be jailed for up to three months or fined up to S$2,000. The penalty for disturbing the peace by fighting in public is up to a year in jail, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/istana-collision-bollards-mfa-perm-sec-injured-2911531,Former security officer fined over collision at Istana that injured MFA permanent secretary,"SINGAPORE: A former auxiliary police officer was fined S$2,500 on Wednesday (Aug 31) after causing a vehicle collision at the Istana last year. Tan Chee Kiat, 30, pleaded guilty to a single charge of causing grievous hurt through a negligent act. He was a Certis CISCO officer at the time of the incident. The Permanent Secretary for Foreign Affairs at the time, Mr Chee Wee Kiong, and his driver Mr Abdul Latif Karim suffered fractures in the collision on Aug 23, 2021. The court heard that the crash took place on Edinburgh Road, which is located within the grounds of the Istana. Tan was deployed at a security post along Edinburgh Road on the morning of the incident. His job was to operate the control panel for the ground bollards, which are barriers used to block access to roads. When activated, they rise from the ground. Mr Chee was the sole passenger in the car driven by Mr Abdul Latif and their vehicle had cleared security and was travelling along Edinburgh Road. At 9.15am, Tan raised the bollards without checking that the car had passed them. The car was driving at 10 kmh at the time, according to court documents. Mr Abdul Latif noticed that the bollards were being raised but he was unable to stop the car in time and hit the bollards. Both men were taken to the hospital for treatment. Mr Chee suffered multiple fractures, a sternum fracture and a tooth fracture. He was admitted the same day and discharged two days later. Mr Abdul Latif sustained a sternum fracture and left knee contusion. He was discharged a day after the incident. Investigations showed that standard safety procedures required the person operating the bollards to conduct a visual inspection of the bollards when activating them. ""When he activated the bollards, (Tan) had failed to conduct such a visual inspection and assumed that the car had passed the bollards, thus resulting in the collision,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutor Pang Jaime. Mr Pang sought a fine of S$2,500, citing the victims' severe injuries and Tan's failure to discharge his responsibility properly. Defence counsel Wee Qianliang informed the court that his client was fired as a result of the incident, and was currently unemployed. He asked for a lower fine of S$2,000. He said that the position of the control panel was such that Tan's back would be facing the road where the cars travelled, and that Tan did not notice any cars when he activated the bollards. Mr Wee added that Tan immediately offered help to the victims after the collision. He said Tan was remorseful for his actions and had written personal apology letters. The collision happened during the official visit of United States Vice President Kamala Harris to Singapore. Ms Harris was hosted by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and had meetings at the Istana that day, according to a Ministry of Foreign Affairs press statement on her visit. Mr Chee retired in April, after serving 40 years in the public service and Singapore Armed Forces. The penalty for causing grievous hurt through a negligent act that endangers human life or personal safety is up to two years' jail, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ns-defaulter-jailed-staying-overseas-without-permit-focusing-studies-2909356,"NS defaulter jailed for staying overseas without permit, said he was focusing on studies","SINGAPORE: A Taiwan-born Singaporean was jailed for nine weeks on Tuesday (Aug 30) for defaulting on his National Service (NS) obligations. Tsai Yi-hsuan, now 25, stayed outside Singapore for a total of almost four years and eight months without a valid exit permit. He pleaded guilty to three charges under the Enlistment Act. He told investigators that he did not approach authorities about his NS obligations each time he was in Singapore as he wanted to focus on his studies, according to court documents. Tsai has since completed his full-time NS in the Singapore Armed Forces. He is the 19th man to be jailed since the High Court set out the sentencing framework for NS defaulters in 2017. The court heard that Tsai was born in Taiwan in 1997. His mother and sister are Singaporeans, while his father is a former permanent resident.  Tsai grew up and was educated in Taiwan, according to Deputy Public Prosecutor Nicolle Ng. He has held four Singapore passports, which he used to travel in and out of the country on 12 occasions. He would travel to Singapore to visit his maternal relatives. Tsai had known that he held Singapore citizenship since elementary school. From the age of 16, he had also known that he was required to serve NS in Singapore as his mother told him so. After Tsai turned 16-and-a-half in 2013, he received an NS registration notice at an old address in Taiwan that was owned by his parents. Tsai's family was not living at that address, but arranged for a security guard to collect their letters there and retrieved the letters on a monthly basis. Tsai's father handed the NS registration notice to Tsai after collecting it. In May 2014, Tsai went to Singapore to register for NS and collect his identity card. He also updated his family's address in Taiwan with the Central Manpower Base (CMPB). Tsai was then found to have remained outside Singapore without a valid exit permit on several occasions from 2010, when he turned 13, to 2014. Under the Enlistment Act, all male Singaporeans and permanent citizens aged 13 and above must comply with exit permit requirements. When Tsai went to register for NS on Jun 3, 2014, the counter staff at CMPB reminded him to get a valid exit permit to stay outside Singapore. CMPB also acknowledged Tsai's application to defer NS for overseas studies and requested further documents to process this. But two days later, Tsai left for Taiwan without a valid exit permit. Later that month, Tsai's mother submitted supporting documents for her son's NS deferment. CMPB replied asking for more documents, including further proof from Tsai's school on his studies, and proof of overseas employment or business registration for Tsai's parents. When there was no response from Tsai's mother, CMPB emailed her again about a month later to no avail. It followed up with a letter to Tsai's updated address in Taiwan. Tsai confirmed that he and his family stayed at the address at the time. But as he was preparing for university entrance exams and his studies took priority, he did not ask his mother about his NS obligations. He next went to Singapore in September 2014 to attend his grandfather's funeral, returning to Taiwan after five days. On Oct 2, 2014, CMPB sent a letter to Tsai's old address in Taiwan stating that his application for NS deferment could not be considered. The letter also enclosed an order instructing Tsai to report to CMPB for his medical screening the next month, failing which he would become an NS defaulter. Tsai did not report for his medical screening in Singapore. On Feb 12, 2015, Tsai turned 18. He knew that he would be required to fulfil NS obligations upon reaching his enlistment age. But he did not follow up with his mother, who was helping with his NS deferment, as he was studying, said Ms Ng. Tsai remained overseas for the next few years, only coming to Singapore in April 2018 to perform rites at his grandmother's tomb. He returned to Taiwan about a week later. In October 2018, Tsai took the Oath of the Renunciation, Allegiance and Loyalty to retain his Singapore citizenship. Tsai wanted Singaporean citizenship as he thought that housing and good jobs were difficult to find in Taiwan. He felt that he could have a bright future and start a family in Singapore, said Ms Ng. But when Tsai was unable to renew his Singapore passport after that, his mother contacted the NS Call Centre. In January 2019, an enlistment inspector informed Tsai's mother that her son had committed offences under the Enlistment Act and was to report to CMPB in Singapore. Tsai came to Singapore on Feb 7, 2019 and surrendered at CMPB the next day. The prosecution sought the jail term imposed on Tsai, arguing that the objective was to preserve the core principles of national security, universality and equity affecting NS. ""The fact (that Tsai) had comparatively limited substantial connection to Singapore, by virtue of growing up and being educated in Taiwan, is not relevant to sentencing,"" said Ms Ng. On the contrary, Tsai was ""clearly aware of and identified with his Singapore citizenship"", she argued, pointing to his preference for Singapore citizenship in view of the life he could build. The mitigating factors were Tsai's voluntary surrender and plea of guilt, added the prosecutor. The Ministry of Defence previously said that it takes a firm stand against offenders, in response to past cases involving NS defaulters. ""If we allow Singapore citizens or permanent residents who are overseas to evade NS or to choose when they want to serve NS, we are not being fair to the vast majority of our national servicemen who serve their country dutifully, and the institution of NS will be undermined,"" said the ministry. The penalty for remaining outside Singapore without a valid exit permit is up to three years' jail, a fine of up to S$10,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ex-hdb-director-obscene-video-men-safra-locker-room-2908816,"Former HDB director admits to taking obscene videos, photos of men","SINGAPORE: A man on Tuesday (Aug 30) admitted to taking obscene videos and photos of men in public places such as SAFRA locker rooms. Norman Leo Chee Wei Kiong, 61, was a director of housing finance at the Housing and Development Board in 2017, TODAY previously reported. His lawyer informed the court that he has since resigned. Chee pleaded guilty to four charges under the Films Act and two charges of committing a public nuisance. Eight more charges, including one for voyeurism, will be considered when he returns for sentencing. On Oct 28, 2020, Chee's offences were discovered after he tried to surreptitiously film a man he found attractive in a supermarket. The man noticed this and confronted Chee, who denied filming him. In the ensuing commotion, a supermarket employee called the police. While waiting for the police to arrive, both men were taken to wait in the security office, and Chee agreed to delete the video of the man. The man inspected Chee's photo gallery to ensure this was done, and noticed that it contained obscene videos featuring naked men. He alerted police to this when they arrived. Police discovered the obscene images and seized Chee's phone for forensic examination. During investigations, Chee admitted that he had a habit of filming and photographing men he considered attractive in public places such as gyms and communal changing rooms. His offences date back more than a decade. On Apr 26, 2012, Chee took two photos of a man clad only his underwear in a male locker room at an unknown SAFRA clubhouse. At a similar location on Jan 12, 2013, Chee used his phone to take five photos of a man with his private parts exposed. On Dec 31, 2018, Chee recorded a 25-second video of a fully naked man, capturing his face and private parts, at the male locker room of SAFRA Mount Faber. Chee also recorded obscene videos of a man, known as ""Billy"", in his own apartment. He filmed ""Billy"" wiping himself with a towel on Dec 22, 2017 and putting on his underwear on Sep 25, 2019. Both videos were more than a minute long. These videos were for Chee's personal gratification, according to court documents. Through forensic examination, 146 more obscene videos showing men engaged in sexual acts were found on Chee's phone. Deputy Public Prosecutor Colin Ng sought two to three weeks' jail and a fine of S$1,600 to S$2,000. He highlighted that Chee had taken videos and photos of unsuspecting men, and that the videos of ""Billy"" did not indicate that he knew he was being recorded. There was no evidence to suggest Chee had circulated the videos, but there was a ""latent risk"" of this as they were in a digital format on an Internet-connected device, added Mr Ng. Defence counsel Shashi Nathan sought no more than a week's jail, calling his client a ""very honourable man"". He highlighted that Chee resigned voluntarily even before his conviction, and that this was a ""painful decision"" after building his career for more than 35 years. Mr Nathan said this ""fall from grace"" had been enlightening for Chee, who had kept parts of his life hidden from people around him and was ""living under a shadow"" before the offences came to light. He also argued that Chee was the primary caregiver for his elderly mother, who suffers from ovarian cancer. The prosecutor countered that Chee's offences were committed in his personal capacity unrelated to his work, and that his resignation was a personal decision and not a mitigating factor. District Judge Kessler Soh said he needed time to consider the appropriate sentence, and adjourned the hearing to Sep 9."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/lawyer-breach-gag-order-victim-identity-doctor-molest-acquit-2908706,Lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam fined for breaching gag order in case of doctor acquitted of molestation,"SINGAPORE: Lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam, 47, was on Tuesday (Aug 30) fined S$4,000 for breaching a gag order in the case of a doctor who was later acquitted of molestation. He led the team of lawyers for the defendant in that case, Dr Yeo Sow Nam. A junior lawyer on the team, Johannes Hadi, also faces charges related to the gag order. Thuraisingam, the managing partner of his eponymous law firm, is a senior member of Singapore's Criminal Bar with more than 20 years in practice. He pleaded guilty to a charge under the State Courts Act, with another charge taken into consideration for sentencing. From Mar 1 to Mar 5, 2021, Dr Yeo was tried in private on accusations that he outraged a woman's modesty at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in 2017. The woman's identity was protected under a court order issued on Feb 7, 2020. This prohibited the publication of her name, address, photograph or any information likely to lead to her identification. Gag orders are usually imposed to protect minors, vulnerable persons and victims in sexual offence cases, a lawyer previously told CNA. On Mar 5, 2021, the fifth day of trial, Thuraisingam sought the trial judge's permission to distribute the transcripts of the proceedings, which were in private, to members of the media. He gave an undertaking to the court that any distribution of the transcripts to the media would carry redactions of the woman's identity and a warning about the gag order in place. The trial judge granted Thuraisingam's application on the basis that the lawyer would make the necessary redactions and there would be no breach of the gag order. On Mar 16, 2021, after the team received the transcripts for the first four days of trial, Thuraisingam sent Hadi instructions over email about distributing them to the media. ""Pls remember to black out complainant's name and remind the press that they cannot print the complainant's name,"" he wrote, referring to the woman who was the complainant against Dr Yeo. ""Explain that we applied for an order that we be allowed to furnish the press with the transcripts,"" he added. Thuraisingam did not instruct Hadi to redact all information likely to lead to the identification of the woman, Deputy Public Prosecutors Sivakumar Ramasamy and Sivanathan Jheevanesh said. Following the senior lawyer's instructions, Hadi redacted only the woman's name from the transcripts and emailed them to journalists from Mediacorp and Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) on Mar 16, 2021. In his emails to media, Hadi wrote: ""We are now releasing transcripts to you, but with the complainant's name redacted as the gag order in relation to the complainant's identity remains in place."" On Jun 26, 2021, the prosecution in Dr Yeo's case applied to withdraw the charges against the doctor. At the same time, Thuraisingam indicated that the defence would apply for the gag order to be lifted. A hearing was scheduled on Aug 16, 2021 for the charges to be withdrawn and both sides to make their arguments on the gag order lifting application. In preparation for the hearing, the prosecution filed written submissions contesting the gag order lifting application on Aug 4, 2021. The prosecution requested to expand the scope of the gag order to include the identities of witnesses who were the woman's colleagues, the name of the product marketed by the woman, her relationship with Dr Yeo and the name of her employer at the time. Before the hearing, between Aug 4 and Aug 11, 2021, Thuraisingam instructed Hadi to distribute transcripts of the trial and the defence's written submissions applying to lift the gag order to members of the media. Thuraisingam again did not instruct Hadi to redact all information likely to lead to the woman's identification, said Mr Sivakumar and Mr Sivanathan. Accordingly, Hadi emailed a bundle of the transcripts and submissions to journalists from Mediacorp, SPH, South China Morning Post, Mothership, Yahoo News, The China Press Malaysia and The Online Citizen on Aug 11, 2021. The front page of the bundle carried the notation: ""All transcripts have been redacted pursuant to the gag order in place at the time of writing in relation to the identification of the complainant."" However, the transcripts contained unredacted information likely to lead to the woman's identification, including her age, date of birth, current occupation, current employer and occupation at the time of the alleged molestation. The transcripts also contained information that was the subject of the prosecution's application to expand the scope of the gag order. At the hearing on Aug 16, 2021, Dr Yeo was given a discharge amounting to an acquittal after the prosecution withdrew all charges against him. Dr Yeo's lawyers then withdrew the application to lift the gag order. When the trial judge asked for the defence's position on the prosecution's application to expand the gag order, Thuraisingam said: ""If the prosecution says that it's necessary to protect the alleged complainant's identity, we take no position."" The trial judge then granted the expanded gag order, which remains in force. Prosecutors sought a fine of at least S$4,000, arguing that in a case involving the likelihood of the complainant being identified, the potential harm caused by Thuraisingam's offences was a key issue. Given the number of media outlets the transcripts were sent to, with a notation that they were redacted in compliance with the gag order, the potential harm was medium if not high, the prosecutors argued. Thuraisingam's actions were inadequate as he left the redaction to the most junior lawyer on the team, who had only two years in practice at the time, and did not check the transcripts before they were sent, said Mr Sivakumar. The only guidance he gave was to redact the woman's name, and this conduct by an experienced member of the Bar ""fell short"", argued the prosecutor. Defence counsel Jerrie Tan of K&L Gates Straits Law said her client accepted the prosecution's proposed fine. Ms Tan urged the court to consider that the complainant's name, the ""most critical part"" of her identity, was redacted, and that no actual harm ensued as a result of the oversight. She contended that Thuraisingam's email to Hadi arose out of a genuine concern that the junior lawyer might forget to redact the complainant's name and remind the press about the gag order. Ms Tan also asked the court to consider the offences in light of ""the type of lawyer"" her client has been, highlighting his pro bono work, including defending clients facing the death penalty, and his firm's donations to the Law Society's pro bono services. District Judge Toh Yung Cheong said that the release of identifying information to the media could have led to the ""re-victimisation"" of the complainant, which the gag order was supposed to protect her from. Any leak of information could also affect public confidence in the legal system and the confidence of other victims to testify in court, said the judge. He said that Thuraisingam's efforts to follow the gag order were insufficient, and this was the main cause of the breach. The senior lawyer was entitled to ask a junior colleague to handle the transcripts, but gave incomplete instructions to Hadi and did not check the redaction before they were sent, said Judge Toh. The prosecution's application to expand the gag order would also have alerted Thuraisingam to the fact that they were concerned about other information about the complainant being made public, said the judge. The penalty for breaching a gag order is up to a year in jail, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/marks-spencer-supervisor-customer-credit-card-details-2907166,Former Marks & Spencer supervisor jailed for using customers' credit cards to order meals,"SINGAPORE: For more than a year, a supervisor at Marks & Spencer noted down customers' credit card details, which he used to buy almost S$9,000 worth of meals. Teo Kai Seng, 29, was on Monday (Aug 29) jailed for three months after pleading guilty to three charges under the Computer Misuse Act. Eight similar charges were considered for sentencing. The court heard that Teo worked at Marks & Spencer from 2016 to 2021. He was promoted to supervisor at the One Raffles Place outlet in March 2020. Around the time of his promotion, Teo started taking down the credit card details of customers while their card payments were being processed at the cashier. He did this whenever he attended to customers at the cash register and there were only two other staff members working in the kitchen and the office. Teo would use his mobile phone to take a photo of the credit card, then transfer the details to a piece of paper. He later keyed them into the Waitrr app, where he had registered an account using his ex-girlfriend's phone number. Waitrr allows users to order food online and pay vendors directly. Teo realised that the app did not require a one-time password for transactions, and decided to exploit this. Teo would offer to buy food for his colleagues, claiming that the Waitrr app gave him a 10 per cent discount and he would extend the savings to them. He paid for the meals using the victims' credit card details, and his colleagues paid him back for their meals in return. Most of the victims did not require their banks to give them SMS notifications when transactions were made on their credit cards or savings accounts. This allowed Teo's offences to go undetected until Oct 27, 2020, when the daughter of a victim lodged the first police report. Teo was traced and arrested on Aug 24, 2021. From Jul 13, 2020 to his arrest, Teo used credit card details belonging to 11 victims aged 46 to 82, performing 450 unauthorised transactions. Deputy Public Prosecutor Chee Ee Ling sought three to five months' jail, highlighting the level of premeditation and planning involved in Teo's offences. For each charge, Teo could have been jailed for up to two years, fined up to S$5,000 or both. The maximum penalties are raised to three years' jail and a S$10,000 fine for a repeat conviction."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/china-prosecutors-tangshan-28-men-assault-women-viral-video-women-violence-2906861,China prosecutes 28 suspects for restaurant attack on women,"BEIJING: Chinese prosecutors said on Monday (Aug 29) they had launched criminal proceedings against 28 people suspected of assaulting a group of women in a viral incident that sparked outrage over gender-based violence in the country. Footage of a group of men assaulting four women at a barbecue restaurant in Tangshan, east of the capital Beijing, was shared widely online, renewing debate about violence against women in China. The men carried out the assault after the women rejected their advances, the footage showed. Prosecutors in Hebei province said they would begin legal proceedings against the suspects - including seven directly involved in the assault - after they obtained ""reliable and sufficient"" evidence. The statement, shared on China's Twitter-like Weibo service, did not specify a criminal charge. Police identified the prime suspect in the attack as ""Chen"", saying he ""recklessly used violence to commit evil"", according to state broadcaster CCTV. Following the attack Tangshan authorities sacked the city's deputy police chief and five other police officers, and also launched a crackdown against organised crime. Discussion of feminism has grown in the country despite pressure from its patriarchal society, widespread censorship and patchy legal support for victims. But viral online essays slamming the attack as symbolic of the country's larger problem of gender-based violence were censored. Two women were hospitalised following the incident and two others sustained minor injuries, authorities said. Women's rights campaigners say domestic abuse remains pervasive and under-reported in China, while prominent feminists also face regular police harassment and detention. Local journalists who travelled to Tangshan to seek information about the victims were harassed, intimidated and even detained, according to the United States-based Committee to Protect Journalists. In early August, a Tangshan man allegedly killed his girlfriend by repeatedly running her over with his car in broad daylight. Surveillance footage of the incident sparked widespread outrage online before being censored."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-support-grant-cheat-msf-forge-retrenchment-letter-2906786,Woman jailed for forging retrenchment letter to apply for COVID-19 Support Grant,"SINGAPORE: A woman was on Monday (Aug 29) jailed for five weeks for forging a retrenchment letter to apply for the COVID-19 Support Grant. Goh Chyi Chen, 42, pleaded guilty to one charge of forgery. Another charge of attempting to cheat the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) was considered for sentencing. The court heard that Goh worked as a senior retail executive with Rigel Telecom before the offences. She was fired in May 2020 due to unsatisfactory work performance. The reasons for Goh's retrenchment were stated in a letter issued by Rigel Telecom, and her retrenchment was not related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the court was told. The COVID-19 Support Grant, administered by MSF, provided financial assistance to Singaporeans affected by the economic impact of the pandemic. For those who lost their job or were on involuntary no-pay leave for at least three consecutive months, the grant provided a monthly cash grant of up to S$800 for three months. The cash support quantum was based on the last-drawn monthly salary, capped at S$800. On Oct 1, 2020, Goh submitted an online application for the COVID-19 Support Grant that included a forged retrenchment letter. She used word processing software to amend the contents of the letter, deleting all the reasons given for her retrenchment and instead stating that it was due to COVID-19. On Oct 12, 2020, an MSF officer contacted the company to verify the letter's contents and learnt that the company did not issue the letter. When the officer contacted Goh over the phone, she continued to claim that she was retrenched due to the pandemic. MSF eventually rejected Goh's application. Deputy Public Prosecutor Norman Yew argued that Goh's actions put public funds in peril, and pointed out that she persisted in her lie when questioned by an MSF officer. He also said that Goh had related prior convictions for cheating, forgery and criminal breach of trust, although these took place in 2004 and were relatively dated. Defence lawyer Anand Nalachandran, who requested not more than a week's jail for his client, asked the court to consider the ""desperate situation"" Goh was in around the time she offended. He highlighted that after the offences, Goh was diagnosed with depression by the Institute of Mental Health. Although there was no contributory link to Goh's offences, the diagnosis showed she was facing several stressors in her life that led to her mistake, said the lawyer. Mr Nalachandran also argued that Goh's application was rejected by MSF, and no public funds were disbursed to her. The penalty for forgery is up to four years' jail, a fine or both. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/scams-singapore-police-force-mid-year-crime-statistics-2022-victims-cheated-2906636,‘I just felt really stupid’: How a scam victim almost lost more than S$1 million – until police and the bank intervened,"SINGAPORE: At the beginning of July this year, Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Simon Lam found himself in a race against the clock.  The senior investigation officer at the Singapore Police Force’s (SPF) Anti-Scam Centre was trying to convince a scam victim over the phone that he was a real police officer. But the victim was confused, as the scammer had impersonated a police officer the day before to convince him to hand over his bank account details. Finally, after about two hours of intervention, ASP Lam had a breakthrough. He sent the victim a news article about the modus operandi of a government official impersonation scam. It was a carbon copy of what the victim experienced. That broke the spell over the victim.  “I just felt really stupid. I felt like I had been completely sucked in. I felt I should have done better,"" said 58-year-old John (not his real name). ""But at that point when I first realised I was a victim of a scam, I was hoping to get it stopped."" John, who works in the financial services sector, was speaking to reporters anonymously at a police briefing on Friday (Aug 26) on the mid-year crime statistics.  In the first half of 2022, scams continued to be the main driver of crime, with 14,349 cases reported. This is an 85 per cent increase from the 7,746 cases in the same period last year. The increase in scams drove up the total number of reported crimes to 25,593 cases, up from 18,725 cases in the same period last year, said SPF in a media release on Monday. The total amount cheated for the top 10 scam types increased to S$227.8 million compared to S$142.5 million in the same period last year.  Recounting John's story, ASP Lam said the victim received a call from a scammer on Jun 30, claiming to be an official from the State Courts. John was told that a company had been set up in his name and that he had to attend a court hearing due to the financial crimes committed by the company. The call was then transferred to another scammer claiming to be a police officer. This scammer told John that he would be jailed if he did not provide his Internet banking details and credit card numbers to “facilitate investigations”.  Struck with fear, John followed the instructions. On Jul 1, the scammers used his details to transfer S$93,000 out of his bank account to another fraudulent account. John was told to tell the bank that he was “making an investment into a business venture”, should he be questioned about the transfers, said ASP Lam.  Subsequent transfers totalling about S$1 million were in progress when a member of the DBS anti-scam team, Ms Elaine Tan, noticed the red flags about one-and-a-half hours after the first transfer that same day.  One of the subsequent transfers of S$97,800 was flagged by DBS’ fraud surveillance systems as a suspicious transaction, said Ms Tan.  “After reviewing it, I noticed a new payee was added on the same day and there was already S$93,000 transferred to the same beneficiary. So it seems odd that our customer will try to make two similar transfers to the same account,” she added.  “My first thought was why did the customer split his transfers into two transactions? And coincidentally, (each transaction) falls below S$100,000. So perhaps was it to avoid some sort of detection?”  Ms Tan's hunches were based on her work experience. She also noticed that the new payee was the only one on John’s payee list, indicating that he had no history of transferring money to a third party. Aside from routine GIRO deductions and salary crediting, John had also made zero transfers to a third party via Internet or mobile banking.  “But the biggest red flag I got was that he wasn't aware of the first S$93,000 transfer when I spoke to him over the phone to verify the transactions. In fact, he claimed that he did not access his DBS Internet banking that day, let alone add a new payee or make a fund transfer,” she said.  “I also noticed that he sounded flustered when I informed him of the completed transfer of the S$93,000. So he requested to end the call quickly and call back later.”  It was then that Ms Tan alerted ASP Lam, who immediately contacted the victim. At the same time, the Anti-Scam Centre quickly traced and located the first transaction of S$93,000.  “The scam proceeds were successfully seized, and this resulted in a full, 100 per cent recovery of more than S$1.1 million. No losses were incurred by the victim,” said ASP Lam.  In response to questions from reporters about how he was scammed despite many reports on such cases, John acknowledged that the setup was “very convincing and elaborate”.  “They weren’t rushing. It was just protracted conversations backwards and forwards with multiple actors … And all of these were trusted authorities,” he said.  The Telegram account that was used also had a “very convincing looking Singapore Police Force (display) picture” which made it appear very official, John added.  “And they also built a lot of empathy or compassion with me, which sort of sucked me in. The junior police officer was, ‘Ah, I really want to help you here … we have someone who can help you with financial affairs when your accounts are frozen.’ So it got me to think they were on my side,” said the scam victim.  “That builds a level of trust between me and them because they weren't simply threatening me with court proceedings that I have nothing to do with or imprisonment on the back of those court proceedings that clearly would be totally inappropriate. … So they sort of spent time building the relationship.”  John also noted that the speed with which the events unfolded resulted in him not stopping to think, despite having seen multiple warnings about scams. Job scams, phishing scams, e-commerce scams and investment scams made up 74.5 per cent of the top 10 scam types. Job scams topped the list, with 3,573 cases reported and S$58.5 million cheated.  In most of these cases, victims would come across online advertisements or receive unsolicited messages over Telegram or WhatsApp from unknown numbers which offered part-time jobs with high salaries that could be performed from home, said SPF.  One common variant required the victim to make advance purchases to help e-commerce merchants. They would also receive a commission in the process. The scammers would ask victims to provide a screenshot of the item in their shopping cart, then instruct them to make payment for the item to a bank account number provided by the scammer.  Scammers would initially refund the victims the cost of the item and the commission, but would later claim to have encountered issues with the refund and would stop paying the victims, said SPF.  In other variants, victims who contacted the number provided would be instructed by the scammers to complete tasks online, such as liking social media posts, or reviewing hotels and restaurants on a website, for a commission.  And in a Ponzi-like variant, victims would be asked to purchase expensive memberships before they could take part in lucrative job tasks.  Victims would often do so until the sums became extremely high and they no longer wished to continue, said the police. Many realised they were scammed when they were told they could only get their money back after finishing all the tasks, SPF added.  The second-most common scam type was phishing scams. A total of 2,301 cases were reported in the first half of the year involving S$7.8 million, said SPF.  In banking-related phishing scams, calls and SMSes were the most common channels used to approach victims.  Scammers would impersonate bank or government officials and approach victims via phone or in-app calls, such as via WhatsApp. These scammers would then convince victims to provide their bank card or account details and OTPs by pretending to assist with issues concerning the victims’ bank card or account.  In some cases, unsolicited SMSes were sent to victims, asking them to click on the embedded link to resolve the issue. The link would often redirect victims to fake bank websites, where they were asked to key in their Internet banking details.  In non-banking-related phishing scams, SMSes and Carousell in-app messaging were the most common channels used to approach victims.  Victims would also receive emails or text messages from scammers impersonating entities that are known or trusted, including banks, government agencies, or companies like Grab and Netflix, added SPF.  These emails and text messages would make fake offers or claims, such as outstanding payment for parcel delivery or disruptions to services or subscriptions, to trick victims into clicking on a phishing link.  In the variant involving online marketplace Carousell, scammers would express interest in purchasing items that victims were selling. The scammers would then request to make payment via CarouPay to the victims’ PayNow account.  Then the victims would receive an email purportedly sent from Carousell, instructing them to provide their Internet banking details via a phishing link or phishing PayNow QR codes.  With 2,267 e-commerce scams reported in the first half of 2022 and S$8.3 million cheated, police said that the increase in e-commerce scams was “largely due to rental scams involving fake property listings”. This made up 29.6 per cent of e-commerce scams.  In the majority of e-commerce scams, scammers would post products for sale at a lower price than the prevailing retail value to entice victims. Interested victims would then pay a deposit via bank transfer, only for their products not to be delivered.  The most common platforms used for e-commerce scams included Carousell, Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram, while one of the most common items involved in the transactions was house or room rental. Meanwhile, S$108.8 million was cheated in investment scams, with 1,683 cases reported in the first half of 2022.  Instagram, Facebook and Telegram were the most common platforms used in these scams.  Most of the time, scammers would claim to be financial professionals and “cultivate victims on online platforms”, said SPF. Once lured, the victims would be introduced to investment websites or mobile apps where they would be enticed to invest and asked to transfer money to unknown bank accounts.  In some instances, victims would earn a profit from the initial investments, leading them to believe that the investment was legitimate and lucrative, only to be unable to cash out their earnings once they transferred larger amounts to the scammers, the police said. Despite the numerous media reports and police advisories, people still fall prey to scams because scammers are “organised criminals”, suggested OCBC’s head of group legal and regulatory compliance, Ms Loretta Yuen, during the media briefing last Friday.  “They are highly sophisticated. And the one thing that I've learned is that they've got a very, very strong skill set. And this skill set they have is how to hack the human brain. They do this very well.”  Ms Yuen added that most people have cognitive bias, believing a scam won’t happen to them. But she reinforced that “scams hit everyone … not just the old or the uneducated”.   “We are thinking how do we lift this red mist off the eyes of our customer? How do we break the spell? We are talking to experts (in) behaviour and we're also looking at our banking process to see at which point (we can) do what we call a disruption or just-in-time disruption,” she said.  As part of OCBC’s anti-scam measures, Ms Yuen highlighted the emergency kill switch that was introduced in February this year for customers to “suspend their accounts quickly if they suspect their bank accounts have been compromised”. The switch can be found at OCBC ATMs, in the OCBC digital app, or activated by pressing option ""8"" via the bank’s official contact number.   To date, the switch has helped an average of 27 customers a month to prevent their accounts from being potentially compromised by scammers.  Ms Yuen also said that the bank will deploy a team to SPF’s Anti-Scam Centre next month to “enhance the speed of recovering monies stolen through scams”.  Police have also introduced several engagement and education tactics as anti-scam measures.  For instance, the ScamShield mobile app has seen more than 5.1 million SMSes reported and at least 24,500 phone numbers believed to be used for scam calls have been blocked since the app’s launch in November 2020. The app’s Android version will be made available next month.  A revamped bank quiz – made in collaboration with the National Crime Prevention Council, the Association of Banks in Singapore, MoneySense and the police – has also been rolled out. Yet, despite the best efforts of banks to raise scam awareness through education, Ms Yuen believes education “is not a silver bullet”.  “As much education as we put out there, one thing that is also very important is the customer vigilance. The customer must be vigilant; the public must be vigilant themselves, not to give out their OTPs … keep abreast with scam tactics, scam typologies, so they don’t fall prey,” she told reporters.   “It takes a whole ecosystem to break the scam network. It’s not just the banks or the public sector like NCPC (National Crime Prevention Council) or the police. The customer has to work with us.”  ASP Lam echoed similar sentiments, saying that public awareness of the various scam types and evolving scam tactics is key.  “We can do the necessary steps to intervene quickly. But if the victims refuse to be convinced, either by their lack of knowledge on the scam which they have fallen prey to or ignorance (in) thinking they will never be a victim of scams, it will affect the recovery and intervention process,” he said.  As part of the mid-year crime statistics, police also revealed that the first half of 2022 recorded the lowest number of cases of housebreaking and robbery in the past 10 years.  There was also a decrease in voyeurism cases. These cases decreased to 216 in the first half of 2022 – a dip from 236 cases in the same period last year.  But voyeurism cases by unknown culprits saw an increase of 5 per cent. Locations which were prone to voyeurism committed by unknown culprits were on public transport, in residential premises, and in shopping complexes.  On the other hand, there was an increase in outrage of modesty cases in the first half of 2022. A total of 773 cases were recorded, compared to 739 in the same period last year.  And with cyber extortion cases, police revealed an increase in cases to 203 in the first half of this year – up from 138 cases recorded in the first half of last year.  The total amount lost by victims in these cyber extortion cases totalled more than S$754,000, with Instagram being the most common platform where victims were first approached, followed by Facebook and Tinder.  “In these cases, criminals typically befriend victims online and subsequently coax them into performing compromising or indecent acts in front of a camera. Thereafter, the criminals would use the video footage or images to extort money or online credits from these victims,” said SPF in its news release.  “In some cases, victims were asked to visit a link or to download an app that may result in granting the criminals access to the victims’ contact data which will then be used to extort the victims."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/woman-jail-throw-hot-water-ex-boyfriend-argument-scald-burn-2906341,Woman jailed for scalding ex-boyfriend with hot water during argument,"SINGAPORE: A woman was on Monday (Aug 29) jailed for three weeks for scalding her ex-boyfriend with hot water during an argument. Shazila Akbar Bacha, 25, pleaded guilty to one count of voluntarily causing hurt to the victim. Another similar charge was considered for sentencing. The court heard that Shazila and the 31-year-old victim were previously in a relationship, and had broken up at the time of the offence. On Jul 18, 2021, Shazila and the victim both separately went to visit their friend. They chanced upon each other along the corridor outside their friend's flat. They got into a verbal dispute at the staircase landing near the flat, during which Shazila slapped her ex-boyfriend's cheek. Both then went into their friend's flat, where another verbal dispute started. Shazila asked the victim why he was still there even though she had slapped him. Shazila was also upset as the victim had made some comments that she was unable to take care of her son, Deputy Public Prosecutor Chong Kee En said. She went into the kitchen and filled an orange plastic cup a quarter full with hot water from the dispenser. Shazila then dared the victim to repeat his statements about her not being able to care for her son. The victim did so and Shazila threw the hot water on his chest, before throwing the cup on the floor. The victim felt pain on his chest and called the police for assistance. He visited a clinic the next day and was found to have a first degree burn below his collarbone as a result of the incident. He was given three days of medical leave and prescribed antibiotics and pain relief medication. The prosecutor sought a jail term, arguing that Shazila was not provoked as she had challenged the victim to repeat his comments before splashing hot water on him. Mr Chong also argued that the use of hot water was aggravating given the difficulty of controlling it, and the danger as it could affect greater surface areas. Defence lawyer Mahadevan Lukshumayeh contended that Shazila had received harassing messages from the victim. The penalty for voluntarily causing hurt is up to three years' jail, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/us-manhunt-gunman-shoots-3-people-dead-random-2906266,US manhunt after gunman shoots 3 people dead at 'random',"WASHINGTON: Police in the US city of Detroit launched a manhunt on Sunday (Aug 28) for a suspect believed to have shot four people at ""random"", killing three of them, authorities said. The Midwestern city's police chief, James White, told media that the first three victims - two women and a man - were found shot multiple times in separate locations around the city in the early hours of the morning. A fourth man spotted the suspect peering into car windows and told him to stop, White said. The suspect shot him once. Three of the victims died and one survived, police told local media. Photographs of the suspect have been released to the public as authorities urged anyone who recognised him to call the police. The shootings appear ""to be very random"", White told a press conference. ""One was waiting on a bus, one was walking his dog, and one was just on the street,"" he said. Detroit mayor Mike Duggan told reporters that agents from ""multiple agencies"" were ""scouring several square miles right now, waiting for the individual to resurface"". ""This individual has already shot four people today,"" he said, appealing for anyone who might know the suspect to come forward. The shootings were not the only incident of deadly gun violence in the United States on Sunday. Authorities in the Texan city of Houston said that three people were shot dead there by a gunman who first set fire to their home. ""This suspect, unfortunately, and very sadly, and very evilly, set fire to several residences, laid wait for those residents to come out, and fired upon them,"" Houston police chief Troy Finner told another press conference. Firefighters tackling the blaze also had to take cover from the gunman, he said. Police then arrived and shot the man dead. The gunman had recently been told he would be evicted, Finner said, adding that ""may have been a trigger point"" for him, but that police were investigating. Meanwhile, an NFL football player was shot in the capital Washington, but is in stable condition, the Washington Post newspaper reported. Brian Robinson Jr, a running back with the Washington Commanders, was shot twice during a possible carjacking, the Post reported, citing police. He was taken to hospital and his injuries were not believed to be life-threatening, the newspaper said. The United States is regularly rocked by shootings, with lawmakers reluctant to pass gun control legislation despite it being popular with most Americans."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-insider/mafia-poach-sea-cucumbers-seabed-india-sri-lanka-2901626,Mafia are moving in to poach sea cucumbers. These guardians of the seabed are striking back,"LAKSHADWEEP, India: There is a treasure in the ocean so valuable that mafias from Mexico to Africa to Japan are turning their attention to poaching rather than drugs. It is the humble sea cucumber. This marine animal, with leathery skin and an elongated body, had a global supply worth around US$270 million (S$376 million) in 2020. Mainland China and Hong Kong are its largest buyers. “(What) really opened my eyes were news stories (about) organised crime syndicates like the Yakuza in Japan making more money (from) sea cucumber smuggling … than they did (from) methamphetamine sales,” conservationist Teale Phelps Bondaroff told the programme Undercover Asia. India and Sri Lanka are wildlife-crime hot spots, and the sea cucumbers around India’s Lakshadweep islands are now under threat of large-scale poaching, said Bondaroff, the director of research in conservation organisation OceansAsia. Between 2015 and 2020, Indian and Sri Lankan authorities seized nearly 65,000kg of sea cucumbers. Over 70 per cent of tropical sea cucumber fisheries had been considered depleted, fully exploited or over-exploited before then, according to a 2013 study published in the journal Fish and Fisheries. This is a threat to ocean health - and the survival of corals, which are already suffering from rising temperatures and ocean acidification due to human activity. Sea cucumbers ingest sand and filter ocean debris, then expel clean sand in a process known as nutrient cycling. Their faecal matter lowers seawater acidity and releases calcium carbonate, a key component for coral growth. Corals, in turn, provide food and habitat for about 25 per cent of the world’s fishes. A study of just one coral reef in Australia found that its sea cucumbers excreted poo that amounted to five Eiffel Towers in weight each year. “There’s a saying that every grain of sand in the ocean has passed through a sea cucumber,” said Bondaroff. “If you remove sea cucumbers … it’s going to have a dramatic effect on (that ecosystem). It’s going to hurt other populations. It’s going to hurt the stability of the ecosystem.” The effects are unfurling on the 36 islands of Lakshadweep, which are formed out of corals. “Suppose all the corals die — then nothing will be there to add (to the structure), and slowly these islands will start disintegrating. They might go underwater also,” said Damodhar A T, the islands’ chief wildlife warden. As with shark’s fin and abalone, sea cucumber is a so-called treasure of Chinese cuisine and is commonly served at banquets. Besides mainland China and Hong Kong, it is popular among the Chinese diaspora worldwide, from Singapore to Vietnam to the United States. In Hong Kong, 600g of it can cost HK$1,480 (S$260); the most valuable species can fetch up to HK$27,500 per kg. These usually end up in the top gourmet restaurants. In China, this ingredient was once exclusive to the very rich but has become popular among its growing middle class. Their appetite for seafood, which Bondaroff said is close to seven times the consumption in the 1970s, has driven up prices further. Food writer and restaurateur Lau Chun, who runs Kin’s Kitchen in Hong Kong, noted that the price of sea cucumber has doubled over the past decade. The COVID-19 pandemic has also driven up demand for sea cucumbers, which are valued in traditional Chinese medicine for their perceived immunity-boosting and infection-prevention benefits. As practitioner Ng Ching Chuen noted, some studies have found sea cucumbers to have “a great regrowth rate”. They can push their innards out to immobilise a predator and grow new ones within a couple of weeks. “We make use of these advantages to maintain our health, for example in post-illness care … diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and hepatitis,” said Ng. Since the 1980s, however, sea cucumber populations across the world have been devastated by overfishing, so much so that 24 countries have since imposed temporary bans on sea cucumber fishing. In India, the collection of and trade in sea cucumbers have been banned since 2001. Under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, the marine animal is listed alongside mammals like rhinoceros and tiger. But the illegal trade in it has only intensified. WATCH: Sea cucumber — the Asian delicacy feeding a deep, dark trade (46:47) Four hours away by boat, in Sri Lanka, fishermen can fish for sea cucumbers if they have a licence for fishing, diving and transport. In 2016, after the country’s sea cucumber population had declined, the government reduced the number of permits issued by 25 per cent, instead of imposing a ban. But the profits are so good that a local fisherman, who goes by the name of Maduranga, is also fishing at night despite already having a proper licence to fish. Sea cucumber fishing at night is banned in Sri Lanka. Maduranga said his 20-strong crew each can make up to 2.3 million Sri Lankan rupees (S$9,000) a month if they get a good haul of sandfish, a high-value species of sea cucumber. It can go for 47,000 Sri Lankan rupees per kg, compared with the disco sea cucumber species at 27,000 Sri Lankan rupees per kg, he said. When processed into the prized delicacy called beche-de-mer, this dried sea cucumber product can fetch up to US$1,000 per kg. To cash in on the lucrative business, some fishermen in Sri Lanka have even taken to “fish laundering”: They take advantage of the country’s legal trade to acquire stock from India, where sea cucumber fishing and exports are banned. “You’ll have a sea cucumber that’s illegally caught in Indian waters smuggled into Sri Lanka to enter markets in Southeast Asia legally,” said Bondaroff. “It’s now seemingly a legal product because it’s been laundered through the Sri Lankan sea cucumber legal fishery.” In the Gulf of Mannar, located between Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu in India, organised crime is taking place “increasingly”, said B Jabez, a forest ranger officer of Ramanathapuram district in the Indian state. And the district’s fishermen have become poachers because of the ban, said one of them who spoke on condition of anonymity. “We’ve been fishing (for sea cucumbers) for the past 37 years,” he said. “This is our only livelihood.” Today, if they fish day and night, they can catch anything between 10kg and 300kg. For 300kg, he will get 3,000 to 4,000 Indian rupees (S$52 to S$70), said the poacher. “We know we’re going against nature … But there are many obstacles for us in every season,” he added. “We struggle during … stormy weather. No one from the government comes to see how we’re suffering.” Traders buy up the poachers’ catch and send it to Sri Lanka. “At a distance of three kilometres, we change boats. Then after another four kilometres, we change boats again. Then again after another eight kilometres - we have to keep changing boats,” said one trader whom the Undercover Asia team tracked down. The trader claimed that he was just a middleman in a complex and hierarchical crime chain, whose role is to hand over his haul to a bigger agent who collects sea cucumbers from small-time traders like him. Local criminal gangs oversee the entire process, he added. “They have the full support of some policemen. They pay them bribes to get things done. They have political support, so you can’t do anything to them,” he alleged. The kingpins are hardly physically involved in the operations, said Tamil Nadu forest ranger officer Sathish Sundaram. “They’re using the poor fisherfolk,” he noted. “Even (when) we’re booking a case … we can’t add the kingpin’s name in the case sometimes.” The operations have become more sophisticated and elusive, according to Bondaroff, who cited cases of getaway drivers being used to transport the hauls. Some smugglers also consolidate the sea cucumber catches by burying them until enough has been amassed. When taking the haul across international waters, they attach a tracking device and drop the load into the ocean for another vessel to pick it up. The sea cucumbers often end up close to 4,000 nautical miles away in Hong Kong, where its free trade status means tariffs on imports of most products, including foods, are not imposed, allowing illegal trade to thrive. At least 63 per cent of the world’s sea cucumbers are traded through Hong Kong, said Bondaroff. With sea cucumber populations dwindling across the southeastern coast of Tamil Nadu, the mafia are moving in on the Lakshadweep islands on India’s western side. Like in Ramanathapuram, poaching kingpins are using the fishermen, said warden Damodhar. “They lured (the fishermen) and … got them into the job.” In 2020, he set up a sea cucumber protection task force comprising officials from the local coastguard, police, fisheries department and forest department. Along with roughly 200 federal marine protection watchers, they monitor three anti-poaching areas round the clock. Following its set-up, the task force busted an international smuggling racket and seized 800kg of sea cucumbers worth almost US$1 million. It was one of the largest seizures of illegally caught sea cucumbers in the world. “Helicopters were used to shift the offenders. That was the first of its kind,” said Damodhar. “Four major cases which we had registered were subsequently handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation, New Delhi. “Till now, we’ve seized around 2,500kg, or more than 2.5 tonnes of sea cucumber … It’s around 45 to 50 crores’ worth (S$784,000 to S$872,000).” But that is perhaps only 1 or 2 per cent of the actual total offences that occurred on the islands, he added. The Lakshadweep authorities have also set up a “community-based” conservation reserve - the world’s first sea cucumber conservation area. With active protection of the animal, its numbers have risen, he said. But that is a lure to even more poachers. Over in Sri Lanka, to address livelihood concerns, its government has introduced aquaculture - sea cucumber farms - to local fishermen. The drawback is that it takes eight to 10 months for juvenile sea cucumbers to grow into adults of marketable size. Meantime, fishermen will continue their unlicensed or night fishing, despite the illegality and the dangers. The challenge of tackling demand continues as well for conservationists. “It involves educating consumers about the products they consume and the impact that has on the environment,” said Bondaroff. “We’ve been trying to … reframe these so-called luxury seafood items as gutter food, showing people that the food they eat at a fancy wedding, at a banquet to show off to their family, at one point in the supply chain is handled by criminals.” Watch this episode of Undercover Asia here."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/malaysia-mahathir-najib-royal-pardon-highly-likely-bersih-petition-2901951,"Mahathir says Najib's royal pardon 'highly likely'; electoral watchdog petition hits more than 103,000 signatures","KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's Dr Mahathir Mohamed said on Thursday (Aug 25) that disgraced former prime minister Najib Razak is likely to win a royal pardon and be freed from a jail sentence for graft that he began this week. Dr Mahathir, whose election victory in 2018 triggered Najib's downfall, said in a report by Reuters that delays in various trials related to the multi-billion-dollar corruption scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) would result in justice being denied. ""For Najib, it is highly likely that he will be pardoned after being imprisoned,"" the 97-year-old Mahathir said in a statement. The two-time former prime minister did not elaborate. The Federal Court on Tuesday rejected Najib's final appeal against a 2020 conviction by a lower court, and upheld the 12-year jail sentence and RM210 million (US$46.8 million) fine for illegally receiving US$10 million from a unit of 1MDB.
  Moving forward, Najib and his legal team have a couple of options to explore, such as filing a review application on his conviction. Malaysian lawyers told CNA that Najib and his legal counsel could also file an application to be pardoned by the Malaysian king. “The judicial process ended with the Federal Court. This is an executive process where the executive may choose to remit, suspend or commute the sentence,” said constitutional law and human rights lawyer New Sin Yew. This power can only be exercised by the king, Mr New added, after having consulted or been recommended by the Pardons Board. This pardon will only be in relation to an offence for which Najib had been convicted, and will not affect other court cases the former prime minister is involved in.  The country's electoral watchdog on Wednesday launched an online petition addressed to the national palace, calling for the king to deny Najib of any royal pardon.  The petition on the website Change.org amassed more than 103,000 signatures as of 9.30pm on Friday. ""We, your loyal subjects, humbly appeal to Your Majesty, not to exercise your discretion to pardon former Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak for his crime against the Malaysian public. ""He has been convicted of stealing public funds in the SRC International case and had been given due process of a fair trial,"" said the petition. In an earlier statement, Bersih said it applauded the Federal Court's decision. ""The judiciary is an important institution to our democracy, it ... has demonstrated that it will not yield before political and public pressures, and is being fair and just to all parties in the administration of justice."" Najib loyalists have also issued a similar petition calling for a royal pardon. His supporters gathered outside the national palace in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday to submit a memorandum to palace officials, Malaysian media reported.  They have two demands - a royal pardon for Najib, and for the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission chief to meet the king to present the evidence that there was a conflict of interest with regard to Judge Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali, according to the Star.  Judge Mohd Nazlan was the High Court judge who found Najib guilty in July 2020. Najib’s legal team had argued that there was an alleged conflict of interest as the judge did not disclose his previous role with Maybank while the bank was 1MDB strategic advisor.  Najib is believed to be close to some of Malaysia's royals. However, there has been no indication so far on how the palace would respond to any pardon application by Najib, who held power for nine years until 2018. Nor has there been any sign yet of how prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob would regard a pardon for his old party leader, as he seeks to rehabilitate the image of the ruling United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). Having been sent to jail on Tuesday after losing the appeal in one of the smaller cases related to the siphoning off of money from the state fund he co-founded in 2009, Najib was back in court on Thursday for a hearing in the largest case. He was brought from the Kajang prison complex to the Kuala Lumpur High Court in a black police car under heavy security and was taken to the courtroom through a private entrance. At the end of the day's hearing, Najib - in a dark suit and tie - waved to reporters from the police car on his way back to Kajang. He did not comment, but an aide to the former premier said he was ""doing OK"". In a social media post, Najib's daughter Nooryana Najwa said he had been provided with basic necessities in prison, and ""was getting used to his new routine"". On Friday, he returned to court in a black SUV escorted by several police and Prisons Department vehicles, said the Bernama news agency. His wife, Rosmah Mansor, was also present at the court complex. The charges laid against Najib in this case include 21 counts of money laundering and four counts of abuse of power for allegedly receiving illegal transfers of at least RM2.3 billion between 2011 and 2014. Najib also faces three other cases, and they all carry jail terms and heavy financial penalties. Malaysian and US investigators say US$4.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB, in a scandal that has implicated financial institutions and high-ranking officials worldwide. More than US$1 billion was traced to Najib's bank accounts. He also faces bankruptcy, which cannot be pardoned and which would prevent him from running for elections. Najib has denied any wrongdoing, and has painted himself as the victim of a political vendetta by his former mentor.  Mahathir was already Malaysia's longest-serving prime minister when he first retired in 2003 after 22 years at the helm. He campaigned for Najib and UMNO during the 2013 election but turned against his protege as the scale of corruption at 1MDB began to emerge. Leading an opposition alliance of unlikely bedfellows, the nonagenarian Mahathir defeated the UMNO-led coalition, removing it from power for the first time since the formation of Malaysia six decades earlier. Reinstalled as prime minister, Mahathir reopened probes into 1MDB that led to Najib facing a total of 42 charges. Mahathir subsequently resigned amid political turmoil as his alliance fell apart."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/men-arrested-evade-roadblock-dangerous-driving-nicoll-highway-police-2901271,3 men arrested for evading roadblock at Nicoll Highway and dangerous driving,"SINGAPORE: Three men, aged between 38 and 44, were arrested for evading a roadblock and dangerous driving, said the police in a news release on Friday (Aug 26). The incident took place on Monday at 3.25am. Police said they were conducting a roadblock along Nicoll Highway towards Mountbatten Road, when three vehicles made a three-point turn before the roadblock and drove against traffic flow. “The officers immediately initiated a pursuit and managed to intercept one of the vehicles along Syed Alwi Road,” said the police. A 44-year-old male driver was arrested for dangerous driving and evading the roadblock. ""Through ground enquiries and with the aid of images from police cameras and CCTVs (closed-circuit television), officers from Central Police Division and traffic police established the identities of the other two drivers,” said the police. The two men, aged 38 and 44, were arrested on Monday and Tuesday respectively. The three vehicles were seized, said the police, adding that investigations are ongoing. Any person found guilty of evading a roadblock may be fined up to S$10,000, jailed for up to seven years, or both. The offence of dangerous driving carries a jail term of up to 12 months, or with a fine up to S$5,000, or both. Roadblocks are conducted to deter and detect crimes, said the police. Members of public are advised to cooperate with police officers when approached during roadblocks, they added."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tradenation-luxury-goods-scam-pi-jiapeng-siriwipa-pansuk-2901061,Tradenation luxury goods scam: Couple remanded in prison as investigations continue,"SINGAPORE: The couple allegedly at the centre of a multi-million-dollar luxury goods scam on Friday (Aug 16) were ordered to remain on remand as investigations into the case continue. Singaporean Pi Jiapeng and his wife, Thai national Siriwipa Pansuk, are accused of deceiving Tradenation customers into paying for luxury watches they did not intend to deliver. The couple, both 27, also allegedly cheated customers of their other luxury goods firm Tradeluxury into buying luxury handbags. The alleged offences took place between May 28, 2021 and Jun 27 this year, according to court documents. Victims reported losses of more than S$20 million. The couple appeared in court via video link from prison, wearing red polo shirts. Both have been on remand to assist with investigations. The prosecution previously described the case as ""complex"" and said more time was needed to determine the whereabouts of the money. On Friday, Deputy Public Prosecutor David Koh said that Pi and Pansuk no longer had to be remanded in a specific prison division to assist with investigations. However, both will remain on remand in prison as a judge previously ordered that they were not to be offered bail given the flight risk. The couple face charges of illegally leaving Singapore via Tuas Checkpoint on Jul 4, after Pi had been arrested and while Pansuk was assisting with investigations. They were on the run for about five weeks before being arrested in Malaysia and handed over to Singapore police on Aug 11. Mr Koh on Friday also requested an adjournment of six weeks as investigations are still ongoing. The judge noted that the prosecution previously indicated that investigations were likely to be ""protracted"" given the number of allegations. The prosecution had described the cheating charges against Pi and Pansuk as ""holding charges"", adding that investigations were still at an early stage. Pi and Pansuk will return to court in October for a pre-trial conference, an administrative hearing where the prosecution and defence meet a judge to manage the progress of the case. Pi is represented by lawyer Bhargavan Sujatha and Pansuk by lawyer Johannes Hadi. Two men charged with helping the couple flee - Malaysians Mohamad Fazli Abdul Rahman, 38, and Mohamed Alias, 40 - have said that they intend to plead guilty. The punishment for cheating is a jail term of up to 10 years and a fine. The penalty for leaving Singapore without presenting a passport is up to six months' jail and a fine of up to S$1,000."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/choa-chu-kang-cemetery-assault-attack-wife-rape-allegation-2899926,"Jail, caning for duo who attacked man at Choa Chu Kang Cemetery over rape allegation","SINGAPORE: Two friends were on Thursday (Aug 25) sentenced to jail and caning for assaulting a man at Choa Chu Kang Cemetery over a rape allegation. Andre Chen Si'en, 31, and Gervan Wong Jun Heng, 26, attacked the victim with various weapons at the secluded cemetery in the early hours of the morning. They then made the victim crawl to their car before dropping him off near his home, where he left a blood trail getting up to his apartment. Both men pleaded guilty to a charge each of voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a dangerous weapon. Additionally, Chen admitted to voluntarily causing grievous hurt in another incident and taking methamphetamine. Seven other charges were considered for sentencing. He was sentenced to eight years' jail and nine strokes of the cane. Wong admitted to 13 other charges of voluntarily causing hurt, consuming drugs and driving offences. Twenty more charges were considered for sentencing. He was sentenced to seven years, three months and 16 weeks in jail, and six strokes of the cane. He was also fined S$2,400 and banned from driving for two years. Wong was also ordered to compensate the victim more than S$1,000 in medical fees. Chen previously made voluntary compensation. The court heard that the 29-year-old victim and Chen were friends who had known each other for many years. On the morning of May 9, 2020, Chen received messages from his wife and her friend alleging that the victim had raped his wife the night before. Chen was in Wong's house when he got the messages, and told him about the allegation. Wong agreed to accompany Chen to settle the issue with the victim. Later that night, Chen called the victim out for drinks. The victim agreed, and Chen offered to pick him up from his place. Before leaving, Chen asked Wong for weapons. Chen armed himself with a knuckleduster and flick knife, while Wong chose a metal baton. During the journey to the victim's house, both men discussed bringing him to a secluded place where they would attack him if he admitted to raping Chen's wife. At about 3am on May 10, 2020, Chen and Wong brought the victim to the cemetery, where Chen asked him about the rape allegation. Chen became incensed by what he felt were ""half-hearted replies"" from the victim, court documents stated. He hit the back of the victim's head with the knuckleduster, which had two sharp horns. One horn tore a chunk of flesh from the victim's head. The victim tried to flee, but Chen caught up with him. He continued hitting the victim's head and body, and stabbed his legs with the knife. Wong joined in with the baton, and the two friends took turns attacking the victim. Chen also took the victim's mobile phone and smashed it against a tombstone. Both men stopped when they became too tired to continue, after which the victim begged them for some water. Wong took some water from the car and sprayed it in the victim's face instead. Chen then ordered him to crawl back to the car, and they drove to the victim's place. Around 5.30am, Chen and Wong left the victim near his apartment block. His mother found him at the doorstep of their home and called emergency services. The victim suffered a head injury, fractures at his arm and foot, stab wounds, lacerations and bruising. He was hospitalised for two days. He also suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and sought treatment at the Institute of Mental Health. His medical bills amounted to more than S$2,000. Chen and Wong were arrested on May 10, 2020, and both tested positive for drugs. Chen admitted to taking methamphetamine while Wong admitted to taking ketamine the previous night. Chen's defence counsel Kalidass Murugaiyan highlighted the rape allegation as an extenuating factor for the court to consider. He claimed that when Chen and Wong met the victim, the victim said things that seemed to confirm he had ""not been a good person"", which triggered the attack. But Deputy Public Prosecutor Huo Jiongrui said that the provocation had to come from the victim in order to be considered a mitigating factor. In this case, the rape claims by Chen's wife and her friend were better described as ""indirect incitement to commit the offence"", he said. The prosecutor noted that the women did not ask Chen and Wong to hurt the victim. Mr Kalidass also said that his client showed remorse immediately after the attack, and helped the victim to ""wash his wounds"". But Mr Huo said this was too charitable a description of spraying water in the victim's face, which was a ""spiteful act"" aimed at humiliating him. He argued that the attack was premeditated, that Chen and Wong outnumbered the victim and that they caught him off-guard by suddenly attacking him from behind. The assault was ""vicious and needlessly prolonged"" and the victim was treated cruelly even after the attack ended, said the prosecutor. Mr Huo also highlighted that both Chen and Wong were on bail when they carried out the attack. Chen was on bail for assaulting a stranger in a lift at Ming Arcade in April 2019, while Wong, represented by lawyer Teo Choo Kee, was on bail for drug consumption. Both men were recalcitrant offenders who had previously committed a variety of serious offences, said the prosecutor. For Chen, this included past violence-related convictions. District Judge Eddy Tham said that while the rape allegation was serious, it was unproven. ""There is no room for vigilante justice here,"" he said, adding that the attack on the victim was clearly vindictive. By luring the victim out to a deserted place and arming themselves, Chen and Wong showed their intent to inflict brutal injuries on the man, said the judge."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/maid-jail-rough-handle-mistreat-toddler-bedtime-routine-2899831,Maid jailed for rough handling of toddler during bedtime routines,"SINGAPORE: A domestic worker was jailed for 10 months on Thursday (Aug 25) after she roughly handled a 22-month-old toddler for weeks. Sri Eha Santika Sari, 29, pleaded guilty to one charge of voluntarily causing hurt comprising five incidents in August 2021. Another charge of committing a rash act that endangered the toddler's safety was considered for sentencing. The maid started working for the victim's family in December 2020. She admitted to handling the toddler in a rough manner from June 2021. This included hitting the toddler, flicking her ears, pulling her hair, knocking her head and smacking her feet. She also pushed the toddler forcefully onto the mattress when she tried to move away, or pulled the toddler's hands and feet when she was restless or did not sleep. This mostly took place during the toddler's bedtime routine, when the maid was in charge of feeding her and putting her to sleep. Her actions came to light when the victim's father checked a live closed-circuit television feed of his daughter's bedroom on Aug 28 last year. He noticed that Sri Eha Santika Sari had grabbed the toddler by her arm and thigh and swung her forcefully onto the mattress. He confronted the maid on the spot, but she denied any wrongdoing. He later reviewed past CCTV footage, which revealed earlier instances of rough handling. Videos played in court showed that Sri Eha Santika Sari had handled the toddler in a rough way multiple times from Aug 17 to Aug 28, 2021. On one occasion, when the toddler sat up after finishing her milk, the maid pushed her head back down to the pillow and pulled her ear forcefully. Another time, the toddler tried to get up while the maid was patting her to sleep. The maid pushed the toddler's head into the pillow and hit her head. The victim suffered pain and often cried as a result of these acts, but was unable to seek help given her young age. After the incident on Aug 28, 2021, Sri Eha Santika Sari continued to live in the flat but stopped caring for the victim. The toddler's father eventually made a police report on Sep 26, 2021. No injuries were found when the victim was taken to the hospital the next day. Deputy Public Prosecutor Sruthi Boppana sought eight to 10 months' jail, arguing that the toddler was an exceptionally vulnerable victim given her age. The toddler was entirely defenceless given her inability to seek help and her gross physical disparity with the offender, said the prosecutor. Furthermore, the maid was entrusted to care for the toddler and abused this trust when alone with her, said Ms Boppana. Sri Eha Santika Sari asked for leniency, saying that a long sentence meant she would not be able to earn money to send her child to school. ""I admit all of my mistakes,"" she told the judge through an Indonesian interpreter. District Judge Kamala Ponnampalam said that while no injuries were found on the toddler, the CCTV footage showed the nature of harm inflicted on her. She noted the offences appeared to have continued with ""fair regularity"" over two to three weeks, and it was fortuitous the toddler's father discovered it before it could continue any longer. The maid could have been jailed for up to 12 years. She was liable for enhanced punishment as the victim was below 14 and the proceeded charge amalgamated multiple occasions of offending."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ex-prive-group-ceo-appeal-jean-luc-kha-vu-han-psychiatric-condition-2897136,"Prosecution appeals for jail time for ex-Prive Group CEO who punched, slapped teenager","SINGAPORE: The prosecution on Wednesday (Aug 24) appealed for jail time for the convicted former CEO of food and beverage group The Prive Group. Jean-Luc Kha Vu Han asked a 13-year-old boy lewd questions, punched his temple and slapped him in a shopping mall lift in 2019. He was intoxicated at the time. He was previously sentenced to a 12-month mandatory treatment order (MTO) after pleading guilty to a charge each of voluntarily causing hurt and intentionally causing alarm. An MTO directs an offender suffering from certain treatable psychiatric conditions to undergo psychiatric treatment. Vu Han was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. An Institute of Mental Health psychiatrist found that there was a contributory link between his psychiatric condition and the offence. A district judge previously described his offences as ""deplorable"", but said they were ""not so heinous as to rule out the rehabilitation of (Vu Han) completely as the dominant sentencing consideration"". Justice Vincent Hoong reserved judgment for a later date, after both parties presented arguments at the High Court. Deputy Attorney-General Tai Wei Shyong and Deputy Public Prosecutor Goh Yong Ngee argued that awarding an MTO on the facts of the case would ""send the wrong message"" on protecting the public interest. ""This was a senseless, unprovoked assault perpetrated against a young victim, resulting in both physical and psychological harm,"" they said, calling for a short jail sentence. The prosecution had sought at least eight weeks' jail and a fine. The incident on Nov 22, 2019 took place when Vu Han, his friend, the victim and the victim's 12-year-old brother were in a lift in Parklane Shopping Mall. Vu Han asked the victim a question about his private parts and asked the victim if he wanted to see his private parts, to which the victim replied no. Vu Han then said that he could arrange a sex act for the victim. The boy was alarmed and said no. Vu Han suddenly punched the boy on his temple and said, ""You want to challenge me?"" He later also slapped the victim's cheek. The victim suffered a bruise on his temple and redness on his arm. After the incident, he experienced fear of taking lifts, had flashbacks of the incident and could not sleep well. The prosecutors said that Vu Han first saw a psychiatrist almost a year after the offences were committed, and that his psychiatric evaluation took place only after he was charged in June 2020. They also said that Vu Han was initially diagnosed by another doctor with adjustment disorder, but ""abandoned"" this for the diagnosis of bipolar disorder. ""Taken cumulatively, we submit that the psychiatric diagnosis was sought for the purpose of seeking an MTO in this case,"" the prosecutors contended. They argued that there was no indication Vu Han had difficulty appreciating the nature of his actions or that his bipolar disorder impaired his self-control. Calling the link between Vu Han's psychiatric condition and his offences ""tenuous"", the prosecutors said there needed to be a ""direct and proximate link"". ""Otherwise, every instance of mental illness can be used as an excuse for criminal conduct, even if the said illness does not, in fact, contribute to the offence,"" they argued. Vu Han's lawyer Ms Teh Ee-Von questioned whether the prosecution was motivated by the public interest or public sentiment. ""The deputy public prosecutor should not allow public sentiment to sway their arguments. Justice should be blind in the sense that offenders with similar offences causing similar harm should be treated in the same way,"" she said. In response, Mr Tai said he would take the unusual step of explaining in open court why the prosecution was appealing the case. He said that the way the case had been argued in the lower court, the outcome and how it was reasoned in the judgment were ""quite disturbing"" to the prosecution. He also said that the public interest was strong as this case would set a precedent for how other cases were argued, and could raise questions about how the legal system deals with such offences. Ms Teh argued that her client had shown a lot of rehabilitative potential, having voluntarily sought psychiatric treatment. Referring to Vu Han's initial diagnosis of adjustment disorder, she said her client sought a second medical opinion as he still felt poorly and felt that something was not right with his treatment. She also pointed out that her client stopped drinking after learning that the symptoms of bipolar disorder could be exacerbated by alcohol. Vu Han was not aware of his condition at the time of the offence, she said. The lawyer challenged the prosecution's description of the attack as unprovoked, arguing that a psychiatrist had found Vu Han was likely having a manic episode with possible psychosis during the incident. Citing the psychiatrist's findings, Ms Teh said Vu Han believed he had heard the boy making remarks about the conversation he was having with his friend in the lift before the offence. The attack may appear to have been unprovoked on the outside, but internally, it was sparked by Vu Han's bipolar disorder, she argued."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/najib-jail-1mdb-malaysia-court-political-career-gone-2894926,"'His political career is gone,' says analyst as Najib Razak begins jail sentence for 1MDB-linked conviction","PUTRAJAYA: Malaysia’s highest court on Tuesday (Aug 23) upheld former prime minister Najib Razak's 12-year jail sentence for corruption in the 1MDB financial scandal, a decision analysts said could slam the door to a political comeback. ""Under Malaysian law, Najib cannot stand for this election and the next election (if found guilty),"" James Chin, a professor of Asian studies at the University of Tasmania, told AFP before the verdict was announced. ""Obviously, his political career is gone."" There has been speculation that polls may be held this year, though elections are not due until September 2023. But Oh Ei Sun, principal adviser for think-tank Pacific Research Center of Malaysia, said one way out for Najib is to get the king's pardon. ""He could still apply for clemency (from the king),"" he told AFP. ""And if pardoned, as many expect, he could easily mount a comeback as his feudalistically minded supporters are numerous in number."" Oh said, however, that the current Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob - who belongs to the same United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) party - must recommend a pardon. Najib and his ruling party were voted out in 2018 following allegations of their involvement in a multibillion-dollar financial scandal at 1MDB. He and his associates were accused of stealing billions of dollars from the country's investment vehicle and spending it on everything from high-end real estate to pricey art. Various recipients of the siphoned funds, including a fugitive financier named Jho Low, used the money to buy luxury assets and real estate, a Picasso painting, a private jet, a superyacht, hotels, jewellery, and to finance the 2013 Hollywood film The Wolf of Wall Street, US lawsuits have said. The wide-ranging scandal prompted the US Department of Justice to open what became its biggest kleptocracy investigation. Najib's daughter-in-law Nur Sharmila Shaheen said the family was told he was sent to Kajang Prison, located south of the capital Kuala Lumpur. ""My father-in-law asked us to take care of the family. He remained strong and calm,"" she said. Federal Court chief justice Maimun Tuan Mat, speaking on behalf of a five-judge panel, said the tribunal found Najib's ""complaints as contained in the petition of appeal devoid of any merit"". ""On the totality of the evidence, we find the conviction of the appellant on all seven charges safe. We also find that the sentence imposed is not manifestly excessive,"" she added. The appeals are ""unanimously dismissed and the conviction and sentence are affirmed"", Maimun said. The 69-year-old former prime minister looked sombre and dejected, seated by his wife Rosmah and two children as the verdict was read. Journalists who were in an adjacent room watching the proceedings through video link saw Najib surrounded by family members, friends and party mates before the connection was cut off. Outside the court, teary-eyed family members and supporters hugged each other. Earlier in the day when Najib arrived in court, around 300 supporters mobbed his car chanting ""bossku"" - ""my boss"" in Malay - a rallying cry among his defenders. Just before the verdict was read, Najib, who had said he received an unfair trial, made an impassioned plea asking for a two-month adjournment so he can adequately prepare for a defence. ""It's the worst feeling to have to realise that the might of the judiciary is pinned against me in the most unfair manner,"" Najib told the court. During a break in the proceedings, he spoke to supporters, telling them ""if I am guilty, please forgive me"". Adib Zalkapli, director at BowerGroupAsia, described the case as unprecedented. ""Najib will be remembered for his many firsts, the first prime minister to lose a general election, the first to be convicted,"" he said. Najib is the UK-educated son of one of Malaysia's founding fathers who had been groomed for the prime minister's post from a young age. The final ruling on the jail sentence also came four years after his long-ruling party's shock election defeat in 2018, during which allegations he and his friends embezzled billions of dollars from state fund 1MDB were key campaign issues. A lower court in July 2020 found Najib guilty of abuse of power, money laundering and criminal breach of trust over the transfer of RM42 million (US$10 million) from SRC International, a former unit of state fund 1MDB, to his personal bank account. An appellate court in December denied his appeal, prompting him to go to the Federal Court for a final recourse."

Qusyairi Matin Norhasrin, 22, pleaded guilty to one count of sexually assaulting a minor. Three other charges were considered for sentencing. The identity of the victim is protected by gag order. The boy was 11 at the time of the offences. The court heard that in 2021, the victim posted on Carousell looking for friends to play games with. Qusyairi responded to the victim using a pseudonym. They exchanged numbers and told each other their ages, and started chatting on WhatsApp. Later that month, they met to ride bicycles. After the meet-up, Qusyairi asked the victim what his sexual preference was. Qusyairi told the victim he used to perform sexual acts on his friends, and asked the boy if he wanted to engage in similar activity. After these conversations, the victim agreed to meet Qusyairi for sex. Sometime last year, they met in the male toilet of Bishan Community Club. They went into a cubicle and locked it. The victim asked Qusyairi how he wanted to perform the sexual act. Qusyairi then sexually assaulted the boy. During the assault, the victim felt uncomfortable but did not push the man away. After some time, as the boy needed to leave, they exited the toilet and went their separate ways. Qusyairi and the victim continued to chat on WhatsApp after the incident. Over messages, Qusyairi asked the boy to send obscene photos and videos of himself. The victim felt uncomfortable with these requests, and eventually told his teacher what had happened. The teacher told his parents, and a police report was made. Deputy Public Prosecutor Selene Yap asked for 18 to 21 months in jail. Defence counsel Ashwin Ganapathy asked the court to consider probation, or alternatively, 13 to 15 months' jail if imprisonment was warranted. He argued that his client was a young offender with rehabilitative potential, who regretted and was ashamed of his actions. District Judge Kow Keng Siong found that probation was not suitable as the offence was serious, and the age disparity between the offender and victim was ""huge"". Qusyairi could have been jailed for up to 20 years and fined or caned for the offence."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tip-illegal-police-raid-obstruct-justice-law-crime-informant-2894621,Seen a police raid? Why tipping off someone about it can be illegal,"SINGAPORE: In the past week, several nightclub employees have been hauled to court for tipping off contacts in other clubs about ongoing police raids. A club bouncer got 17 weeks’ jail and a fine for sending more than 60 messages alerting members of two chat groups about such raids. He did this knowing that members of the groups would likely take steps to prevent the detection of offences in the vicinity of the raids, court documents stated. In similar cases last week, a customer service officer at a club was jailed for two weeks and fined, while seven other club employees were fined for sending tip-offs to chat groups. After the convictions, several people raised questions on social media, asking what made these actions illegal. Lawyers whom CNA spoke to pointed to Section 204A of the Penal Code, which penalises acts that obstruct, prevent, pervert or defeat the course of justice. This provision was amended at the start of 2020.  Previously, the offender needed to have the intention to obstruct justice, said Mr Chooi Jing Yen, partner at Eugene Thuraisingam LLP. The amendment lowered the requirements for the offence to committing an act that ""has a tendency"" to obstruct justice, while knowing that it is likely the act will obstruct justice. Mr Mark Yeo, senior associate at Kalco Law LLC, said it was also likely that the enforcement action had to be ongoing at the time the messages were sent to the groups for there to be an offence. He pointed to a judgment issued last year by a High Court judge, which stated: “If an accused person is aware or has reason to believe that some wrongdoing has been or may have been committed ... and consequently takes steps to somehow thwart or prevent the investigation into or the prosecution of the wrongdoing, he is guilty of an offence under Section 204A. “He does not need to know what specific offence may have been committed. He only needs to be aware of facts that may amount to wrongdoing.” Mr Yeo said this was especially so in the club bouncer’s case because the man’s messages included information like the locations of the raids and police vehicle licence plate numbers. Both lawyers also said it is not necessary for an offender to have come across the information illegally in order for the tip-off to be an offence. Those who tipped off the chat groups generally knew about the raids when they were conducted at their workplaces, or when they spotted police vehicles nearby, court documents stated. Mr Chooi said it is well-established that the offence of obstruction of justice does not depend on how the offender came across the information in the tip-off. Additionally, if knowledge of the raids was obtained through insider knowledge, it could be an offence under the Official Secrets Act, Mr Yeo said. Reacting to the club bouncer’s case, other people brought up the example of fellow drivers warning each other to move illegally parked cars when a traffic warden is spotted. When asked whether this is also an obstruction of justice, the lawyers said it is potentially an offence, but there could be good reasons not to prosecute. Illegal parking is a fairly trivial and common regulatory offence, said Mr Chooi, and authorities could be more concerned with reducing incidents of it than prosecuting the offenders. “Seen this way, drivers who alert others about traffic wardens in the area (and thereby encourage them to move their cars away) may actually be promoting the goal of reducing incidents of illegal parking,"" he said. Mr Chooi said that Singapore seemed to subscribe to this notion especially for road traffic offences. “We would rather prevent the offence than prosecute it. For example, we have road signs on our expressways alerting drivers that a speed camera is up ahead, and road signs at certain junctions alerting drivers that there is a red light camera at that junction. “The philosophy is not so much to catch and prosecute offenders, but to prevent there being so many offenders in the first place.” Mr Yeo said it was likely that the potential wrongdoing in the clubs was significantly more serious than traffic violations. He added that it appeared the nightclub employees were working as a group, and their acts were premeditated and planned solely to evade enforcement action. Syndicated or group offences are typically treated more seriously than offences committed spontaneously by individuals, he said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/vtl-bus-ticket-ecommerce-scam-man-jailed-spf-2892991,Man jailed for cheating victims into paying for Singapore-Malaysia VTL bus tickets on Carousell,"SINGAPORE: A 27-year-old man has been sentenced to eight weeks' jail for cheating victims into buying bus tickets for the Singapore-Malaysia Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL). Muhammad Solehudin Abu was investigated for cheating three victims on e-commerce platform Carousell when he did not have any bus tickets for sale, said the police on Monday (Aug 22). ""After receiving payment from the victims, the man became uncontactable and removed his listing from Carousell,"" police said in a media release. The Singapore-Malaysia land VTL was launched in November 2021, allowing travellers to cross the border without having to serve COVID-19 quarantine in either country if they travel through the Causeway on designated bus services.  When bookings first opened, travellers faced long waits and ticketing issues on the websites of the two designated bus companies amid high demand for tickets. The offence of cheating carries a jail term of up to 10 years and a fine. The police said they take a serious view of people involved in scams and frauds, and that offenders will be dealt with in accordance with the law.  The police advised members of the public to be careful when making online purchases, and to opt for buyer protection by using in-built payment options that release payment to the seller only upon delivery. ""Whenever possible, avoid making advance payments or direct bank transfers to the seller,"" said police. ""Scammers may entice buyers to contact them directly through messaging platforms such as WhatsApp or WeChat by offering a better or faster deal if bank transfer payments are made directly to them.  ""They may also use a local bank account or provide a copy of an NRIC/driver’s licence to make you believe that they are genuine sellers,"" said the police, urging people not to fall for such scams.  For more information on scams, members of the public can visit www.scamalert.sg or call the Anti-Scam Hotline at 1800-722-6688. Anyone with information on such scams may call the police hotline at 1800-255-0000 or submit information online."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/teaching-assistant-sexual-abuse-11-boys-after-school-care-centre-2892916,"Teaching assistant gets jail, caning for sexually abusing 11 boys at after-school care centre","SINGAPORE: Over seven years, a teaching assistant at an after-school care centre sexually abused 11 boys between the ages of nine and 13. The man, now 30, was on Monday (Aug 22) sentenced to 42 years' jail and the statutory maximum 24 strokes of the cane after he pleaded guilty to six counts of aggravated sexual assault. Fifty-four more charges, including aggravated rape and other sexual offences, were considered for sentencing. The names of the offender and after-school care centre cannot be published as this could lead to the identification of the victims, who are protected by gag orders. ""This is one of the worst cases of paedophilic sexual abuse of young boys that has come before the courts,"" prosecutors told the court. The man spent his primary school years at the centre and continued to visit it through secondary school and National Service, when he would bring food and drinks, and play basketball with ex-students. After his National Service in 2012, he started visiting four to five times a week and helped to check students' homework at the centre. In 2013, the man was given a monthly allowance of S$100 for assisting at the centre. This was gradually raised to S$900 by July 2020. The man's duties included helping students with their homework, accompanying them during outings and general administration. He was also entrusted with a set of keys to the centre and had unrestricted access to it. The man's sexual abuse of boys at the centre lasted from the second half of 2013 to his arrest in August 2020, when he was 28. He would gain the boys' trust by buying them gifts, including mobile phone game credits and taking them out for meals and leisure activities. As he was involved in the administration of the centre, the offender was also known to the parents of a few of the boys. He got to know a few of the victims' families, spending time with them over the weekends and having meals together. The abuse started with hugs. He told the victims he loved them and kissed them on the cheek. He also kissed them on the lips when they were alone. Once the victims were comfortable with him, he progressed to sexual acts with them. These assaults mostly took place at the centre, particularly its toilet, and at the man's home. On several occasions, the man also abused the victims in a group setting, including making the boys perform sexual acts on each other. He made 105 video recordings of himself sexually abusing the various victims, which he admitted to watching for his own pleasure later. Aside from students at the centre, the man also met a 12th victim, aged 13 to 14, through the dating app Grindr. He sexually assaulted the boy at home. One student at the centre, identified as V4, was abused from the age of nine to 12. V4 became close to the offender when he was in Primary 3 and would approach the man daily for help with his homework. The offender bought the boy gifts and food, and started bringing him out for movies and dinners in 2014, with permission from the boy's parents. He hugged V4 daily and did this openly as it was still ""relatively acceptable"" behaviour for a teacher to hug a student, court documents stated. The man occasionally walked V4 home from the centre and would kiss the boy on the lips before leaving. He regularly told the boy he loved him. That same year, the man moved on to sexually abusing V4. In late 2017, after attending sexual education lessons, V4 felt that the sexual acts were wrong and told the man he did not want to continue. The man agreed to stop. Both of them continued to play basketball and computer games together, and remained friends after the man's arrest, court documents stated. Another student at the centre, identified in court documents at V7, was abused from the age of 11 to 13. V7 and the offender grew close in 2015. The man tutored the boy, gave him in-game items in mobile phone games and regularly told the boy he loved him. That same year, V7's mother noticed that her son often wanted to spend time at the centre and would only return home late at night. She later checked her son's phone and saw that the offender texted him regularly, including messages that read: ""I love you baby."" V7's mother confronted the man about this as she felt their relationship was inappropriate. But the man rebuffed her, accused her of neglecting her son and blamed her for not taking care of the boy. The woman wanted to pursue the matter, but the offender refused to give her more information. After this encounter, the man persisted in contacting V7. He went on to sexually abuse V7 from end-2015 to at least September 2018. The offences came to light through a lead from Australian law enforcement officials in April 2020. The South Australia Joint Anti Child Exploitation Team alerted the Singapore Police Force that an email account linked to the offender had received at least 17 emails with links to download child pornography. Police raided the man's house in August 2020 and arrested him. He was released on police bail and detained on Dec 9, 2020, after which he was remanded. According to court documents, V7 was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder which has since resolved, while the other victims were not found to have any psychiatric condition as a result of the sexual abuse. The offender was diagnosed with paedophilic disorder and found to have a moderate to high risk of reoffending, especially without robust supervision and monitoring. The prosecution sought 39 to 42 years' jail and 24 strokes of the cane, highlighting the offender's abuse of the teacher-student relationship he shared with the victims. ""Words cannot adequately express the depravity of the accused's conduct,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutors Han Ming Kuang and Sean Teh. ""The accused is an irrepressible paedophile who sexually abused 12 young boys over seven years in a premeditated and predatory fashion. ""He exploited the vulnerability of his victims and betrayed their trust to feed his deviant urges."" The man's cultivation of relationships with a few of the victims' families made it easier for him to commit the offences, and harder for the victims to resist his advances, they argued. The prosecution also pointed to the ""sickening, lengthy videos"" the man recorded of himself sexually abusing the victims. Defence counsel Kalaithasan Karuppaya asked for a shorter jail term of 33 to 40 years, citing his client's remorse, cooperation with investigations and plea of guilt. In her judgment, Justice Mavis Chionh said the man showed ""a calculated cunning in the manner he preyed on the naivete and childish sensibilities of his young victims"". Court documents recounted how the man first gained the trust and friendship of the victims by plying them with gifts, then initiated seemingly innocuous physical contact, before moving to full sexual contact. ""This was not an accused person who suffered a momentary lapse in judgment,"" said Justice Chionh. ""This was an accused who relentlessly and cynically took advantage of his position at the after-school care centre and the access it afforded him to a pool of potential victims to carry on his campaign of sexual abuse for some seven years."" She disagreed with the defence on the offender's remorse, saying it was ""telling"" that the man failed to show any guilt when V7's mother confronted him about text messages sent to her son. ""He actually sought to turn the tables on V7's mother by accusing her of neglecting V7 and not taking care of him. And he subsequently went on to commit a string of sexual assaults on V7. ""This indicates that the accused felt no remorse about his offending behaviour, and – if not for the police raid – would very likely have continued offending,"" said the judge. The man could have been jailed for between eight and 20 years and caned at least 12 strokes for each charge of aggravated sexual assault."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/pokka-ceo-alain-ong-fine-disclose-interest-asian-story-corporation-2892731,Former Pokka International CEO fined for failing to disclose interest in transactions,"SINGAPORE: The former CEO of Pokka International was on Monday (Aug 22) fined S$15,000 for failing to disclose his interest in three business transactions. Ong Eng Sing, 47 and also known as Alain Ong, was also barred from acting as a company director or managing a company for two years. He pleaded guilty to three charges under the Companies Act, the Singapore Police Force said in a news release. From 2010 to 2017, Ong held various positions in Pokka International and Pokka Corporation (Singapore), including acting as director of both beverage companies. During the same period, he also owned 40 per cent of Asian Story Corporation (ASC), another beverage company. Between 2010 and 2017, the two Pokka entities entered into three agreements with ASC. These included a distribution agreement and framework between Pokka International and ASC in 2010 and 2017, and a manufacturing agreement between Pokka Corporation and ASC in 2016. ""On all three occasions, Ong did not disclose his interest in these transactions to Pokka International or Pokka Corporation,"" said the police. Deputy Public Prosecutor David Koh sought the sentence imposed, citing the need to deter serious lapses in corporate behaviour. He highlighted that Ong did not disclose his interest in ASC at any time during the seven years over which the offences took place. Mr Koh added that Ong has not provided any explanation for the failure to disclose his interest, which was relevant for determining the appropriate sentence. Defence counsels Timothy Tan and Tara Heng said that their client accepted the prosecution's sentencing position, and highlighted his ""foresight and devotion to Pokka"". ""Despite having partial, indirect, and beneficial interest in ASC, (Ong) had never abused his position in Pokka,"" they said. They also said that he was remorseful and had readily cooperated with Commercial Affairs Department investigations. Ong could have been jailed for up to a year or fined up to S$5,000 for failing to disclose his indirect interest in a transaction."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-sexual-abuse-young-underaged-girl-stepdaughter-sister-law-2892536,"Man jailed for sexually abusing stepdaughter, 8, and sister-in-law, 9","SINGAPORE: A man was jailed for 11-and-a-half years on Monday (Aug 22) for sexually abusing his stepdaughter and sister-in-law from the ages of eight and nine respectively. He told the young girls that he was touching them out of ""family love"". They kept quiet about the abuse, which took place from 2014 to 2015 and only came to light last year. The offender cannot be named as the identity of the victims is protected by a gag order. He pleaded guilty to one charge of aggravated sexual assault and two charges of outraging the modesty of a minor. Nine more charges for sexual offences against children were considered for sentencing. The man lived in a flat in Bedok with his stepdaughter - identified in court documents as V2 - and V2's mother. He and V2's mother married in 2014, and divorced in 2016. The court heard that the offender started abusing his stepdaughter in 2014 or 2015, when she was eight to 10 years old. As the girl's mother was often out at work during the day, the offender, who was then unemployed, would be in the flat alone. He would wait for V2 to return from school, sit next to her and touch her thighs while she used her phone. This progressed to touching her chest. V2 felt disgusted and uncomfortable during these acts, but her stepfather assured her it was part of ""family love"" and told her not to tell anyone, court documents stated. On one occasion, the man also asked V2 to touch his private parts and she did as instructed. In 2015, the man escalated his abuse by entering V2's bedroom and touching various parts of her body, including her private parts. He also kissed her lips. The entire episode lasted half an hour, and V2 kept silent the entire time. He continued to touch the girl in this manner almost on a daily basis, until he and his wife decided to divorce, and V2 moved out of the flat with her mother. The man's sister-in-law - identified in court documents as V1 - was the stepsister of his wife. His abuse of V1 started in 2014, when the girl was about nine. Before the divorce, V1 frequently visited V2 at the flat to play video games and watch television, as they lived near each other. On several of these occasions, V2's mother was not at home and the offender was the only adult around. He would sit next to the girls while they played games. He eventually started touching V1 on her waist and thigh frequently. These actions became more intrusive over time. On one occasion in 2014, V1 decided to practise meditation inside V2's room while the offender, V2 and V2's mother sat outside in the living room. The man went into the room, asked V1 to keep her eyes closed and told her that what he was going to do next would help her with her meditation. He then touched her private parts. V1 was uncomfortable, but did not stop the man as she trusted him and believed that his actions would help her. The man repeated this when V1 tried to meditate in the flat on another occasion sometime after Aug 8, 2014. He told V1 to follow him into the master bedroom. There, he touched her private parts and sexually assaulted her. V1 felt pain, but did not stop the man as she still trusted him. He eventually stopped when V1 said she needed to use the toilet. The offender continued to molest the girl's private parts when she visited the flat at other times. He repeatedly explained to V1 that he was touching her ""for medicinal purposes and family love"", court documents stated. V1 did not react adversely as she trusted him, and she did not know then that what the man was doing to her was wrong. In 2018, V1 attended a sex education class where she learnt what constituted inappropriate behaviour. She realised that what the offender had done to her was wrong, and spent the next two hours crying in school. But she did not tell her family about the abuse as she was afraid they would be angry that she had not told them earlier, or would not believe her. It was only in February 2021 that V1 disclosed the abuse during an argument with her father. She was taken to make a police report. Further investigations revealed that V2 had also been abused by the offender. The man was diagnosed with paedophilic disorder towards girls under 14, and assessed to be at moderate risk of reoffending. Deputy Public Prosecutors Ng Yiwen and Wong Shiau Yin sought 11 to 12 years' jail and nine months' jail in lieu of caning, as the offender is 50. They cited the man's exploitation of young and vulnerable victims, his abuse of trust and his premeditation, arguing that he used ""trickery"" to abuse V1 in the privacy of the master bedroom. Defence counsel Gregory Fong asked for a shorter sentence of nine-and-a-half to 10 years' jail for his client. Justice Pang Khang Chau imposed a sentence that included six months' jail in lieu of caning. The punishment for aggravated sexual assault by penetration is between eight and 20 years' jail and at least 12 strokes of the cane. The penalty for outraging the modesty of a child under 14 is up to five years' jail, a fine, caning or any combination of these punishments."

The operation took place in the vicinity of Yishun Street 1 on Wednesday. A 75-year-old man and 62-year-old woman were alleged to have acted as a gambling service provider to four other men aged between 48 and 72. Another man, 61, was also allegedly involved in illegal betting activities with another gambling service provider.
About S$2,280 in cash and seven mobile phones were seized. The police said they take a serious view of all forms of illegal betting activities and will continue to take tough enforcement action against offenders. Those found guilty of being involved in unlawful betting operations can be jailed up to five years and are liable to a fine of not less than S$200,000. If convicted of gambling with an unlicensed gambling service provider, the offender can be jailed up to six months, fined up to S$10,000, or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/moe-bullying-not-acceptable-no-place-schools-2890486,Bullying not acceptable and has no place in schools: Ministry of Education,"SINGAPORE: Bullying is not acceptable and has no place in schools, said the Ministry of Education (MOE) on Saturday (Aug 20), adding that it takes a serious view on any form of bullying, including cyberbullying.  In response to CNA's queries, MOE said that since 2012, the number of such incidents reported each year to schools has remained low. About two cases per 1,000 primary school students and five incidents per 1,000 secondary school students are reported.  On Thursday, the police said three teenagers were arrested after a girl was assaulted in a multi-storey car park in Buangkok.  The three teenagers, all aged 15, were arrested for wrongful confinement. They are also under investigation for voluntarily causing hurt.  Videos of the assault were circulated on social media. In the videos, three girls, all dressed in black tops, can be seen repeatedly hitting a girl in white while questioning her. The girl in white was grabbed by the hair and thrown to the floor several times. On Saturday, MOE said it was aware of the videos.  It said: ""As the police is investigating the matter, it would be advisable that there is no speculation of the schools involved or the extent of the student's involvement."" It added that where necessary, the schools will mete out appropriate disciplinary action and provide counselling as well as support to the students. In January, MOE took disciplinary action against three students seen fighting in a video which was circulated online. The 30-second clip shows a girl in a school uniform kicked and punched several times by two other girls. Last year, in another incident that made the rounds on social media, some Ngee Ann Polytechnic students were caught urinating on two other male students. MOE said on Saturday that when there are reports of alleged cases of bullying, school staff will seek to understand the underlying causes of the behaviour. It added that such cases are ""complex"" as they can extend into the online space and often involve unresolved relationship issues.  ""Counselling support is provided to the students involved and appropriate disciplinary actions are meted out where necessary to help students understand that there are consequences for anti-social and hurtful behaviour,"" it added.  ""Schools also engage the parents and work with them to provide students with the necessary support both in and out of school."" All students are also taught the safe channels to report serious incidents, inappropriate practices, or hurtful behaviours. Peer support leaders also help to keep online and offline spaces safe and positive, alerting teachers when needed, said MOE. As part of efforts to establish a caring and enabling learning environment, schools have appointed dedicated key personnel to oversee and implement preventive and intervention measures to engender a peer support culture in the learning, social and cyberspace, it added."

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-refuse-wear-mask-defiance-authority-covid-19-rules-2887696,'Deliberate defiance of authority': Man fined for not wearing mask in fast food outlet,"SINGAPORE: A man who refused to wear a mask in a fast food outlet was fined S$8,000 on Thursday (Aug 18), with the prosecutor saying he showed ""deliberate defiance of authority"". Philip Richard Mockridge, 55, pleaded guilty to one charge under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations, with two similar charges taken into consideration for sentencing. Mockridge, a permanent resident, conducted his own defence. After sentencing, he asked for time to consider whether to appeal. His fine was deferred by one week for him to make his decision. The court heard that the police received a call about a person refusing to wear his mask at City Square Mall on the night of May 16, 2021. Two police officers responded and saw Mockridge sitting in a fast food restaurant in the mall's basement at about 9.10pm. Mockridge's mask was pulled down to his chin, exposing his mouth and nose. He did not have any food or drink with him at the time. A police sergeant told Mockridge that he had to put his mask on if he was not eating or drinking. Mockridge then asked to see the officers' identification, and they presented it. The officer repeated that Mockridge had to wear his mask, and he said: ""Are you sure about that? I'm not so sure."" A few minutes later, Mockridge walked away from the officers to collect his food at the counter, still unmasked. A member of the public stood next to him at the counter. Five minutes later, Mockridge received his food and went to stand with the officers at the restaurant's entrance. He did not eat or drink at any time. The sergeant asked Mockridge if he had an issue with wearing a mask, to which he replied: ""Which law are you referring to?"" Mockridge then took out his phone and started recording the exchange. When the sergeant repeated his question, Mockridge challenged him again, asking: ""Which law are you referring to?"" The sergeant referred to the COVID-19 regulations and repeated that Mockridge was supposed to wear his mask over his mouth and nose. He then replied: ""And if I don't, what will you do?"" When the officer informed Mockridge of the penalties for flouting the regulations, he said: ""So you're threatening to put me in a cage?"" Around 9.25pm, as Mockridge persistently refused to wear his mask despite instructions to do so, the sergeant told him that he would have to answer to any follow-up action. Mockridge then walked away with his mask still on his chin, his mouth and nose exposed. At the time of this incident, Mockridge was already being investigated for two previous occasions when he did not wear a mask outside his home. The earlier incidents took place at Sengkang MRT station on Nov 26, 2020, and at Serangoon MRT station on Dec 19, 2020. Deputy Public Prosecutor Wu Yu Jie sought a fine of S$10,000, pointing out that Mockridge stayed unmasked for no reason for at least 15 minutes in the restaurant. His responses to the officers ""clearly demonstrate his defiance, despite having gone through two prior incidents with the police"", said the prosecutor. In mitigation, Mockridge said that his responses to the officers were ""genuine and legitimate questions"" as he was uncertain about the law. ""I was overly persistent, I accept that, and that's what constituted the breach, your honour,"" he told District Judge Soh Tze Bian. He also claimed he had ""no reason whatsoever to be aware"" of the investigations against him for the prior incidents, and had ""completely forgotten"" about them. Mr Wu contended that this was not believable as Mockridge had been interviewed by police about the prior incidents in March 2021. The prosecutor also disagreed that Mockridge's questions to the officers were genuine and legitimate, saying he had no reason to doubt their answers. ""He was not genuinely intending to accept the responses of the police, as evidenced by his escalating questions about what the police would do if he failed to comply with their directions,"" said Mr Wu. Mockridge asked for a fine of S$1,000. Judge Soh said that while he did not agree with the prosecution's position to impose the maximum fine, S$1,000 was too low. Mockridge could have been jailed for up to six months, fined up to S$10,000, or both, for an offence under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cyclist-pedestrian-accident-73-year-old-elderly-man-died-2887606,Cyclist jailed for causing 73-year-old pedestrian's death in accident,"SINGAPORE: A cyclist was on Thursday (Aug 18) jailed for 12 days for causing the death of a 73-year-old pedestrian in an accident. Daniel Woon Hock Soon, 46, pleaded guilty to one charge of causing death by a negligent act. Another charge of not wearing a helmet under the Road Traffic (Bicycles) Rules was considered for sentencing. The court heard that Woon, a food stall operator at a military camp, was cycling on the road at about 7am on Aug 13 last year. He was travelling along the leftmost lane of Hougang Avenue 3, going in the direction of Hougang Avenue 2. Cycling towards the box junction at Hougang Avenue 3 and Lorong Ah Soo, Woon saw that the traffic light had turned amber and sped up to beat it. As he crossed the junction and approached the other side of the road, he decided to get back onto the pavement by cycling through the pedestrian island. The victim had been standing on the pedestrian island and was just then stepping onto the road to cross the pedestrian crossing. But Woon failed to keep a proper lookout and collided into him. Shortly after, he saw the elderly man lying on the road at the crossing. Woon helped to carry the victim onto the pavement and stayed by his side until an ambulance came to take him to the hospital. The elderly man was taken to the hospital unconscious. He was noted to be vomiting on his arrival, and succumbed to his injuries later that day. His cause of death was severe head injury consistent with that from a road traffic accident. Woon told the court that he did not sustain any injuries from the collision. An inspection of Woon's bicycle did not find any mechanical faults that may have contributed to the accident. Deputy Public Prosecutor Wong Shiau Yin asked for two to four weeks' jail, highlighting that Woon sped up instead of slowing down when he saw the amber light signal. Woon then maintained the same speed after crossing the junction and was unable to avoid the victim, she said. Ms Wong also pointed out that Woon has a string of traffic offences dating back to 2003, including speeding and careless driving. She said the mitigating factors were Woon's plea of guilt and the fact that he helped the victim after the accident. Woon, who did not have a lawyer, told the court he did not slow down after the junction because he was trying to stay clear of oncoming traffic. ""It was a bus lane, so I was also fearing for my life,"" he said. Woon claimed he did not anticipate the elderly man's reaction, saying: ""Instead of continuing on his path, he swerved into my path actually."" He also told the judge that the jail term would take him away from caring for his elderly mother, a stroke patient with dementia. District Judge Janet Wang said that regardless of the vehicle, ""it is incumbent on the road user to keep a proper lookout for pedestrians at designated crossings"". ""This is just a very unfortunate accident that could have been prevented,"" she said in sentencing. The punishment for causing death by a negligent act is up to two years' jail, a fine or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/new-zealand-remains-two-children-found-suitcases-2887456,Remains of two children found in suitcases that were auctioned in New Zealand,"Detective Inspector Tofilau Faamanuia Vaaelua said that the bodies were likely to have been in storage for several years and the victims are thought to have been between five and 10 years old when they died. The children were concealed in two suitcases of similar size, he said. ""The nature of this discovery provides some complexities to the investigation especially given the time lapsed between the time of death and the time of discovery,"" Vaaelua added. The remains were only found when an unsuspecting family bought a trailer-load of items being auctioned off in bulk from a storage unit in South Auckland. Police reiterated that the family concerned are not connected to the homicide, but are ""understandably distressed by the discovery"" and have asked for privacy, Vaaelua added. They are receiving support to help deal with the trauma. Police are using household and personal items found alongside the suitcases in their bid to identify the victims. They are also checking hours of closed-circuit television footage, but key moments could have already been erased due to the delay between when the victims died and the discovery of the bodies. Similarly, experts conducting the post-mortem investigation face difficulties in identifying the children, Vaaelua said, due to the timescales involved. Both the storage unit and property where the suitcases were taken to have been thoroughly examined by forensic experts. Vaaelua also said that police in New Zealand are working with international criminal police agency Interpol, though relatives of the victims are thought to be in the country. The children had not yet been identified, and Vaaelua said that he felt for their families, who might not be aware they are dead. The gruesome discovery has sent shock waves through the neighbourhood. ""This is no easy investigation,"" Vaaelua said. ""No matter how long or how many years you serve and investigate horrific cases like this it's never an easy task."" ""What I can say is we are making very good progress with DNA inquiries,"" he added. ""The investigation team is working very hard to hold accountable the person or persons responsible for the death of these children."" A neighbour of the family that made the discovery told the New Zealand Herald that he was looking after their house as they had left Auckland to escape media attention."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/lawyer-jailed-voyeur-film-video-neighbour-showering-2887236,Former lawyer jailed for taking video of neighbour showering,"SINGAPORE: Facing stress at work, a lawyer climbed into his neighbour's balcony to film a video of the young woman showering through her toilet window. The 32-year-old man was on Thursday (Aug 18) jailed for 12 weeks after pleading guilty to two counts of voyeurism. Two more charges of criminal trespass were considered for sentencing. CNA is not naming the offender as this could lead to the identification of the victim, who is protected by a gag order. The man has since left the legal profession and now works in a private enterprise, his defence counsel Shashi Nathan told the court. The court heard that the offender and victim lived in neighbouring terrace houses at the time. The victim's master bedroom toilet had a window that overlooked a small balcony. In the evening of Nov 23, 2020, the man climbed over the parapet into his neighbour's home when he realised that the victim was in the shower. He could deduce it was the woman by listening for her voice or due to her habit of playing videos in the shower, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Yvonne Poon. He went onto the balcony and held his phone outside her toilet window, with the camera facing in. But before he could start filming, the victim noticed him and shouted. The man quickly escaped back home by climbing over the parapet, without having taken a video. After the victim got dressed, she told her husband about what had happened and they went next door to confront the offender. The man continuously apologised to the victim and asked the couple to keep their voices down. He repeatedly asked if they could resolve the matter in any other way, and if they could speak at another location. He also gave his phone to the victim to check for photos or videos of her, but she found nothing incriminating. The couple nevertheless called the police. During investigations, the man admitted that several months ago, he had succeeded in taking a video of the victim showering. On that occasion, he similarly heard the victim in the toilet and climbed over the parapet to take the video, which he subsequently deleted. He told investigators that he committed the offences because he had been experiencing stress at work ever since the COVID-19 ""circuit breaker"" in April 2020. The prosecution asked for 12 to 15 weeks' jail, highlighting that the man had intruded into the sanctity of the victim's home and filmed her fully nude. There was premeditation as he made special note of the signs that pointed to the victim being the person in the shower and waited until it was her to film, said Ms Poon. She added that it was fortuitous the victim looked up and saw the man's phone, or his offences would have gone undetected. Mr Nathan told the court that his client was a young man who had been doing well in his career, but left the legal profession of his own accord after committing the offences. ""It shows courage. It shows his own self-awareness of what has happened and what he needs to do to do the right thing,"" said the lawyer, adding that the man wanted ""a fresh start"". Mr Nathan asked for six weeks' jail, arguing that his client's actions were impulsive and that he had been going through a difficult period in his life at the time. In sentencing, District Judge Eddy Tham said that the level of intrusion was high and harm caused to the victim was great as she was filmed showering in her own home. It was ""a big stretch"" to say that the offender could relieve his stress by taking such videos of the victim, he said. But the man showed remorse by coming clean when he was confronted, and admitting to the earlier offence even though no video recording was found, said the judge. The penalty for voyeurism is up to two years' jail, a fine, caning or any combination of these punishments."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-threaten-spread-ex-girlfriend-nude-videos-influencer-2885946,"Man admits threatening to spread ex-girlfriend's nude videos, make her an 'influencer'","SINGAPORE: A man threatened to circulate his ex-girlfriend's nude videos, telling her that she was going to ""be an influencer"" and he had ""nothing to lose"". After they broke up, the man also stalked the woman on Microsoft Teams for months when she blocked him on other social media platforms. He pleaded guilty on Wednesday (Aug 17) to two charges of making threats that caused his ex-girlfriend alarm, and one charge of stalking. The man, now 22, cannot be named to protect the identity of the victim, who is covered by a gag order. She was 19 at the time of the offences. The judge called for reports to assess the man's suitability for probation or a mandatory treatment order, which directs an offender suffering from certain treatable psychiatric conditions to receive psychiatric treatment. The man suffered from depression and anxiety at the time, according to his defence lawyers Mr Mark Yeo and Ms Chloe Chen of Kalco Law. The court heard that the man and his ex-girlfriend met in school and got together in April 2018. They fell out and broke up around December 2019. During their relationship, the man took or received from the victim more than 100 videos and photos of her in various states of undress. Several of the videos showed them having sex. In late 2019, the couple got into an argument on Telegram. The victim was then under the impression that the man had deleted the revealing videos and photos of her But during the argument, the man told the victim he had ""almost 100"" of her nude videos and threatened to circulate them. He also told her she had ""messed with the wrong guy"", said Deputy Public Prosecutor Benedict Teong. The man repeated a similar threat during another argument on Telegram on Dec 23, 2019, when the victim said she was going to leave their chat group. ""I'm going to leak your nudes and make sure your 2020 is amazing,"" he said in a message to her. The man sent these threatening messages with the intention of causing alarm to the victim, said Mr Teong. From May to July 2020, the man also harassed the victim with frequent unwelcome messages on Microsoft Teams, which she used to access her school lectures. The man's messages usually involved him trying to guilt-trip his ex-girlfriend, said the prosecutor. By that time, the victim had blocked the man on other social media and made clear to him that she did not want to have contact with him anymore. The offender will return for sentencing in October. The punishment for using threatening words to cause alarm is up to six months' jail, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both. The offence of stalking carries a penalty of up to a year's imprisonment, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/former-gang-member-sexual-assault-three-teen-boys-playground-slide-2885811,Former gang member found guilty of sexually assaulting 3 teens at playground slide,"SINGAPORE: A former gang member was on Wednesday (Aug 17) convicted of sexually assaulting three teenage boys at a playground slide. A High Court judge found Mustapah Abdullah, 50, guilty of three counts of sexual assault. Mustapah had claimed trial to the charges and represented himself. The identities of the victims, aged 16 to 17 during the offences, are protected by gag order. They lived in the same neighbourhood as Mustapah and got to know him in 2017. The victims ""clearly looked up to him, regarded him as a 'big brother' and respected his advice"", said Justice See Kee Oon. They also knew of his past gang involvement. The friendship soured in 2018, when the victims started avoiding Mustapah over a rumour that he had made one of their friends perform a sexual act on him. This friend, identified as W2 in court documents, was purportedly sexually assaulted by Mustapah on two occasions in 2018 when he was 16. Mustapah is also accused of sexually assaulting W1, another friend of the teens, on five occasions in 2017 when he was 15. These allegations are the subject of seven charges against Mustapah that have been stood down during the trial. Angered by the rumour, Mustapah arranged to meet the teens on the night of Oct 17, 2018 at a hut in their neighbourhood. According to the prosecution, he pulled, slapped and tried to scratch one victim's eye out, and kicked another victim on his back. He then told each victim to meet him alone at the slide. One by one, he asked each victim to perform a sexual act on him at the top of slide. All three complied. Justice See found that Deputy Public Prosecutors Gail Wong, Tay Jia En and Gladys Lim had proven their case against Mustapah beyond reasonable doubt. He found that each victim gave a ""textured, coherent and internally consistent account"" of events, whereas Mustapah, who represented himself, gave ""shifting and unreliable evidence"". A key plank of Mustapah's defence was his claim that the victims were given a choice as to whether to perform the sexual acts on him, said Justice See. He rejected this argument, noting that all three victims testified they only agreed to Mustapah's demands as they feared he would injure them or their families. ""It is crucial to appreciate the full context in which the victims had agreed to 'settle' the problem with the accused"" by performing the sexual acts, said the judge. ""The accused was angry that the victims had purportedly spread rumours about him ... and were avoiding him. He wanted to know who had been responsible for the rumours. ""He confronted the victims and spared no effort to demonstrate his capacity to carry out his threats of violence,"" said Justice See. Mustapah eventually presented each victim with an ultimatum of performing the sexual act, or walking away and being prepared for the consequences. To the victims, the sexual act was ""the lesser of two evils"" and they only complied out of fear of further harm or harassment, said the judge. ""Plainly, the victims did not consent. They did not act voluntarily and did not freely agree to submit themselves."" The judge also found that apart from displays of physical violence, Mustapah capitalised on the victims' respect for him as an authority figure with a purportedly violent past. This included deliberately referring to his past involvement in gang fights when confronting the teens. ""Unsurprisingly, the victims were intimidated and felt fearful that further harm would be inflicted upon them or their families if they were to choose not to 'settle' the matter with the accused,"" said the judge. Justice See rejected Mustapah's assertion that the victims had conspired to ""backstab"" him and that the prosecution witnesses were out to malign him, calling this ""pure speculation"" and ""baseless and vexatious"". He also gave full weight to Mustapah's self-incriminating statements made in interviews with police and an Institute of Mental Health psychiatrist. The prosecution previously told the court it was seeking 26 years' imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane, with additional jail time in lieu of caning. The offender cannot be caned as he is now 50. Mustapah will return for sentencing in September. He can be jailed for up to 20 years, fined and caned for each charge of sexual assault by penetration."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/club-bouncer-tip-nightclub-police-raid-2885606,Club bouncer gets jail for tipping off chat groups about police raids,"SINGAPORE: A club bouncer was on Wednesday (Aug 17) sentenced to 17 weeks' jail and fined S$3,000 for offences including obstructing the course of justice. Aaron Chua Jun Hao, 27, was part of a network of nightclub employees who used chat groups to tip each other off about police raids in order to escape detection. He was sentenced after pleading guilty to six counts of obstructing the course of justice, and one count each of affray and causing hurt by a rash act. Thirteen other charges were considered for sentencing. Authorities first discovered the tip-off chat groups in April 2019, when they detained a man at Woodlands Checkpoint for failing to declare cash he had on him. A check of the man's mobile phone showed two WhatsApp chat groups called ""Rolex Movement"" and ""Night Owl"". Then in February 2020, police arrested three club employees who were acting as police lookouts. Investigations revealed two more WhatsApp chat groups, ""UncleValet"" and ""Pao Pao Bing Tuan"". Members of these chat groups mostly comprised bouncers and other club employees. They used the groups to alert each other about raids at their clubs, allowing other members to take steps to prevent the detection of offences at their workplaces. The tip-off messages included information such as police vehicle licence plate numbers, locations of enforcement checks, sizes of raiding teams and the specific unit or department conducting the raid. The members used code words and abbreviations, such as referring to non-uniformed enforcement officers as ""cv"", said Deputy Public Prosecutor Lee Wei Liang. Chua, a bouncer at various clubs, was a member of the ""Night Owl"" and ""UncleValet"" chat groups. He admitted to sending 60 tip-off messages to the ""Night Owl"" chat group between January and April 2019, and four such messages to ""UncleValet"" between January and February 2020. In his messages, he identified officers from the Secret Societies Branch of the Criminal Investigations Department, including singling one out by name. Court documents stated that there were ongoing law enforcement operations in the vicinity of the nightclub when Chua sent the messages. He did it ""knowing that members of the said chat group will likely take steps to prevent the detection of offences in the vicinity of the said law enforcement operations"". Eight other alleged members of ""Night Owl"", aged 29 to 48, are set to plead guilty on Friday. The eight - Abdul Hadi Zainuddin, Muhammad Rashidi Rashid, Muhammad Rasyidi Safiee, Daniel Seet Joo Tong, Brandon Chung, Ang Whay Chong, Wilson Soon Jien Yang and Lim Poh Kian - were among 22 men charged with obstruction of justice in July. Chua was also convicted of unrelated offences of driving his car towards a man and hitting him from the back three times, and being part of a fight between two groups drinking at a pub in Katong. Anyone convicted of intentionally obstructing the course of justice could be jailed for up to seven years, fined or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/wirecard-case-4-more-people-charged-singapore-2885511,"Four more people in Singapore charged over Wirecard case, taking total tally to seven","SINGAPORE: Four more people were charged in court on Wednesday (Aug 17) in connection to the Wirecard investigation, taking the total tally to seven. This comes after investigations by the Singapore Police Force's Commercial Affairs Department into the activities of two Singapore subsidiaries of the German company Wirecard AG. Three of the four - James Aga Wardhana, Chai Ai Lim and See Lee Wee - were former employees of Wirecard Asia Holding, while Yeo Chiew Hai Henry was a director at Jacobson Fareast Marketing Services. The four individuals allegedly conspired with Edo Kurniawan, then Wirecard Asia's vice president of controlling and finance, to dishonestly misappropriate amounts ranging between S$41,200 and S$100,000 from the company. Edo left Singapore before investigations into the offences commenced, and a warrant of arrest has been issued against him in connection to the case, said the police. Wardhana, See and Yeo are also accused of committing money laundering by allegedly transferring most of the misappropriated amounts to other individuals. Additionally, Wardhana has also been charged for allegedly abetting Yeo to falsify four invoices totalling S$184,870 from Jacobson Fareast to Wirecard Asia. The four individuals will be charged with criminal breach of trust. If convicted, they could be jailed for up to 15 years and be liable to a fine for each charge.  Wardhana, See and Yeo have also been charged with the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act. If convicted, face jail terms of up to 10 years and fines of up to S$500,000 for each charge. Wardhana and Yeo have also been charged with falsification of accounts. If convicted, they could be jailed for up to 10 years and be liable to a fine for each charge. Before this, three other men had been charged in connection to the Wirecard investigation. In May, James Henry O'Sullivan was given two additional counts of allegedly abetting to falsify documents. He had purportedly instigated R Shanmugaratnam - the director of local accounting firm Citadelle Corporate Services - to issue letters to Wirecard that falsely confirmed that Strategic Corporate Investments, another company, held certain sums of money under escrow in its bank account, which it did not. In September last year, O'Sullivan had been handed five charges of abetting Shanmugaratnam in the falsification of documents.  Shanmugaratnam had been charged with 14 counts of falsification of documents for allegedly issuing 14 letters from Citadelle to Wirecard, its subsidiaries and an audit firm. The letters falsely claimed that Citadelle held large sums of money in its escrow accounts at various points in time between 2015 and 2017, when the company did not maintain such accounts or hold such balances in its accounts. Strategic’s director Thilagaratnam Rajaratnam was also charged in court in May this year. Munich-based Wirecard collapsed in June 2020 after its auditor refused to sign off on its 2019 accounts because it could not verify €1.9 billion (S$2.7 billion) supposedly held abroad in escrow by third-party partners. Several Wirecard executives, including former chief executive Markus Braun, have been arrested on fraud charges. In September 2020, MAS directed Wirecard to cease its payment services in Singapore and to return all customers' funds."

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/youth-cheat-7-friends-332000-crypto-investment-scam-2883321,"Youth admits cheating 7 friends of S$332,000 in investment scam","SINGAPORE: A youth told seven friends that he had made profits from trading cryptocurrency, convincing them to invest about S$332,000 through him. Instead of investing, he used the money to buy items in online games, which he sold for profit. He then paid back about S$82,000 to his friends. The youth, now 20, on Tuesday (Aug 16) pleaded guilty to three charges of cheating. Another four similar charges will be considered when he returns for sentencing next week. The youth cannot be named as he was under 18 when he committed the offences and is protected under the Children and Young Persons Act. Sometime before 2017, the youth discovered that he was able to profit from buying and selling in-game items from games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Around November 2017, when the youth was 16, he decided to increase his profits by selling higher value items, but did not have enough money to buy these. He wanted to approach his friends for money, but knew they would not help him if they were made aware that the money was for buying in-game items, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Cheng You Duen. The youth therefore lied to his friends that he invested in various commodities such as forex and cryptocurrency, and offered to invest on their behalf. He lied that he had previously profited from Bitcoin trading and guaranteed his friends fixed returns if they invested through him. One of the youth's victims was a 17-year-old classmate who was deceived into delivering more than S$188,000 between January and August 2018. Between April and August 2018, this classmate received more than S$40,000 from the youth, as purported returns on his investments. The victim eventually made a police report in October 2018 that he had invested a large sum with the youth but had not received the returns. Another 17-year-old schoolmate was cheated into delivering about S$106,000 over at least 26 occasions from May to August 2018. He also received about S$40,000 as purported investment returns, and made a police report in October 2018. There were other victims, such as another 17-year-old friend who invested S$5,000 with the youth, who did not receive any returns. Mr Cheng called the youth a recalcitrant offender and highlighted that there has been a rising number of investment scams in Singapore. He argued that the money given back to the victims, although mitigating their economic losses, could not be considered a demonstration of the offender's remorse. ""In any event, a substantial sum of S$249,124 remains outstanding,"" said the prosecutor. He added that some of the victims also sourced money from relatives and friends for their investment sums. Defence counsel Adeline Goh said her client's offences were ""borne out of a teenager's misguided attempt to gain a sense of belonging among his friends"". She said that her client believed he would be more well-liked by his peers if he showed that he was knowledgeable and successful at cryptocurrency trading. The lawyer said that when the victims, who initially placed small amounts of money with the offender, started to increase their investments, he was ""at a loss"". ""This is a misguided attempt by a teenager to gain friendship,"" she said, urging the court not to consider reformative training. Ms Goh also highlighted her client's young age and genuine remorse for his actions, adding that he had stopped playing computer games. ""He has experienced firsthand how a lie he thought was harmless could derail his life,"" she said, calling the court proceedings a ""wake-up call"" for him. But District Judge Kessler Soh said that the defence's mitigation plea appeared to downplay the harm caused to the victims. He ordered reports to assess the youth's suitability for probation and reformative training, as requested by the prosecution. Probation is a community-based sentence, while reformative training is a harsher punishment that detains younger offenders in a structured environment with an emphasis on rehabilitation. The punishment for cheating is up to 10 years' jail and a fine."

Tan has been in remand since Jun 30 though he has been offered bail at S$400,000. According to court documents, between November and December 2015, Tan became aware that his company's performance for the financial year would be poor.  He entered into a conspiracy with Trek's then chief financial officer Gurcharan Singh and former executive director Poo Teng Pin, to falsify Trek's financial statements for the financial year 2015. They also recorded a fictitious US$3.2 million (S$4.41 million) sale from Trek Technology to Taiwanese manufacturing firm Unimicron to inflate reported revenue and net profits for the financial year, in order to improve their company's financial position.  Trek Technology is a company incorporated in Singapore and a subsidiary wholly owned by mainboard-listed Trek 2000. On Singh's instruction, a sales coordinator created a customer code for Unimicron to address and generate invoices and delivery orders in Trek's system. Tax invoices and delivery orders were then created to support records of the fictitious US$3.2 million sale. Tan and Singh also signed false documents that purported to show that their company had sold and delivered 500,000 units of fictitious product, for a total price of US$3.2 million. In February 2016, Tan, Singh, Poo and president of regional sales at the time Foo Kok Wah then entered into a conspiracy to cheat auditors Ernst & Young (EY). EY had queried the fictitious sale and asked the company to provide supporting documentation.  Tan and his co-accused agreed to deceive EY into believing that the fictitious sale was a genuine transaction, and that the company's unaudited financial statements for the financial year 2015 had been drawn up properly. After the company failed to provide satisfactory explanations, EY issued a disclaimer of opinion and reported the matter to the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA), which in turn reported the matter to the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) of the Singapore Police Force. Following investigations by the CAD, Tan, Singh, Poo and Foo were charged with offences under the Penal Code and the Securities and Futures Act.  For falsifying accounts, Tan may be sentenced to a jail term of up to 10 years, a fine or both.  The punishment for cheating is up to three years in jail, a fine or both. For abetting this offence, the penalty is up to a quarter of the maximum jail term, a fine or both. For committing forgery, Tan may be sentenced to a jail term of up to 4 years, a fine or both.  He was fined S$80,000 in 2020 for failing to disclose US$10.5 million (S$14.4 million) worth of transactions."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-molest-9-year-old-girl-family-friend-child-tuition-2883021,Jail for man who molested 9-year-old daughter of family friends during tuition,"SINGAPORE: A 60-year-old man was on Tuesday (Aug 16) sentenced to more than one-and-a-half years in prison for molesting a nine-year-old girl. The incidents in 2016 and 2019 took place while the girl was receiving tuition from the man's wife in their home. The offender cannot be named as this could lead to identification of the victim, who is protected by gag order. He was convicted in April of one count of outraging a minor's modesty and one count of attempting to do so, after contesting the charges at trial. The prosecution sought the sentence imposed, citing the offender's abuse of trust, intrusion of the victim's body and exploitation of a vulnerable victim, and the psychological harm she suffered. After the sentencing, the offender indicated that he would appeal against his conviction and sentence. The court previously heard that the offender and his wife were close family friends with the victim's parents. The offender had known the victim since she was about three, and was especially close to her among her siblings. He would exclusively buy presents for the victim during her birthday and when she did well for her examinations, said the prosecution. In 2016, the victim and her younger sister were having tuition in the offender's home when the victim had a breakout of hives on her arm. The offender offered to help apply powder to the girl's arm so his wife could continue teaching her younger sister. While in the master bedroom, with the door closed, he told the victim to pull her pants down and molested her, the prosecution added. The prosecution also argued that the man tried to molest the victim in his home between Sep 9 and Sep 13, 2019. During one of her tuition breaks, she was sitting on the edge of the living room sofa when the offender sat next to her. He tried to put his hand down the back of her pants. When the victim felt his touch, she swept his hand away and he stood up and left. The incidents went unreported until 2019, when the offender asked the victim if her younger sister had already grown pubic hair. This greatly alarmed the victim, who became afraid that her sister would also fall prey to the man. She decided to talk to a friend about this, and eventually told a school counsellor about what had happened. The victim did not tell anyone about the 2016 incident earlier because she did not know what he had done was wrong at the time. She only realised this when she learnt what a ""bad touch"" was in a Primary 5 sex education class, which led to her breaking down in school. She also testified that she did not report the matter to her parents as she was not close to her family members then, and was in fact closer to the offender at the time. The victim's medical report stated that she sometimes had flashbacks and nightmares of the incidents, and bad dreams about people she trusts. She also had thoughts of self-harm. District Judge Victor Yeo previously ruled that the prosecution proved its case against the man on both charges. He found the victim's evidence to be unusually convincing, whereas the offender's denial of the allegations was inconsistent and not credible. For outraging the modesty of a child, the man could have been jailed for up to five years, fined or both. Attempted outrage of modesty carries up to half the maximum jail term. The man cannot be caned as he is above 50."

""Clearly it is ludicrous to suggest that Salman Rushdie was in any way responsible for this abhorrent attack on him,"" the spokesman told reporters. ""This was not just an attack on him, it was an attack on the right to free speech and expression and the UK government stands both by him and his family, but equally we stand in defence of free speech around the world."" Rushdie was set to deliver a lecture on artistic freedom at the Chautauqua Institution in New York last Friday when police say a 24-year-old man rushed the stage and stabbed the Indian-born writer.  The author has lived with a bounty on his head since his 1988 novel The Satanic Verses prompted Iran to urge Muslims to kill him. On Monday, Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani told reporters that freedom of speech does not justify Rushdie's insults against religion in his writing. ""Salman Rushdie exposed himself to popular outrage by insulting Islamic sanctities and crossing the red lines of 1.5 billion Muslims,"" Kanaani said. ""During the attack on Salman Rushdie, we do not consider anyone other than himself and his supporters worthy of reproach, reproach and condemnation ... No one has the right to accuse Iran in this regard."" Rushdie is off a ventilator and his condition is improving, his agent Andrew Wylie said on Sunday. ""He's off the ventilator, so the road to recovery has begun. It will be long; the injuries are severe, but his condition is headed in the right direction,"" said Wylie."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/rape-drunk-teenage-girl-birthday-celebration-2881086,Man jailed 8 years for raping drunk teenage girl at house party,"SINGAPORE: A man was sentenced on Monday (Aug 15) to eight years' jail and six strokes of the cane for raping a drunk teenage girl at a birthday celebration. Rajama Samuel Doctorian Purba, 20, pleaded guilty to one charge of rape. Two charges of outraging the victim's modesty and possessing obscene films were also considered for sentencing. Rajama was pursuing a diploma at a private school at the time of the offences in November 2020. The victim was a 16-year-old secondary school student then. Her identity is protected by gag order. She had never met Rajama before the incident, but had a friend studying in the same course as Rajama's housemate. The four of them had gathered to celebrate the victim's friend's birthday at Rajama's apartment. The victim was initially hesitant to attend as she did not know anyone else at the gathering, but agreed as it was a celebration for her friend. She and her friend arrived at Rajama's apartment at about 9.30pm. The group played card games and drank alcohol - including whisky and soju - that Rajama and his housemate provided. After a few rounds of card games, the victim started feeling dizzy and falling in and out of consciousness. She told the group she wanted to vomit. Rajama supported her to the toilet in his bedroom, while the other two remained in the living room. Once in the bedroom, Rajama locked the door and brought the victim to the toilet, where she threw up. Rajama cleaned up after her. He then realised the victim had become completely unconscious. He lifted her and placed her on his bed, where he molested and raped her. During the assault, the victim drifted in and out of consciousness and was aware of Rajama's movements. But she was unable to resist or move due to intoxication. Rajama stopped after some time as he felt guilty, court documents stated. He dressed the victim up and helped her to the toilet where she vomited again. He then left her there and rejoined the rest in the living room. Rajama's housemate went to the bedroom later as he wanted to use the toilet, and saw the victim lying on the toilet floor. He became angry and told off Rajama for disrespecting the victim and leaving her in such a condition. They laid the victim down on the bed. Rajama then confessed to his friend that he had sex with the victim as she was in a drunken state. They returned to the living room, where they continued drinking. Around 4am the next day, the victim left the apartment while supported by her friend. They took a private-hire car to his flat, where the victim told him what Rajama had done to her. When the victim returned home, she could not stop thinking about what had happened. She confided in her ex-boyfriend, and was coaxed into making a police report. Rajama was arrested at his apartment the next day, where five obscene films were found in his possession. The victim was assessed to suffer from mild psychological distress. She said she tried to struggle during the sexual assault, but was too weak to resist Rajama. Deputy Public Prosecutors Kavita Uthrapathy and Theong Li Han sought seven to 10 years' jail and six strokes of the cane. They highlighted the victim's vulnerability as she was young and severely intoxicated, but also acknowledged Rajama's young age at the time and his early plea of guilt. Defence counsel Nasser Ismail asked for a slightly shorter jail term of seven to nine years, citing his client's remorse and lack of premeditation. The punishment for rape is up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/salman-rushdie-ventilator-improving-new-york-stabbing-2880036,Salman Rushdie off ventilator and 'road to recovery has begun': Agent,"Salman Rushdie, the acclaimed author who was hospitalised on Friday (Aug 12) with serious injuries after being repeatedly stabbed at a public appearance in New York state, is off a ventilator and his condition is improving, his agent said on Sunday. ""He's off the ventilator, so the road to recovery has begun,"" his agent, Andrew Wylie, wrote in an email to Reuters. ""It will be long; the injuries are severe, but his condition is headed in the right direction.""  Rushdie, 75, was set to deliver a lecture on artistic freedom at Chautauqua Institution in western New York when police say a 24-year-old man rushed the stage and stabbed the Indian-born writer, who has lived with a bounty on his head since his 1988 novel The Satanic Verses prompted Iran to urge Muslims to kill him. The suspect, Hadi Matar of Fairview, New Jersey, pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted murder and assault at a court appearance on Saturday, his court-appointed lawyer, Nathaniel Barone, told Reuters. Following hours of surgery, Rushdie had been put on a ventilator and was unable to speak as of Friday evening, Wylie said in a prior update on the novelist's condition, adding that he was likely to lose an eye and had nerve damage in his arm and wounds to his liver. One of Rushdie's sons said his father was able to say a few words after getting off the ventilator. ""We are extremely relieved that yesterday he was taken off the ventilator and additional oxygen and was able to say a few words.  ""Though his life changing injuries are severe, his usual feisty & defiant sense of humour remains intact,"" Zafar Rushdie wrote on Twitter. Zafar also offered thanks to audience members who ""bravely leapt to his defence"" and for the ""outpouring of love and support from around the world"". The stabbing was condemned by writers and politicians around the world as an assault on freedom of expression. In a statement on Saturday, President Joe Biden commended the ""universal ideals"" of truth, courage and resilience embodied by Rushdie and his work. ""These are the building blocks of any free and open society,"" Biden said. Neither local nor federal authorities offered any additional details on the investigation on Saturday. Police said on Friday they had not established a motive for the attack. An initial law enforcement review of Matar's social media accounts showed he was sympathetic to Shi'ite extremism and Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), although no definitive links had been found, according to NBC New York. The IRGC is a powerful faction that controls a business empire as well as elite armed and intelligence forces that Washington accuses of carrying out a global extremist campaign. Authorities in Iran have made no public comment about the attack, although hardline state media outlets have celebrated it with headlines including ""Satan has been blinded"" and some Iranians voiced support online for the stabbing. Many other Iranians expressed their sympathies for Rushdie, however, posting on social media about their anger at the Islamic Republic's clerical rulers for issuing the 1989 fatwa, or religious edict, that told Muslims to kill the author. Rushdie, who was born into a Muslim Kashmiri family in Bombay, now Mumbai, before moving to Britain, has long faced death threats for The Satanic Verses, viewed by some Muslims as containing blasphemous passages. The book was banned in many countries with large Muslim populations. Iranian organisations, some linked to the government, have raised a bounty worth millions of dollars for Rushdie's murder. The fatwa was issued 33 years ago by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, then Iran's supreme leader. His successor, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said as recently as 2019 that the decree remained ""irrevocable"". Matar was born in California and recently moved to New Jersey, the NBC New York report said, adding that he had a fake driver's license on him. He was arrested at the scene by a state trooper after being wrestled to the ground by audience members. Witnesses said he did not speak as he attacked the author. Rushdie was stabbed 10 times, prosecutors said during Matar's arraignment, according to the New York Times. Prosecutors said in court that Matar travelled by bus to the Chautauqua Institution, an educational retreat about 19 km from the shores of Lake Erie, and bought a pass that admitted him to Rushdie's talk, the Times reported. Attendees said there were no obvious security checks. Asked to comment on the case, Matar's lawyer Barone said, ""We're kind of in the early stages and, quite frankly, in cases like this, I think the important thing to remember is people need to keep an open mind. They need to look at everything. They can't just assume something happened for why they think something happened."" Ali Tehfe, mayor of Yaroun in southern Lebanon, said Matar was the son of a man from the town. The suspect's parents emigrated to the United States and he was born and raised there, the mayor added. Asked whether Matar or his parents were affiliated with or supported the Iran-backed Hezbollah armed group in Lebanon, Tehfe said he had ""no information at all"" on their political views. A Hezbollah official told Reuters on Saturday that the group had no additional information on the attack on Rushdie."

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/tradenation-luxury-goods-scam-jb-hotel-couple-malaysia-2879596,"Tradenation luxury goods scam: Couple appeared calm when police approached, says JB hotel receptionist","JOHOR BAHRU: The couple at the centre of an alleged multi-million-dollar luxury goods scam in Singapore appeared calm when approached by police officers outside a budget hotel in Johor Bahru, said a receptionist who witnessed the incident.  Singaporean Pi Jiapeng, 26, and his wife, 27-year-old Thai national Siriwipa Pansuk, had been on the run for more than five weeks before they were approached by the authorities outside BookMe hotel along Jalan Bestari on Wednesday (Aug 10).  They have since been handed over to Singapore police and were charged in court on Friday.  Ms Sheila Rozy, one of the receptionists on duty at BookMe hotel on Wednesday, told CNA that the pair had approached the front desk after 10pm.  ""We told them our rooms were all full for the night, so they left the hotel and stood outside. They seemed calm and did not seem suspicious,"" said Ms Sheila.  ""While they were waiting outside, four or five men came and approached them. They were men in plain clothes who later identified themselves as police officers. ""They spoke to the couple for a few minutes. The couple looked calm and did not try to run away. They were then taken into a marked police car and left,"" said the receptionist.  Ms Sheila said that she and other members of staff on duty did not collect any identification documents from the couple as they had never checked in.  ""We never called the police as we had no inkling they were suspects,"" she added.  Ms Sheila also said that hotel staff were later informed by police that Pi and Pansuk were arrested due to their alleged involvement in the Tradenation luxury goods scam.  Rooms at BookMe cost between RM60 (S$18.50) and RM100 a night and the hotel is frequented by travellers from Singapore due to its proximity to shopping malls at Taman Bukit Indah, said Ms Sheila.   The budget hotel is also close to restaurants, massage parlours and convenience stores at Taman Nusa Bestari.  In response to queries from CNA on the arrest, Johor police declined to comment citing that the case was based on cooperation among police from Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand.  Last Wednesday, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) received information from the Royal Thai Police that the pair may be staying in a hotel in Johor Bahru, and sought assistance from the Royal Malaysia Police to locate them. Pi was first arrested in June on suspicion of cheating. His passport was impounded and he was released on bail. Pansuk also surrendered her passport to the police and was assisting with investigations. While some media reports said the total value of the undelivered luxury goods was S$32 million, CNA understands that victims who made police reports have not received products worth at least S$20 million as of Jul 17. The couple subsequently became uncontactable and fled Singapore via Tuas Checkpoint on Jul 4. They hid in the container compartment of a Malaysia-registered lorry. Two men charged with helping the couple flee Singapore - Malaysians Mohamad Fazli Abdul Rahman, 38, and Mohamed Alias, 40 - have said that they intend to plead guilty. After Pi and Pansuk fled, SPF issued a warrant of arrest for them and both were also listed on Interpol's red notice website. They were arrested and handed over to SPF at Woodlands Checkpoint on Thursday evening. Pi and Pansuk now face three charges, of which two are for conspiracy to cheat. They are accused of cheating customers of Tradenation between May 28, 2021 and Jun 27 this year by deceiving them into paying for luxury watches that they did not intend to deliver. They are also accused of cheating customers of Tradeluxury into buying luxury handbags between Jan 15 and Jun 27. The remaining charge is for illegally leaving Singapore via Tuas Checkpoint on Jul 4. They appeared in a district court via video link from remand. Pi was dressed in a green shirt, while Pansuk wore a black dress. When the judge asked if they had anything to say, Pi said it was ""not right"" for them to have fled the country. ""It's due to the pressure that we face during that point of time. Me and my wife are facing a lot of death threats and pressure,"" he said. ""It is our mistake to take that decision and we are really very sorry about the trouble."" The punishment for cheating is a jail term of up to 10 years and a fine. The penalty for leaving Singapore without presenting a passport is up to six months' jail and a fine of up to S$1,000."

A post-mortem examination concluded she had likely been smothered, with symmetrical bruises on her shoulders leading prosecutors to believe Fong Soong Hert had knelt on his wife as she died. One of the couple’s three sons read out a statement in court saying: “All of mum’s family are heartbroken and miss her every day.” He said he and his brothers are committed to supporting their father as best they can after telling the judge everyone who knew the couple “could see how they adored each other”. The defence team told the court Fong was “bewildered, devastated and broken”, and that he continues to have no real recollection of what happened in that room that night. Toby Hedworth QC said Fong is “living a nightmare from which he cannot wake”. On Aug 9, Fong pleaded guilty to the murder and told the Newcastle Crown Court in the north-east of England that he now accepts ""proper criminal liability"" for his actions on the night his wife died. During his sentencing on Friday, Judge Sloan noted that it was clear the defendant had been experiencing significant discomfort and was ""mentally and physically"" worn down, referencing a fall Fong had experienced while travelling in Scotland before Pek Ying Ling’s death. Fong was taken to hospital after falling from a steep embankment and prescribed a mix of strong painkillers. The judge said there was ""no premeditation"" in the attack and that Fong was a ""man of good character"". But, in his judgment, he added that he was sure that in the minutes Fong held a pillow over his wife's face, he had ""formed an intention to kill"". The judge handed Fong a life sentence, telling him he must serve a minimum of 12-and-a-half years in prison before he would be considered eligible for parole. Fong is expected to serve that time in a jail in the United Kingdom."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-insider/tech-support-scam-baiters-india-call-centre-big-money-2876366,When tech support is a scam: How India’s call-centre scams became big money,"GURUGRAM, India: After working “the whole night for five days”, Leo is off for a weekend getaway in Chandigarh city, in the foothills of the Himalayas. “It’s really to get out of the frustration and everything,” he says. “Your manager is shouting. Your owners are shouting. It’s all about making money doing this.” By “this”, he means a typical working day for scammers: Wearing headphones for 10 hours and “trying to manipulate somebody … trying to make bullshit stories sound like they really happened”. Leo (not his real name) is part of the underbelly of India’s call-centre industry, where scammers trick customers from places such as the United States and the United Kingdom into paying to resolve fake computer problems or issues related to their customer accounts in legitimate companies. There are vast returns to be reaped. Scammers can make enough for a month, or even a year, in a single night, says Leo. “I’m not kidding,” he tells the programme Undercover Asia. “If you talk about scope, as in how much money there is to be made, it’s way too big for you to understand it and me to explain it.” Tech support scams are an international problem, but India has emerged as a leader in the shady industry — to the extent that three call centres in Kolkata recently became the target of vigilante YouTube content creators seeking to give them a taste of their own medicine. In May, YouTubers Mark Rober, Jim Browning and Trilogy Media released videos that exposed the alleged individuals behind the call centres. The videos also showed the YouTubers’ team pranking the centres by unleashing glitter and stink bombs, cockroaches and rats on their premises. WATCH: India’s thriving scam industry: Before you call tech support (46:56) People who work to expose scammers are called scam baiters, and Browning told news site ThePrint.in that over 95 per cent of global scam calls originate from India. Citing his database of IP addresses, he said they originate specifically from in and around Kolkata and New Delhi. India’s tech support scam industry sprang from its boom in genuine outsourced call centres in the early 2000s, journalist Snigdha Poonam tells Undercover Asia. Poonam, who has reported on these scams, says the boom lasted for about 10 years before the market started to shift out of India. Then the scammers got busy. They started by “stealing the databases of genuine (customers) from these big tech companies that they’d worked at”, says Poonam. “And (they) started to set up these small centres where you already had that industry network.” Now in areas like Gurugram, also known as Gurgaon, it can be impossible to tell how much of a business is real and how much of it is a scam operation. “There’s a floor (on) which they’ll provide genuine tech support, but then they’ll have another set of people who, at a different location in the same office, are making these fake calls,” says Poonam. It is difficult to determine exactly how much is lost to tech support fraud. But losses reported to the US’ Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI’s) Internet Crime Complaint Centre hit US$347.66 million (S$476.33 million) last year, more than double the losses in 2020. In total, US$6.9 billion was reported lost to Internet scams last year, according to the bureau’s Internet Crime Report 2021. In Singapore, millions have been lost too. Explaining one version of a tech support scam, Leo cites a “customer” searching online for help with a malfunctioning printer who comes across an advertisement that looks like the original manufacturer’s website. The victim would see a toll-free number to call and end up speaking with the scammers. He may have his computer taken over remotely by the scammers and ultimately lose money through unauthorised access to his personal or financial information. A pop-up could also appear on victims’ computer screens, resembling an error message from the computers’ operating system or antivirus software, according to the US’ Federal Trade Commission. The pop-up could warn of a security issue and give users a (scam) number to call for help. Scammers may also impersonate customer support staff of organisations such as banks, utilities and virtual currency exchanges, stated the FBI report. “Whether we like it or not, scams are an outcome of entrepreneurship,” says computer programmer and investigative journalist Samarth Bansal, who has reported on the scamming industry. Be it from a love scam, job scam or e-commerce scam, digital technology is the “fundamental infrastructure” that has enabled scammers to build trust with their victims before extracting money, he notes. “A lot of tech is becoming increasingly frictionless,” he observes. “We’re building systems to make it easier for users to transact, to give them a better user experience, but that’s also being exploited by scammers.” With greater access to high-speed mobile internet in India in recent years, scammers have also turned their sights on the domestic market. Targeting their countrymen is somewhat easier than targeting the overseas market because it does not require knowledge of English or even a call-centre set-up, only a smartphone. Mangal Rathi, who owns a small upholstery business, recounts how he lost about 25,000 rupees (S$430) to a scammer by unknowingly calling a fake customer care hotline when he did not receive a mobile payment from a customer. Rathi called the scammer back and was apparently told “the police can’t touch him”. “The police say that I can forget about getting my money back,” laments Rathi. “What am I supposed to do now?” It is the lack of consequences for scammers that angers scam baiters and recipients of scam calls. Bansal and Poonam were part of a team who exposed an international tech scam based in Gurugram in 2017. The story ran in the Hindustan Times, a major newspaper, and Bansal expected it to result in multiple arrests. But “nothing really happened”, he says. “All I got … was a thumbs-up emoticon on WhatsApp (from a police officer) but nothing more.” Five years on, scam baiters such as Sven (not his real name) continue trying to expose scammers and bring them to the authorities’ attention. Sven showed Undercover Asia how he gathered evidence against a Gurugram-based scam call centre that was targeting US citizens. He identified its mastermind and roped in a contact in the US to find out the number of complaints — 93 — lodged with the US’ Federal Trade Commission against the scamming company. He even risked getting into trouble by gaining access to the company’s computer systems to gather proof. But the police left him disappointed when, according to him, they said it “it wasn’t under their jurisdiction”. The lack of enforcement was also a cause for angst among Undercover Asia viewers, who noted that scammers hurt more than their victims. They also affect Indians seeking to work in legitimate tech companies, said YouTube viewer Virginia. She has seen managers for customer support roles being less willing to hire Indians because some end users “refuse to work with anyone who has an Indian accent and demand to speak with someone who doesn’t, or the support calls will drag on much longer because people are afraid of being scammed”. Some viewers lauded the scam baiters while others shared their tactics for dealing with scam calls. Although the police conduct raids and may disrupt scam operations, proving that scammers cheated people abroad can be difficult, notes Poonam. “They start hunting through their routers and their computers and their servers, but what are they going to find?” she questions. The police may uncover the names of supposed victims overseas and “the exact amount in pounds or euros or dollars that (scammers) would charge … them, but that’s not proof of anything”, she says. Industry insiders agree it is difficult for the authorities to stop them for good. While some scammers feel bad enough about cheating victims — many of whom are senior citizens —that they quit, there are others who do not believe their actions constitute stealing. “If I convinced (the person to) take out the money from (her) bank and deposit it in some other account, then … I’m extremely talented,” says a former scammer who earned enough to splurge more than 85,000 rupees on her 20th birthday. As for Leo, he has reinvented his role after seven years in the business: He now helps others who want to set up a scamming operation. “If somebody has money (and) wants to get into this business, I help him out from the A to Z of it,” he says. He helps them secure a place to operate, get hold of servers, hire staff to handle calls, and set up ways to ensure victims’ monies are channeled back to them, including via cryptocurrency. He tells his clients they can recoup their “investments” in two months. But in truth, it could be as quick as 15 days. “You can shut down an office. It’s possible; it does happen a lot,” says Leo. But “you can never shut down a business”, he declares. Watch this episode of Undercover Asia here."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/fong-soong-hert-murder-wife-newscastle-life-sentence-holiday-uk-2876421,Singaporean man given life sentence for murdering his wife while on holiday in the UK,"LONDON: A Singaporean man was on Friday (Aug 12) sentenced to life imprisonment for murdering his wife in Newscastle while on holiday in the United Kingdom.  Fong Soong Hert, also known as Alan Fong, must serve 12-and-a-half years in prison before being considered for parole. The minimum sentence in the UK for murder is life imprisonment. When the trial began on Aug 1, Fong's legal team argued that he should be found guilty of the manslaughter of his wife Pek Ying Ling, known as Evelyn Pek, on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The 51-year-old changed his plea to guilty of murder on Tuesday, telling the Newcastle Crown Court that he accepts “proper criminal liability” for his actions. Fong's wife was found dead at the County Aparthotel in Newcastle on Dec 6, 2021.  During the trial, the court heard that Fong and his wife were in the UK on holiday following a trip to Dubai and Europe.  They had planned to tour Scotland, but Fong suffered a bad fall while in the Isle of Skye. He tripped, lost his step and fell down a steep embankment. Fong was given a mix of painkillers by paramedics before being taken to hospital to be examined. Days later, the couple travelled to Newcastle with their son Alonzo Fong and checked into the hotel. The court heard a recording of a call from Alonzo to emergency services at about 7am on Dec 6. He was heard saying: “Okay, he told me, I think they had some argument of some sort and then I think he lost it.” During the trial, a pathologist who carried out the post-mortem told the court that 11 bruises and haemorrhages were visible on the victim’s chin, shoulders, arms and legs. Fong, who took to the stand on Monday, described his marriage as “wonderful” and “peaceful”. He claimed he could not remember any details of killing his wife. The couple’s three sons were in the public gallery when their father admitted to the charges on Tuesday. In a joint statement, they said: “We are heartbroken after losing our Mum, but now we just want to provide our Dad with the support he needs.” After the sentence, Newcastle's Northumbria Police said: ""All our thoughts remain with the couple’s three sons who have been left devastated beyond belief by the events of Dec 6 last year. ""Once again we want to publicly thank them for their composure and the dignity they have shown in the face of such tragedy. ""We will continue to support them in any way we can and we ask that everyone respects their privacy at this extremely difficult time."""

A High Court judge dismissed the appeal by Maslinda Zainal against her conviction and upheld her sentence of one-and-a-half years' jail. Maslinda, 47, was found guilty of two counts of criminal breach of trust as a public servant last year, after rounds of court hearings where all 20 teachers in the English department testified. She was in charge of collecting money that students submitted to their teachers for learning packages, but over-collected about S$40,000 between January 2016 and April 2017. The school's lower-secondary head for English discovered the offences when she checked the amounts collected against the bookshop invoices and found discrepancies. Maslinda admitted in police statements that she found it troublesome to return the surplus to students, and said that she used it to buy stationery and other items for them. She later testified that the police pressed her to confess. But Justice Chua Lee Ming found no reason to disagree with the trial judge's finding that she gave the statements voluntarily.  In the appeal, Maslinda challenged the amount of student funds that she was found guilty of taking. Justice Chua rejected her arguments, saying that the trial judge's findings ""cannot be said to be plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence, save for a small reduction of S$12"". He said that the amount collected from the students was proven through their book lists, class lists and evidence from teachers, while the amount paid for the learning packages was evidenced by the bookshop invoices. But he allowed a reduction of S$12 from the amount collected based on the evidence of a teacher who collected the money from the students. Justice Chua also rejected Maslinda's argument that she was ""just negligent, not dishonest"", instead agreeing with the trial judge that she had dishonest intentions. He upheld the trial judge's finding that Maslinda spent only some of the surplus funds on items for students, and that she used the rest for her personal expenses. ""In using the surplus to purchase stationeries and assessment books, the appellant had also acted dishonestly and did not act in good faith,"" he said. Justice Chua also disagreed with Maslinda's assertion that the trial judge and prosecutor interfered in an egregious way during her defence lawyer's cross-examination of prosecution witnesses. He agreed with the trial judge on the aggravating factors. This included betraying the trust she held as Head of Department and harming public confidence in the teaching service. ""Her submissions included blaming the school for not having implemented a better system for the collection of the monies from the students; this demonstrated a lack of remorse,"" he added. Maslinda will start serving her sentence in two weeks, after being granted time to find a substitute for some classes she was teaching. In response to CNA queries, the Ministry of Education said Maslinda has been suspended from duty since 2017, and that it will follow up with disciplinary proceedings after the court case. ""MOE takes a serious view of staff misconduct and will take disciplinary action against those who fail to adhere to our standards of conduct and discipline, including dismissal from service,"" said the ministry. For criminal breach of trust as a public servant, she could have been jailed for up to 20 years and fined for each charge."

Pi and Pansuk are accused of cheating customers of Tradenation between May 28, 2021 and Jun 27 this year by deceiving them into paying for luxury watches that they did not intend to deliver. They are also accused of cheating customers of Tradeluxury into buying luxury handbags between Jan 15 and Jun 27. The remaining charge is for illegally leaving Singapore via Tuas Checkpoint on Jul 4. The pair appeared in a district court via video link from remand. Pi was dressed in a green shirt, while Pansuk wore a black dress. When the judge asked if they had anything to say, Pi said it was ""not right"" for them to have fled the country. ""It's due to the pressure that we face during that point of time. Me and my wife are facing a lot of death threats and pressure,"" he said. ""It is our mistake to take that decision and we are really very sorry about the trouble."" He added that they would ""do our best"" to work with the police in their investigations. Through a Thai interpreter, Pansuk said: ""I know that I have done something wrong. I will cooperate with the police officers for the investigation."" Deputy Public Prosecutor David Koh described the two cheating charges as ""holding charges"", adding that investigations were still at an early stage. This is because the couple absconded, and because time was needed to investigate the more than 180 police reports made, he said. The judge granted the prosecution's request for the pair not to be offered bail as they were ""proven"" flight risks, and to be remanded for further investigations. They will return to court next week. Pi and Pansuk are both currently unrepresented. At least three scam victims turned up at the State Courts to attend the hearing. One victim said it was a ""relief"" that the couple has been charged, but another said there is still the question of where their money is. Both men did not want to be identified. While some media reports said the total value of the undelivered luxury goods was S$32 million, CNA understands that victims who made police reports have not received products worth at least S$20 million as of Jul 17. Pi was first arrested in June on suspicion of cheating. His passport was impounded and he was released on bail. Pansuk also surrendered her passport to the police and was assisting with investigations. The couple subsequently became uncontactable and fled Singapore via Tuas Checkpoint on Jul 4. They hid in the container compartment of a Malaysia-registered lorry. Two men charged with helping the couple flee Singapore - Malaysians Mohamad Fazli Abdul Rahman, 38, and Mohamed Alias, 40 - have said that they intend to plead guilty. After Pi and Pansuk fled, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) issued a warrant of arrest for them and both were also listed on Interpol's red notice website. On Wednesday, SPF received information from the Royal Thai Police that the pair may be staying in a hotel in Johor Bahru, and sought assistance from the Royal Malaysia Police to locate them. Pi and Pansuk were arrested and handed over to SPF at Woodlands Checkpoint on Thursday evening. The punishment for cheating is a jail term of up to 10 years and a fine. The penalty for leaving Singapore without presenting a passport is up to six months' jail and a fine of up to S$1,000."

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tree-roots-damage-nature-environment-yio-chu-kang-road-2874131,Construction firm fined for damaging 28 roadside trees in Yio Chu Kang,"SINGAPORE: Twenty-eight trees along Yio Chu Kang Road were damaged after a construction firm carried out unauthorised excavation works in 2020. Chc Construction was on Thursday (Aug 11) fined S$13,000 after earlier pleading guilty to three charges under the Parks and Trees Regulations. Three more charges were considered for sentencing. The damaged trees comprised 25 rain trees and three angsana trees. Three of the rain trees had to be removed for safety reasons due to extensive root damage. Crown reduction was done for the 25 trees that remained standing. Chc Construction was engaged by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to replace railings at the centre median of Yio Chu Kang Road. The trees were planted at the green verge in the centre median. All of them had been marked for retention before the works started. Around Sep 18, 2020, the National Parks Board (NParks) discovered that the trees were damaged. It issued a stop-work order to LTA on Sep 24, 2020. Investigations by NParks revealed that the trees, which had girths of 0.5m to 3.2m, suffered damage to their roots and that some roots were severed. Chc Construction admitted that it failed to inform NParks or LTA about the damage caused to the trees. It also admitted to carrying out the street works without seeking approval from the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation. The penalty for this offence is a fine of up to S$30,000. The punishment for knowingly carrying out an activity that may damage trees in a public park is a fine of up to S$5,000."

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/murder-9-month-old-baby-mohamed-aliff-head-injury-van-floorboard-2873556,Man gets life imprisonment for murdering girlfriend's 9-month-old son,"SINGAPORE: A 29-year-old man was given life imprisonment with 15 strokes of the cane on Thursday (Aug 11) for murdering his girlfriend's nine-month-old son in a van in Yishun. Mohamed Aliff Mohamed Yusoff was sentenced after a High Court judge convicted him in July of murder. Justice Mavis Chionh said that the death penalty was not warranted in this case, and noted that the prosecution did not seek it. The victim, Izz Fayyaz Zayani Ahmad, died of traumatic intracranial haemorrhage caused by blunt force trauma. On Nov 7, 2019, Aliff, Izz and Izz's mother Nadiah Abdul Jalil went out for dinner, during which the couple had a disagreement over how to discipline the baby for spilling a drink. After dinner, Aliff volunteered to take care of Izz for the night and Ms Nadiah agreed. Aliff then drove Izz to a multi-storey car park at Yishun Street 81. The prosecution's case was that Aliff inflicted blunt force trauma to Izz by pushing his head against the van's wooden floorboard at least twice between 10pm and 12.15am that night. Aliff's defence was that the victim’s death was an accident. He claimed that Izz ""fidgeted and fell"" from his right arm while he was trying to close the van's door and holding things in his left hand. He claimed that the baby hit the floorboard of the van's rear cabin headfirst, bounced and hit his head again on the edge near the van's floor, then fell to the ground. Justice Chionh said that the courts had found the death penalty was appropriate when an offender acted in a way that showed viciousness or disregard for human life. She found that Izz's death was not such a case. On top of life imprisonment, the prosecution asked for 15 to 18 strokes of the cane. The defence sought five to six strokes of the cane, but the judge said this was manifestly inadequate. Justice Chionh previously ruled that the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt. She found that the version of events in which Aliff pushed the baby’s head against the floorboard was consistent with the autopsy findings, citing expert evidence. In contrast, the version in which Izz fidgeted and fell was not supported by the autopsy findings and medical opinion, said the judge. Aliff's conduct after the incident was also ""strikingly consistent with the behaviour of someone labouring under the guilty knowledge that Izz had died by his hand and fearful of being found out"", she said. ""It was not the behaviour of someone who was anxious to get Izz's injuries treated after seeing Izz hurt himself in an accidental fall,” she added. After the incident, Aliff spoke to Ms Nadiah on the phone near midnight on Nov 8, 2019 and drove to meet her in Jurong East. When Ms Nadiah saw her son lying on his back in the van's rear cabin, she picked him up and placed him in a baby carrier that she wore. Aliff told her that if anyone asked what happened, she should say that Izz fidgeted and fell, and that Aliff did not call the hospital because he had called her. He also told her to say that the victim’s body was still warm when she met him, and that they went to the hospital after he turned cold. Aliff eventually drove to the National University Hospital, where the victim was pronounced dead at 4.30am on Nov 8, 2019. Ms Nadiah testified that Aliff suggested they pay someone to bury Izz and report him as missing a year later. She refused and insisted that her son should be given a proper burial. She also described how Aliff delayed bringing them to the emergency department. After reaching the hospital, he took time to brush his teeth, wipe his body and dispose of his mobile phone. Closed-circuit television footage from the hospital showed that Aliff took 36 minutes to bring Ms Nadiah and her son from the car park to the emergency department. Justice Chionh said she believed Ms Nadiah's evidence, whereas Aliff was a ""glib and disingenuous witness"" who gave multiple differing versions of events that night. In his police statements, Aliff shifted between admitting to pushing the baby's head against the floorboard and claiming that the victim accidentally fell. The judge said Aliff's account of events was ""riddled with inconsistencies"" and ""flatly contradicted"" by medical evidence and other evidence. ""The head is a vulnerable part of the body, especially when one considers that the force in question was being applied by the accused, a full-grown adult man, to a nine-month-old child measuring only 71cm in height and weighing only 7.3kg at the time of death,"" said Justice Chionh. ""In the circumstances, the only logical inference to be drawn from the accused's actions was that he intended to cause head injuries to Izz when he pushed Izz's head against the floorboard of the van."" In sentencing, defence lawyer Kanagavijayan Nadarajan argued that Aliff had a ""good relationship"" with Izz during the two months of dating the baby's mother. The lawyer said Aliff had volunteered to take care of the baby as he knew Ms Nadiah would be working the next day. But Justice Chionh said this could not be a mitigating factor, as Aliff went on to violate Ms Nadiah's trust by inflicting physical violence on Izz and causing his death. The judge also noted that Aliff's behaviour after Izz's death showed a disturbing lack of remorse. She added that the courts took a tough stance towards offenders who cause the death of defenceless young victims through violence. Among vulnerable victims, young victims were notable as the ""gross physical disparity"" with offenders often meant they could not protect themselves, she said. Aliff's sentence was backdated to Nov 8, 2019, the day he was arrested. Under the Prisons Act, after an offender has served 20 years of a life sentence, a review must be conducted and there is a possibility of reduction in the sentence. The offence of murder under Section 300C of the Penal Code is punishable with death or life imprisonment with caning."

He cannot be named as the identity of his victims is protected by gag order. The court heard that on Jun 9, 2020, the man slapped and punched his sister when she visited their mother at home. The offender was drinking heavily at the time. The victim was talking to another sibling about selling their mother's house when the offender started scolding and questioning her. When she refused to answer him, he slapped her. He also pushed her, causing the back of her head to hit the wall. The man got angrier when his sister continued not to reply. He slapped her, punched her face repeatedly and strangled her. She started to drift in and out of consciousness due to the severity of the blows. When she regained consciousness, her brother told her to perform a sex act on him. She struggled but was overpowered.  He then squeezed his sister's chest and pulled her shirt, exposing her. He told her ""he could sleep with her or bring her to Geylang to sell her body"", court documents stated. The man threatened to assault anyone who tried to intervene and told his family not to call the police. At around 10pm, about three hours after the victim first arrived at the house, one of their siblings managed to leave the house and call emergency services. The victim was taken to the hospital, where she was found to have a nasal fracture, blunt trauma to her eye and a contusion at her chest. The man also admitted to assaulting his wife on three occasions in May 2021. In one incident, the offender's wife was using her phone when he accused her of hiding something from him. He hurled vulgarities, punched and kicked her face multiple times and pulled her hair and shirt. A friend who was with them called the police. Although the victim had a cut on her lip, she refused medical attention as she was worried that her husband would assault her again if she pursued the matter. Later that month, the couple got into a dispute in the wife's flat. The man hit her head multiple times with a hard glass bottle of deodorant, causing her to bleed. He also hit her arms and legs many times with an object that was stated in court documents as ""black cylindrical equipment"". The victim did not tell anyone about the assault as she was afraid of her husband.  Two days later, the man went to his mother's flat where he started assaulting his wife again. He punched her eye, hit her head multiple times and threw hard objects at her. The victim made a police report the next day and sought medical assistance for her injuries. At the time of these assaults, the man's wife had a personal protection order in force against him. The man pleaded guilty to one charge each of outrage of modesty, voluntarily causing grievous hurt, causing hurt with a dangerous weapon and disorderly behaviour. He also admitted to two charges of breaching a personal protection order that his wife took out against him in 2018. Eleven other charges were considered for sentencing."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/indonesia-police-general-murder-bodyguard-ferdy-sambo-nofriansyah-yosua-hutabarat-2871466,Indonesian police general charged with premeditated murder of bodyguard,"JAKARTA: The Indonesian National Police has charged two-star general Ferdy Sambo with premeditated murder, after his bodyguard died at the general’s house last month of multiple gunshot wounds. National Police Chief General Listyo Sigit Prabowo and six other police generals held a press conference on Tuesday night (Aug 9) to update the public regarding the case.  Earlier, Mr Sambo was suspended from his position as chief of internal affairs. “The special task force (for the case) has named FS as a suspect,” Mr Prabowo said, referring to Mr Sambo by his initials.  Mr Prabowo added that Mr Sambo and three of his subordinates have been charged with premeditated murder.  He said there is evidence that Mr Sambo ordered his subordinates to shoot and kill Mr Nofriansyah Yosua Hutabarat, 27. Besides multiple gunshot wounds, the latter was also found with bruises and cuts on his body. Speaking at the same press conference on Tuesday, head of the criminal investigation agency Commissioner General Agus Andrianto said that the four suspects could face the death penalty.   ""The maximum is the death penalty, life imprisonment, or a maximum imprisonment of 20 years,"" said Mr Andrianto. The unusual death of Mr Hutabarat at the home of his superior has gripped the nation. Mr Hutabarat, a police sergeant assigned to guard Mr Sambo’s family, died on Jul 8 but police only disclosed the incident on Jul 11. The police initially said that Mr Hutabarat was killed by another police officer in a shootout at Mr Sambo’s home as he had tried to sexually assault Mr Sambo’s wife. But Mr Prabowo said during the Tuesday press conference that there was no shootout and that Mr Sambo had created the scenario to cover up the murder. The police are still establishing Mr Sambo’s motive for the murder, he added. After the press conference, Coordinating Minister for Politics, Legal and Security Affairs, Mahfud MD said on Tuesday night that the case is “a bit special”.  He said that for now, the police have managed to establish that the main suspect is Mr Sambo.  “Related to the motive, the investigators will reveal it later because it is currently being investigated.  ""The motives may also be too sensitive (to be mentioned publicly),” said the minister. Earlier on Tuesday, President Joko Widodo reiterated that the police must solve the case.  “Don’t cover anything. Tell the truth,” he said.  ""Don't let the public reduce their trust in the police."""

When the trial began last Monday, Mr Fong’s team had argued that he should be found guilty of the manslaughter of Pek Ying Ling, known as Evelyn Pek, on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Ms Pek was found dead at the County Aparthotel on Dec 6, 2021. On Tuesday, after a delay to the start of proceedings, Judge Paul Sloan QC asked the 51-year-old defendant to stand, and the clerk read out the charges, to which Mr Fong responded: “Guilty.” He is due to be sentenced on Friday - the minimum sentence for murder is life imprisonment. The couple’s three sons sat at the back of the public gallery as their father admitted to the charges. In a joint statement, they said: “We are heartbroken after losing our Mum, but now we just want to provide our Dad with the support he needs.” Detective Chief Inspector Matt Steel, the senior investigating officer, called the case “incredibly tragic”. He commended the couple’s sons’ “composure and their engagement with the police throughout this extremely difficult period in their lives”. He added: “We will support them in any way we can as they continue to navigate their grief and process what has happened. “We would ask that everyone respects their privacy at this extremely difficult time. We want to be clear that we will absolutely not tolerate domestic abuse or violence in any form. “When incidents of this nature do occur we are committed to bringing those responsible to justice.” Mr Fong’s guilty plea comes five days into the trial. Court proceedings were postponed last Thursday and Friday due to a lawyer's illness.  Acting on behalf of the prosecution, Peter Makepeace QC told the court last week that Mr Fong and Ms Pek were in the UK following a trip to Dubai and Europe. They had planned to tour Scotland, but while on the Isle of Skye, a small island off the Scottish coast, Mr Fong experienced a bad fall. On a walk one evening, he tripped, lost his step in the dark and fell down a steep embankment. The court heard that an ambulance was called, and Mr Fong was given a mix of painkillers by paramedics before being taken to hospital to be examined. Days later, the couple travelled down to Newcastle with their son Alonzo Fong and checked into the Country Aparthotel on Westgate Road. The court played a recording of the call Alonzo made to the emergency services soon after 7am on Dec 6. He’s heard saying: “Okay, he told me, I think they had some argument of some sort and then I think he lost it. "" The court also heard from Dr Jennifer Bolton who carried out the post-mortem of Ms Pek’s body. The mother-of-three had been wearing black leggings, a black top and black underwear, stained with urine, when she was found. The forensic pathologist said 11 bruises and haemorrhages were visible on Ms Pek’s chin, shoulders, arms and legs. Two large, symmetrical bruises were identified on each shoulder, which Dr Bolton said she believed were likely to have been caused at the same time. She added: “That then raises the possibility of her being knelt on while the pillow was then held over her face.” Mr Fong took the stand himself on Monday, describing his marriage as “wonderful”, “peaceful” and “very happy”. When questioned by the prosecution, the defendant claimed he could not remember any details of killing his wife. He replied “I don’t know” or “I cannot remember” to most questions put to him."

Fong Soong Hert, referred to as Alan Fong, is on trial for murder at Newcastle Crown Court, in the north-east of England.  His wife Pek Ying Ling, known as Evelyn Pek, was found dead in a hotel room in Newcastle, on Dec 6, 2021. The 51-year-old denies the charges and took the stand for the first time on Monday, a week into the trial.  Proceedings were postponed a few days earlier - on Thursday and Friday - because a lawyer was unwell.  As he was questioned by defence barrister Steven Reed QC, Mr Fong described his 28-year marriage as “wonderful, peaceful” and “very happy”. On his relationship with his three sons, who have been watching the trial from the public gallery, the defendant called himself a “doting dad”. Before travelling to Newcastle, Mr Fong had been touring Scotland with Ms Pek when he tripped over a pipe in the dark and fell down a 15m embankment. He was taken to hospital and prescribed a mix of strong painkillers, including codeine and morphine. In his evidence, the defendant said a doctor told him that he was “very fortunate he didn’t suffer fatal or serious injuries”.  But he recalled being in severe pain, telling the jury: “l just felt like my whole body is breaking up.” “I felt like a walking corpse”, he later added. The court heard that the couple attended a Newcastle United football game at St James’ Park stadium, but Mr Fong said he struggled to walk back to the hotel afterwards. He confirmed his wife was responsible for giving him his medication, saying: “She looks after me very well.” The jury heard that Ms Pek also suggested her husband take the antidepressants and anti-anxiety tablets he had been prescribed back in Singapore to help calm him down. During his cross-examination, the prosecution questioned why Mr Fong did not immediately call the emergency services when he realised his wife was dead. He was also asked why he did not scream for help. Peter Makepeace QC said: “Your wife might have been savable. So what did you do to try and save her? “Not a single thing, did you Mr Fong?” “What you did was sit and turn your phone on and off nine times. We know that you did, the evidence shows it.” To each point, Mr Fong responded and said he could not remember. The prosecution then added: “All this ‘I can’t recall’ only surfaces after you were released from police custody ... and after you’ve had time to speak to your own lawyers. The defence is expected to call on experts on Tuesday before the jury gives its verdict."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/funeral-director-credit-card-unauthorised-payment-2867006,"Funeral director gets jail for unauthorised credit card charges of S$356,000, attempted witness tampering","SINGAPORE: A funeral director was sentenced to four years and three months' jail on Monday (Aug 8) for making unauthorised credit card charges worth more than S$356,000. As authorities closed in on Casper Ang, 34, he also tried to interfere with investigations by getting a police officer to pass information to a witness. He pleaded guilty to 11 charges of unauthorised access to computer material, cheating, forgery, transferring criminal proceeds, attempting to obstruct justice, managing companies while bankrupt and making a false police report. The prosecution called Ang, also known as Hong Weiliang, a ""varied and persistent offender"". Another 17 charges against him were considered for sentencing.  Ang operated Singapore Funeral Supplies during the offences. He also managed Ang Brothers Funeral Services from 2019 to 2020 and medical supplier CT Care from March to May 2020, while bankrupt. The court heard that Ang made the credit card transactions on a payment terminal that was issued to Singapore Funeral Supplies by the company First Data. The terminal could process payments without a physical card. Between August and December 2018, Ang received credit card details - minimally, the card number and expiry date - from four suspected accomplices. These were Paul Wee Lian Heng, 67, and three individuals operating online as ""TorCat"", ""Federation Russia"" or ""FiRuC"", and ""Libean"". Wee has been charged and will to return to court for a pre-trial conference in August. The other individuals have not been identified. Ang did not know their identities but believed them to be Russian. Ang met Wee around August 2018, and was subsequently contacted by the other individuals over Telegram. Using details provided by his four partners, Ang tried to process 452 credit card transactions, of which 114 transactions valued at more than S$356,000 were approved. The value of the remaining declined transactions was estimated at about S$1.4 million. All the affected cardholders are believed to be foreign. Ang knew it was likely that the card details were obtained illegitimately but did not verify with the cardholders that the transactions were authorised, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Ryan Lim. He earned at least S$100,000 from his involvement in the scheme by keeping some of the proceeds from the successful transactions. First Data suffered a loss of more than S$275,000 after receiving requests for chargebacks, or reversals of payment, which it refunded to the cardholders. The offences were discovered after First Data received many complaints from cardholders To benefit from the scheme, Ang needed to withdraw the money from Singapore Funeral Supplies' bank account. Around October 2018, Ang's wife and sister-in-law took away his access to the company's finances as they were concerned about its debt Ang's sister-in-law took over the company's chequebook and required Ang to provide copies of supplier invoices before she would release a blank cheque to him. From October to December 2018, Ang therefore provided false invoices to obtain 13 blank cheques from his sister-in-law. He used them to withdraw more than S$265,000 from the company's bank account, which came from the successful transactions. He also admitted to passing criminal proceeds to Wee by cash or bank transfer, and to people acting on behalf of TorCat, FiRuC and Libean, usually by meeting them in Ang Mo Kio. After Ang's arrest in April 2019, he lied to investigators that his accomplice was a man who had since died. He did this to frustrate investigations and shift the blame away from himself. In fact, Ang had previously handled the funeral of the man he named, and they did not actually know each other. Ang gave investigators the phone number of a witness he said could verify that he and this man were acquainted. While Ang was remanded for investigations on or around Apr 21, 2019, he met Quak Tiong Beng, then a staff sergeant who had been with the police since 1999. Quak, 42, recognised Ang as he followed Ang on social media and had previously met him when he was in remand for another matter in May 2017. They spoke, and Ang informed Quak that he was under investigation. When Quak walked past Ang's cell two days later, Ang asked if he could help him make a phone call to the witness. He asked Quak to tell the witness that if an officer showed him a photo, he should say that he had seen the person before but could not confirm who he was. Quak helped Ang to call the witness. Unknown to both men, the witness was being interviewed by the investigation officer when the call went through. The witness picked up the call in front of the officer and listened to it on speaker mode as Quak conveyed the instructions. Quak was then investigated. He pleaded guilty to helping Ang pervert the course of justice and was sentenced to five months' jail in June last year. The prosecution asked for four years and 11 months' jail, arguing that Ang's offences undermined the financial infrastructure and integrity of police investigations. Defence counsel Amarick Gill asked for a shorter jail sentence, contending that the sentence should not be calculated solely on the basis of the high amounts of money involved. Ang has appealed against his sentence, which is stayed pending the outcome."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/geylang-coffee-shop-slash-knife-arrogant-rude-sleeping-pills-2866741,Jail for man who slashed sleeping pills seller at Geylang coffee shop,"SINGAPORE: A man has been jailed for half a year for slashing another man at a Geylang coffee shop after an argument. Lee Han Leng, 45, pleaded guilty on Monday (Aug 8) to one charge of voluntarily causing hurt with a dangerous weapon. The incident took place at Hin Sheng Coffee House at 346 Geylang Road on Jun 1 this year, with Lee fleeing the scene after. Officers who responded to calls about the attack tracked Lee down through police camera footage and witness interviews. The court heard that on Apr 21, more than a month before the attack, Lee went to an area near the coffee shop to buy sleeping pills from the victim. Lee placed S$15 on the table but the victim, 21-year-old Koh Hee Yang, told him that the pills cost S$17. Lee paid the remaining S$2. ""The victim felt that the manner in which (Lee) threw the S$2 on the table was rude,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutor Teo Lu Jia. Both men argued and got into a scuffle. Lee remained angry with Mr Koh and bought his sleeping pills from other sellers after that. On Jun 1, Lee was at home when he felt frustrated about his argument with Mr Koh and decided to take revenge. He took a knife with a blade of about 8cm to 10cm with him, left his house and boarded a bus to the coffee shop. Lee arrived at about 4.40pm and saw Mr Koh seated with three friends. ""When (Lee) saw the victim, he felt even more angry, as he felt that the victim was seated in an arrogant manner,"" said Ms Teo. He took the knife from his bag, went up to Mr Koh and without saying anything, suddenly started slashing wildly at his head and neck. The victim used his hands to block the blows while retreating from Lee, and his friends also helped to pull him away from his assailant. After slashing the victim, Lee ran away from the scene. The victim was taken to the hospital by paramedics. Mr Koh suffered lacerations on his scalp, neck and hand, which required stitches, and decreased feeling in his thumb. He was given painkillers and three days' medical leave. He racked up a medical bill of about S$156, for which Lee was also ordered to compensate him. Police officers established that Lee had gone home after the attack. When the authorities went to his place, Lee initially refused to surrender but eventually unlocked the gate. According to an Institute of Mental Health report, Lee was found to have a substance use disorder, but this did not cause or contribute to the offence. The prosecutor argued for five-and-a-half months to six-and-a-half months' jail for Lee, who did not have a lawyer. Ms Teo highlighted that the attack was unprovoked, happened in a public place causing alarm to others, and that Lee fled the scene. She also said that Lee previously committed a similar offence in 2015, after getting into a dispute with someone about whether he had any drugs. Lee could have been jailed for up to seven years, fined, caned or any combination of these punishments for the offence."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/father-rape-14-year-old-daughter-wife-cancer-treatment-2866416,Man jailed for raping 14-year-old daughter while wife received cancer treatment,"SINGAPORE: A man who raped his 14-year-old daughter continued to do so after his wife had to undergo treatment for cancer. The 44-year-old man was on Monday (Aug 8) sentenced to 24 years' jail and the statutory maximum of 24 strokes of the cane. The victim's identity is protected by gag order, and the offender cannot be named as he is her biological father. He pleaded guilty to three counts of rape. Another eight counts of rape, molestation and sexual assault by penetration were considered for sentencing. The court heard that the man first sexually abused his daughter in May 2019, and this continued for several months. In October 2019, while the rest of the family was asleep, the man entered the victim's bedroom and sexually assaulted the girl before raping her. The victim pretended to be asleep throughout the ordeal, while her sister slept on the mattress next to her. The man committed the offence on another night in November 2019, and again in the early hours of Dec 2, 2019. Each time, the victim pretended to be asleep.  On that last occasion, the girl's mother entered her daughters' bedroom sometime after the assault. She saw her husband kneeling next to the girl's bed naked from the waist down and hit him, asking how he could do such a thing. The victim started crying, and so did her sister who awoke from the commotion. The man apologised to his wife and left the bedroom. The girl did not report the assaults as she saw that her family was financially dependent on her father after her mother started receiving cancer treatment. She did not want to upset or worry her mother during her treatment, said Deputy Public Prosecutors Shen Wanqin and Benjamin Samynathan. She was also afraid of her father and thought that he would be stronger than her if she tried to resist him, said the prosecutors. After that incident, the victim's mother changed her children's sleeping arrangements by moving the victim and her sister to the same bedroom as their other siblings. The sexual abuse stopped. In 2020, the victim's mother was admitted to hospital. That same night, the man entered his children's bedroom and sat on the victim's mattress. He left the room shortly after as he was startled by the sound of his son sneezing loudly. The next day, the victim told her mother about the incident over text messages. The mother returned home a few days later and confronted her husband about what had happened. When she asked why he had gone into the children's bedroom, her husband kept quiet and did not respond. A few days later, the mother decided to apply for a personal protection order for her children against their father, as she wanted to protect them from him in her absence. She took the victim to the police station where the girl told officers that her father had raped her the previous year. According to an assessment by an Institute of Mental Health psychiatrist, the offender had no mental illness, was not of unsound mind during the offences and was not intellectually disabled. The victim's mother has since died from her illness. The prosecution sought the sentence imposed, citing the offender's abuse of trust and the vulnerability of the young victim as aggravating factors. ""No child should be exploited in such a manner, particularly by the very ones they trust and look to for love and protection,"" they said. Mr Samynathan highlighted that some of the offences took place after the children's mother started receiving cancer treatment, which was a stressful time for the victim. He also pointed out that even after the offender was caught by his wife, he went into his daughter's bedroom again when he was alone with his children. Defence counsel Vigneesh Nainar asked for a shorter jail term of 22 to 24 years, highlighting his client's shame and remorse for his actions. The lawyer said his client understood that his children did not want to have contact with him anymore and ""despise"" him. ""This loss in itself is a punishment for him,"" said Mr Nainar. Justice Dedar Singh Gill said that a father's rape of a young and vulnerable daughter was ""the worst type of rape"" and ""creates turmoil in the family"". A wrong decision may mean the victim's ordeal continues and the offender does not get his punishment, said the judge. ""No young girl should find herself in this position,"" he said, pointing to how the victim did not report her father earlier given the family's financial dependence on him. He also noted that the victim's mother only changed the sleeping arrangements but did not report the offences after her initial discovery. The penalty for rape is up to 20 years in jail and a fine or caning."

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/norvan-tan-beef-bro-entrepreneur-sexual-assault-drunk-friend-sister-2861576,"Co-founder of food chain Beef Bro gets jail, caning for sexually assaulting sister's intoxicated friend","SINGAPORE: A man was on Friday (Aug 5) sentenced to nine years, nine months and four weeks' jail and eight strokes of the cane, after being convicted of sexually assaulting his sister's intoxicated friend in his family flat. A High Court judge found Norvan Tan En Jie, 26, guilty in July. He had claimed trial to two counts of sexual assault by penetration and two counts of outrage of modesty. Tan is the co-founder of Singapore food business Beef Bro. The identity of the victim, who was 19 at the time, is protected by gag order. She was a friend of Tan's sister. The two women had returned to the flat after a night of drinking in the early morning of Dec 26, 2016. Around the same time, Tan returned home with two friends. Justice Ang Cheng Hock found that Tan sexually assaulted the victim on the living room sofa, on his sister's bed and in the toilet over several minutes, while his sister was talking to one of his friends in his room. The victim formed the view that Tan was her assailant during each assault, based on the man's voice and build, the judge previously said. Tan's DNA was also found in semen on the back of the victim's shirt, which was seized from the laundry basket in the toilet. Tan's sister testified as a prosecution witness at trial but later tried to retract statements that she had made in messages to the victim and her police statements, which implicated her brother. Deputy Public Prosecutors Ng Yiwen and Niranjan Ranjakunalan sought a longer jail term of 10 years and five months, arguing that the victim was vulnerable given her state of intoxication. The victim was so drunk that she vomited repeatedly, did not have the strength to talk or change out of her clothes by herself, and fell twice when Tan was supporting her out of the toilet, they said. They also said that she did not have the strength to resist or say anything when Tan sexually assaulted her, and had closed her eyes as they felt heavy, only to be prompted to open them when Tan touched her chest. They said it was clear that Tan, ""fully cognisant of how intoxicated (the victim) was, deliberately exploited that vulnerability to satiate his perverse sexual desires"". ""By the end of the assault, not one sensitive part of (the victim's) body was left unviolated,"" said the prosecutors. They also highlighted that Tan did not wear a condom during the assault, which exposed the victim to the risk of sexually transmitted diseases. Defence counsel Amarjit Singh argued that these were not aggravating factors and called for a lighter sentence. The lawyer described Tan, who was 21 at the time of the offences, as an ""aspiring"" and ""kind-hearted"" individual. He also provided letters from Tan's parents and aunt for the judge to consider. Justice Ang agreed with the prosecution that the aggravating factors warranted a heavier sentence. At the end of the hearing, Tan indicated that he would appeal against his conviction and sentence. His sentence has been stayed pending the appeal and he remains out on higher bail of S$95,000. The prosecution successfully sought the increase in bail, citing Tan's own mitigation which stated that he was a successful entrepreneur. Tan has previously been in the news for running several companies, including footwear business BlackOut SG, in addition to the Beef Bro chain of eateries.  The prosecution also asked for e-tagging as a bail condition. They said Tan was a flight risk as he had indicated an intention to leave Singapore after first finding out about the allegations against him. The judge did not order e-tagging. For sexual assault by penetration, Tan could have been jailed for up to 20 years and fined or caned. For outrage of modesty, he could have been jailed for up to two years, fined, caned or any combination of these penalties."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tradenation-luxury-scam-fugitive-escape-flee-plead-guilty-2860966,Tradenation luxury goods scam: Two men to plead guilty to helping fugitive couple flee Singapore,"SINGAPORE: Two men accused of helping a fugitive couple allegedly involved in the Tradenation luxury goods scam to flee Singapore have said that they intend to plead guilty. Malaysians Mohamad Fazli Abdul Rahman, 38, and Mohamed Alias, 40, appeared before a district court on Friday (Aug 5). Mohamad Fazli was given a new charge of conspiring with lorry driver Mohamed Alias to arrange for Siriwipa Pansuk to hide in the container compartment of a Malaysia-registered lorry. He was previously charged with a similar offence of helping Pansuk's husband, Pi Jiapeng, to escape the country. Mohamed Alias also faces two charges of helping the couple flee Singapore by driving the lorry at Tuas Checkpoint on Jul 4. On Friday, the prosecution informed the court that Alias could also be charged with harbouring an offender. They sought an adjournment of two weeks to finalise their position on the charges. Both men remain in remand as no bail has been offered to them. The prosecution said their flight risk was high as they were able to facilitate illegal smuggling of people out of Singapore. They will return to court later in August. Arrest warrants and Interpol red notices have been issued against Pi and Pansuk, after at least 180 police reports involving two companies, Tradenation and Tradeluxury, were made since June. The complainants said they made advance payments for luxury watches or bags, but did not receive the products. While some media reports said the total value of the undelivered luxury watches and bags was S$32 million, CNA understands that victims who made police reports have not received goods worth at least S$20 million as of Jul 17. Singaporean Pi, 26, was arrested on Jun 27 for his suspected involvement in cheating offences. His passport was impounded and he was released on bail on Jun 29. Thai national Pansuk, 27, was also assisting the police with investigations and surrendered her passport to officers on Jun 30. Both subsequently became uncontactable. According to Interpol, Pi was born in Fujian, China, while Pansuk is from Roi Et, a province in central north-eastern Thailand."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/dee-kosh-sentence-jail-sex-offender-youtuber-dj-2858071,The rise and fall of Dee Kosh: From celebrity YouTuber to convicted sex offender,"SINGAPORE: Former Singapore media personality Dee Kosh started out as a YouTuber in 2011 whose rapid rise to fame landed him a gig as a radio disc jockey just one year later. But fast forward a decade on and the 33-year-old, whose real name is Darryl Ian Koshy, was on Friday (Aug 5) sentenced to 32 weeks' jail for sexual offences involving teenage boys. CNA retraces Kosh's disgraced - and at several turns lurid - descent from breakout popularity to being labelled by prosecutors as a ""seasoned criminal"" guilty of ""predatory conduct"". In the earlier days of social media and video sharing, Kosh's comedic skits set him apart from other local YouTubers and helped him rack up hundreds of thousands of subscribers on the platform. One of his most-watched videos, a parody of the Korean smash hit Gangnam Style, has garnered more than 3 million views. Kosh embarked on a radio career in April 2012, starting out as the host for 98.7FM's Say It With Music segment. He then teamed up, in January the next year, with radio personality Divian Nair on The Double D Show. In 2014, he left Mediacorp for Power 98, a radio station run by SAFRA, where he hosted his own night-time show as a part-time presenter. Court documents would later reveal that Kosh committed his first offence between 2016 and 2017, when he used a hidden camera to film him having sex with a victim without the latter's knowledge or consent. The victim had been hanging out at Kosh's house and engaging in paid and unpaid sexual acts from 2016 to 2020.  Another victim had told Kosh he was under 18 years of age when they first made contact in 2017. Kosh asked the victim questions of a sexual nature anyway, and later told him he had an ""indecent proposal"". Kosh then offered the victim S$400 to perform a sexual act on him, later raising this to S$2,000 after the victim repeatedly declined.  Their conversation was recorded on video by the victim's roommate. A third victim was under 16 years of age when he first spoke with Kosh in 2018. Kosh suggested moving their conversation to a Telegram ""secret chat"", where he offered the victim S$100 to S$250 in exchange for sexual services. The victim gradually stopped talking to Kosh after he made yet another offer of money for sex. All three victims were approached by Kosh on social media. And all of them cited being afraid of offending a celebrity with a large following, as their reason for not reporting Kosh's offences to the police right away. The situation changed in 2020 when an Instagram user posted about being sexually harassed by Kosh, and shared screenshots of message exchanges. More victims soon came forward to share their personal encounters with Kosh, and when they realised they were not alone, at least four police reports were made. Kosh's initial response was to deny all allegations. One of the victims even received a cease and desist letter from Kosh's lawyers, preventing him from publishing claims on any platform.  But days later he wrote a lengthy apology note, admitting there was ""truth to some of the things which are being said now"". Kosh was arrested by police officers in October 2020 at his home, where a total of 25 obscene videos were found on his electronic devices. He was charged in court in August 2021 with multiple offences including attempted sexual exploitation of a young person and making obscene films. Kosh's employer, Power 98, suspended him from duties thereafter. In May this year, he admitted to sexual offences involving two underaged teenage boys.  Kosh pleaded guilty to attempting to procure an indecent act from a young person and communicating with a minor to obtain sexual services. He also pleaded guilty to a third charge of making an obscene film.  On Wednesday, a public prosecutor described his conduct as highly premeditated and persistent and argued that he capitalised on his celebrity status and used money to entice the victims. A court-ordered psychiatric examination also found that Kosh was not suffering from paedophilic disorder and that his risk of reoffending was low. This led to his lawyer seeking a jail term of two-and-a-half months - shorter than the five to eight months' term sought by the prosecution. On Friday, a judge called Kosh's use of the Internet to commit his crimes ""aggravating""; and noted that his social media presence was central to tracking down one of his teenage victims. He was sentenced to 32 weeks in jail. That morning, Kosh posted on Instagram - for the first time since his apology in 2020 - that he was on his way to prison. ""It's time to pay the price,"" he wrote."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/dee-kosh-jail-sentence-sexual-offences-teenage-boys-2859036,Former DJ Dee Kosh jailed for sexual offences involving teenage boys,"SINGAPORE: Former radio disc jockey Dee Kosh, 33, was sentenced to 32 weeks' jail on Friday (Aug 5) for sexual offences involving teenage boys. The YouTuber, named Darryl Ian Koshy in court documents, solicited paid sex from a total of four teenage boys between February 2017 and August 2020.  In May, he pleaded guilty to attempting to procure an indecent act from a young person and communicating with a minor to obtain sexual services, in relation to two of the teenage victims. Two other charges related to the other two victims were considered for sentencing. Kosh also admitted to secretly filming himself having sex with another victim, then aged between 23 and 25. Two more charges of making and possessing obscene films were taken into consideration for sentencing. All the victims' identities are protected by gag order. Deputy Public Prosecutor Lim Ying Min earlier called Kosh a ""seasoned criminal skilled at avoiding detection"" and said his offences were highly premeditated. She sought five to eight months' jail. Defence counsel Johannes Hadi asked for a shorter jail term of two-and-a-half months, arguing that his client was remorseful and highlighting his good prospects for rehabilitation as assessed by a psychiatrist. In sentencing, District Judge Jasvender Kaur highlighted that Kosh brushed off one of the teenagers when the boy repeatedly told him he was underaged. She also said that Kosh took steps to conceal his what he did. This included moving conversations with the victims to Telegram and Snapchat, which offered certain privacy features. She rejected an argument made by the defence that Kosh did so as he wanted to be discreet about his sexuality. The judge said that Kosh was persistent and sought to overcome the resistance of one of his victims by asking him to think of the money he was offering. She also said that Kosh's use of the Internet to commit his crimes was aggravating, and that his social media presence was central to tracking down one of the teenage victims. Kosh had posted a photo of that victim, whom he saw during a video shoot, on social media. He said that he expected to be able to find the boy because of the number of social media followers he had, said the judge. Judge Kaur also addressed the defence's argument that the court should disregard the prosecution's references to Kosh's comments in a YouTube video he made about the case. The video, which Kosh posted on Jan 26, has since been taken down. The prosecution used it to argue that Kosh was not remorseful for his crimes, which is a factor in sentencing. ""It is appropriate to consider what the accused said in the video which he posted on Jan 26,"" said Judge Kaur. ""He publicly claimed he assumed (the victim) A1 was 18 years of age and portrayed it as an unwitting contravention of the law. This was a blatant lie."" The truth was that the victim had confirmed he was under 16, said the judge, adding that taking all these circumstances into consideration, she would give Kosh's plea of guilt less mitigating weight. Kosh rose to fame on YouTube and was a presenter on radio station Power 98, a position he held during the offences. Power 98 said on Friday that Kosh is no longer an employee of the radio station after his contract lapsed in January. Power 98 previously said that Kosh was suspended after being charged in August last year. Before that, he was placed on no-pay leave pending investigations. Two of Kosh's underaged victims were identified in court documents as A1 and A2. In March 2018, Kosh used his verified Instagram account to message A1, who informed Kosh that he was under 16. On a Telegram ""secret chat"", Kosh offered A1 S$100 to S$250 in exchange for sexual services. A1 was shocked and initially thought Kosh was joking. He gradually stopped talking to Kosh after he made another offer of money for sex. Their conversations took place over four months. A1 did not cease communications immediately as he was afraid of offending Kosh. A2 was spotted by Kosh outside Takashimaya on Orchard Road during a video shoot in February 2017. They were later put in touch through social media. Over WhatsApp, A2 told Kosh he was under 18. Kosh suggested that A2 work for him. He then initiated a ""question game"" and started to ask the boy questions of a sexual nature, which led to him making an ""indecent proposal"". Moving to Snapchat, Kosh asked A2 what it would take for him to allow someone to perform a sexual act on him, adding that he would be blindfolded and would not know the gender of the person. Eventually, Kosh revealed that he was referring to himself, and offered the victim S$400 to let him do so. He gradually raised this amount to S$2,000 after A2 repeatedly declined the offer. Their conversation was recorded on video by A2's roommate using another phone. Another victim, A3, was a man Kosh started following on social media in 2016. A3 accepted Kosh's invitation to his home as he thought it might lead to a recruitment opportunity at Kosh's production firm. They went on to have paid and unpaid sex from 2016 to 2020. On one occasion between 2016 and 2017, Kosh used a hidden camera to film them having sex without A3's knowledge or consent. None of the victims reported the offences to the police immediately, as each thought he was the only victim and was afraid of going against ""a celebrity with a large following"", the prosecutor previously told the court. When allegations of misconduct by Kosh started surfacing online in August 2020, the victims realised that they were not the only ones he had targeted, and A1 made a police report. Kosh was arrested on Oct 5, 2020. Kosh could have been jailed for up to five years, fined up to S$10,000 or both for attempted sexual exploitation of a young person under the Children and Young Persons Act. For communicating with the purpose of obtaining sexual services of a minor, he could have been jailed for up to two years and fined. The penalty for making an obscene film is a jail term of up to two years and a fine of between S$20,000 and S$40,000."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/10-men-arrested-illegal-transaction-marine-gas-oil-2859561,10 men arrested for illegal transaction of marine gas oil,"SINGAPORE: Ten men have been arrested for their suspected involvement in an illegal transaction of marine gas oil, the police said on Thursday (Aug 4). During a joint operation with the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), officers from the Police Coast Guard arrested the 10 men, aged between 22 and 48, after they were suspected to be involved in an illegal transaction of marine gas oil at the sea off the southern Tuas Basin. Six men were crew members of a Singapore-registered tugboat, while the remaining four men were crew members of a foreign-registered tugboat. Preliminary investigations revealed that the crew members of the Singapore-registered tugboat were believed to have misappropriated the marine gas oil without their company’s knowledge by selling it to the crew members of a foreign-registered tugboat, said the police. The tugboat and cash amounting to S$8,000 were seized as case exhibits, the police added. All 10 men will be charged in court on Friday, with the men on the Singapore-registered tugboat charged with the offence of criminal breach of trust as a servant. The remaining four men will be charged with dishonestly receiving stolen property. If found guilty of criminal breach of trust as a servant, a person can be jailed for up to 15 years and fined. Those found guilty of receiving stolen property can be jailed for up to five years, fined, or both. The Police Coast Guard and MPA take a serious view of illegal transactions of marine gas oil in Singapore waters, said the police. ""The authorities will continue to conduct enforcement and security checks to prevent, deter and detect such illicit activities in Singapore waters,"" they added."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ez-link-card-auto-top-loophole-buy-cigarettes-2857876,"Man jailed for exploiting EZ-Link auto top-ups of nearly S$110,000 to buy cigarettes","SINGAPORE: A man was jailed for a year on Thursday (Aug 4) for exploiting an automatic EZ-Link card top-up function to get S$109,900 that he used to buy cigarettes. Chua Yi Da, 27, pleaded guilty to one charge of unauthorised access to computer material. His three accomplices were Gary Yeo Jia Jun, 29, Darren Koh Wei Zhou, 26, and Cynthia Li Xinyi, 24. Yeo was earlier sentenced to one year in jail for his involvement, while the other cases are pending. The court heard that in June 2019, the group conspired to exploit a loophole in the EZ-Reload programme. This programme automatically topped up an EZ-Link card by a pre-selected amount whenever the card was used to make a purchase that exceeded the amount stored in the card. The four obtained 801 EZ-Link cards, linked them to EZ-Link accounts and opted in to the EZ-Reload programme, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Samuel Chew. They then applied to DBS Bank for multiple replacement cards for debit cards that they owned, using the bank's video teller machines. They obtained a total of 216 debit cards altogether. Of these, Chua obtained 11 DBS debit cards in his own name, as well as 12 cards linked to a joint account he set up with Koh for this purpose. He also got another 22 cards by asking his relative for a debit card and applying for replacement cards without the relative's knowledge. The group then bought cigarettes using EZ-Link cards on several occasions. Court documents did not specify how much was stored on the cards, but the EZ-Reload programme topped up whenever the amount fell below S$0. The scheme was discovered when a Cheers convenience store employee made a police report about several people making bulk purchases of cigarettes using EZ-Link cards. A total of S$109,990 was topped up on the 801 cards. This loss was borne by EZ-Link as there was not enough money in the debit cards designated as the source of funds. Chua and his accomplices never intended to pay for the automatic top-ups on the EZ-Link cards said Mr Chew. No restitution has been made to EZ-Link and the cigarettes obtained by the four could not be recovered. Chua's defence counsel Tham Kok Leong asked for a lenient sentence, arguing that his client was ""not a very intelligent man"" and had been ""led all the way"" into carrying out the offences. Responding to the defence's claim that Chua was directed to commit the offences by a loan shark, to whom he gave the cigarettes, the prosecution said these were bare assertions not supported by evidence. Mr Chew also argued that Chua's culpability and the harm he caused was high, and sought one year in jail so that Chua's sentence would be on par with Yeo's. The penalty for unauthorised access to computer material is jail for up to two years, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/malaysian-doctor-deported-new-zealand-david-lim-kang-huat-sexual-assault-patients-2857796,New Zealand deports Malaysian doctor who drugged and sexually assaulted patients,"SINGAPORE: A Malaysian doctor who sexually assaulted patients after sedating them has been deported from New Zealand back to Malaysia, according to media reports on Wednesday (Aug 3). David Lim Kang Huat was convicted of sexually assaulting four men while they were unconscious at a clinic located in Hastings, a city in New Zealand’s North Island in 2014. The victims, who had consulted Lim for minor ailments, were sedated with the anesthetic Midazolam, the New Zealand Herald reported. They woke up to find the general practitioner rubbing their private parts. In a report from 2017 covering Lim’s court hearing, the newspaper quoted a crown prosecutor saying the victims were aged between 18 and 30. Lim, who is reported to have transitioned from male to female while in prison, was sentenced to five years' jail in 2017 after being found guilty of five charges of disabling or stupefying and five charges of indecent assault on a male above the age of 16, New Zealand news media website Stuff reported. Lim, who was given a deportation notice in December 2017 while in prison, will not be allowed to return to New Zealand, based on a recent parole board decision. According to the New Zealand Herald, Lim continued to deny the crimes during a hearing on Jan 26 and did not complete any “offence-focused treatment” aimed at reducing the risk of sex offenders repeating their crimes. Lim’s sentence ended on Jun 1.   A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment  confirmed with the New Zealand Herald that Lim was deported two days later. A verification and compliance general manager at Immigration NZ said the government covered the cost of Lim’s deportation. ""We prioritise cases for deportation with those engaged in criminality or who otherwise pose a risk to the integrity of New Zealand's immigration system being the highest priority cases for deportation,” the New Zealand Herald quoted him as saying. Born in Malaysia and trained in Scotland, Lim went to New Zealand in 2006 to work in Hawke's Bay Hospital, according to the media reports. The doctor spent three years as a registrar there, before working full-time at The Doctors clinic in Hastings. A year after being sentenced, a disciplinary tribunal banned Lim from practising medicine in the country. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/alan-fong-soong-hert-murder-trial-wife-evelyn-pek-smothered-pillow-2856681,Singaporean on murder trial in UK may have knelt on wife’s shoulders and smothered her with pillow: Pathologist,"NEWCASTLE, UK: A UK court has heard that a Singaporean man charged with murder may have knelt on his wife’s shoulders as he smothered her with a pillow. Fong Soong Hert, referred to as Alan Fong, is on trial for murder at Newcastle Crown Court, in the northeast of England. He denies the charges and is expected to take the stand on Thursday (Aug 4). His wife Pek Ying Ling, known as Evelyn Pek, was found dead in a hotel room in Newcastle, on Dec 6, 2021. The couple had been travelling in Dubai, Croatia and Scotland before visiting their son Alonzo who was studying in Newcastle. On the third day of the trial, the jury heard from Home Office pathologist Jennifer Bolton. She carried out the post-mortem of Pek’s body to understand what injuries were present and how they contributed to the mother-of-three’s death. Dr Bolton said Pek had been wearing black cropped jeggings, a black top and black underwear on her lower half, which were urine-stained. The forensic pathologist led the jury through each injury found on Pek’s body. A total of 11 bruises and petechial haemorrhages, which are tiny spots of bleeding under the skin, were located on her chin, shoulders, arms and ankles. Dr Bolton confirmed the cause of death as smothering, and noted the two bruises on Pek’s shoulders were symmetrical and likely to have been caused at the same time. She said: “That then raises the possibility of her being knelt on while the pillow was then held over her face.” “There’s nothing really ... to suggest that she struggled,” she added. Acting on behalf of the defence, Toby Hedworth QC questioned whether this would mean the assailant would have had to be “sufficiently mobile” to sit upon her. He also asked whether the narrowing of one of Pek’s coronary arteries, which was also discovered during the post-mortem examination, could have played a role in her death. Dr Bolton confirmed it was unlikely to have killed her but may have meant “death came a little more quickly”. The court later heard from Detective Constable Mark Wedderburn and Detective Constable Joanne Glendenning who were involved in collating evidence for the case. This included images of an embankment outside The Bosville Hotel on the Isle of Skye, where Alan Fong and Pek had been staying days before she died. Mr Fong is believed to have tripped over a pipe in the dark and fallen down a drop of around 15m. He sustained several injuries that saw him being taken to the MacKinnon Memorial Hospital and kept in overnight, and given a mix of painkillers including morphine and codeine. The court was also played a recording of the 999 call the couple’s son Alonzo made to the emergency services soon after 7am on Dec 6. Alonzo is heard saying: “Okay, he told me, I think they had some argument of some sort and then I think he lost it. “And then he told me he covered her just to make her keep quiet ... he told me she’s not breathing as well, so can I get medics as well?” The call handler is also heard saying to a colleague: “‘He thinks his dad has killed his mum at the hotel”. CCTV footage from the County Aparthotel on Westgate Road, Newcastle shows police officers entering the lobby and hurrying along the corridor. Body-worn camera footage shows Mr Fong opening the door and stepping into the corridor, as instructed. Pek’s body is then visible, lying on the bed with her legs hanging over the edge and her face covered by a pillow. When ambulance workers arrived at 7.30am, they are heard asking Mr Fong: “How long has she been like this for? He replies: “I don’t know.” The worker asks: “You don’t know?”, and Mr Fong says: “‘It must be long”. The case continues."

Pai Keng Pheng was the managing director of Sentek Marine and Trading at the time of the offences, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) said in a news release on Wednesday. Between August 2014 and January 2018, the company had allegedly acquired about 118,131 metric tonnes of marine gasoil which had been dishonestly misappropriated from Shell Eastern Petroleum's facility at Pulau Bukom, said SPF. The gasoil was loaded onboard Sentek’s vessels. This was allegedly done with Pai Keng Pheng’s consent during his tenure there. According to SPF, Pai is facing 42 charges of consenting to Sentek’s acquisition of property representing another person’s benefits from criminal conduct, where for each offence, he faces a jail term of up to 10 years, a fine of up to S$500,000, or both. Pai also faces an additional charge of abetting the obstruction of the course of justice for allegedly instigating an individual named Pai Kheng Hian to instruct a witness to give false information to investigators.  For this offence, he faces a jail term of up to seven years, a fine, or both. The latest charges add to 30 charges of corruptly giving gratification and 10 charges of obstructing the course of justice that Pai had earlier been charged with. In March, a former Shell employee was jailed for 29 years for his role in a S$128 million marine fuel heist at Shell's Pulau Bukom refinery that involved illegally loading bunkers, including Sentek vessels, with stolen marine fuel."

Police responded to the alleged case of assault at Serangoon Avenue 4 at about 8.29pm on Tuesday. A 20-year-old man suffered multiple injuries as a result of the incident and was taken to hospital in a conscious state. The suspected attacker had fled the scene in a vehicle with a 21-year-old woman before police arrived, however, his identity was established quickly with the help of images from police cameras. Through ground enquiries, officers from SPF's Ang Mo Kio Division found the vehicle abandoned at a multi-storey car park at Northshore Drive in Punggol. ""A search for the couple within the vicinity was mounted together with officers from the K-9 unit of the Special Operations Command,"" SPF said in a news release. ""The couple was eventually spotted hiding at the back of a lorry which was parked along Punggol 17th Avenue."" The suspect was arrested within five hours of the alleged attack taking place. The woman accompanying him was also found to have suffered multiple injuries, and was taken to hospital in a conscious state. ""Preliminary investigations revealed that the two victims are known to each other,"" SPF said. ""The suspect is also known to the 21-year-old female and the assault allegedly arose from a past incident of dispute. ""Further investigations revealed that the suspect had used a pair of scissors in both attacks."" Both victims are in a stable condition, police added. The suspect will be charged in court on Thursday for voluntarily causing hurt by a dangerous weapon. Those convicted of the offence face up to seven years in prison, a fine, caning, or a combination of such punishments. ""The police will spare no effort to track down those who commit such brazen acts and will take firm action against them in accordance with the law,"" SPF said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/charles-yeo-arrest-warrant-asylum-uk-breach-bail-conditions-2855351,Court issues arrest warrant for Charles Yeo after he breached conditions for overseas travel on bail,"SINGAPORE: A district court on Wednesday (Aug 3) issued a warrant of arrest for lawyer and former Reform Party chairman Charles Yeo after he breached the conditions for overseas travel while on bail. Yeo, 31, was charged in January with harassing a police officer and wounding the religious feelings of Christians in some social media posts. He was also arrested that month for investigations into forgery offences and alleged criminal breach of trust by an attorney, after complaints were lodged against Whitefield Law Corporation. Yeo is a former partner at the law firm. On Jul 20, the State Courts granted Yeo permission to travel to Vietnam for work between Jul 27 and Jul 30. But he did not return to Singapore on Jul 30 and did not report to the investigation officer on Aug 1 as he was required to, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) previously said. In an announcement on Instagram on Jul 30, Yeo said he was seeking ""political asylum"" in the United Kingdom, after repeated claims in recent months that criminal charges against him have been ""politically motivated"". At Wednesday's bail review hearing, a judge revoked Yeo's bail of S$10,000. His mother, who was his bailor, was ordered to appear in court to show cause, or explain why the bail should not be forfeited. The judge also granted an application by Yeo's defence counsels Mr Ashwin Ganapathy, Mr Azri Imran Tan and Mr Joshua Chow to discharge themselves. Ms Victoria Tay, who appeared on behalf of the discharged lawyers, said she was instructed to put on record that they were not aware that Yeo was seeking asylum in the UK and would not return to Singapore as expected. SPF earlier issued a gazette for Yeo's arrest following his abscondment. SPF also said it was working with foreign law enforcement counterparts to trace Yeo's whereabouts. Yeo was part of the Reform Party team that contested in Ang Mo Kio GRC in the 2020 General Election, against a five-member team led by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.  He stepped down as chairman of the party following his arrest in January. The hearing for a review of Yeo's warrant of arrest has been fixed for September."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/dee-kosh-sexual-offences-teenage-boys-jail-youtube-video-sub-judice-2854901,'Seasoned criminal': Prosecution describes former radio DJ Dee Kosh's sexual offences as highly premeditated,"SINGAPORE: The prosecution is seeking five to eight months' jail for former radio disc jockey Dee Kosh, who has admitted to sexual offences involving two teenage boys. A district court also heard that Kosh's posting of a YouTube video about his case earlier this year was sub judice conduct. The video has been taken down. Sub judice is a form of contempt of court, referring to actions that can unduly influence court proceedings. The prosecution and defence made oral arguments on Wednesday (Aug 3), and Kosh will return for his sentencing on Friday. The YouTuber, named Darryl Ian Koshy in court documents, previously admitted to soliciting paid sexual services from three victims between 2017 and 2020. Two of the victims were underaged at the time. Kosh, 33, also secretly filmed himself having sex with the third victim, then aged 23 to 25. All the victims' identities are protected by gag order. In May, Kosh pleaded guilty to attempting to procure an indecent act from a young person, communicating with a minor to obtain sexual services and making an obscene film. Four more charges will be considered for sentencing. The court had ordered Kosh to undergo a psychiatric examination at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) to assess whether he has a paedophilic disorder and his risk of reoffending. On Wednesday, defence counsel Johannes Hadi informed the court that Kosh was found not to suffer from paedophilic disorder and that his risk of offending was deemed low. The lawyer sought a shorter jail term of two-and-a-half months for his client. Urging the court to impose a longer jail term, Deputy Public Prosecutor Lim Ying Min argued that Kosh deliberately sought out minors to proposition even though he knew the victims' ages. She described Kosh's conduct as highly premeditated and persistent, arguing that he capitalised on his celebrity status and used money to entice the victims. Ms Lim also said it was aggravating that Kosh took steps to conceal his wrongdoing. The defence argued that Kosh moved his conversations with the underaged victims to Telegram's ""secret chat"" and Snapchat because he wanted to be discreet about his sexuality. Calling this explanation ""fanciful"" and ""an afterthought designed to mislead"", the prosecutor retorted that Kosh had ""no qualms"" about flirting with boys he met on social media, and that this was not discreet behaviour. Ms Lim also contended that Kosh's admission to the offences was not motivated by remorse. In doing so, she referred to a more than nine minute-long video that Kosh posted on YouTube on Jan 26. This was a day after indicating he would plead guilty. Ms Lim said that posting the video was sub judice conduct as his case was still before the courts, and that Kosh took the video down after the prosecution requested its removal. Reading out extracts from a transcript of the video, she said Kosh used it to mislead the public and lighten his offences to a case of mistaken assumption of the victims' ages, when he in fact knew they were underaged. Ms Lim also highlighted that after allegations of sexual misconduct started surfacing in August 2020, Kosh's lawyers issued a letter to an alleged victim demanding that he cease and desist from publishing his claims on any platform. Describing Kosh as a ""seasoned criminal skilled at avoiding detection"", she added that his status as a first-time offender should be given little mitigating weight as his sexual propositioning of minors took place over three years. In response, Mr Hadi said that Kosh made the video to address news reports and ""false rumours"" about his case. He argued that his client was remorseful, and read out other extracts from the video transcript in which Kosh said he had made ""terrible mistakes"". Mr Hadi also asked the court to consider the report of the IMH doctor who examined Kosh and found that his risk of offending was low. Citing the IMH report, Mr Hadi said the reasons for this finding were that Kosh was remorseful, employed and did not suffer from substance abuse or psychiatric disorder. He also argued that his client was relatively young and had good prospects for rehabilitation. District Judge Jasvender Kaur said she would deliver her sentence after considering both parties' submissions. Kosh attended the hearing at the State Courts with his supporters, including social media personalities Wendy Cheng, also known as Xiaxue, and Aiman Haikal. Kosh rose to fame on YouTube and was a presenter on radio station Power 98, a position he held during the offences. Power 98 has said that Kosh was suspended since being charged in August last year. Before that, he was placed on no-pay leave pending investigations. The court previously heard that in March 2018, Kosh used his verified Instagram account to message the first underaged victim, identified as A1 in court documents. A1 told Kosh he was under 16. Kosh then suggested moving their conversation to a Telegram ""secret chat"", where messages could be set to be automatically deleted and could not be forwarded to others. Kosh would also be informed if a screenshot was taken. On this platform, Kosh offered A1 S$100 to S$250 in exchange for sexual services. A1 was shocked and initially thought Kosh was joking, but the man's persistence made him realise it was not a joke. A1 gradually stopped talking to Kosh after he made another offer of money for sex. Their conversations took place over four months until June 2018. A1 did not cease communications immediately as he was afraid of offending Kosh. Kosh saw the second victim, identified as A2 in court documents, outside Takashimaya on Orchard Road during a video shoot in February 2017. He approached A2 and was later put in touch with him through social media. They communicated over WhatsApp, with A2 informing Kosh that he was under 18. Kosh suggested that A2 work for him, offering to teach the boy about production work, how to take selfies and increase his confidence. They started talking and Kosh initiated a ""question game"". He started to ask the victim questions of a sexual nature. This led to Kosh telling A2 that he had an ""indecent proposal"" and suggested moving the conversation to Snapchat, which shares some features of a Telegram ""secret chat"". Kosh asked A2 for a shirtless picture so that he could ""blackmail"" him if he talked. A2 did not send the photo, but assured Kosh that he would not talk. Kosh then asked A2 what it would take for him to allow someone to perform a sexual act on him. He added that A2 would be blindfolded and would not know the person's gender. Eventually, Kosh revealed that the person who would perform the sexual act was himself, and offered the victim S$400. He gradually raised this amount to S$2,000 after A2 repeatedly declined. Their conversation was recorded on video by A2's roommate using another phone. In 2016, Kosh started following the third victim, identified as A3 in court documents, on social media. They started chatting and Kosh invited A3 to his home. The victim agreed as he thought it might lead to a recruitment opportunity at Kosh's production company. At Kosh's home, they chatted for a while before going into the bedroom, where Kosh performed a sexual act on A3. After this, A3 continued to go to Kosh's house to hang out and engage in paid and unpaid sexual acts from 2016 to 2020. On one of these occasions between 2016 and 2017, Kosh used a hidden camera to film them having sex without the victim's knowledge or consent. None of the victims reported the offences to the police immediately, as each thought he was the only victim and was afraid of going against ""a celebrity with a large following"", said the prosecutor. Allegations of sexual misconduct by Kosh surfaced online in August 2020, when a man posted on Instagram that he was sexually harassed by Kosh. Shortly after, more victims came forward on social media. Kosh initially denied all the claims, but later addressed them on social media, admitting that there was some truth to them. The victims realised that they were not the only ones targeted by Kosh, and A1 made a police report on Aug 16, 2020. Kosh was arrested on Oct 5, 2020. Kosh could be jailed for up to five years, fined up to S$10,000 or both for attempted sexual exploitation of a young person under the Children and Young Persons Act. For communicating with the purpose of obtaining sexual services of a minor, he could be jailed for up to two years and fined. The penalty for making an obscene film is a jail term of up to two years and a fine of between S$20,000 and S$40,000."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/alan-fong-soong-hert-murder-trial-wife-evelyn-pek-ying-ling-2854516,Singaporean man charged with murdering wife described as ‘caring and soft-hearted’,"NEWCASTLE, UK: A Singaporean man on trial in the United Kingdom for murdering his wife has been described by his son as a “caring and soft-hearted guy”. Pek Ying Ling, known as Evelyn Pek, was found dead in a hotel room in Newcastle, England on Dec 6, 2021. Her husband Fong Soong Hert, referred to as Alan Fong, has been charged for her murder, which he denies. He is on trial at Newcastle Crown Court, with the case expected to continue into next week. The couple had been travelling around Europe and visiting family after COVID-19 restrictions eased in Singapore. On Tuesday (Aug 2), the defendant’s eldest son Alonzo Fong took the stand. The prosecution took him through text messages sent on the morning of his mother’s death. Shortly after 7am, he sent his girlfriend a message reading: “My dad just called me and told me he accidentally killed my mum. “I’m going over to check now.” After arriving at the County Aparthotel in Newcastle, he messaged: “I’m so confused - he told me they fought and he covered her mouth and now she’s unconscious. ""Don’t tell anyone I still don’t know what happened.” Describing his parents’ relationship in a police interview, Alonzo said they “showed each other love every day"". He also claimed his father was known to be a “very caring and soft-hearted guy”. Behind a screen, Alan Fong wiped tears from his eyes with a tissue. The jury heard accounts from paramedics, hotel staff and police officers who attended the incident. Emergency services arrived at the hotel to find Evelyn Pek lying on the hotel bed, with a blood-stained pillow over her face. She was pronounced dead at 7.32am. The court heard that days earlier, Alan Fong had been taken to hospital after falling down a 15m ledge on the Isle of Skye, a small island off the coast of Scotland. Witnesses described seeing him stumbling outside The Bosville Hotel in Portree, where he was staying. He told hotel staff he had tripped over a pipe in the dark while trying to take a photo of the harbour. According to the prosecution, Alan Fong lost his mobile phone and laptop bag during his fall. Together with his wife, he went back to look for the items, but could only find the phone. The court heard from Peter Makepeace QC, who is representing the prosecution, that back at the hotel, Alan Fong was in a lot of pain and an ambulance was called.  He was checked over at the MacKinnon Memorial Hospital and prescribed pain medication. The prosecution stressed, however, that no head injuries were detected. After travelling to Inverness and then Newcastle, the defendant had several falls - witnesses noted that two of these falls left his wife with injuries to her arms.  After Alan Fong collapsed a third time, he was taken to Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary, and arrived at the hotel in the early hours of Dec 6 with his wife. CCTV footage caught them entering their hotel room at 12.17am. The door was not opened again until police arrived the following morning. The case continues."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/dna-police-murder-gardens-bay-database-2823061,Gardens by the Bay murder: How police used DNA to prove their case,"SINGAPORE: In the middle of July 2016, Leslie Khoo found himself in hot water. Chinese national Cui Yajie, 31, had been reported missing, and police investigators found out that Khoo, then 48, was the last person to see her. They suspected Khoo knew more than he was telling. When officers arrested Khoo on Jul 20 and questioned him, he insisted he had dropped Ms Cui off at Upper Jurong Road. Investigators went to that exact spot but could not find any trace of him ever being there. This was a red flag, so they interrogated him further. ""He was just like a deer caught in the headlights,"" Superintendent of Police (SUPT) Alvin Phua, who assisted the investigating officer in Khoo's case, told CNA. ""He knew the game was up."" Khoo eventually revealed that on Jul 12, he had argued with Ms Cui in his car and drove her to a road along Gardens by the Bay, where ""in a fit of anger"" he strangled her to death. The ""natural question"", SUPT Phua said, would then be where the body was. Khoo claimed to have brought it to a remote area in Lim Chu Kang, where he burnt it over three days under a discarded lorry canopy. Khoo then led investigators to the scene, prosecutors said, telling them with a smile that there was ""nothing left"". Following an 11-day trial in 2019, Khoo was convicted of murdering Ms Cui and sentenced to life imprisonment. While Khoo's confession might have made it look like an open-and-shut case, SUPT Phua said this was only ""the first part of the story"". ""You need to find out whether that is a genuine confession or a confession that is aimed to shield others from the punishment of that crime,"" said SUPT Phua. The 47-year-old is also deputy head of the Special Investigation Section, a unit under the Criminal Investigation Department that deals with serious crimes like murder, kidnapping and those involving firearms. ""So, you need to look out for a lot of corroborative evidence to either prove or disprove his version of the event,"" he added. The evidence includes eyewitnesses or closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage, but if they are not readily available - like in Khoo's case where the crimes happened in remote areas - then a DNA profile becomes crucial. ""Because you have been there, not only I should be able to see you on CCTV,"" SUPT Phua said. ""Any contact that you have, your DNA transfer might be there. More often than not, it is there. And this is where the recovery and eventual tracing of DNA evidence become absolutely critical."" This emphasis on DNA comes after a Bill was introduced in Parliament on Aug 1, proposing to allow the police to collect DNA samples from people arrested for more crimes. Under the Registration of Criminals Act, police currently can collect DNA samples only for a specific list of registrable crimes, including shop theft, molestation and cheating. The Bill seeks to expand this scope by adding ""eligible"" crimes like voluntarily causing hurt, drink driving and reproducing obscene films. ""Restricting the collection of an individual’s particulars and DNA information to just these types of (registrable) crime has resulted in smaller databases, which may limit the police’s ability to solve crimes, especially in cases with very few leads,"" the Ministry of Home Affairs had said. Special Investigation Section head SUPT Roy Lim, 50, said the expansion will help deter more would-be criminals, adding that the DNA database, launched in 2003, has helped the police solve major crimes quicker. This database contains DNA profiles of every individual who has gone through the police system for registrable crimes, SUPT Lim said. This DNA could be extracted from blood or buccal samples. It also stores DNA evidence found at crime scenes, helping police solve cold cases when a matching profile enters the system down the road. ""If we increase the database, we increase the probability of people that we want to reach out to, especially perpetrators. We also lower the time needed to hunt for these people,"" he said. ""For major crimes, when we don't have a suspect, a lot of manpower and resources are dedicated to trying to solve these cases as quickly as possible. When you solve crimes quicker, people feel safe."" For instance, SUPT Lim oversaw a 2016 investigation into a case of mischief by fire, when police were on the hunt for a group of men who hurled Molotov cocktails at St James Power Station. Officers had CCTV footage of the group's silhouettes and their getaway car, but the images were not definitive enough to identify crucial markers, like their faces or the car's licence plate. The big break came when officers found a lighter along the group's suspected escape route near the nightclub, SUPT Lim said. Eager not to miss anything, officers bagged the lighter and sent it for DNA analysis. This returned a match in the database to someone who was previously convicted of a registrable crime. Police interviewed the man and used circumstantial evidence to prove he was at the scene that day. The man eventually broke down, and his statements revealed the identities of four other suspects. ""If we didn't find that lighter, it would have taken us probably a longer time, searching stretches of roads and camera after camera to try to find the car plate,"" SUPT Lim said. ""So, the lighter was a very fast forward way to help us to solve the case. We could have solved it probably in another two or three days' time after we have covered all the CCTVs, but this was almost immediate - the next day."" Khoo's murder case was different in that police already had pieces of the puzzle, but needed DNA to ensure the pieces fit. After Khoo's confession, investigators seized his car and sent it to the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) for processing. HSA found bloodstains in the car, possibly from Ms Cui's decomposing body that was left in the car overnight. But because there was no more body, police needed to find another way of getting Ms Cui's DNA so they could try matching it with the profile from the bloodstains. Investigators went to her home and collected a pair of pants she wore as pyjamas. ""The logical place to look at will definitely be things that a person uses on a daily basis intimately,"" SUPT Phua said. ""So, we can be looking at pyjamas, like in this case, clothing worn that wasn't washed, and toothbrushes or shavers for guys. These are the things that you use on a daily basis and the chance of getting a DNA profile there is high."" But for the analysis to be accurate, SUPT Phua said it was important to ensure that this item was only used by the subject and not anybody else. ""This requires a bit of thinking out of the box,"" he said. ""It's not only you just get any pair of pyjamas, so long as it's in her room. You need to be sure that these are worn by her and her only. And so these are the additional things that you need to verify along the way."" DNA from the bloodstains and Ms Cui's pyjamas were eventually shown to be a match. Back in the wooded area at Lim Chu Kang Lane 8, where Khoo said he had burnt the body, officers started combing for evidence. Dusk had fallen and it was hard to see anything, much less traces of human remains. Police could set up large lights, but this would cast long shadows too. The search continued the next day in the morning light. Crime scene specialist Jolene See, 30, had just started her 8am shift and was sent to the scene under the harsh sun. As per common practice, the crime scene specialists spoke to investigators to get the facts of the case. They were told that there was no body, so they needed to find anything - possibly something small - that resembled human belongings or remains. This could be hair, fabric or any source of DNA. Ms See slipped on her surgical gloves and shoe covers and got to work.  The officers walked shoulder to shoulder in a thorough line search to scour the narrow lane, as well as the vegetation and drain to one side. Khoo said he had disposed in that drain whatever remains were left. The officers were used to searching for evidence in urban settings, but this was different. When someone saw something, they stopped, squatted and sometimes brushed aside leaves to take a closer look. ""It’s quite difficult because it’s outdoor terrain, so it's very hard to look for minute things, and we have to be really detailed about it,"" Ms See recalled. ""We do a lot of bending and squats. It can be exhausting."" To ensure the search was as thorough as possible, the gurkhas, National Parks Board and national water agency PUB were brought in for their expertise in forested areas and how water flowed in that specific drain, SUPT Phua said. ""You will want to leverage the expertise of different agencies to see how best you can carefully and meticulously process the entire area - go through it with a fine comb for any shred of evidence, because you can't afford to miss out anything,"" he said. After a few hours of searching, officers found clumps of what looked like human hair - the same colour as the asphalt it was on - under one of two discarded lorry canopies in the area. CNA was given access to never-before-released crime scene photographs. ""We collected it, packed it properly to preserve the DNA, and handed it over to the investigating officer to send it for analysis,"" Ms See said. Officers continued searching over seven days and eventually found more than they hoped for, including bone fragments that later turned out to be animal bones. While HSA could not match the hair to Ms Cui as it was missing its roots, a mitochondrial DNA analysis concluded that it matched the profile of her mother. This was submitted as evidence in court to show that Ms Cui's body was indeed burnt there. It was also the first time that mitochondrial DNA sequencing was used in Singapore to establish a deceased's identity without a body. ""It was nice to recover something that will help us to identify or at least try to identify the body,"" Ms See said of the hair discovery. ""I think at that point of time, we were glad that our hard work actually paid off."" SUPT Phua said DNA from the bloodstains in the car and the hair at Lim Chu Kang helped solidify the case. ""You're not talking about any single silver bullet to the case, but you can say it’s the confluence of all the evidence, little bits, that help to add up and strengthen the case to suggest that it was her present at the scene,"" he said. This is why it is so important to ensure that DNA evidence is not contaminated, SUPT Lim said, adding that officers who first respond to a crime scene are trained to process it properly. Gloves and shoe covers are also discarded after a single use. ""It starts from how the evidence was found, then how it's documented and photographed, packaged and submitted,"" he said. ""HSA has a different set of protocols on how are they going to deal with it and extract DNA. Ours is to ensure that what we seize is not contaminated and is original - we don't introduce anything else - before it goes to court."" Officers are also taught where to look for DNA based on the circumstances of the case, although SUPT Lim acknowledged that mastering this takes years of experience. ""That's why we are always teaching and teaching. You don't teach, five years down the road everybody will say, 'Never mind, just wait. No DNA, don't solve.' It cannot happen,"" he said. ""The old detective way must complement the new-age technology that we have."" DNA sources include blood, hair, semen, saliva and skin cells, but not all of them are visible to the naked eye. Crime scene specialists use a specific light source to unveil human secretions, and a screening kit to determine whether a substance is really blood, Ms See said. As for collection, an item small enough will be seized in whole and sent to HSA for analysis. If an item cannot be removed, like a window pane, it will be swabbed in all ""probable areas of DNA deposition"" before the swabs are sent to HSA, Ms See added. SUPT Lim is confident that perpetrators, despite their best efforts otherwise, will leave traces of DNA at the crime scene. ""You want, you dress yourself up like a ninja - housebreakers have done that, socks, gloves and all - but you will still leave something behind,"" he insisted. ""DNA is a silent witness ... They're just waiting and thinking, 'Come swab here bro, this fella switched on the tap.'"" Another quality of DNA is that it is known to ""reside around for the longest time"", SUPT Lim said, pointing to how police officers planted their own DNA on 5kg of explosives before blowing them up to study the resilience of DNA evidence. ""We tested where we planted the explosives, and we still got DNA,"" he said. ""It actually depends on contamination, including the rain and sun, but DNA stays for a long, long time."" DNA collected from crime scenes or blood samples of those brought in for registrable crimes are then stored in the DNA database, which SUPT Lim said is located in a ""very secured"" server accessible only by a limited number of people with security clearance. ""Even I don't have access to the DNA database,"" he said. ""Even if we want to do any matching, we go through an authorised person. There are also (data protection) protocols and security. We don't want somebody to be planting it, we don't want people to be taking it out."" SUPT Lim suggested that a national DNA database could be even more useful for solving and deterring crime. For example, he recalled how police were trying to use DNA to identify the perpetrators in the Little India riot, but were unable to as many of them were foreign workers whose DNA were not in the database. But when asked about how such a national database could raise privacy concerns, SUPT Lim said these were rights issues drawn from Western influence. ""But to me, if you don’t commit a crime, why are you afraid? People say this could be manipulated, but we have so much (security measures) in place,"" he said. ""People always protect themselves, but if it is they themselves who suffer the loss of loved ones, then they start questioning the police: 'How come you don’t have DNA? Technology is so advanced.' The fact is you could be one of those that are opposing us in getting DNA."" SUPT Lim recounted how in 2013, police used DNA to identify a headless body found in a Whampoa canal near McNair Road. It belonged to Indian national Jasvinder Kaur, 33, who was murdered by her husband. ""No head, no hands so we couldn't tell (her identity). We found something else that belongs to her, and we matched it with the body,"" said SUPT Lim, who was personally involved in the investigation. ""You can extract DNA from the bone marrow, but of course, how good the DNA is going to be, how usable it is and how much it is depends on the condition of the body."" Dismembered and decomposed bodies are all part of the job for Ms See, who said she is not disgusted but sad when dealing with such scenes. ""I will want to try my best to actually recover as much DNA and fingerprints or any evidence that will help in the case and when it goes to trial,"" she said, adding that she has dug through rubbish chutes to find evidence. ""Sometimes we miss our meals and we're just exhausted, then we're just asking ourselves why we're here. But I think ultimately we are doing something good. And there's a sense of satisfaction at the end of the day."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/threaten-girlfriend-post-intimate-videos-online-knife-sex-2852936,"Man admits threatening to post intimate videos with girlfriend, using knife to pressure her into sex","SINGAPORE: After their relationship deteriorated, a 25-year-old man threatened to post intimate videos with his girlfriend online, and used a knife to pressure her into sex with him. The man on Tuesday (Aug 2) pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal intimidation and one count of having an offensive weapon. Four more charges will be considered for sentencing. The 23-year-old victim's identity is protected by gag order, and the offender's name was redacted from court documents. The court heard that the couple met on a dating application in May 2018. Over a few occasions that year, the man took five videos and one photo of them having sex. Their relationship started deteriorating in August 2018. In late 2018, the victim told her boyfriend to delete the intimate videos and photo. She went to his house and deleted the files from his computer and phone with his agreement. But unknown to her, her boyfriend had kept copies of them on other devices. A few months later on Mar 25, 2019, the couple had an argument. The offender was angry that the victim did not reciprocate his affection and wanted to break up with him. Over text message, the man threatened to hack into the woman's Instagram account and post the intimate videos and photo of them on her feed, alarming her. Things took another turn on the night of Apr 7, 2019, when the couple was discussing the state of their relationship while sitting under the victim's block. Sometime after midnight, the man asked the woman to have sex with him. He was upset as they had not had sex in a long time, since their relationship started deteriorating, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Chong Ee Hsiun. The victim rebuffed him and the man became angry. He took out a flip-knife from his pocket and held it by the side of his body with the blade still folded, saying: ""Really cannot?"" When the victim continued to say no, he flipped the blade of the knife out, poked its tip against his girlfriend's thigh and asked her whether it hurt. He then explained to the victim that ""the sensation of being poked by the knife represents how much he has been hurting all the time due to the deterioration in their relationship"", said Mr Chong. The victim started crying. The man placed the knife's blade at the side of her neck, holding its tip to her skin. He continued to ask her if it hurt, and said this was how he had been feeling. The victim, still crying, agreed to have sex with her boyfriend and said they could do so during a staycation planned later that month. The man then put the flip-knife back in his pocket, waited for the victim to calm down and took a taxi home. According to the offender, he carried the flip-knife around as he felt urges to self-harm. He was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, mixed anxiety and depressive disorder, and alcohol abuse disorder, said Mr Chong. But the Institute of Mental Health found that these conditions only had a contributory link to his offences involving the flip-knife, and not his threat to distribute the intimate videos with the victim, said the prosecutor. The prosecution is seeking five to eight months' jail for the man. The offender, who is represented by Mr Chua Hock Lu, will return for sentencing in September. The punishment for criminal intimidation is jail for up to two years, a fine or both. For possessing an offensive weapon, the man could be jailed for up to two years."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/charles-yeo-wanted-police-travel-uk-reform-party-2850711,Lawyer Charles Yeo wanted by police after breaching conditions for overseas travel while on bail,"SINGAPORE: Former Reform Party chairman Charles Yeo is wanted by the Singapore Police Force (SPF) after he failed to return to Singapore, in breach of court conditions for the approval of his overseas travel.  The police said in a news release on Monday (Aug 1) that they have issued a gazette for Yeo’s arrest following his abscondment. SPF added that it is working with foreign law enforcement counterparts to trace Yeo’s whereabouts. In an announcement on Instagram on Saturday, Yeo said he was seeking “political asylum” in the United Kingdom, after repeated claims in recent months that criminal charges against him have been ""politically motivated"". The police said they are aware of his social media posts. Yeo was on bail when he left Singapore last week, having obtained permission from the court to travel to Vietnam for work. But instead of returning to Singapore after, the 31-year-old said he had flown to the UK.  Yeo was charged in January for harassing a police officer and wounding the religious feelings of Christians in some social media posts. SPF said Yeo is also on police bail as he is currently under investigation for separate offences of criminal breach of trust by an attorney and forgery offences, after complaints were lodged against Whitefield Law Corporation. Yeo is a former partner of the law firm. On Jul 20, the State Courts granted Yeo permission to travel to Vietnam for work between Jul 27 and Jul 30.  The police said Yeo reported to the investigation officer on Jul 26 to collect his passport, provide his travel itinerary and furnish additional bail before his departure the next day.  Under the conditions of his application to leave Singapore, Yeo was required to report to the investigation officer on Aug 1 at 6pm to surrender his passport upon his return. “Charles Yeo did not return to Singapore on Jul 30 and he did not report to the investigation officer on Aug 1,” said SPF, adding that Yeo's bailer informed the police that he did not return to Singapore on Jul 30 and was uncontactable.  “Following the report, police attempted to contact Charles Yeo on Aug 1 but to no avail. As Charles Yeo had breached the conditions for the court’s approval of his overseas travel, the police issued a police gazette for Charles Yeo’s arrest.” Yeo was part of the Reform Party team that contested in Ang Mo Kio GRC in the 2020 General Election, against a five-member team led by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.  He stepped down as chairman of the party following his arrest in January. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/delivery-driver-van-accident-78-year-old-woman-died-cbd-2849926,Delivery driver jailed for careless driving after fatal accident involving elderly woman,"SINGAPORE: A delivery driver was sentenced on Monday (Aug 1) to four months' jail after knocking down a 78-year-old woman in the central business district. The victim died of head injury a day after the accident. Muhammad Said Shahidir Dres, 35, was also banned from driving for eight years after pleading guilty to one count of careless driving. The court heard that on Apr 3, 2020, Said was driving his van along Cross Street while making a delivery at about 3.05pm. He was driving on the extreme right lane as he intended to make a right turn at the junction of Robinson Road towards Collyer Quay. Around the same time, the victim started walking across the signalised pedestrian crossing of Robinson Road between CapitaGreen and Hong Leong Building. She had crossed three of the four lanes of the road when the front right part of Said's van collided with her. She fell to the ground bleeding. Another woman who was waiting to cross the pedestrian crossing called the police to report the accident. The victim was taken to the hospital, where she succumbed to her injuries and was pronounced dead the next morning. Before executing the right turn, Said's van was the leading vehicle with no vehicles ahead or beside him, and his view was not blocked, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Ben Mathias Tan. The victim was crossing in front of him, but Said did not notice her until he collided with her and heard a knock against his van, said the prosecutor. The accident was captured by a closed-circuit television camera. A mechanical inspection did not find any evidence of possible mechanical failure to Said's van that could have caused or contributed to the collision. There was also no report of traffic light malfunctions on the day of the accident, according to a report dated Apr 24, 2020. Mr Tan added that Said did not perform any dangerous manoeuvres and was not driving a heavy vehicle, hence his culpability was low. But he highlighted that the accident happened at a pedestrian crossing where the victim was crossing ""slowly and steadily on foot in full visibility"". Said was unrepresented, after his lawyer discharged himself at the start of the court hearing. The punishment for careless driving causing death is jail for up to three years, a fine of up to S$10,000 or both."

Malaysian Mohamad Fazli Abdul Rahman, 38, faces one charge of conspiring with lorry driver Mohamed Alias to arrange for Singaporean Pi Jiapeng to hide in the container compartment of a Malaysian registered lorry. Pi was arrested last month for alleged cheating offences. Together with his wife, Thai national Siriwipa Pansuk, they fled the country on Jul 4, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) said previously. Alias, 40, was charged earlier this month with helping Pi and Pansuk to leave Singapore illegally. The lorry driver allegedly drove the vehicle hiding the couple on Jul 4, at about 7.25pm at Tuas Checkpoint's departure cargo section. The Singapore Police Force said on Friday that Fazli was arrested in Malaysia ""with strong cooperation and assistance from the Royal Malaysia Police"".  If convicted, he could be jailed for between six months and two years, and fined up to S$6,000.  Arrest warrants and Interpol red notices have been issued against Pi and Pansuk, after at least 180 police reports involving two companies, Tradenation and Tradeluxury, were made since June. The complainants said they made advance payments for luxury watches or bags, but they did not receive the products. While some media reports said the total value of the undelivered luxury watches and bags was S$32 million, CNA understands that victims who made police reports have not received goods worth at least S$20 million as of Jul 17. Pi, 26, was arrested on Jun 27 for his suspected involvement in cheating offences. His passport was impounded and he was released on bail on Jun 29. Pansuk, 27, was also assisting the police with investigations and surrendered her passport to officers on Jun 30. Both subsequently became uncontactable. According to Interpol, Pi was born in Fujian, China, while Pansuk is from Roi Et, a province in central north-eastern Thailand. "

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/maid-slap-hit-101-year-old-woman-abuse-cctv-jail-2844801,"Maid jailed after caught on CCTV slapping, hitting 101-year-old woman","SINGAPORE: A domestic worker was jailed for eight weeks on Friday (Jul 29) after slapping and using a cup to hit the head of a 101-year-old woman. Ngaisah, 48, pleaded guilty to two charges of voluntarily causing hurt to the elderly woman whom she had been looking after for five years. The victim suffered from dementia and could not recognise her family members nor communicate with them. She was dependent on Ngaisah, who goes by one name, to meet her daily needs. The two lived together in a flat in Lorong Ah Soo. On Apr 26, the victim's family installed a closed-circuit television camera in the living room of the flat to monitor them. A family member viewed the footage later that day and lodged a police report after seeing how the elderly woman was treated. The footage, which was played in court, showed that at about 6pm on Apr 26, the Indonesian maid was feeding the victim as they sat next to each other on the living room sofa. While feeding her, Ngaisah held the victim close, slapped her cheek once and then let go of her. The victim was seen holding and rubbing her cheek due to the pain. Ngaisah continued to forcefully feed the victim. About half an hour later, she helped the woman to take her medication and drink water from a plastic cup. When the water was finished, CCTV footage showed Ngaisah hitting the victim's head once with the cup. The victim was seen rubbing her forehead. After the offences were discovered, the victim was taken to the hospital, and no obvious injuries were found on her. The elderly woman was unable to tell medical staff what had happened to her. She was admitted and discharged a week later. The victim's ability to protect herself from abuse was impaired by her dementia, making her a vulnerable person. Ngaisah knew this and was hence liable for enhanced punishment, said the prosecution. The prosecutor asked for 10 to 12 weeks' jail, highlighting Ngaisah's ""blatant"" abuse of trust and authority, as the family depended on her to look after the elderly woman. She argued that such abuse was difficult to detect given the victim's dementia and minimally communicative state, and would not have been discovered if not for the CCTV. Ngaisah, who was not represented, told the judge that she was sorry for her mistakes and asked for leniency as she has family back home. The punishment for voluntarily causing hurt is up to three years' jail, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both. If the offender knew the victim was a vulnerable person, the maximum sentence is doubled."

Jacob Quek Kuan Liat, 41, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years' jail on Friday (Jul 29) after pleading guilty to an amalgamated charge of criminal breach of trust by an employee. The offences took place more than half a year after Quek started working as a checkpoint manager for the healthcare provider in June 2020. One of his responsibilities was to collect the payments from travellers arriving from Malaysia for COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction tests. Each PCR test cost S$160. The cash proceeds from the night shift and day shift would be collated and handed over for banking into Parkway Shenton's account. Between Jan 28, 2021 and Jun 16, 2021, Quek misappropriated the proceeds to sustain his gambling addiction, using it to place football bets. He would then return money to Parkway Shenton if he won. He made more than S$180,000 in voluntary restitution this way. The offences were discovered when Quek turned himself in at a neighbourhood police centre on Jun 22, 2021. The prosecutor asked for 42 to 45 months' jail, highlighting the substantial amount of money that Quek misappropriated. The judge said it was aggravating that Quek stole the money to feed his gambling addiction. But he also noted that Quek had surrendered himself to the police, paid back about 30 per cent of the stolen money, and signed an agreement to repay the rest after his release. The punishment for criminal breach of trust as an employee is up to 15 years' jail and a fine."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/fake-travel-insurance-claim-14000-woman-jail-2844321,"Jail for woman who made fake travel insurance claims of more than S$14,000","SINGAPORE: After successfully inflating the cost of her damaged luggage in an insurance claim, a woman embarked on a series of fraudulent travel claims totalling more than S$14,000. Siti Saliha Muhammad Hussain, 30, used photos of damaged goods, receipts, boarding passes and police reports that she found online, and altered some of these with Paint and Microsoft Word applications to support her claims. On Friday (Jul 29) she pleaded guilty to six charges of cheating, with 14 more charges taken into consideration. She made a total of 20 fraudulent claims between March 2016 and September 2019, of which 17 resulted in payouts. The companies that fell victim to her scheme were AXA Insurance, AIG Asia Pacific Insurance, NTUC Income Insurance Co-operative, Aviva and FWD Singapore. Siti Saliha was sentenced to five months' jail and will start serving her sentence in September, after being granted a deferment to settle her work and a loan she took out to make full restitution to the insurers. The court heard that in September 2016, Siti Saliha made a trip to Kuala Lumpur with her mother and two sisters. She bought travel insurance policies from AXA and AIG for her family. During the trip, the family's luggage, which was worth about S$200, was damaged while being retrieved from the airport's baggage claim. Siti Saliha recalled that earlier in the year, she was able to inflate the cost of damaged luggage in an insurance claim without providing any supporting receipts. She had also been able to make a separate insurance claim for a piece of luggage even though it was damaged before the trip. ""The accused felt that this was another opportunity to exploit the slack checks and balances in place for travel insurance claims, and intended to do so without her family's knowledge,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutor Angela Ang. She went online and found photos of a damaged Louis Vuitton luggage and receipt, as well as a receipt for Tumi luggage, which she intended to use to inflate the cost of her damaged luggage. She used these documents to submit claims under her own and her mother's and sisters' insurance policies. AXA and AIG disbursed a total of S$750 and S$1,000 respectively for the four fake claims. Having ""tested the system"", Siti Saliha decided to make fake travel insurance claims whenever possible by ensuring that she bought policies for herself and her family before any trips, said Ms Ang. She would occasionally also buy travel insurance policies for the sole purpose of making a fake claim, despite there being no trip planned. While on a trip to Tokyo in April 2017, Siti Saliha accidentally misplaced her wallet containing about S$5,000 and her iPhone. As her policy did not cover loss from personal negligence, she made a false police report in Tokyo that her belongings were stolen. She used the police report in a false claim to AXA. To get around a cap on the payout she could receive, she also claimed that her laptop was stolen, which was not true. The insurer paid out S$2,288 to her. Later that year, Siti Saliha helped one of her sisters buy travel insurance for a trip to Krabi, and retrieved her sister's used boarding pass after she returned. Siti Saliha then found samples of adjusting reports and property irregularity reports online, and amended them on her computer to make reference to her sister's laptop and luggage. She also found old receipts for a laptop and luggage, and searched online for photos of damaged items. She submitted these to MSIG together with her sister's boarding pass, and received a payout of S$1,500. Sometime before February 2019, Siti Saliha also bought her mother a policy for an alleged trip to Pekanbaru. In fact, her mother had no such trip planned and the policy was bought to make a fake claim. She made a false claim that her mother was robbed of S$600 in cash and her iPhone, attaching a doctored sample police report and a doctored photo of a boarding pass that she found online. She received S$1,415 from AXA for this. She repeated this after her mother travelled to Jakarta in March 2019 and after her own trip to Kuala Lumpur in April 2019, claiming that belongings were stolen and submitting doctored police reports when this was untrue. She also volunteered to buy travel insurance for a friend with whom she was travelling to Kuala Lumpur in July 2019. She did so intending to make fake claims for a theft on their return, and got a payout of almost S$1,500 from AIG. The offences were discovered after some of the insurance companies found Siti Saliha's claims suspicious and carried out internal investigations. They then filed police reports against her. The prosecution sought five to seven months' jail, highlighting the lengths that Siti Saliha went to, including opening different email accounts to buy the policies without arousing suspicion. Defence counsel Yamuna Balakrishnan asked for a fine on the basis that her client came from a poor financial background and was the only person providing for her family members, some of whom were ill and not working. Deputy Presiding District Judge Luke Tan said it was ""really quite ironic"" that Siti Saliha highlighted dire financial circumstances in her mitigation when her offences arose from overseas travel. He said there was ""absolutely no basis"" not to impose a jail term, which was supported by the case law. The punishment for cheating is jail for up three years, a fine or both."

CNB officers arrested the pair in a Sentosa hotel room on Wednesday evening. Heroin, Ice, cannabis and methadone were seized from the room.
 
The two of them were then escorted to their hideout in a private residential area near Shenton Way on Thursday morning where more drugs were recovered, said CNB. CNB added that a black luxury sedan was also seized on Thursday. The vehicle is believed to be driven by the man and woman, who are both Singaporean. The total amount of drugs confiscated is sufficient to feed 1,500 abusers for a week, added CNB. ""The seizure of 1,893g of heroin can feed the addiction of about 900 abusers for a week, while the seizure of 4,193g of cannabis can feed the addiction of about 600 abusers for a week."" “These traffickers have no qualms that their luxurious lifestyles - lavish holidays, luxury cars and private residential apartments - are at the expense of other innocent parties, such as the children or loved ones of the drug abusers,"" said Deputy Assistant Commissioner Aaron Tang, Director of CNB's Intelligence Division. Investigations into the suspects’ drug activities are ongoing. Those found guilty of trafficking more than 15g of pure heroin (diamorphine) or 500g of cannabis may face the mandatory death penalty."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ntu-student-peep-man-showering-toilet-2841761,"NTU student peeped at man showering, gets short detention order","SINGAPORE: A Nanyang Technological University (NTU) student who peeped at a man while he was showering was sentenced on Thursday (Jul 28) to a short detention order of two weeks. Xu Ziye, 22, pleaded guilty to two counts of voyeurism and possessing obscene films, with a third charge of criminal trespass considered for sentencing. The 24-year-old victim's identity and the location of the incident are protected by gag order. The court heard that the victim went to the toilet to shower at about 3.30pm on Aug 26, 2020. Xu entered the cubicle next to the victim, intending to use his phone's camera to spy on the man. The victim, who was completely naked, saw Xu lifting his phone over the wall dividing the cubicles and pointing it towards him. He shouted at Xu and immediately started to dress himself. When he came out of the cubicle, he saw Xu running out of the toilet. Xu went back to his room, where he admitted to his girlfriend over text message that he had tried to take a photo of the victim showering, but was caught. Shortly after this, the victim went to Xu's room to confront him. Xu admitted that he was the person in the next cubicle and the victim called the police. After Xu's arrest, two phones and a laptop were seized from him and the data was analysed. More than 720 obscene videos depicting sexual acts were found in the phones. Defence counsel Eric Liew asked for a short detention order, and Deputy Public Prosecutor Nicholas Wuan said he did not object to it, given Xu's relatively young age of 20 at the time of the offences. A short detention order is a community-based sentence under which an offender can be detained in prison for not more than two weeks. District Judge Shaiffudin Saruwan said that Xu's actions involved a high degree of intrusion, but were spontaneous and not highly premeditated. The judge also noted that Xu was a first-time offender. An NTU spokesperson said the university ""takes a zero tolerance approach to sexual misconduct"".  In response to questions, the spokesperson said Xu was suspended for one semester and mandated to undergo counselling. He has since graduated from the university.  The spokesperson told CNA that NTU ""extended support to the individuals involved"" when the incident happened in August 2020.  NTU said any student who commits such acts will be disciplined, including possible suspension or expulsion, depending on the nature and severity of the offence. For the offence of voyeurism, Xu could have been jailed for up to two years, fined, caned or any combination of these punishments. The penalty for possessing obscene films is up to six months' jail, a fine of up to S$20,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tradenation-luxury-goods-scam-timeline-couple-pi-jiapeng-siriwipa-pansuk-police-interpol-2841536,Timeline: How a couple fled Singapore after millions were lost in Tradenation luxury goods scam,"SINGAPORE: After more than five weeks on the run, a couple allegedly involved in a luxury goods scam involving millions of dollars have been arrested. Singaporean Pi Jiapeng, 26, and his wife, 27-year-old Thai national Siriwipa Pansuk were arrested in Malaysia and handed over to Singapore police on Aug 11. This comes after arrest warrants and Interpol notices were issued for the couple. They were charged in court a day later. At least 180 reports have been made to the police about the scam involving two companies – Tradenation and Tradeluxury. While some media reports said the total value of the undelivered luxury watches and bags was S$32 million, it was said in court on Aug 19 that the case involves losses of more than S$20 million. 2021: Victims contact Pi and Pansuk about luxury watches and bags, making advance payments of thousands of dollars for the products. Some buyers told CNA that they had seen Instagram influencers promoting the company, which had many reviews on Carousell and a physical store. Pi and Pansuk befriend some victims, taking them out for meals in restaurants and inviting them to their home. The victims allege that the duo started making excuses for not delivering on the orders. April 2022: Tradenation is registered as a precious stones and metals dealer with the Ministry of Law. Registered dealers are regulated under the Registrar of Regulated Dealers for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism purposes. June 2022: Police receive reports about the companies and about Pi and Pansuk. Some people put up adverts on Carousell warning against Tradenation. One couple told CNA they lost about S$180,000 while another lost about S$20,000. Jun 27, 2022: Pi is arrested by police for his suspected involvement in cheating offences. His passport is impounded. Jun 29, 2022: Pi is released on bail. Jun 30, 2022: Pansuk surrenders her passport to police officers. She was assisting with investigations, police later said. The couple subsequently becomes uncontactable. Jul 4, 2022: Pi and Pansuk allegedly leave Singapore by hiding in the container compartment of a Malaysia-registered lorry. Jul 13, 2022: Lorry driver Mohamed Alias, 40, is arrested for helping Pi and Pansuk leave the country illegally. Jul 15, 2022: Alias is charged with helping Pansuk to leave the country. Jul 20, 2022: The Singapore Police Force (SPF) releases the names of the couple. Police confirm that arrest warrants and Interpol red notices have been issued against Pi and Pansuk. At least 180 reports involving Tradenation and Tradeluxury have been made since June, said the police. According to Interpol, red notices are issued for fugitives wanted either for prosecution or to serve a sentence. It is a request to law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person, pending extradition, surrender or similar legal action. SPF also confirms that it is working with foreign law enforcement agencies to trace the couple and the criminal proceeds. The Law Ministry says it has suspended Tradenation’s registration due to ongoing police investigations. The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) confirms that the couple fled the country by hiding in the container compartment of a lorry. Jul 21, 2022: Pi and Pansuk are listed on Interpol's red notice website. Details show that Pi was born in Fujian, China, while Pansuk is from Roi Et, a province in central northeastern Thailand. Jul 22, 2022: The lorry driver Alias is charged with helping Pi to leave Singapore illegally. He allegedly drove the vehicle hiding the couple on Jul 4, at about 7.25pm at Tuas Checkpoint's departure cargo section. The penalty for this offence is a jail term of between six months and two years, and a fine of up to S$6,000. Jul 24, 2022: In a statement, ICA says all vehicles entering Singapore’s land checkpoints are checked by immigration officers, but doing the same for every outgoing vehicle would have a significant impact on trade and travel. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, about 200,000 travellers departed through land checkpoints daily. ICA added that it calibrated departure checks based on Singapore's prevailing security posture. ""For example, enhanced checks will be conducted on departing conveyances in the aftermath of major security incidents to prevent the perpetrators from leaving Singapore,"" says the authority. Jul 29, 2022: A second person is arrested for allegedly helping Pi and Pansuk flee Singapore illegally. The man, a 38-year-old Malaysian, is alleged to have entered into a conspiracy with Mohamed Alias to commit the offence, said the Singapore Police Force. The 38-year-old was arrested with assistance from the Royal Malaysia Police. Jun 30, 2022: Malaysian Mohamad Fazli Abdul Rahman, 38, is charged with conspiring with Mohamed Alias to help Pi leave the country illegally.   Aug 5, 2022: Appearing before a district court, Alias and Fazli say that they will plead guilty to their charges. Fazli is given a new charge of conspiring with Alias to help Pansuk leave the country illegally, adding to his earlier charge in relation to Pi. The prosecution informs the court that Alias could also be charged with harbouring an offender. They seek an adjournment of two weeks to finalise their position on the charges. Both Alias and Fazli remain in remand as no bail has been offered to them. The prosecution said that their flight risk was high as they were able to facilitate the illegal smuggling of people out of Singapore. They will return to court later in August. Aug 10, 2022: SPF receives information from the Royal Thai Police that Pi and Pansuk may be staying in a hotel in Johor Bahru. SPF seeks the assistance of the Royal Malaysia Police to locate the couple. Aug 11, 2022: Malaysian police arrest Pi and Pansuk in Johor Bahru and hand the couple over to SPF at the Woodlands Checkpoint at about 6pm. SPF says the couple will be charged in court on Aug 12. They face charges of criminal conspiracy to commit cheating and illegal departure from Singapore. ""The Singapore authorities will do whatever is necessary and permissible under Singapore law to pursue and bring to justice those who commit crimes in Singapore, regardless of where they might have fled to,"" SPF says in a news release. ""We will also not hesitate to take firm action against fraudsters."" Aug 12, 2022: Pi and Pansuk are charged in court, appearing via video-link from remand. Two of the three charges are for conspiracy to cheat. The other is for illegally leaving Singapore via Tuas Checkpoint on Jul 4. When the judge asks if they have anything to say, Pi responds that it was ""not right"" for them to have escaped the country illegally. ""It's due to the pressure that we face during that point of time. Me and my wife are facing a lot of death threats and pressure,"" he says. ""It is our mistake to take that decision and we are really very sorry about the trouble."" Through a Thai interpreter, Pansuk says: ""I know that I have done something wrong. I will cooperate with the police for the investigation."" The judge grants the prosecution's request for the pair not to be offered bail as they are ""proven"" flight risks. Aug 19, 2022: Pi and Pansuk remanded for another week as the prosecution requests more time for investigations. Describing the case as ""complex"", the prosecution says the case involves losses of more than S$20 million and more time is needed to determine the whereabouts of the funds."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/serial-offender-molest-12-year-old-schoolgirl-bus-stop-2841411,Serial offender jailed for molesting 12-year-old schoolgirl near bus stop,"SINGAPORE: A serial offender was jailed for 20 months on Thursday (Jul 28) for molesting a 12-year-old schoolgirl near a bus stop in Bendemeer. Neo Beng Yeow, 56, was also sentenced to an additional 10 days' jail as he reoffended while on a remission order for his previous sentence. He pleaded guilty to one charge of outraging the girl's modesty, with a second similar charge considered for sentencing. The victim's identity is protected by gag order. The court heard that on Jul 23, 2021, Neo approached the victim as she was walking towards a bus stop to meet her friends after school.  He held her arm and asked if she had eaten. The girl replied no.  Neo then brushed his hand across her chest over her school uniform. The victim was shocked and hurried towards her friends. Neo also walked towards them and while he was talking to them, one of the victim's friends took a photo of him. Neo then ran to the bus stop and left on a bus. The victim and two of her friends started crying, and some passers-by stopped to help them. One of them made a police report. The victim's school vice-principal approached the group at the bus stop a while later and they told her what had happened. The vice-principal then brought them to the school to wait for the police. Neo has two previous convictions for outrage of modesty, and was sentenced to 15 months in jail each time, Deputy Public Prosecutor Theong Li Han told the court. In 2017, he kissed a nine-year-old girl on the lips and touched her head.  In 2019, he hugged and kissed the forehead of a six-year-old girl. Ms Theong, who sought the sentence imposed, argued that Neo predominantly targeted girls in primary school and would be aware of their ages as they were wearing their school uniforms. She added that while Neo did not make skin-to-skin contact with the 12-year-old victim, he had intruded upon her private part. Defence counsels Tan Kah Tian and Shane Goh asked for a shorter sentence of 16 months' jail, arguing that Neo's touch was fleeting and the degree of sexual exploitation was relatively low. They added that an Institute of Mental Health report indicated Neo would benefit from psychiatric treatment. They said Neo was willing to undergo such treatment, and that he was remorseful and committed to never offend again. District Judge Christopher Goh said that Neo's previous convictions for similar offences were the most aggravating factor affecting his sentence. The punishment for using criminal force to outrage the modesty of a child below 14 is up to five years' jail, a fine, caning, or any combination of these punishment. Neo cannot be caned as he is above 50, and the prosecution did not seek additional jail time in lieu of caning."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/charles-yeo-lawyers-liberty-appeal-death-sentence-drug-trafficking-pay-costs-2838721,"Charles Yeo, Lawyers for Liberty ordered to pay costs for failed challenges against 2 death row cases","SINGAPORE: Lawyer Charles Yeo and Malaysian non-profit organisation Lawyers for Liberty (LFL) were on Wednesday (Jul 27) ordered to pay costs after their unsuccessful attempts to challenge the death sentences of two drug traffickers. The Court of Appeal ordered Mr Yeo to pay S$4,000 to the Attorney-General and Public Prosecutor, while LFL was ordered to pay S$1,000 to the Public Prosecutor. The Court of Appeal had dismissed two applications to set aside the death sentences of drug traffickers Roslan Bakar and Pausi Jefridin after hearings held in February. Roslan and Pausi were convicted and sentenced to death in 2010 for the capital offence of trafficking not less than 96.07g of heroin (diamorphine). Their appeals were dismissed in 2011. Their latest challenges were filed in the days before their scheduled executions on Feb 16. LFL joined Roslan and Pausi as a party in the first application, and Mr Yeo represented them in both applications. Mr Yeo had argued that it was unconstitutional to carry out a death sentence on offenders suffering from significant mental disorder. A High Court previously heard evidence from experts that Roslan had an IQ of 74 and Pausi had an IQ of 67. These claims were disputed by the prosecution's own experts. That judge ultimately found that neither Roslan nor Pausi suffered from an abnormality of mind that impaired his responsibility for the offence committed. The Court of Appeal dismissed the latest applications as no new evidence was produced regarding Roslan and Pausi's mental state. The judges found that there was no basis to review their sentences. When the judges questioned Mr Yeo about LFL's interest in the proceedings, he said that the organisation was assisting Roslan and Pausi as it was against the death penalty. Rejecting this reason, the court also made the finding that LFL had no standing to be a party to the application. After the applications were dismissed, the Attorney-General and Public Prosecutor applied for costs to be ordered against Mr Yeo and LFL. They argued that Mr Yeo's conduct in bringing the applications to the court was improper, citing serious procedural and substantive deficiencies in his submissions. They also argued that the applications were a ""legal filibuster to frustrate and delay"" the carrying out of Roslan and Pausi's executions. They asked the court to order S$25,000 in costs against Mr Yeo for the two applications. Mr Yeo countered that he did not charge or earn any fees for acting for Roslan and Pausi, and asked the court to order not more than S$2,000 in costs. The judges found that Mr Yeo acted improperly in filing both applications when he had no material to justify them. ""As a qualified lawyer of four years' standing, he should have known that it was his duty to determine whether there was any proper case to put forward to the court – he could not just act willy-nilly on the basis of his clients' instructions or desires,"" they said. The judges also considered his ""sincere passion"" to help his clients and ""youthful enthusiasm"", but warned that this was insufficient. In respect of LFL, the Attorney-General argued that the organisation abused the court's process and participated in the legal proceedings to further its own cause of campaigning against the death penalty. The Attorney-General asked the court to order S$2,000 in costs against the organisation. LFL's representative, Mr N Surendran, countered that the court's power to order costs was ""unconstitutional"" and had an ""oppressive"" and ""chilling"" effect, according to court documents. He argued that costs orders had the ""inevitable effect of preventing or intimidating NGOs ... or concerned members of the public or lawyers from assisting or ensuring access to justice for the prisoners or their families"". The judges rejected this argument, saying that Roslan and Pausi had ""ample access"" to the courts and assistance from defence counsel, and that their cases were given ""exhaustive consideration"". ""Given the gravity of the right to a fair trial and the importance of access to justice, allegations of breaches of the same which could impugn the criminal justice system ought not to be made lightly,"" they said. They also highlighted that the power to order costs can only be exercised if the application was frivolous, vexatious or otherwise an abuse of the process of the court."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/drunk-man-punch-knock-out-stranger-kick-ttsh-nurse-2838506,"Man gets jail for punching stranger, kicking TTSH nurse while drunk","SINGAPORE: A man was sentenced to seven weeks' jail on Wednesday (Jul 27) for punching a stranger on the street and kicking a nurse at Tan Tock Seng Hospital while drunk. Adam William Fletcher, 40, pleaded guilty to two charges of voluntarily causing hurt in the incidents in June last year. Fletcher knocked out the ""blameless"" 57-year-old stranger with a single punch and kicked the nurse while she was giving him medical attention, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Zhi Hao. The court heard that Fletcher and another man went to a bar on East Coast Road, where he drank about five pints of beer, on Jun 25, 2021. Later that evening, both men went to an alley behind the bar where they got into an argument, during which Fletcher pushed his companion. Their dispute was broken up by a passerby, and Fletcher walked away from the alley at about 10.30pm. Around this time, Fletcher noticed the 57-year-old victim walking along East Coast Road. As the victim walked towards him, Fletcher suddenly swung out his left arm and punched his head. The man fell down immediately and lost consciousness, hitting the back of his head against the ground. He regained consciousness a few minutes later with the help of others passing by. Fletcher fled from the scene, but the assault had been captured on video by a passerby. Police later found Fletcher behaving in a drunken and disorderly manner along Mountbatten Road. He was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital at about 1am on Jun 26, 2021. Medical personnel assessed him to be intoxicated and combative. He had abrasions on both knees. At about 5am, the second victim, a 40-year-old nurse, was on duty in the hospital's emergency department. She was holding onto Fletcher's leg so that the doctor could administer an intravenous drip to him. Fletcher started reacting aggressively, struggling violently and kicking his legs in the direction of the attending nurses. He also spouted vulgarities, asking medical staff to ""get your ... hands off me"". During this struggle, he kicked the second victim once in her left upper chest and collarbone. She had to stop her work because of pain and immediately went to consult a doctor about her injuries. The 57-year-old victim was taken to the hospital with bleeding and tenderness at his head. He felt disoriented and confused as a result of his head injury. He was diagnosed with a concussion and given three days' medical leave when he sought follow-up medical treatment the next day. He subsequently experienced severe anxiety and low mood. He was assessed to have severe anxiety and post-traumatic stress from the assault, and required counselling. He was later also found to have fractured his elbow in the assault. He incurred more than S$3,800 in medical fees, for which Fletcher made compensation. The nurse was diagnosed with a contusion at her chest and given three days of medical leave. The prosecution sought eight weeks' jail, highlighting that the attacks were unprovoked. Fletcher was represented by lawyer Mr Sarindar Singh. The punishment for voluntarily causing hurt is up to three years' jail, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tradenation-tradeluxury-scam-couple-victims-watches-2834866,"We were friends: Couple who lost S$180,000 on how they fell victim to luxury goods scam","SINGAPORE: When husband and wife Jasper and Alice (not their real names) bought a luxury watch online, they did not know it would be the start of a close friendship with a couple who eventually went on the run, allegedly with S$180,000 of their money and millions of dollars from other victims.  The couple decided to order their first watch from Tradenation in September last year after seeing Instagram influencers promoting the company and reading many positive customer reviews on e-commerce platform Carousell.  “My husband was a little bit sceptical at first. But I told him, just give it a leap of faith since it’s a Singapore company and somebody actually promoted it. It shouldn't be a scam or something, right?” Alice told CNA. They did not see any negative reviews left by customers on the company's Carousell page, which advertised watches with a wait time of two to four weeks. ""Everyone said they received their watch,” she said. The day Jasper and Alice met Siriwipa Pansuk to collect their first watch, she took the couple to a watch shop in Orchard Road to authenticate the purchase. The watch was authentic, and the couple decided she was trustworthy even though the delivery of the watch was delayed by a few days.  She then asked the couple out for dinner on the same day, and they had dinner together at an upscale restaurant in a hotel. After the restaurant closed, the 27-year-old Thai national invited the couple to her home.  “We found that we could click quite well and we became friends,” Alice said, adding that the other couple encouraged them to also start an account on Carousell buying and selling watches at a profit.  For months, Jasper and Alice frequently met Pansuk and her husband Pi Jiapeng, a 26-year-old Singaporean. The four of them chatted, had meals together and went shopping.  It was not a business relationship involving the buying and selling of watches, but a friendship, Jasper said. “The husband talked a lot about cars, talked a lot about watches. So we had common topics ... and we met up almost every other day.”   Pansuk and Pi are accused of cheating victims like Jasper and Alice who made advance payments for luxury watches and bags they sold under two companies – Tradenation and Tradeluxury.  Arrest warrants and Interpol notices have been issued against the couple, who are wanted in connection with a series of cheating cases associated with these companies. As of Jul 20, at least 180 reports involving the two companies have been made, said the Singapore Police Force. While some media reports said the total value of the undelivered goods was S$32 million, CNA understands that the victims who made police reports have not received goods worth at least S$20 million as of Jul 17. As time passed, Jasper and Alice’s friendship with the couple became more intense. Months into the friendship, Pansuk and Pi, or “JP” as the couple called him, invited them to their home to meet Pansuk's grandmother and have meals cooked by a private chef.  “I just felt that it was a bit too much and that it was another red flag. Nobody does things to that extent … Her grandmother comes over and (they get a) private chef,” said Jasper, adding that this took place in November to December 2021.  “It’s just too ridiculous. After that time, we started to distance ourselves because I realised something was not right.”  Alice said they did not dare to raise their suspicions because Pansuk ""always says 'I can sue you'"". ""And of course we didn't want to get into any trouble because we're running a business as well ... We also did not have any concrete evidence that it was really a scam,"" she said. In January this year, Pansuk suggested that Jasper and Alice purchase more products from them. Jasper said he felt then that something was ""very fishy"". But his doubts abated slightly when the couple told them they would be opening a physical store.  “That's when I thought I was thinking too much ... They have a shop and need to start it up, need to buy more watches – that’s what they told me – to get ready for the shop’s opening."" And so they bought more watches from the couple. They waited months and despite repeated requests, did not get the products they paid for.  Jasper and Alice made a police report on Jun 11. Alice said she received text messages from Pansuk berating Jasper for making a police report.  “She said: 'I got a report from your husband. Very disappointed when you all know us for a while, but still like this. Anyway tell your husband, please wait until the court is done then see if he can get his money.'”  Pi was arrested on Jun 27 for his suspected involvement in cheating offences, the police said previously. His passport was impounded and he was released on bail on Jun 28, pending the completion of investigations.  Pansuk was also assisting the police with investigations and surrendered her passport to officers on Jun 30.  The couple fled Singapore on Jul 4 by hiding in the container compartment of a lorry. The lorry driver has been charged with helping them escape. They still owe Jasper and Alice about S$180,000. At one point, the outstanding amount was S$850,000, but Pi and Pansuk paid part of this back in multiple transactions after repeated demands.  According to Jasper and Alice, when they made their police report, they were advised that this was a breach of contract and that they should engage a lawyer.  Just before Pi and Pansuk fled Singapore, Alice and Jasper tried to trace the couple’s whereabouts, but were always a step behind. Another victim CNA spoke to said his first order with Pi and Pansuk went smoothly. But he waited four months for his second order and received a watch that was not brand new, unlike what was advertised.  The victim, who wanted to be known only as Marcus, said his last purchase with Tradenation was in June when he bought two Rolex watches for his friend and for himself.  The couple told him another customer had bought more Rolexes that would be delivered in two weeks. They asked if he wanted to buy over some of the watches as that customer needed cash urgently.  Marcus bought another watch and paid them a total of S$78,000. But two weeks went by and no watches were delivered. The couple told him that the shipments were delayed, but Pi began ignoring his WhatsApp messages and refused to take his calls. “Suddenly, they messaged me – sorry, we are under investigation now,” Marcus said. He made a police report on Jul 1 and joined a Telegram group with more than 180 other victims who were waiting for their goods.  Some victims had already started legal proceedings against Pi and Pansuk, he said.  “There were so many victims before me, and they went as far (back) as January.”  Some of the victims were first-time buyers, who were misled by Tradenation’s legitimacy due to its physical store and its registration with the Ministry of Law, said Marcus.  Tradenation was registered as a precious stones and metals dealer. Registered dealers are regulated only for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism purposes, the ministry said previously. Its registration has since been suspended. First-time buyer Justine (not her real name) ordered a Rolex Submariner worth close to S$20,000 on behalf of a friend. She told CNA that purchasing the watch from an authorised dealer or a Rolex shop would have meant a wait of several years. “We actually put our name on the (authorised dealer's waitlist), just that we need to wait for a very long time. If you want to get the watch faster, this is the only way.” Tradenation also was selling the watch for about 10 per cent cheaper than its retail price. “(I wanted to) get the first one and see if they can deliver ... If it was okay, we actually planned to buy some more,” said Justine. But after she made her purchase in May, the excuses from the couple began. First, they told her that the watch would take about two weeks to be delivered. Then they said the shipment was delayed. “They did mention that if I wanted a refund, I can request a refund. I did not at that time because I've already waited this long and then they promised that the shipment will arrive at the end of the month,” Justine said. At the end of May, the couple said that the watch had arrived in Singapore but was stuck in customs due to a “tax clearance issue”. It would only be delivered to her towards the end of June. Justine’s subsequent messages to them from mid-June went unanswered. She eventually made a police report in July. “After the incident, I explained to my friend and then we split the cost. (He was) devastated, pissed off, but cannot do anything.” The money lost is a ""significant amount"" of her savings, Justine said. “I'm still hoping that we can get some back, hopefully even a small portion of the amount I would be okay – at least we have something back.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/iris-koh-jipson-quah-doctor-healing-divide-covid-19-vaccine-moh-2837986,"Iris Koh, suspended doctor and assistant linked to Healing the Divide group get more charges","SINGAPORE: Iris Koh, the founder of the Healing the Divide group that has a known stance against COVID-19 vaccination, was on Wednesday (Jul 27) handed two more charges of conspiring to defraud the Ministry of Health (MOH). Koh, 46, appeared in court on Wednesday and now faces a total of four charges. She was given permission to travel to Malaysia last month for cancer treatment. Her two new charges involve Jipson Quah, a doctor linked to Healing the Divide, and his assistant Thomas Chua Cheng Soon. Both men also received several new charges on Wednesday. Koh is accused of conspiring with Quah, Chua and another person, named Cedric Lim Junqi @ Mohammad Daniel Lim in charge sheets, to make false representations to MOH that Lim was vaccinated with the Sinopharm vaccine when he was not. This allegedly took place on Jan 14. According to court documents, she is accused of a similar conspiracy with Quah and another man named Gary Tho Kong Choong to defraud MOH in October last year that Tho was vaccinated with the Sinopharm vaccine. This comes on top of her two existing charges. One charge is for conspiring with Quah to defraud MOH into believing people were vaccinated with the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine between July 2021 and January this year. Koh's other existing charge is for obstructing a police inspector by refusing to sign and tearing up a copy of her statement in January. Quah, 34, and his assistant, Chua, 40, now face a total of 10 and seven charges respectively after receiving several fresh charges. Both men already faced one charge each of conspiring to make false representation to MOH that a woman was vaccinated with the Sinopharm vaccine when she was not, from December 2021 to January this year. The charge was amended on Wednesday to list the woman's full name as Mehrajunnisha Quaide Milath, and name an additional person, Milath Quaide, as part of the conspiracy. Quah is now accused of conspiring to defraud MOH by claiming that nine more people were vaccinated with the Sinopharm vaccine when they were not. Six of his charges also involve Chua. This includes the two charges where he is named as a co-conspirator with Koh and Chua. Quah and Chua allegedly conspired with David Christopher Newton, 43, to defraud MOH that he and a woman named Apinya Wonglangka were vaccinated with the Sinopharm vaccine when they were not. This allegedly took place between Dec 29, 2021 and Jan 15, court documents said. Newton was earlier charged over his alleged involvement in the false representation. According to court records, he will return to court for a pre-trial conference in August. The doctor and his assistant then allegedly engaged in another similar conspiracy to defraud MOH that a woman named Elizabeth Monica Paglar, a man named Stephen Columbus Sayson and another woman named Natalie Carmella Sayson were vaccinated when they were not on Jan 19. The charges that Quah faces alone are for conspiring with Ngo Soh Yong and Sim Hong Ow to make false representations to MOH that they were vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine when they were not, between Oct 16, 2021 and Nov 6, 2021. Deputy Public Prosecutor Etsuko Lim said it was likely that further charges would be made against Quah and Chua. She asked for a six-week adjournment for investigations to continue. Koh was represented by lawyer Mr Wee Pan Lee and Quah was represented by Mr Anand Nalachandran, while Chua was unrepresented. All three accused had their bail extended and will return to court on Sep 7. Quah has been suspended by the Singapore Medical Council for 18 months from Mar 23, or until the conclusion of his disciplinary proceedings. He was allegedly paid up to S$1,500 to inject patients with saline solution instead of a COVID-19 vaccine, and upload their false vaccination statuses to MOH's National Immunisation Registry, according to the council. The offence of making false representation to MOH carries a jail term of up to 20 years, a fine or both. If convicted of voluntarily obstructing a public servant in the discharge of their public functions, Koh could be jailed for up to three months, fined up to S$2,500 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-jailed-market-manipulation-skyone-shares-2836286,"Man jailed for market manipulation, unauthorised trading and cheating","SINGAPORE: A 36-year-old man was sentenced to three years and three months' jail on Tuesday (Jul 26) for manipulating the share price of Sky One Holdings Limited and other offences.  Justin Goh Hanshi pleaded guilty to 12 charges, including nine under the Securities and Futures Act for market manipulation and unauthorised trading.  The other three charges were for cheating two financial institutions into disbursing hundreds of thousands of dollars to accounts controlled by Goh.  Another 21 charges were taken into consideration during sentencing. In a news release, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) said that in September and October 2013, Goh had directed three trading representatives to ""push up and maintain"" the share price of Sky One Holdings. At the time, the company was listed on the Singapore Exchange's (SGX) Catalist platform for fast-growing enterprises.  The three representatives used 15 trading accounts belonging to their clients, friends and family to buy and sell Sky One shares to manipulate the market. Goh also used 12 trading accounts belonging to his friends and family to ""conduct trades for his own benefit"", said the SPF.  All the trades were performed without the consent of the respective trading firms, the police added.  Investigations also revealed that Goh ""instigated"" three nominees - who were his friends and family members - to open share financing accounts with two financial institutions. Although the accounts were opened in the nominees' names, it was Goh who had ""full and effective control"" over them, said the police.  Goh then arranged for Sky One shares to be transferred to the nominees. He used the shares as collateral for a loan, which he used to buy more shares.  He again used the new shares as collateral to borrow more money.  In total, the financial institutions involved were cheated into disbursing more than S$4.2 million to the accounts controlled by Goh.  On Oct 28, 2013, Sky One shares opened at S$0.46. By about 10.50am, the price plummeted to S$0.043, a 90 per cent drop. Following the crash of Sky One's share price, the financial institutions sold the shares that had been pledged to them.  The institutions are still owed at least S$779,845.96, said the police.  The three trading representatives were also convicted of unauthorised trading and sentenced to three months to three and a half months' jail.  The three nominees have also been hauled to court. One has been sentenced to eight months' jail for cheating, while court proceedings against the other two are ongoing."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sugar-daddy-sugar-baby-sex-money-cheat-17-year-old-girls-2836041,Serial cheat posed as rich 'sugar daddy' to deceive 17-year-old girls into sex,"SINGAPORE: Less than a year after being released from prison, a jobless man posed as a rich ""sugar daddy"" to deceive three 17-year-old girls into having sex with him for money. The girls never received any payment. One of them was also duped into lending the man money and threatened into finding girls to keep him company. Tan Chip Huat, 49, pleaded guilty to seven counts of cheating, dishonestly obtaining services, criminal intimidation and intentionally causing alarm on Monday (Jul 25). Another 13 similar charges will be considered when he returns for sentencing in August. The three teens were among 10 victims Tan cheated of more than S$72,000, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Eric Hu. Their identities are protected by gag order. Tan, who has previous convictions for cheating in 2005 and 2013, was released from prison in 2020. He targeted his latest victims between January and August last year. Tan knew that he had financial difficulties and never intended to pay the victims, but still led them on because he was ""having fun"", said the prosecutor. His ruse involved posing as a high-flyer in the financial industry who earned S$50,000 to S$60,000 a month, court documents stated. He also pretended to work in a family business. Tan claimed to live in a condominium with a personal chauffeur, and told one victim that he indulged his ex-girlfriends with expensive gifts. In fact, he was unemployed during the offences, and previously worked as a cleaner earning less than S$2,000 a month. Tan met the first 17-year-old victim, identified as V3 in court documents, through online classifieds website Locanto on Jan 4, 2021. The girl responded to Tan's post offering S$5,000 a month for a ""sugar girlfriend"" as she needed financial help with her school fees. Tan offered to sponsor V3's tuition fees at an arts school, amounting to S$20,000, in exchange for sexual services. She agreed. They met at a hotel on Jan 5, 2021 and had sex. Tan told V3 he would pay her S$10,000 first as he needed to keep some spare cash. He told her the bank transfer would be effected on Jan 10, 2021 and also convinced her to lend him S$400. But when V3 checked her bank account on Jan 10, 2021, no money had been transferred. Tan gave various excuses when he was confronted about this over the following days. He also continued asking V3 to meet up or introduce her friends to him. During one such phone conversation on Jan 8, 2021, Tan shouted at V3 when she said she could not find anyone to accompany him that night. Tan was aware that one of V3's close friends - another 17-year-old victim identified as V5 in court documents - worked as a social escort. He threatened to expose V5 to police unless V3 got V5 to transfer him S$500 as a loan. Afraid of the possible damage to V5's reputation, V3 transferred the S$500 to Tan herself without telling her friend. Tan said he would repay the loan as well as the payment he owed V3. He never did. Faced with Tan's continued requests for companionship, V3 asked a friend - identified as V4 in court documents - if she would have sex with him for S$1,000. V4, a 17-year-old single mother with an infant son, agreed as she needed the money. She met Tan on Jan 8, 2021. When V4 did not receive the payment after three days, she confronted Tan, who told her he would pay her an extra S$100 to compensate for the delay. V4 complained to V3 about the delay, saying that she really needed the money. V3 then decided to transfer S$1,100 to her friend out of her own pocket, thinking that she would be reimbursed by Tan. When Tan learnt about this, he became upset that V3 had paid V4 on his behalf, because she had taken money from her father to make the payment. Over the phone, Tan demanded that V4 return the money to V3 or he would look up her address and beat her and her baby up. Both girls arranged for V4 to temporarily transfer some money to V3 to make it look like she had repaid the S$1,100, in order to appease Tan. Tan, who still owed V3 and V4 money, started threatening V3 that he would withhold the payments unless she found someone to keep him company. In a panic, V3 approached her friend V5, telling her that Tan would pay S$3,000 for sexual services. V5 agreed and V3 accompanied her to meet Tan on Jan 13, 2021. Like V3 and V4 before her, V5 did not receive the payment she was promised. The prosecutor said that V3 did not benefit in any way from introducing her friends to Tan, and that she, V4 and V5 never received any of the payments they were owed. He added that Tan also did not pay back V3 a sum of at least S$2,500 that she lent him for his personal expenses. Tan was arrested on Jan 21, 2021, but continued to cheat women after his arrest up to August that year. One was a 25-year-old woman whom Tan met through Locanto in early May 2021. She told him that she had credit card debts of about S$5,000. Tan offered to help the woman settle her debts by transferring S$77,000 to her for safekeeping, claiming that he was bad at managing his finances. A few days later, learning that Tan needed money, the woman lent him her credit card to buy gifts for his parents as she believed she would be getting S$77,000 from him. Tan used her credit card to make several purchases, including iPhones that he resold for profit. The victim's losses were estimated at more than S$11,600. When the woman later confronted Tan, he wrote her two cheques that bounced. As an excuse, Tan also sent the victim an image of a nurse in a hospital and told her that he was hospitalised. She did an online search and found that the image was taken from a website. She also searched Tan's name and found that he had previously been convicted for cheating offences. She made a police report on Jun 15, 2021. Another victim was a 23-year-old woman who worked part-time as a social escort. On Jul 5, 2021, Tan responded to her advertisements on Locanto. They had dinner that same day and he offered her S$10,000 for a long-term sexual relationship, writing her a cheque. The pair had sex later that night. The woman deposited the cheque in her account the next day but it bounced. With the help of Project X, an organisation that assists sex workers, she negotiated a payment of S$3,500 with Tan instead. But the cheque that Tan wrote for this sum bounced again, and he continued to make various excuses for the non-payment. The woman made a police report on Jul 19, 2021. Mr Hu asked the court to order an assessment of Tan's suitability for corrective training, while defence counsels Mr Jerald Foo and Ms Levin Lin argued for no more than four years' jail. Corrective training involves incarceration for between five and 14 years and is usually imposed on repeat offenders. It is a separate regime from imprisonment, with no early release. The prosecutor said that Tan would likely be sentenced to more than 10 years' jail under regular imprisonment. He argued that Tan was a persistent offender who reoffended less than a year after being released from prison in 2020, and that his methods of deception had evolved over time. He also said that Tan would have been charged with obtaining underage sex if he had gone through with his promise to pay the 17-year-old victims for sex. Those who cheat and dishonestly obtain services can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined. The penalty for criminal intimidation is up to two years' jail, a fine or both. Those who intentionally cause alarm to another person can be jailed up to six months, fined up to S$5,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/girl-group-assault-low-iq-victim-urine-drink-bottle-2835906,Girl who joined week-long group assault on victim with low IQ gets reformative training,"SINGAPORE: A 16-year-old girl who joined a week-long group assault on a teenage boy with low IQ was sentenced to at least one year of reformative training on Tuesday (Jul 26). Reformative training is a harsher punishment than probation that detains younger offenders in a structured environment with an emphasis on rehabilitation. The 19-year-old victim was reported missing by his social worker and younger sister, and eventually found in a critical condition in a hotel room on Tyrwhitt Road. The girl, called A1 in court documents, cannot be named as she was a minor when she committed the offences and protected under the Children and Young Persons Act. She carried out the assault together with Muhammad Shahfakhry Mohamad Faizal, 21, Putri Nuramira Aishah Rosli, 19, and another 16-year-old girl. She pleaded guilty to one charge each of voluntarily causing hurt, mischief and taking methamphetamine. The victim was studying at APSN Delta Senior School for students with mild intellectual disability prior to the incident. He had known A1 since 2018, and met Shahfakhry through her in 2021. The court heard that on Jan 15, A1, Shahfakhry and Putri met at the hotel room to take drugs. The victim joined them after asking A1 where she was. From Jan 17, the victim started staying over at the hotel room. That day, Shahfakhry started slapping, punching and kicking the victim. A1 also became upset with the victim that day. She told Shahfakhry that the victim wanted to have sex with her without her consent. Shahfakhry punched and kicked the victim after this, and A1 also slapped and kicked his head a few times. The other 16-year-old girl recorded a video of these acts. From Jan 17 to Jan 25, the victim was abused with various implements and methods by A1 and her three co-accused. Some of the incidents were recorded, and A1 was present for most of them. On Jan 19, A1 also had the idea to urinate into a bottle of iced lemon tea and give it to the victim, and did this. When Shahfakhry asked A1 what was in the bottle, she said that it contained her urine. Shahfakhry then asked the victim to drink it, and the victim complied. This constituted the charge of mischief against A1. After the group saw that the victim was in a bad condition on Jan 25, they stopped hitting him and bought medication and bandages to tend to his wounds. That same day, the victim's social worker and younger sister made police reports saying that the victim had not returned home after leaving about two weeks ago. The victim's sister also told police that on Jan 23, she saw a social media post with a photo of someone badly injured, whom she recognised as her brother. The police eventually traced the victim to the hotel and found him in a room with A1, Shahfakhry and Putri. All three were arrested then, and the other 16-year-old girl was also arrested later. After methamphetamine was found in urine samples after her arrest, A1 also admitted to taking the drug. When police found the victim, he was assessed to be in critical condition and taken to hospital. He was found to have amnesia possibly due to traumatic brain injury, and extensive pooling of blood at his scalp. He had chemical burns to his scalp, face and back and a small amount of air in his upper chest, which was likely from traumatic perforation. The victim also suffered fractures around his eye and cigarette butt burns, slash wounds and lacerations around his body. Doctors had to provide nutritional support during his hospital stay from Jan 26 to Feb 4, as he was unable to take food orally partly due to acute stress reaction. The punishment for voluntarily causing hurt is jail for up to three years, fined up to S$5,000 or both. The offence of mischief is punishable with up to two years' jail, a fine or both. Those who take methamphetamine can be jailed for one to 10 years and fined up to S$20,000."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-jailed-bribery-false-evidence-stabbing-case-cpib-2835711,Man convicted in stabbing incident gets jail for bribing his victims during appeal,"SINGAPORE: A man who was earlier convicted in a stabbing incident received on Tuesday (Jul 26) another six months' jail for bribing two victims to give false evidence during his appeal. The case stretches back to 2012, when Muraleindren Thoondy stabbed three people following a fight in the Liang Court area. The 53-year-old was subsequently charged for the assault, and sentenced to three-and-a-half years' imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane in 2015. During the trial, two of his victims - brothers Santhiran Mayalagu and Surash Mayalagu - had identified him as their assailant.  But Muraleindren then filed an appeal against both his conviction and sentence. Through his lawyers, he filed a criminal motion to submit further evidence, in which Santhiran and Surash said they had mistaken Muraleindren for the assailant.  The two statutory declarations were eventually found to be untrue and the case was referred to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau. It was later found that Muraleindren, with the help of a middleman, had given Santhiran and Surash a bribe to file the false evidence.  Investigations revealed that Muraleindren had given S$10,000 in cash to Santhiran, in return for Santhiran and Surash to state that they had misidentified Muraleindren as the assailant.  Muraleindren's appeal was dismissed in 2016, and the sentence was upheld. For intentionally giving false evidence, Santhiran and Surash were both convicted and sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment in 2020. The middleman, Sinevigneshwaraneckman Many, was sentenced to four months’ jail this February for abetting Muraleindren in the giving of the bribe. Anyone convicted of a corruption offence can be fined up to S$100,000 or sentenced to jail of up to five years, or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/nus-research-fellow-false-claims-40000-thomas-teh-2833666,"Former NUS researcher jailed for making false claims of almost S$40,000","SINGAPORE: A former research fellow was on Monday (Jul 25) jailed for 20 weeks for making almost S$40,000 worth of false claims from the National University of Singapore (NUS). Thomas Teh Kok Hiong, 42, started serving his sentence immediately. He earlier pleaded guilty to five counts of cheating and two counts of forgery. Eighteen other similar charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. The court previously heard that Teh doctored receipts and invoices to justify the false claims he made for personal items as well as purchases he did not actually make. Between October 2010 and September 2018, he submitted 22 expense reports and duped NUS into reimbursing him for expenses he claimed were for research purposes. Teh also forged payment documents to get approval for claims on two occasions. In October 2017, he engaged a shop to install solar film for his car and paid S$300 for the personal purchase. He later used a blank invoice issued by the shop to claim S$4,815 for ""UV protective film for lab hood and cabinets"" from NUS. In January 2018, he entered S$2,820 into a blank cash sale document to support an expense claim for research equipment. He had actually spent about S$1,000 on a labeller and radio for his own use. Court documents did not say how Teh's offences were discovered. Teh, who was with NUS' Department of Biomedical Engineering at the time of the offences, has made full restitution to the university, his lawyer previously told the court. The penalty for cheating is up to three years' jail, a fine or both, while the punishment for forgery is up to four years' jail, a fine or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/stepfather-sexual-assault-stepdaughter-12-sgnasilemak-telegram-2833451,"Man jailed for sexually assaulting stepdaughter, 12, whose nude photos were in 'SgNasilemak' chat","SINGAPORE: A man sexually assaulted his 12-year-old stepdaughter after remarrying her mother, preying on the girl when they were alone at home. He also told her to take intrusive photos of herself after threatening her. Nude photos of the girl were later found circulating in a Telegram chat called ""SgNasilemak"". The man, now 38, was on Monday (Jul 25) sentenced to 11-and-a-half years' jail and 15 strokes of the cane. He pleaded guilty to three charges of aggravated sexual assault, outrage of modesty and sexual exploitation of a child. Three more charges were considered for sentencing. The offender and victim cannot be named as their identities are protected by a gag order. The court heard that the offender and victim's mother, now 35, were previously married. They remarried in 2016 and had two sons together. The man was unemployed at the time of the offences. The victim's mother was a homemaker who stopped working in 2018 to care for her children. The man first sexually assaulted his stepdaughter at home in 2017, when she was 10. In June that year, he approached her when she was lying down on her grandmother's bed at home and told her to perform a sexual act. She complied as she felt that she could not refuse the offender, whom she regarded as her father. But after another similar incident later that day, she told him she did not want to do it anymore. After that, the victim avoided her stepfather but did not tell anyone what had happened as she was scared of him. She was also afraid that telling someone would cause her mother to divorce him, breaking her family up. The victim was especially concerned about the effect such a split would have on her younger stepbrothers, as she had already seen this happen after her mother's first divorce. ""Nothing untoward"" happened for almost two years after this incident, which lulled the victim into thinking there would be no repeat of the assaults, said Deputy Public Prosecutors Yvonne Poon and Eric Hu. But she was assaulted again on May 25, 2019, when she was 12. That morning, the offender woke the victim up while she was sleeping in her room. At that time, the offender had access to the victim's phone as she would give him her password when he asked for it, out of respect for him as a paternal figure. While looking at her text messages, the victim's stepfather found out that she had had sex with her 13-year-old boyfriend. The victim was scared and embarrassed when he confronted her about it. The offender asked his stepdaughter to take photos of herself naked in the bathroom and send them to him over WhatsApp. He threatened to tell the victim's mother that she had been having sex if she did not do so. The victim complied and went into the bathroom. After that, she stayed in the toilet for a while and cried as she was confused and scared. When the girl emerged from the bathroom, her stepfather was outside in the kitchen. He asked her to perform a sexual act there, and she complied. During the assault, the man lifted the victim's shirt and touched her chest. The victim noticed a flash and saw the man pointing his phone camera at her. A photo of the victim with her chest exposed was later found in the offender's phone. After the assault, the offender told his stepdaughter to call her boyfriend over. When he arrived, the offender told him to use a condom next time and passed him one. The victim and her boyfriend then left the house. While they were out, the offender sent the victim a text message telling her to take a taxi home and that he wanted to take her out to play football when she was back. The girl was afraid of being alone with her stepfather again. She asked her boyfriend to follow her home, and told him what had happened that morning. The victim's boyfriend told her to tell her mother, but she said that she was too scared. The boyfriend then gave her a small foldable knife and another multipurpose tool and told her to keep them. The victim assumed these were meant for her protection and put them in her bag. She continued to cry in the taxi as she was afraid of what would happen when she returned home. When they reached home, the offender asked why the victim's boyfriend was with her. As all three were leaving the house to play football, the boyfriend's mother called him and he had to leave. Alone with the victim again, the offender told her that the football session was cancelled. They went back into the flat and the man told her in a ""stern and serious"" tone to perform a sexual act, court documents stated. The victim complied as she was afraid. She went into her room after that, where she took out the foldable knife and contemplated using it on herself as she felt like she wanted to die. Later that day, while meeting her boyfriend again, the victim broke down and told him what had happened after he left. Despite his urging, she still did not want to tell her mother as she was afraid of breaking up the family. Sometime later, the victim's boyfriend told her that he needed to help her and tell an adult what had happened. He went through her phone and discovered that she was a member of the ""SgNasilemak"" chat group. The victim told him that her stepfather had used her phone to join the group. The boyfriend found that three nude photos of the victim had been put into circulation inside the chat group. He saved screenshots of the obscene material into a thumb drive. He then met the victim's maternal aunt to tell her about this, and passed her the thumb drive. She in turn informed the victim's mother. The victim's aunt also confronted the offender over the phone on Jul 3, 2019. He was defensive and initially denied all wrongdoing, claiming he was drunk and could not remember anything. It was only later on that the offender said he would confess to his actions. The victim's aunt eventually made a police report on Jul 26, 2019. Naked photos of the victim were later found in the phones belonging to both the girl and her stepfather. A web history of the stepfather's phone also showed access to the ""SGNasiLenak4"" chat group, which was known to circulate obscene photos. According to the offender's psychiatric evaluation, he was likely to have been intoxicated with alcohol around the time of the 2019 offences, but still aware of the nature and wrongfulness of his actions. The prosecution sought a longer jail term of 12-and-a-half years, highlighting the victim's vulnerability and young age, the offender's abuse of trust and his premeditation. Ms Poon added that the man's offences spanned almost two years and were not a fleeting incident. Defence counsel Teo Choo Kee asked for not more than 11 years' jail, arguing that his client's actions were not premeditated. Justice Dedar Singh Gill said that the offender's assault of his stepdaughter violated the sanctity of his relationship with her, and the circulation of her nude photos degraded her further. The punishment for aggravated sexual assault involving penetration is between eight and 20 years' jail and not less than 12 strokes of the cane. Those who outrage the modesty of a child under 14 can be jailed for up to five years, fined, caned or any combination of these punishments. Those guilty of procuring an indecent act from a young person under 16 can be jailed for up to five years, fined up to S$10,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/100-cent-checks-departing-vehicles-impact-trade-travel-ica-fugitive-couple-escape-2832161,"100% checks on departing vehicles will affect trade and travel, says ICA in response to fugitive couple escape","SINGAPORE: While all vehicles entering Singapore's land checkpoints are checked by immigration officers, doing the same for every outgoing vehicle would have a significant impact on trade and travel, said the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) on Sunday (Jul 24). The issue has been underscored by the recent news of a fugitive couple who fled Singapore by hiding in the container compartment of a lorry. The pair had allegedly failed to deliver luxury watches and bags worth at least S$20 million. Arrest warrants and Interpol notices have been issued against the couple. The lorry driver has already been charged with helping them escape. ICA told CNA that Singapore's land checkpoints are one of the busiest land crossings in the world. Before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, about 200,000 travellers departed daily, according to ICA. ""Any delay in clearing departure traffic during peak hours can cause traffic tailback onto our roads inland, such as BKE (Bukit Timah Expressway) for Woodlands Checkpoint and AYE (Ayer Rajah Expressway) for Tuas Checkpoint,"" said ICA. ""It would also disrupt trade flows between Singapore and Malaysia.""  ICA said it calibrated departure checks based on Singapore's prevailing security posture. ""For example, enhanced checks will be conducted on departing conveyances in the aftermath of major security incidents to prevent the perpetrators from leaving Singapore."" Explaining why all incoming vehicles are checked while not every outgoing one is, ICA said it takes an ""arrival-centric approach"" to border security.  As for departing vehicles, the agency adopts a ""risk management approach"" to balance security checks and facilitate smooth departure clearance at the checkpoints. ICA said that this is a common practice internationally, adding that it also helps to optimise resources. On a day-to-day basis, ICA said it conducts regular and random checks on departing vehicles to deter and detect attempts to depart Singapore illegally. This covers car boots, the luggage and engine compartments of buses, as well as the cabin and container compartments of lorries. ""Targeted and thorough checks may also be conducted on departing conveyances based on risk profiling and information received,"" said ICA. ""While the checks may not be 100 per cent, they are not minimal or negligible in number."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/car-accident-motorcycle-death-right-turn-yishun-ring-road-2828671,Driver gets jail for causing motorcyclist's death while turning into Yishun car park,"SINGAPORE: A driver who caused a motorcyclist's death in a collision while turning into a car park in Yishun was sentenced to 15 weeks' jail on Friday (Jul 22). Teo Kai Xiang, 34, was also banned from driving for eight years, after pleading guilty to one charge of driving without reasonable consideration for others on the road. Another charge of inconsiderate driving that caused the victim's motorcycle to hit a stationary car was considered for sentencing. At the end of the hearing, Teo's lawyers informed the court that he was appealing against his sentence. The court heard that on Nov 1, 2020 at about 11.30am, Teo was driving his car on the first lane of Yishun Ring Road towards Yishun Avenue 5. He made a right turn into a non-signalised T-junction leading to the entrance of the open air car park of Block 165, Yishun Ring Road. At the same time, the 50-year-old victim Mr Leong Chee Kiong was travelling straight on Yishun Ring Road in the opposite direction on his motorcycle. Teo did not come to a complete stop when checking for oncoming vehicles before making the turn, and failed to give way to Mr Leong's motorcycle, causing a collision. The collision caused Mr Leong's motorcycle to hit the front right portion of another stationary car at the entrance of the car park. Just before the collision, the driver of the other car had noticed an unknown object coming towards his car from his right, and then felt a hard impact. When Teo alighted to check what happened, he saw Mr Leong lying on the ground. The victim was taken to the hospital. He suffered traumatic brain injury, a rib fracture and multiple facial fractures. Mr Leong underwent emergency medical procedures and was admitted to the intensive care unit, but he died later that same day at 11pm. The cause of his death was found to be head injury. The autopsy report did not make any finding on whether Mr Leong was run over by a vehicle. There was no evidence of mechanical failure in Teo's car, while the extent of damage to Mr Leong's motorcycle meant that investigators could not determine any possible mechanical failure that could have contributed to the accident. A forensic report found that based on estimates of the motorcycle's projection speed, Mr Leong's motorcycle would have been visible to Teo for six to eight seconds on the road, and for four seconds at the very least. Deputy Public Prosecutor Gladys Lim sought at least five months' jail for Teo, while his defence lawyers Mr Sunil Sudheesan, Ms Diana Ngiam and Ms Joyce Khoo asked for four to six weeks' jail. Ms Lim highlighted that Mr Leong's motorcycle would have been visible to Teo and that his failure to come to a complete stop before turning would have affected his ability to spot oncoming vehicles. She also acknowledged that there were no signs of dangerous driving by Teo and that he had a clean driving record prior to the accident. Teo's lawyers argued that it was not clear whether the helmet worn by the motorcyclist met safety standards set by authorities. They added that around end 2021, a ""new sizeable hump"" with speed regulating strips was installed on the same stretch of road where the accident happened. This indicated that ""our authorities recognise the dangers of vehicles, especially motorcyclists, approaching the bend at high speeds and have therefore put in place interventionist features to mandate that vehicles slow down as they approach"", they said. Teo could have been jailed up to three years, fined up to S$10,000 or both for causing the death of another person through careless or inconsiderate driving."

Mohamed Alias, 40, was on Friday (Jul 22) charged with helping a Singaporean man leave the country by allowing him to hide in the container compartment of a Malaysia-registered lorry with licence plate number JUH 7245. Last Friday, the Malaysian driver was also charged with helping the man's wife, a Thai woman, leave Singapore in the same way.  The fugitive couple, 26-year-old Singaporean Pi Jiapeng and 27-year-old Thai national Pansuk Siriwipa, are accused of cheating victims who had made advance payments for luxury watches and bags. Arrest warrants and Interpol red notices have been issued against them, after at least 180 police reports involving two companies, Tradenation and Tradeluxury, were made from June. While some media reports said the total value of the undelivered goods is S$32 million, CNA understands that the scam victims who made police reports have not received goods worth at least S$20 million as of Sunday. The lorry driver allegedly drove the vehicle hiding the couple on Jul 4, at about 7.25pm at Tuas Checkpoint's departure cargo section. The penalty for this offence is a jail term of between six months and two years, and a fine of up to S$6,000. Police previously said that Pi was arrested on Jun 27 for suspected involvement in cheating offences. His passport was impounded and he was released on bail on Jun 28, pending the completion of investigations. Pansuk Siriwipa was also assisting the police with investigations and surrendered her passport to officers on Jun 30. Both subsequently became uncontactable. The police have appealed to the public for information on the missing couple.  According to Interpol, Pi was born in Fujian, China, while Pansuk is from Roi Et, a province in central north-eastern Thailand. The agency added that Pansuk has a height of 1.64m."

Pi Jiapeng, a 26-year-old Singaporean man, and 27-year-old Pansuk Siriwipa from Thailand are wanted fugitives, according to Interpol.  The Singapore Police Force had issued arrest warrants and identified them on Wednesday. The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) said that the couple fled Singapore by hiding in the container compartment of a lorry. Pi was born in Fujian, China, while Pansuk is from Roi Et, a province in central northeastern Thailand, said Interpol. The agency added that Pansuk has a height of 1.64m. At least 180 reports involving two companies, Tradenation and Tradeluxury, have been made to the police from June to date. While some media reports said the total value of the undelivered goods is S$32 million, CNA understands that the victims who made police reports have not received goods worth at least S$20 million as of Sunday. The complainants said they made advance payments to the company for luxury watches or bags, but the companies did not deliver the products.  A 40-year-old Malaysian man had helped the couple leave Singapore illegally by allegedly hiding them in a lorry, ICA said in response to queries from CNA. The police have arrested the man. According to Interpol, red notices are issued for fugitives wanted either for prosecution or to serve a sentence. It is a request to law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person, pending extradition, surrender or similar legal action. Red notices are published by Interpol at the request of a member country and must comply with Interpol’s constitution and rules. A red notice is not an international arrest warrant, said Interpol. Each member country decides what legal value it gives to a red notice and the authority of law enforcement officers to make the arrests.  There are currently about 69,000 valid red notices, of which around 7,500 are public, according to Interpol data. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/death-penalty-drug-trafficking-execution-appeal-nazeri-lajim-2826561,Court dismisses drug trafficker's bid against death sentence one day before execution,"SINGAPORE: The Court of Appeal on Thursday (Jul 21) dismissed an eleventh hour bid by a convicted drug trafficker against his death sentence, one day before it is due to be carried out. Nazeri Lajim, 64, was convicted in 2017 of possessing not less than 33.39g of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking and sentenced to the mandatory death penalty. He previously lost an appeal against his conviction and sentence in 2018, and an application to review his appeal in 2021. He was one of 17 death row inmates who sought a declaration that the Attorney-General discriminated against them as Malays in prosecuting them for capital drug offences. This was dismissed by a High Court judge last December. Thursday's hearing was an appeal against another High Court judge's decision to dismiss Nazeri's application to commence judicial review proceedings against the Attorney-General. In that application, Nazeri sought a declaration that his capital charge was ""arbitrarily imposed"" and breached his constitutional rights, and a prohibition order or stay of execution of his death penalty pending court proceedings. He referred to cases of other offenders initially charged with trafficking drugs above the capital threshold, but who then had their charges reduced to non-capital offences, and argued that his prosecution was unconstitutional. Nazeri, who was unrepresented, asked for an adjournment of one to two weeks to appoint a lawyer for his case, saying that he was not highly educated and not versed in legal matters. ""This is to give me a sense of relief,"" he told Justices Andrew Phang, Tay Yong Kwang and Belinda Ang through a Malay interpreter. He also asked the court for compassion, informing the judges that he has a big family including 10 siblings, some of whom had not seen him yet. The judges in turn questioned Nazeri about who helped him with his written submissions to the Court of Appeal, which contained legal citations. He told them he received help from fellow inmates. Senior State Counsel Anandan Bala and State Counsels Chan Yi Cheng and Rimplejit Kaur argued that Nazeri's appeal was without merit and an example of ""drip-feeding"" applications to prevent the law from taking its course. ""The applicant's only contention appears to be that all offenders charged with trafficking drugs above the capital threshold belong to the same class of offenders and should be treated similarly,"" they said in earlier submissions. ""Therefore, where the charged is reduced to a non-capital offence for one offender, it must necessarily be reduced for all offenders. This is hopelessly flawed."" Delivering the decision on behalf of his fellow judges, Justice Phang said that Nazeri's application was ""entirely devoid of factual basis"" and dismissed it as an abuse of the court's process. The Court of Appeal held that the Attorney-General can consider a myriad of factors when deciding what charges to bring against an offender, beyond the amount of drugs possessed. These factors may include whether there is sufficient evidence against the offender, the offender's personal circumstances, willingness to testify against the co-accused and other ""policy factors"". Such factors may even justify situations where offenders involved in the same criminal enterprise are prosecuted differently, said the Court of Appeal. Affirming the decision made by the judge below, Justice Phang said: ""There is simply 'no substratum of fact to support a real possibility of relief being granted'."" He added that no adjournment would be granted for Nazeri to find counsel because legal assistance would not give ""factual substratum"" to a case that had none to begin with. ""There must come a point in time that the appellant accepts the consequences of his actions,"" said the judge."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tuas-explosion-stars-engrg-workers-killed-charged-2826106,"Tuas explosion: Stars Engrg director, manager charged with safety lapses, obstructing justice","SINGAPORE: Stars Engrg, its director Chua Xing Da and production manager Lwin Moe Tun were on Thursday (Jul 21) charged over the fatal explosion at the company's Tuas premises last year. Three workers were killed and seven others were injured in the explosion at 32E Tuas Avenue 11 on Feb 24, 2021. An inquiry committee concluded in March that the blast was mainly brought about by the company's failure to ensure the safe use of a mixer machine. Stars Engrg's core business is the installation of fire protection systems, and the work site was used to manufacture fire-retardant wraps. The committee found that a ruptured oil jacket in the mixer machine led to the initial blast. This ignited potato starch powder that had accumulated in the air, causing subsequent flash fires. The committee also strongly recommended criminal proceedings against Chua, who is a Singaporean, and Myanmar national Lwin Moe Tun. Chua was handed two charges under the Workplace Safety and Health Act for failing to ensure that machinery kept at the work site was safe, and failing to ensure the safety and health of employees on or before Feb 24, 2021. He allegedly failed to ensure that a heated mixer machine at the workplace was safe for use, which led to the explosion. He also allegedly failed to ensure that Stars Engrg employees received adequate training and supervision to operate a heated mixer machine, and that they operated it in a safe environment. Stars Engrg faces two similar charges for failing to ensure that the heated mixer machine was safe for use and to ensure the safety and health of employees between Jun 12, 2020 and Feb 24, 2021. Lwin Moe Tun, who oversaw the production of the fire-retardant wraps, was handed one charge under the Workplace Safety and Health Act for a negligent act that endangered workers' safety. He allegedly allowed Stars Engrg employees to perform repairs on a damaged heater that was part of the heated mixer machine on or around Feb 24, 2021. Both men also face further charges of obstruction of justice, with Lwin Moe Tun receiving two counts for this offence and Chua receiving one. Lwin Moe Tun is accused of deleting a message and photograph related to the unsafe changing of a faulty heater from a WhatsApp conversation between himself and Mr Subbaiyan Marimuthu, who died in the explosion. He allegedly did this on his phone on Feb 25, 2021 and on Mr Subbaiyan's phone the next day. Chua, who also goes by the name Cai Xingda, is accused of abetting Lwin Moe Tun by telling him that it was okay to delete the communications from his phone on Feb 25, 2021. All three accused will return to court for pre-trial conferences at the end of August. The penalties for failing to ensure the safety of any machinery kept on the work site and taking steps to ensure the safety and health of employees is up to two years' jail, a fine of up to S$200,000 or both. The punishment for a negligent act that endangers the safety or health of employees is jail for up to two years, a fine of up to S$30,000 or both. Those who obstruct the course of justice, or abet such an act, can be jailed for up to seven years, fined or both."

The man is a Singaporean citizen while the woman is a Malaysian with Singapore permanent residency. “We will recall them if we need further statements on the investigation,” said the spokesperson.  He added that statements on the case have been sent to the deputy public prosecutor but he could not confirm whether the two would be charged.  A video of the incident shows a woman pushing against a black car in slow-moving traffic, before ripping off the front licence plate and throwing it at the windscreen. A man later gets out of a Singapore-registered red Kia car and runs toward the victim’s vehicle, making offensive gestures. In a statement last Friday, Iskandar Puteri district police chief Rahmat Ariffin said the two suspects involved in a case of mischief were arrested on Thursday night at the immigration checkpoint on the Malaysian side of the Second Link.  The incident itself happened on Jul 10.  “Both suspects admitted to being involved in the case,” Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Rahmat said in the statement. “The suspects were believed to be unsatisfied when their vehicle was blocked and scraped when the incident happened.” ACP Rahmat said on Sunday that the driver of the black Toyota Alphard was not injured and there was minor damage to the car. He added that the victim was returning to Singapore from residential development Forest City in Johor when the incident happened."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/upskirt-video-voyeur-don-don-donki-camera-basket-2823046,"Jail for man who placed camera in shoe, shopping basket to take upskirt videos","SINGAPORE: A man was on Wednesday (Jul 20) jailed for 10 weeks and fined S$11,500 for taking upskirt videos of women around various shops including Don Don Donki. Foo Chuan Wei, 38, previously pleaded guilty to four counts of insulting a woman's modesty, one count of possessing obscene films and one count of misappropriating a camera he used to film the women. Another two charges of insulting a woman's modesty were considered for sentencing. The court heard that sometime between September and October 2019, Foo was trying on clothes at a shop in VivoCity when he came across a modified camera with a 32GB memory card. It is not known who the equipment belonged to. Foo took the camera and memory card and left the shop. On Oct 26, 2019, he placed the modified camera in a basket and used it to record an upskirt video of a woman at Don Don Donki in Orchard Central. Court documents also showed that he had separately bought another camera online, which he placed in his shoe to record more upskirt videos of women on three occasions. These other videos were taken at Plaza Singapura on Sep 19, 2019, and at Timezone arcade and an unknown shop in Suntec City on Sep 26, 2019. Foo was discovered while trying to take a photo of a woman inside a changing room at VivoCity on Nov 2, 2019, according to a call made to police. When police arrived, they found the modified camera, two memory cards containing the upskirt videos and a phone on Foo. He was arrested and police also seized his computer the next day. A total of 19 obscene videos were found on those devices. Foo admitted to downloading some of those videos from pornography websites as upskirt videos were his ""fetish"", court documents stated. Deputy Public Prosecutor Tessa Tan sought a jail term of eight to 12 weeks, highlighting the risk that the upskirt recordings of the victims could have been disseminated online. Defence counsel Genesis Shen asked for a community-based sentence and argued that his client had been attending sessions at the Institute of Mental Health from January to March. Magistrate Joanne Leong said a community-based sentence was not appropriate as Foo was ""well into his adulthood"" when he offended at the age of 35. The court had to send a ""strong message"" to those who harbour thoughts of abusing technological advancements that make it easier to record and disseminate voyeuristic videos, she said. There were several aggravating factors in this case, said the magistrate, citing the multiple victims and the use of a miniature camera. There was also a degree of consideration and planning by Foo, she said, seen in the way he prepared the camera that he bought by placing adhesive tape on it. Magistrate Leong also gave limited weight to Foo's plea of guilty, noting that he was caught red-handed. For insulting a woman's modesty, Foo could have been jailed for up to one year, fined or both. Possession of an obscene film is punishable with jail for up to six months, a fine of up to S$20,000 or both. Those who dishonestly misappropriate property can be jailed for up to two years, fined or both."

National Police chief Listyo Sigit Prabowo said on Monday (Jul 18) that Inspector General Ferdy Sambo has been suspended from his position as chief of internal affairs, as the authorities investigate the killing of 27-year-old Nopryansyah Yosua Hutabarat. “The (decision) is taken to ensure that what we are doing remains objective, transparent and accountable so that the ongoing investigation process can run smoothly and shed light on this incident,” Mr Prabowo told reporters at the National Police headquarters in Jakarta. “The process is ongoing. Witnesses are being examined. Evidence is being collected. We are committed to ensure that the whole process meets with scientific standards.” Mr Hutabarat, a police sergeant assigned to guard Mr Sambo’s family, was killed on Jul 8. He had multiple bullet wounds on his body. Police said that Mr Hutabarat was killed by another police officer in a shootout at Mr Sambo’s home. Police also said that Mr Hutabarat had tried to sexually assault Mr Sambo’s wife and that the second officer was trying to protect her. The police did not disclose the incident until Jul 11. They also withheld the identity of Mr Hutabarat’s shooter, identifying him only by his initial “E”. Police also said on Jul 12 that several surveillance cameras which could have captured the incident were broken.  Meanwhile, Indonesian media reported that none of Mr Sambo’s neighbours recalled hearing a shootout or seeing an ambulance arriving at the scene. Lawyers for Mr Hutabarat’s family were quoted as saying by local media that there were seven gunshot wounds on the slain officer’s body. The lawyers also reportedly said that Mr Hutabarat had dislocated his shoulder and jaw. There were various cuts and bruises all over his body, they added. The circumstances surrounding Mr Hutabarat’s death led to speculation by local news outlets that the slain officer was having an affair with Mr Sambo’s wife and was tortured and killed as a result. The South Jakarta police declined to comment when asked about this theory last week."

Rike Kusnul Kotimah, 25, was on Tuesday (Jul 19) jailed for three months and one week after pleading guilty to one charge of voyeurism and one charge of theft. Another charge of distributing the voyeuristic recording was considered for sentencing. There is a gag order on the victim's identity. The court heard that Rike Kusnul Kotimah started working for her employer on Mar 11. Soon after this, she asked for a transfer, which her employer agreed to on Apr 14. The employer checked the maid's photo gallery on her phone to ensure there were no pictures of her household and saw that she had taken a photo of a S$50 note placed in front of her husband's pants. The maid later admitted to taking the S$50 that was left in her employer's husband's pants, which she found while doing the laundry earlier in April. Her employer made a police report on Apr 14. During the course of investigations, the police discovered that Rike Kusnul Kotimah had used her phone to record a video of the employer's young son while she was changing him. Between March and April, while at home, she positioned her phone camera about 1m to 2m away and started recording a video while intentionally changing the boy's pants in the middle of the camera's field of vision. The child's bare buttocks could be seen throughout the video, which was at least 18 seconds long, and his private parts were exposed for a few seconds. The maid then uploaded the video onto her TikTok account with a caption in the Indonesian language. The caption, translated to English, read: ""Condition for a domestic worker to be successful: Personal necessities borne by the employer, food and date borne by employer, no off day, no Shoppee (sic), whatever things I can request from employer and just believe it, go back to Indonesia with a bag full of money, not a bag full of dirty clothes!"" Rike Kusnul Kotimah claimed that she had taken the video as a memento, court documents stated. Deputy Public Prosecutor Alexandria Shamini Joseph, who asked for the sentence imposed, said that the maid had intentionally recorded a video of the victim being changed at home when he had a reasonable expectation of privacy.

Preliminary investigations revealed that a 37-year-old man was involved in a fight with a 21-year-old man. The suspect had allegedly retaliated by slashing the 37-year-old with a karambit before he fled the scene. The injured man suffered multiple laceration wounds and was conscious when taken to the hospital, the police said in a news release on Monday.  ""Through extensive ground enquires and with the aid of the images from police cameras, officers from Central Police Division and Criminal Investigation Department established the identity of the 21-year-old man and arrested him within 12 hours of the reported offence,"" said the police.  A karambit which was purportedly used during the incident was also seized. A karambit is a curved knife with Southeast Asian roots.  During the arrest of the suspect, a 19-year-old man was also arrested for the offence of harbouring an offender. Both men will be charged in court on Tuesday. The suspect will be charged with voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapon and the 19-year-old will be charged with harbouring an offender.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/father-sexual-assault-daughter-child-divorce-2812696,'Only constant figure in her life': Jail for divorced father who sexually assaulted young daughter,"SINGAPORE: After her parents divorced, a girl grew up in an unstable family environment, moving homes often. She preferred living with her father as she felt her mother was physically and verbally abusive. But her own father sexually abused her, once when she was four to five and again when she was nine to 11. The man was on Friday (Jul 15) jailed for 13 years after pleading guilty to one count of sexual exploitation of a child and one count of sexual assault. Two more similar charges were considered for sentencing. The identities of the offender, now 52, and victim are protected by gag order. The court heard that the first assault took place in 2007, before the victim's parents were divorced. The victim was playing alone in the master bedroom when her father came in and asked her to perform a sexual act on him. She followed his instructions. Later, he also sexually assaulted her. She was aged four to five at the time The offender and the victim's mother divorced in 2010. The victim mostly lived with her father after that. Between Apr 6, 2012 and Jul 29, 2013, the offender and victim were alone at home when the man felt an urge to have sex. He once again instructed the victim to perform a sexual act on him, and she complied. He also sexually assaulted her again. She was nine to 11 at the time. ""She complied with the accused's requests and performed the sexual acts requested of her because she trusted the accused, who was her biological father,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutors Jane Lim and Gerald Tan. The victim felt disgusted by the sexual assaults. Years later, in late 2019, she confided in her mother, who became enraged and scolded the victim for not telling her sooner. The victim replied that she only learnt about sex recently and did not previously understand why her father had asked her to do these acts. She also told her mother not to tell her father about this as she was afraid. In July 2020, the teenager confided in her then-boyfriend about the sexual assaults by her father. She told him that these happened from when she was four to five until when she was in Primary 4. The victim cried as she told her boyfriend about this. He advised her to make a police report, but she said she was scared and did not want her father to kick her out of the house. During a dispute with her boyfriend later that month, the victim started crying and said that she could not sleep the night before as she had argued with her father. She said she felt he had not been a good father to her and recalled the sexual abuse at his hands. The victim also said she was afraid of reporting the assaults to the police as she would have to go and live with her mother. Later, the couple met one of the victim's friends, and the victim told her about the sexual assaults as well. Both the victim's friend and boyfriend encouraged her to make a police report. The victim made a police report the next day saying that she was first molested by her father in 2006. She told her mother that she did so because she ""could not take it anymore"", court documents stated. Over the years, the victim repeatedly replayed the assaults in her head and felt anxious whenever she recalled them. She occasionally practised self-harm to distract herself from these recollections. She was admitted to hospital and diagnosed with major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation in 2019, and reported that she had been in a low mood for a few years. A medical report in September 2020 noted that clues to the victim's low mood included ""punitive parenting"" from a young age, her parents' divorce and financial issues with her father. She said that she developed suicidal thoughts because she felt it was ""unfair for her to have all these emotions"", according to the medical report. The prosecutors asked for a jail term of 13 to 14 years and 18 months, highlighting the victim's young age, the offender's abuse of her trust and the psychological harm she suffered. They argued that the victim was especially vulnerable because of her parents' divorce, unstable family environment and fear of her mother. ""These vulnerabilities made her particularly susceptible to the accused who was her main caregiver and the only constant figure in her life,"" they said. The punishment for procuring an indecent act from a child is up to five years' jail, a fine of up to S$10,000 or both. The penalty for sexually assaulting a child under 14 is between eight and 20 years' jail and not less than 12 strokes of the cane. The offender cannot be caned as he is above 50."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/norvan-tan-sexual-assault-sister-friend-trial-verdict-2812501,Man found guilty of sexually assaulting sister's intoxicated friend,"SINGAPORE: A man was on Friday (Jul 15) found guilty of sexually assaulting his sister's friend, who was staying over at his family's flat after a night of drinking in 2016. Norvan Tan En Jie, 26, was convicted after claiming trial to two counts of sexual assault by penetration and two counts of outrage of modesty. The identity of the victim, who was 19 at the time, is protected by gag order. She was a friend of Tan's sister. The victim and Tan's sister returned to the flat in the early morning on Dec 26, 2016. The victim was heavily intoxicated and Tan's sister had to help her change her clothes. Around the same time, Tan returned home with two friends. Deputy Public Prosecutors Ng Yiwen, Sheryl Yeo and Niranjan Ranjakunalan put forth the case that the assaults took place while Tan's sister was talking to one of his friends in his room. According to the victim's testimony, while she was in the toilet, she heard a man ask from behind: ""Are you okay?"" He then carried her out of the toilet to the sofa in the living room, where he kissed her lips. The victim felt an urge to vomit and ran to the toilet, where she heard the same male voice asking if she was okay. The man then carried her and placed her on Tan's sister's bed, where he touched her chest and sexually assaulted her. The victim felt nauseous and returned to the toilet, where she again heard the man's voice asking after her. The man then sexually assaulted her in the toilet. The victim testified that Tan's sister later found her in the toilet and brought her to her room to sleep. When the victim woke up later that morning, she was emotional, anxious and upset, and told her boyfriend and friends about what she had experienced. She also exchanged messages with Tan's sister about what had happened to her, and Tan's sister said that she would find out who the assailant was. The victim changed out of her shirt and shorts before going home. Tan's DNA was later found in semen on the back of the victim's shirt, which was seized from the laundry basket in the toilet. A few days later, Tan's sister told the victim that her brother admitted to their family that he had carried out a sexual act with the victim. Tan's sister also repeated this in her police statements. Tan's sister testified as a prosecution witness during the trial, but later claimed she had lied in her messages to the victim and her police statements. She claimed that she lied about her brother's admission to carrying out a sexual act with the victim, in hopes that this admission would be enough for her friend to drop her intention of making a police report. During the trial, to explain the presence of his semen, Tan claimed that he and his girlfriend at the time had sex on a daily basis at various locations around the flat, including the toilet. Tan, who was represented by lawyer Amarjit Singh, claimed that the semen transferred to the victim's shirt when it came into contact with the toilet floor or wall, or other clothes in the laundry basket. Tan's version of events was that he was in the kitchen smoking when he heard a thud and went to the toilet to check it out. He said he saw the victim sprawled on the toilet floor. He claimed that he called the victim and tapped her shoulder but received no response. He said he then helped her into an upright position and left her sitting with her back against the wall of the toilet. He said that when his sister and friend came into the kitchen, he told his sister her friend was ""damn drunk"". He claimed that he then went to bed and the rest of the day passed uneventfully. Tan also claimed that his sister was trying to frame him in her messages to the victim and police statements, and denied admitting that he had carried out a sexual act with the victim. Justice Ang Cheng Hock found that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt on all four counts of sexual assault and molestation. He said that the victim's account of events was unusually convincing, and that she was an honest and forthcoming witness. He added it was clear from her evidence that she had formed the view that Tan was her assailant during each assault, based on the man's voice and build. In contrast, Tan's testimony at trial was ""an afterthought concocted as a defence to the charges"" and full of inconsistencies, said the judge. He found that the defence also failed to show how Tan's semen could have transferred to the victim's shirt through contact with other surfaces in the toilet. Justice Ang said that the court also had to grapple with the relevance of Tan's sister's evidence and her credibility as a witness. He found that Tan's sister's messages and her police statements that her brother had admitted to a sexual act with the victim were truthful, despite her claims that she lied in them. He rejected the defence's argument that Tan's sister was a habitual liar, instead finding that she was honest in her communication with the victim and demonstrated concern for her in the messages. In contrast, by the time Tan's sister testified at trial, her integrity as a witness was ""impeached"" and she took the stand intending to lie to help her brother, he said. Tan will return to court for sentencing in August. For sexual assault by penetration, he could be jailed for up to 20 years and fined or caned. He faces up to two years' jail, a fine, caning, or any combination of these penalties for outrage of modesty."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-molest-young-girl-under-his-care-2809841,Man jailed for repeatedly molesting girl he was paid to look after,"SINGAPORE: A 58-year-old man was jailed for three years on Thursday (Jul 14) for molesting a girl under his care.  The victim was 10 to 11 at the time of the offences. Her mother had paid the man to look after the girl after learning that he took care of other children by giving them accommodation and providing for their daily needs for a fee. The man described the girl as a ""temptation"" and said that while he ""wanted to rape her"", he did not do so as he was scared, court documents stated. He pleaded guilty to three charges of outraging the victim's modesty. Another two similar charges were considered for sentencing. The identities of both the offender and victim are protected by gag order. The court heard that the victim moved to Singapore with her mother when she was younger. The victim's mother met the offender through friends. As she could not speak English or help with her daughter's schoolwork, she sought help from the offender, paying him S$1,300 a month to take care of the girl's basic needs, including her education. The girl moved in with the offender, his family and other children under his care when she was eight. She viewed him as a father figure as her own father was absent. The offender also told investigators the victim was ""very close"" to him. The first offence took place in 2017 when the girl was confiding in the man about personal matters. Towards the end of their conversation in one of the bedrooms, he briefly kissed her on her lips.  Later that year, while waking the girl up in the morning, the offender touched her chest over her clothes. On a third occasion in 2017, the man asked his maid to lock her bedroom door so that the victim would not be able to sleep there. He then told the victim to sleep with him on his bed where he touched her again. The next morning, the man told the victim not to tell his wife or maid about what had happened. The victim did as she was told. Twice in 2018, the offender touched her private parts while she was taking an afternoon nap in a bedroom. The girl finally confided in her mother in 2018, following an incident when she found the man in her bedroom after she had taken a shower. The girl's mother took her back home the next day. She then told the offender's wife what her daughter had said, but the woman begged her not to report the matter to the police. During a confrontation with the man and his wife, he denied any wrongdoing. The offender subsequently gave the victim and her mother an apology letter, which his wife helped to write. The court heard that the victim was unable to stop thinking about the incidents and struggled over the next few years, leading to difficulties focusing on her studies. In February 2020, a teacher noticed that the victim was behaving unusually. Her teachers also found a penknife in her schoolbag. The girl asked to speak to the school counsellor who accompanied her to make a police report together with her mother. The man was arrested a week later. The victim attended multiple counselling sessions to help prevent self-harm and cope with suicidal thoughts after the offences came to light. She said that she felt disgusted by what the offender had done to her, had lost trust in men and felt fearful when they came near her. Deputy Public Prosecutor Niranjan Ranjakunalan sought 33 to 39 months' jail for the offender. When asked if he had anything to say, the offender, who was unrepresented, told the court: ""Sorry to the victim."" ""There was clearly abuse of trust on the part of the accused for preying on a child he was entrusted with,"" said District Judge Lee Lit Cheng. Another aggravating factor was the man's premeditation in the third offence in 2017, as he asked the maid to lock her bedroom door, the judge said. She also noted that the victim had to continue sleeping in the man's bed for the rest of the night after he stopped molesting her, and that the offences caused the girl psychological harm. The judge gave some mitigating weight to the man's decision to plead guilty, sparing the victim the further trauma of having to recount her ordeal at trial. Those guilty of outraging the modesty of a child under 14 can be jailed for up to five years and fined, caned or any combination of these punishments."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/boy-scald-death-mother-father-child-abuse-murder-appeal-2803711,Mother who scalded 5-year-old convicted of murder on appeal; father gets life term,"SINGAPORE: The mother of a five-year-old boy who died of scald injuries has been convicted of murder on Tuesday (Jul 12) following an appeal by prosecutors.  The Court of Appeal also increased the sentence of the boy's father to life imprisonment. The couple, both 30, were initially convicted in 2020 of voluntarily causing grievous hurt by heated means. Azlin Arujunah and her husband Ridzuan Mega Abdul Rahman were each originally sentenced to 27 years' jail. Ridzuan also received 24 strokes of the cane and Azlin received an additional 12 months' jail in lieu, as women cannot be caned. With the appeal, Azlin's charge has been amended to murder under Section 300c of the Penal Code, which is punishable with death or life imprisonment. The Court of Appeal adjourned to consider Azlin's sentence after the prosecution and defence have made further submissions. High Court Judge Valerie Thean had in 2020 acquitted the couple of murder with common intention after finding that the prosecution did not prove the element of common intention. The boy was subject to abuse from about a year after returning to his parents from another family in May 2015. He was hit with tools like a broom or a hanger and pinched with pliers. His parents began scalding him with hot water, leaving him limping in pain with blisters and peeling skin. He was eventually confined in a cage meant for the family cat. From Oct 15 to Oct 22, 2016, the boy's parents scalded him with hot water on four occasions. This led to his death from severe scald injuries. Delivering the judgment on behalf of a five-judge panel, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon said that Azlin was solely responsible for the first and third scalding incidents, while she carried out the second and fourth scalding incidents jointly with Ridzuan. During the first incident between Oct 15 to 17, 2016, Azlin grabbed her son by the ankle to prevent him from running away and poured hot water on his leg and hand several times. In the second incident from Oct 17 to 19, 2016, Azlin threw several cups of hot water at the boy, who shouted at her: ""Kau gila ke apa?"", meaning ""Are you crazy or what?"" Ridzuan heard this and threw more hot water at the boy. The third incident on Oct 21, 2016 took place when Azlin became angry with the boy and chased him around the living room, throwing nine to 10 cups of hot water at him. A day later in a fourth incident, Azlin told her husband to ""deal with"" the boy after he did not want to remove his shorts to take a bath. Ridzuan hit the boy with a broom before throwing cups of hot water on him. The boy crouched down in the toilet as he was attacked and eventually fell forward and stopped moving. He was taken to hospital after more than six hours as his parents were afraid of getting arrested. He went into shock during surgery and died of his injuries a day after he was admitted. The court heard that the hot water poured on the boy was between 70 and 90.5 degrees Celsius. Water temperature higher than 70 degrees Celsius would cause mid to deep burns even with minimal contact, said the judges. Laying out its findings in a 131-page judgment, the Court of Appeal said: ""There has been no case where the court has been presented with the issue that this court is faced with."" This was because the prosecution sought to prove Azlin's liability for two criminal acts committed by another person - the second and fourth scalding incidents carried out by Ridzuan - as part of the entire murder charge against her. The judges said this involved an ""expanded interpretation"" of common intention, or the intention shared by multiple actors committing a criminal act. A key issue in their inquiry was whether such an interpretation could be allowed. The judges ultimately found that it was, based on their interpretation of the relevant provision in the Penal Code. They also found that this interpretation was permissible as it furthered the provision's purpose to deter group crimes and expand the criminal liability of those who commonly intend and participate in group crimes beyond the acts specifically committed by them. Applying this to the case, the judges said that an aggregation of Azlin's acts and intentions across the four incidents was sufficient to make out the murder charge under Section 300c. They said it was clear beyond reasonable doubt that Azlin intended to cause the scald injuries in all four incidents, and this satisfied an ""expanded interpretation"" of common intention. Azlin not only did not stop Ridzuan from splashing hot water at their son in the second incident, but also chased the boy around the house. In the fourth incident, she instigated Ridzuan to scald their son and encouraged him during the act, stated the judgment. In 2020, Justice Thean had found that life imprisonment was not justified for Ridzuan and Azlin as their actions were not the ""worst case"" of offending under the charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt with heated means. But the Court of Appeal amended Ridzuan's sentence to life imprisonment after finding that the trial judge failed to consider multiple accumulative aggravating factors. These included the prolonged period of escalating abuse and the cruelty of the abuse, as extensive parts of the boy's body were scalded, including sensitive areas like his face and private parts. Chief Justice Menon said the distress the boy experienced could only be assessed by considering all the scalding incidents, as they were not carried out on unblemished skin, but skin that was repeatedly and brutally injured. Another aggravating factor was the fact that Azlin and Ridzuan carried out the acts against a defenceless young child in their own home, and the abuse took place over four months. The judges also found that Ridzuan's case was devoid of material mitigating factors argued by the defence, such as his relatively young age of 24 at the time of the offences and purported remorse. They said Ridzuan's defence of low adaptive functioning did not seem reasonable either, as a psychologist testified that his actual adaptive functioning was higher than what his test results suggested, due to the way he self-reported his abilities. The court said this made Ridzuan's offences one of the worst types of offending that justified life imprisonment. The judges also asked parties to submit on whether the man's caning sentence would still stand. The appeal was decided by Chief Justice Menon and Justices Andrew Phang, Judith Prakash, Tay Yong Kwang and Steven Chong. The appeal panel appointed Professor Goh Yihan, Dean of the Singapore Management University's School of Law, to assist in its findings. Deputy Public Prosecutors Mohamed Faizal, Senthilkumaran Sabapathy and Norine Tan argued the appeal for the prosecution. Azlin was represented by lawyers Amarick Gill, Cheryl Ng and Lee Zhe Xu, while Ridzuan was represented by lawyers Eugene Thuraisingam and Chooi Jing Yen."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/china-shanghai-stabbing-ruijin-hospital-2798756,'Very shocking': Four stabbed by assailant at major Shanghai hospital,"SHANGHAI: Four people at a renowned Shanghai hospital were wounded by a knife-wielding assailant on Saturday (Jul 9), in the second reported stabbing incident after a COVID-19 lockdown of the financial hub was lifted early in June. Officers raced to the more than 100-year-old Ruijin Hospital on Saturday morning after receiving calls about an attack, police said. Videos on social media showed chaos as visitors clambered under turnstiles to get out of the hospital while doctors were seen running out with their patients, some in wheelchairs and one on a mobile bed. A long trail of blood was seen on the marble surface of a flight of stairs in one video. ""It's very shocking,"" said a Shanghai resident who had arrived for a check-up just after the hospital was sealed off, declining to give her name. ""This is very despairing. What has happened to this society?"" Hospitals are a flashpoint for many in China, who face issues from touts illegally trading appointment tickets, long queues to see doctors, and corruption that can push up the cost of receiving care. Reports of patients assaulting doctors are also common. At the Shanghai hospital, police found a man holding a crowd hostage with a knife on the seventh floor of the outpatient department. When the man threatened to hurt the hostages, the police opened fire, subduing him, according to local police. None of the wounded is in a life-threatening situation and the incident is being investigated, the police said. Ruijin Hospital has been cordoned off, and all appointments cancelled, a police officer told onlookers outside. A man was arrested on Monday after going on a stabbing spree in the city's downtown Jingan district."

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/felicia-teo-ahmad-danial-murder-discharge-acquittal-appeal-2796956,Felicia Teo case: Suspect appeals for discharge amounting to acquittal for murder,"SINGAPORE: One of the two suspects in the 2007 disappearance of Ms Felicia Teo Wei Ling has appealed to secure a discharge amounting to an acquittal for her murder. Court records show that lawyers for Ahmad Danial Mohamed Rafa'ee, 37, filed the appeal on Friday (Jul 8). He is represented by Mr Shashi Nathan, Ms Tania Chin and Ms Laura Yeo. At a hearing last month, Ahmad Danial was given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal for the murder of Ms Teo, which is a capital offence. This means that he can still be prosecuted for her alleged murder in the future should there be developments in the case, such as the emergence of new evidence.  If he successfully appeals for a discharge amounting to an acquittal, he cannot be charged for the same offence again. Ms Teo, who would be 34 this year, was reported missing on Jul 3, 2007 and later presumed dead. Ahmad Danial was originally charged with murdering Ms Teo between 1.39am and 7.20am on Jun 30, 2007 at a flat in Block 19, Marine Terrace with suspected accomplice Ragil Putra Setia Sukmarahjana, who is at large. He was given the murder charge in December 2020. Last month, the prosecution substituted it with six charges for lesser offences and offered him bail. At the time, Mr Nathan had argued a discharge not amounting to an acquittal meant that the murder charge would hang over his client's head for ""an indeterminate time"". Prosecutors told the court then that the main reason they were applying for a discharge not amounting to an acquittal was because Mr Ragil was still at large. Ahmad Danial's current charges include leaving Ms Teo's body around Punggol Track 24 as well as misappropriating her phone and other belongings on or around Jun 30, 2007. He is accused of intentionally omitting to give information about Ms Teo's sudden or unnatural death to the police, when he was legally bound to do so. He allegedly fabricated false evidence by placing Ms Teo's phone near East Coast Park between 7.20am and 8.22am on Jun 30, 2007 to support false information given to the police that she had gone there. He allegedly also fabricated false evidence by making calls to Ms Teo's phone, leaving her voicemails and messaging her on social media to create the false impression that he believed she was still alive. On Jul 11 and Jul 25, 2007, he is suspected of giving false information to two police officers to the effect that Ms Teo left the Marine Terrace flat on her own on Jun 30, 2007, and that he did not know what happened to her. Mr Ragil is named as Ahmad Danial's suspected accomplice in all these charges, including the original murder charge. He is at large and believed to be in Indonesia. Ahmad Danial was set to plead guilty to the six charges earlier this week, but the hearing was adjourned after his lawyer said there were multiple issues to resolve on ""facts, sentencing and documentation"". Those convicted of depositing a corpse can be jailed for up to six months, fined up to S$2,000 or both. Anyone who fabricates false evidence can be jailed for up to seven years or fined. The punishment for misappropriating the property of a dead person is up to three years' jail and a fine. The penalty for omitting to give information to public servants as required by the law is up to one month's jail and a fine of up to S$500. Anyone who gives false information to a public servant can be jailed up to six months, fined up to S$1,000 or both."

No one was injured in the incident. Police established the man's identity through ground enquiries and police camera footage, and arrested him. They seized the 73cm-long katana sword, which has a 49cm-long blade, from his car boot. According to charge sheets, this incident took place between Blocks 692 and 695, Hougang Street 61. Tan was previously charged with using a replica foam sword to commit criminal intimidation with two men named Fu Yiming and Jeremy Ong Kian Song. He is accused of holding the sword while Fu shouted at two people to kneel down and apologise. The replica samurai sword had a 66cm-long foam blade and is suspected to belong to Tan. This offence allegedly took place at about 6.10am on Mar 10, 2022 at an apartment block on Soon Lee Street. Tan will return to court later this month. Fu was earlier also charged with criminal intimidation for the same incident. Possession of a scheduled weapon carries a penalty of up to five years in jail and not less than six strokes of the cane. The punishment for criminal intimidation is up to two years' jail, a fine, or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-abuse-young-son-baby-slap-punch-kick-2796181,"Man jailed for assaulting sons aged 1 and 6, says he was disciplining them","SINGAPORE: A 33-year-old man was on Friday (Jul 8) jailed for 13 months and one week for assaulting his two young sons then aged one and six. The man cannot be named to protect the identities of the two victims. His lawyers told the court that his intention was to discipline his sons. He pleaded guilty to one charge each of ill-treating a child and voluntarily causing hurt, as well as a charge of theft. Another charge of voluntarily causing hurt to the older boy was considered for sentencing. The court heard that in May 2020, the man saw his one-year-old twin son and daughter fighting in the cot. He got upset and hit his younger son three to four times on the arm and leg. A few weeks later on May 28, 2020, the man grew frustrated with his older step-son, then four, while teaching him. He slapped and caned the boy on his arm, leg and back and pushed him, causing him to hit a fan. The boy sustained bruises and marks around his body, including his head, cheek, neck, back, arm, shoulder, hand, thighs and legs. This assault formed the charge taken into consideration. On May 29, 2020, during a police interview about this second assault, the man's wife informed the police about the earlier incident with her younger son. The baby was then taken to the hospital for a medical exam, and a 1cm-long reddish lesion was found on his right thigh. On Feb 26 this year, the man again physically abused his older step-son when he got angry with the boy for kicking the family's maid. The man brought the boy, then aged six, into a room and slapped, pinched, punched and kicked him. The boy suffered bruises on his face, neck, lips, shin and forearm, which were found to be consistent with blunt force trauma. He cried throughout the assault. The boy's mother rushed home when she could not find her son anywhere in the house while monitoring surveillance footage of the flat on her phone. She was worried that her husband may have assaulted the boy again, and when she saw bruises on the boy after reaching home, she called the police. At the time of this assault, the man was on bail for the earlier incidents involving his sons as well as a theft offence, and had taken a court date to plead guilty to the charges. He committed the theft on Apr 12, 2021, when he saw a man who was drunk and sleeping at a table in a coffee shop at about 1.30am. He took the victim's bag and kept his wallet, which contained at least S$100 as well as his identity card, driving licence and condominium access card. The bag also contained the victim's car and house keys. After waking up at around 3am, with the help of a security officer, the victim reviewed security footage and spotted the man taking his bag. He found his bag, without his wallet, discarded about 200m away from the coffee shop that morning, and his car keys were found at the pavement in his condominium in the late afternoon. The offender was arrested about three weeks later. He later gave the victim's wallet to police and gave restitution of S$200 for the cash inside and costs of replacing the victim's bank cards. Deputy Public Prosecutor Norine Tan sought 10 to 12 months' jail for the man's assault of his older step-son, a short jail term for the assault of his younger son, and four to six months' jail for the theft. She highlighted that the assault of the older step-son involved serious acts of slapping, pinching, punching and kicking, and was not a fleeting attack. She pointed out that the man had a similar charge against the boy taken into consideration, and reoffended while on bail. On the theft charge, Ms Tan also pointed out that the man had many prior property-related and dishonesty-related offences. Defence counsels Sim Bing Wen and Anita Kaur Gill asked for lower sentences of six to eight months' jail for the assault on the older step-son and two months' jail for the theft. They argued that the man was remorseful for his actions, loved all his children and worked hard to provide for his family. They said that he was the main disciplinarian of the family. ""There were times when juggling the demands of his work as a food delivery rider with the need to be a caregiver and disciplinarian to the children overwhelmed him and caused him to overreact,"" said the lawyers. They added that his first assault against his older step-son was ""motivated solely by his intention to discipline and educate (the boy) for his own good"". According to the man, after returning home from a long shift he learnt that the boy had asked the maid for a doughnut, which she did not give. The boy then kicked the maid, and she was crying. The offender also submitted a handwritten letter to the court saying that his intention was to make his child a ""better boy"" and admitting that his ways were wrong. Mr Sim sought to make a distinction between his client and other offenders, arguing that his actions were ""not senseless and disproportionate"" and he did not attack them in an ""unprovoked way"". But Ms Tan countered that the man's assault of his children must be seen as disproportionate, and that disciplining a child was not justification for parents to use excessive force on their children. In sentencing, District Judge Brenda Chua said that acts of violence against children should not be tolerated. Ill-treatment of a child is punishable with up to eight years' jail and a fine of up to S$8,000. The penalty for voluntarily causing hurt is up to three years' jail, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both. The maximum penalty is doubled if the victim was below 14. Those guilty of theft can be jailed for up to three years and fined."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/haj-pilgrimage-tour-scam-2794196,Man linked to former religious teacher jailed for deceiving 85 people in Haj tour scam,"SINGAPORE: A man was sentenced to two years' jail on Thursday (Jul 7) for deceiving more than 85 people in a scam related to the Haj pilgrimage performed by Muslims. Mohd Ramlee AB Samad, 62, pleaded guilty to 20 charges of cheating, with another 65 similar charges considered for sentencing. He admitted to cheating 69 people into paying more than S$97,000 for the purported Haj tour in 2018. All 85 victims were also deceived into handing their passports to him to obtain visas. He ran the scam with the help of his friend Mr Fahrorazi Sohoi, who was then a religious teacher and a bankrupt. The court heard that in May 2018, Ramlee told Mr Fahrorazi that there were places available on a discounted trip for that year's Haj, which was from Aug 19 to Aug 24, 2018. It is obligatory for able Muslims to perform the annual Haj pilgrimage in Mecca at least once in their lifetime if they have the means. There is a quota on the number of pilgrims each year. Ramlee claimed to have been informed of the discounted trip by a man named Mohsein, purportedly a representative of Saudi authorities who had been liaising with Singapore authorities. He claimed that flights and accommodation would be covered by the Saudi authorities, and participants need only pay S$1,550 for airport tax, administrative fees and the Korban sacrifice ritual. He also claimed that the quota of participants would be ""obtained under Batam's and Brunei's as Singapore's Haj quota was full"", court documents stated. Ramlee asked Mr Fahrorazi to look for interested participants and collect payment and passports from them. In return, he would receive S$200 commission for each participant. Mr Fahrorazi agreed and spread the word. In fact, Ramlee knew that there never was such a trip, and intended to deceive the victims through Mr Fahrorazi to cheat them into making payment, said Deputy Public Prosecutors Tan Zhi Hao and Ryan Lim. Mr Fahrorazi made advance payments for the trip to Ramlee's bank account even before collecting full payment from the victims, as Ramlee told him that places on the tour and the flight had to be reserved. He transferred a total of about S$40,000 to Ramlee. On or around Aug 13, 2018, Ramlee left Singapore for Batam. On Aug 15, 2018, some of the victims suspected the trip was a scam when Mr Fahrorazi told them the departure date had been delayed by a day to Aug 17, 2018. Ramlee was arrested on Oct 4, 2018 when he returned to Singapore from Batam. A total of 82 passports belonging to the victims was seized from him. Three victims' passports and more than S$196,000 in cash were seized from Mr Fahrorazi. Ramlee has not made any restitution to date. The prosecutors said that the victims did not suffer any financial losses as the seized cash will be returned to them. They asked for at least two years' imprisonment, citing the significant amount of money involved, and the premeditated and relatively sophisticated nature of the fraud. They highlighted that Ramlee deceived the victims through Mr Fahrorazi, allowing him to distance himself from the fraud and use his friend's position as a religious teacher to perpetrate the scam. ""This gave the scam a veil of legitimacy and helped convince the victims that the purported discounted trip was legitimate,"" said the prosecutors. Mr Fahrorazi was given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal for his role in the scam in October 2019. This means he may still be prosecuted for the offence in the future should there be developments in the case, such as the emergence of new evidence. The punishment for cheating is mandatory imprisonment for up to 10 years and a fine."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/grab-driver-molest-sexual-assault-two-men-jail-caning-appeal-2794081,"Two men get jail, caning for molesting Grab driver on expressway","SINGAPORE: Two men convicted of molesting their Grab driver while travelling on the expressway were on Thursday (Jul 7) sentenced to jail and caning. Neo Wei Meng, 41, was given one year and two months' jail and three strokes of the cane, while Goh Suet Hong, 40, received a year's jail and two strokes of the cane. Earlier this week, each man was found guilty of one count of using criminal force to outrage the modesty of the then 28-year-old victim. The victim picked Goh and Neo up in his Grab car at Neil Road after midnight on Nov 12, 2018. They told him he looked ""very cute"". They then carried out what a magistrate called a ""group sexual assault"" against the victim by touching him inappropriately, including his private parts and nipples. They did this while the victim drove from Neil Road to Neo's home in Hougang, ignoring his repeated pleas to stop. This was the first leg of the journey. After Neo alighted, Goh then moved to the front passenger seat and continued the assault. Goh touched the victim's private parts and kissed his lips as he drove to Goh's home in Punggol. This was the second leg of the journey. The offences took place in a car along the Central Expressway (CTE) between 1.18am and 3.03am on Nov 12, 2018. Deputy Public Prosecutor David Menon sought 14 to 15 months' jail and three strokes of the cane for Neo. He initially sought nine to 10 months' jail and no caning for Goh, but raised this to 12 to 13 months and two strokes of the cane after the court sought clarification on the sentencing position. Mr Menon explained on Thursday that Goh's prolonged contact with the victim's private parts, even though it was not skin-to-skin contact, was an aggravating factor that warranted caning. He argued that the court was also allowed to take into consideration Goh's conduct during the first leg of the journey. Goh was only charged for his assault of the victim during the second leg. The sentence sought for Neo was higher in order to reflect the higher degree of sexual intrusion from making skin-on-skin contact with the victim's private parts during the first leg. Defence counsel Kalaithasan Karuppaya asked for leniency and mercy, and sentences at the lower range of the penalties sought by the prosecution. Delivering his sentence, Magistrate Hairul Hakkim Kuthibutheen said the experience of being ""repeatedly and mercilessly"" molested had left an ""indelible mark"" on the victim. At trial, the victim testified that he took about a month after the assault to resume his work as a Grab driver, and even then only for a few hours each day. The victim, who now delivers food, has said that he felt ""traumatised"" and was unable to face strangers, the magistrate noted. He had told the court: ""I do not dare to face the customer. So what I do is I just hand the food at the door and run away."" The magistrate took as aggravating factors the victim's status as a public transport worker, Goh and Neo's state of voluntary intoxication at the time and the fact that they assaulted the victim while he was driving, endangering him and other road users. He said that Neo's offending was aggravated by his prolonged skin-to-skin contact with the victim's private parts. He said that while Goh's offending involved indirect contact with the victim's private parts, it was still prolonged contact and Goh also kissed the victim for about three minutes. The magistrate also considered the immediate background to Goh's offences, which was the group sexual assault with Neo during the first leg of the journey. He also considered Goh's actions for which he had not been charged, including making skin-to-skin contact with the victim's private parts during the first leg. Magistrate Hairul Hakkim emphasised that he was only empowered to sentence Goh for his offences during the second leg for which he was charged. He said it was ""not the role of the courts"" to question why the prosecution chose not to charge Goh for his actions during the first leg, or to include details of his conduct during both legs in a single charge. He added that if either had been done, Goh could have received a heavier sentence than Neo. ""One could say that Goh has done what Neo did, which is to touch the victim's (private parts) skin-to-skin, plus more in the second leg,"" said the magistrate. Both Goh and Neo have filed appeals against their convictions and sentences. They could have been jailed for up to two years jail, fined, caned or any combination of these punishments for using criminal force to outrage a person's modesty."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/22-men-charged-obstruct-justice-whatsapp-alert-raid-2792386,22 men charged with obstructing justice by alerting WhatsApp groups about raids,"SINGAPORE: Twenty-two men were on Wednesday (Jul 6) charged with obstructing the course of justice by tipping off WhatsApp chat groups about ongoing law enforcement operations. The men are accused of sending the messages knowing that the chat group members would likely take steps to prevent the detection of offences in the area. Sixteen of the men allegedly sent their messages to a chat group called ""Night Owl"" between January and April 2019, from late at night to the early hours of the morning. The men are: Abdul Hadi Zainuddin, Mervin Yeoh Wei Kian, Muhammad Rashidi Rashid, Muhammad Rasyidi Safiee, Daniel Seet Joo Tong, Muhammad Azhar Dawood, Goh Wei Jie, Brandon Chung, Muhammad Ikhmal Bin Ismail, Ang Whay Chong, Ong Wee Sen, Wilson Soon Jien Yang, Jeffrey Goh Hock Soon, Ilex Tan, Lim Poh Kian and B Barathkrishnan. They are aged 29 to 49. The alleged messages, detailed in charge sheets, appeared to name massage parlours and nightclubs where raids were taking place, including vehicle number plates, and locations and numbers of enforcement officers. Another group of three men are accused of sending similar messages to a chat group called ""UncleValet"" on Feb 1, 2020. Lim Wei Xiong, Mah Chee Kean and Lim Song Huat are aged 33 to 44. Two more men - Yam Jianwen, 27, and Raymund Reuben Mervyn, 42 - allegedly sent similar messages to the ""Rolex Movement"" chat group in April 2019. One of the messages, allegedly sent by Mervyn, read: ""My contact informed me it's CNB operation next three days island wide,"" referring to the Central Narcotics Bureau. The remaining man, Chua Yong Dan, 32, allegedly sent similar messages to a chat group with a Chinese name that translates to ""artillery regiment"" on Feb 6, 2020. Anyone convicted of intentionally obstructing the course of justice can be jailed for up to seven years, fined or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-follow-woman-lift-upskirt-voyeur-punch-2792206,"Man jailed for pointing phone camera up woman's skirt in lift, punching her","SINGAPORE: While driving to his girlfriend's place, a man noticed a woman walking by in a skirt and decided to follow her first in his car, then on foot. He followed the stranger into a lift, where he pointed his phone camera up her skirt and later punched her when she tried to stop him from fleeing. Tan Hiang Peng, 31, was jailed for 11 weeks on Wednesday (Jul 6) after pleading guilty to two charges of insulting the woman's modesty and voluntarily causing hurt. A third charge of possessing obscene films was taken into consideration for sentencing. The court heard that the man, an insurance agent, was driving from Hougang Avenue 3 to his girlfriend's apartment when he spotted the victim at around 9pm on Sep 23, 2020. ""He decided to follow her because, among other things, he perceived that she was wearing a short skirt,"" court documents stated. Tan followed the woman in his car for some distance before stopping at a car park to continue watching her. When he saw the woman walk towards a lift lobby, he decided to follow her on foot. When the woman entered the lift, Tan rushed in as the lift door was closing and pressed a random floor number. They were alone in the lift. He stood behind the woman, who was listening to music on her earphones, and held his phone under her skirt. The flashlight on his phone was turned on. After several moments, the victim noticed the light from Tan's phone and shouted at him, according to court documents. She tried to grab his hand, but Tan pushed her chest. A scuffle ensued, during which Tan tried to flee and the victim tried to grab his shirt collar to prevent him from escaping. Tan then punched the victim twice in the face and the victim's grip on him loosened. Police camera footage captured him running out of the lift and down the stairs back to his vehicle. Tan drove on to his girlfriend's place, where he changed his top and footwear. To avoid detection, he threw away the shirt and slippers he wore during the incident in a communal rubbish bin on the ground floor, the court documents said. Tan was identified through the police camera footage, and arrested at his girlfriend's apartment the following day. During investigations, Tan claimed that he had thrown away his shirt and slippers because they were ""torn"" during the scuffle. He acknowledged that he was addicted to pornography, and said that he had placed his phone under the victim's skirt because he had seen similar acts in pornographic videos and was ""curious and excited"" to try this himself. He also claimed that he had wanted to ""test the flashlight"" on his phone. The police found more than 2 terabytes worth of pornographic videos and images on electronic devices seized from Tan, who admitted knowing that downloading and storing pornography was an offence. The man did not record an upskirt video of the victim. Deputy Public Prosecutor Jarret Huang sought 10 to 12 weeks' imprisonment, citing a significant level of premeditation and the confined space in which the offences happened. He also highlighted that Tan immediately turned to violence instead of surrendering after he was caught, and then took pains to conceal his involvement. These aggravating factors demonstrated that Tan's behaviour was aberrant even compared to the ""typical upskirt offender"", he said. The penalty for insulting a person's modesty is up to a year in jail, a fine or both. The punishment for voluntarily causing hurt is up to three years in jail, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/felicia-teo-missing-murder-ahmad-danial-guilty-plea-adjourned-2792031,Felicia Teo case: Suspect's guilty plea adjourned as defence says 'multiple issues to resolve',"SINGAPORE: A court hearing for a suspect who was set to plead guilty in the case of Ms Felicia Teo Wei Ling, who was reported missing in 2007 and later presumed dead, was adjourned on Wednesday (Jul 6). Speaking to the media, the defence counsel for Ahmad Danial Mohamed Rafa'ee, 37, said that the case was moving to a pre-trial conference for parties to resolve issues. ""Both parties, the defence and prosecution, have multiple issues to resolve including facts, sentencing and documentation,"" said lawyer Shashi Nathan. ""We are in polar positions for some issues,"" he told reporters, adding that he wanted time to review the facts of the case. ""However, I am confident that we will be able to resolve matters fruitfully with the prosecution."" Ahmad Danial was originally charged in 2020 with murdering Ms Teo between 1.39am and 7.20am on Jun 30, 2007 at a flat in Block 19, Marine Terrace with suspected accomplice Ragil Putra Setia Sukmarahjana, who is at large. Last week, he was given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal for the charge of murder, which is a capital offence. A discharge not amounting to an acquittal means he can still be prosecuted for the murder charge in the future should there be developments in the case, such as the emergence of new evidence. The murder charge was replaced with charges for six lesser offences instead. At the previous hearing, Mr Nathan had asked for a plead guilty mention for his client to admit to these charges. Ahmad Danial's current charges include leaving Ms Teo's body around Punggol Track 24 as well as misappropriating her phone and other belongings on or around Jun 30, 2007. He is also accused of intentionally omitting to give information about Ms Teo's sudden or unnatural death to the police, when he was legally bound to do so. Ahmad Danial is also suspected of fabricating false evidence by placing Ms Teo's phone near East Coast Park between 7.20am and 8.22am on Jun 30, 2007, purportedly to support false information given to the police that she had gone there. He allegedly also fabricated false evidence by making calls to Ms Teo's phone, leaving her voicemails and messaging her on social media to create the false impression that he believed she was still alive. On Jul 11 and Jul 25, 2007, he is suspected of giving false information to two police officers to the effect that Ms Teo had left the Marine Terrace flat on her own on Jun 30, 2007, and that he did not know what happened to her. Mr Ragil is named as Ahmad Danial's suspected accomplice in all these charges, including the original murder charge. He is at large and believed to be in Indonesia. Those convicted of depositing a corpse can be jailed for up to six months, fined up to S$2,000 or both. Anyone who fabricates false evidence can be jailed for up to seven years or fined. The punishment for misappropriating the property of a dead person is up to three years' jail and a fine. The penalty for omitting to give information to public servants as required by the law is up to one month's jail and a fine of up to S$500. Anyone who gives false information to a public servant can be jailed up to six months, fined up to S$1,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/threesome-rape-appeal-srihari-mahendran-girlfriend-blindfold-2791981,Court of Appeal reduces jail time for man who raped a stranger's blindfolded girlfriend,"SINGAPORE: A man who was convicted of raping a stranger's blindfolded girlfriend in a ""threesome"" planned without the woman's knowledge in 2016 has had his jail sentence reduced after an appeal. Srihari Mahendran, 26, was convicted after a High Court trial in 2020 and initially sentenced to 17 years and 10 months' jail and 14 strokes of the cane. The Court of Appeal on Wednesday (Jul 6) reduced his jail term to 16 years and six months, citing the need for parity with his co-accused. His caning sentence was untouched. Parity refers to the principle that people who commit the same offences should generally receive the same penalty, all other factors being equal. In this case, Srihari's lawyer Edmond Pereira asked the Court of Appeal to reduce his client's jail term to 14 to 16 years to reflect his lower culpability and other mitigating factors compared to the co-accused. Srihari's co-accused, the victim's then boyfriend, was sentenced to 19 years and 11 months' jail and 24 strokes of the cane on appeal. The victim's boyfriend cannot be named to protect the identity of the victim. Srihari can be named as there is no gag order on his identity and he was a stranger to the couple. Srihari and the victim's boyfriend met online in 2015 on a pornographic blog. Srihari agreed to fulfil the boyfriend's sexual fantasy of seeing his girlfriend have sex with another man. In April and August 2016, without the victim's knowledge, Srihari snuck into two hotels where the couple were, and raped and sexually assaulted the woman with her boyfriend's help. She became suspicious on the second occasion and removed her blindfold to see Srihari leaving the room. Evidence was also left in a video recording of one of the sexual encounters as the men filmed it. The victim's boyfriend pleaded guilty, and testified against Srihari. Srihari failed in his defence at trial that he genuinely believed he had the victim's consent. Srihari initially filed an appeal against his conviction as well, but Mr Pereira informed the court at the start of the hearing that his client had decided to discontinue that application. Mr Pereira argued that Srihari was acting under the instruction and direction of the co-accused, who was the mastermind of the offences, to fulfil his co-accused's sexual fantasy. He argued that although Srihari claimed trial to the charges, the victim was still spared from having to relive the experience by testifying in court, as he accepted her evidence instead of subjecting her to cross-examination. An accused person who chooses not to claim trial is generally given mitigating weight in sentencing, as a guilty plea spares the victim from having to testify in court and is taken as an expression of remorse. Mr Pereira also argued that Srihari admitted his role in the offences to hotel staff early on and even revealed his involvement in the first sexual encounter, which was then unknown. In contrast, the co-accused lied multiple times to police and Institute of Mental Health psychiatrists at the start of investigations, even though he eventually pleaded guilty, said the lawyer. He asked the court to give some credit to Srihari's ""openness and forthright expression"" of his involvement in the offences. Mr Pereira also urged the court to consider that the co-accused was more culpable for the victim's vulnerability as he was the one who exposed the victim to the sexual encounters. After listening to these arguments, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon said he was unsure whether this could be treated as a ""black and white"" case where Srihari was given no credit for claiming trial, while the co-accused was given full credit for pleading guilty. Deputy Public Prosecutor Ng Yiwen responded that what mattered was that the co-accused ultimately chose to plead guilty and admit to his offences, unlike Srihari.  He argued that giving Srihari credit for not calling the victim to testify would ""unduly reward"" him, as her testimony was neutral and irrelevant to his defence anyway. He also told the court that after Srihari initially volunteered information to the hotel staff, the man went on to lie to the police as investigations progressed. Mr Ng added that while the co-accused was the mastermind of the offences, Srihari helped to execute the plan and derived pleasure from it. Justice Judith Prakash also commented that Srihari was an ""enthusiastic participant"" in the offences. Delivering the judgment on behalf of a three-judge panel, Chief Justice Menon said the court thought that ""the parity principle was not given adequate expression and weight"" by the trial judge. In brief remarks, he said that the trial judge's decision on sentence was ""unimpeachable"" if looked at on its own terms. But with regard to the difference in culpability between Srihari and his co-accused, the court found that Srihari's sentence was ""not sufficiently differentiated"" from that of his co-accused. The court allowed Srihari's application and reduced his jail term by one year and four months. Srihari has been out on bail pending his appeal. His sentence was deferred for two weeks at the request of his family, and will start on Jul 20."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/passengers-molest-grab-driver-cte-2790411,Two men found guilty of molesting Grab driver while travelling on expressway,"SINGAPORE: After a night of drinking, two passengers started touching their Grab driver inappropriately as he drove them home, including while they were on the expressway. In what a magistrate described as a ""tag team"" effort, the friends took turns touching the victim and ignored his pleas to stop. After one of them alighted, the other moved to the front passenger seat to continue the assault as the victim drove. Goh Suet Hong, 40 and Neo Wei Meng, 41, were on Tuesday (Jul 5) each found guilty of one count of using criminal force to outrage the modesty of the victim. The offences took place in a car along the Central Expressway (CTE) between 1.18am and 3.03am on Nov 12, 2018. Goh, then a hairdresser, and Neo, then a freelance interior designer, met for drinks along Neil Road around 10pm on Nov 11, 2018. After drinking, they booked the then 28-year-old victim's car to drop Neo off at his home in Hougang followed by Goh at his home in Punggol. The victim testified that when he picked Goh and Neo up, they told him he looked ""very cute"" and said: ""Do you know god has sent us to pleasure you?"" and ""We are women disguised as men."" During the first leg of the journey to Hougang, while travelling on the CTE, Goh touched the victim's nipples. The victim told him to stop. At the same time, Neo touched the victim's private parts. When he told Neo to stop, the man persisted and also started licking his cheek and ear, the victim testified. According to the victim, Goh and Neo traded places after some time, with Goh moving to the victim's private parts while Neo touched his nipples. His repeated pleas for them to stop went ignored. He said that Goh and Neo only stopped when they spotted a police car after exiting the expressway. The second leg of the journey started after Neo alighted at his home in Hougang. Goh shifted to the front passenger seat, where he kissed the victim on the cheek and lips and touched his private parts again. The victim said that when they reached Punggol, Goh asked for them to spend some time together in the car but the victim declined. Goh then asked the victim to drive to a multi-storey car park and wait while he stepped outside to relieve himself. The victim drove away while Goh was urinating behind a pillar. Around 3am, the victim made a report at a police station that he had been molested, and also handed over to police Goh's belongings that were left in the car. Magistrate Hairul Hakkim Kuthibutheen said he preferred the victim's testimony over Goh's and Neo's as his was ""unusually convincing"" and contained ""that ring of truth"". Goh's defence was that he was asleep during the first leg of the journey. He admitted to committing the acts during the second leg, but claimed that he believed the victim consented as he purportedly smiled at Goh after being kissed. Magistrate Hairul Hakkim rejected the argument that Goh was asleep during the first leg, saying that sequence of events ""defies logic"". He also rejected the defence of implied or mistaken consent, finding that Goh did not establish that he had exercised due care and attention in allegedly coming to believe the victim consented. Neo's defence was one of bare denial that he had committed the acts, instead claiming that he fell asleep after boarding the car and hardly spoke to the victim. The magistrate rejected this argument as he found the victim's testimony to be truthful. During the trial, defence counsel Kalaithasan Karuppaya argued against believing the victim's testimony as he was supposedly ""unclear and unsure"" of where Goh and Neo were seated in the car. Magistrate Hairul Hakkim said this was a ""gross misrepresentation"" of the victim's evidence, as he was clear that Goh was seated behind him and Neo was in the middle back seat during the first leg of the journey. Mr Karuppaya also argued that the victim failed to seek assistance during the journey despite having ""ample opportunity"" to do so. For example, the victim could have stopped the car along the shoulder of the expressway or sought help from a couple crossing the road during the second leg of the journey. Magistrate Hairul Hakkim said that the High Court had repeatedly made it clear in previous rulings that there was no such thing as an expected or typical response of a victim of a sexual crime. ""I find the victim's failure to do any of the actions suggested by the defence to be clearly within the realm of possibilities,"" he said. The magistrate recounted some of the reasons the victim had given at trial for continuing to drive the passengers despite the assault. The victim had testified that he was ""terrified"" of Goh and Neo and worried that if he terminated their trip early, his Grab account would be suspended. The victim said that he had been a Grab driver for about a year at the time of the incident and it was his only source of income, which he needed to pay for the daily rental of the car. It was also understandable that the victim felt fearful as he was confined in the enclosed space of a car and being molested by two male passengers, said the magistrate. The magistrate noted the victim's testimony that he drove off at the multi-storey car park because Goh and Neo were no longer in his car and ""it gives me the confidence to run away from them"". He also cited the fact, corroborated by both Goh and the victim, that the front passenger door from which Goh had alighted was not completely shut when the victim drove away. This evidenced the victim's ""desperation"" to escape to safety, said the magistrate. Goh and Neo will return to court on Thursday for sentencing. Deputy Public Prosecutor David Menon is seeking nine to 10 months' jail for Goh, and 14 to 15 months' jail and three strokes of the cane for Neo. He said the offences were aggravated as the victim was a public transport service worker and Goh and Neo were voluntarily intoxicated at the time. The prosecutor also said that the victim was driving at speed during the offences, and Goh and Neo took advantage of his vulnerability while also posing a safety hazard to him and other road users. Mr Karuppaya asked the court not to consider his clients' intoxication as an aggravating factor, arguing that they did not get drunk in order to commit the offence, and ""it just happened"". The maximum penalty for using criminal force to outrage a person's modesty is two years' jail, a fine, caning or any combination of these punishments.Editor's note: An earlier version of this article placed the two accused men in incorrect seating positions and attributed an extra word to the magistrate's oral judgment.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ocbc-phishing-scam-leong-jun-xian-money-laundering-reformative-training-sentence-2789851,"OCBC phishing scam: Man gets reformative training for money laundering, first to be dealt with by court","SINGAPORE: A 21-year-old man linked to the OCBC phishing scams last year was on Tuesday (Jul 5) sentenced to reformative training for at least a year. Leong Jun Xian is the first to be dealt with by the court among those accused of being involved in the scam. A total of S$13.7 million was lost in the spate of phishing scams that affected 790 customers, according to the Oversea-Chinese Bank Corporation (OCBC) in an update in January. Reformative training is a harsher punishment than probation and detains younger offenders in a structured environment with an emphasis on rehabilitation. Leong was a member of a money laundering group that provided its services to unknown individuals believed to be linked to overseas syndicates. He and his seven co-accused, whose ages range from 17 to 21 years old, found and provided control of at least 16 bank accounts to syndicates in Telegram chat groups between December last year and February this year. The 16 accounts received almost S$600,000 from victims of various scams, including the OCBC phishing scams. Leong, who personally provided 12 of the accounts, was described by the prosecution as a ""lynchpin"" and the ""middle management"" in the money laundering organisation. He was promised a salary of S$3,000 a month, with an additional S$600 to S$800 for each bank account he provided. In April, he pleaded guilty to five charges, which included two counts of assisting another to retain benefits from criminal conduct and one count of being a member of a locally linked organised crime group. Aside from his involvement in the scams, Leong also pleaded guilty to two counts of rioting. Ten other charges were considered for sentencing. Reformative training and probation suitability reports were called at the previous hearing. On Tuesday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Jason Chua informed the court that Leong was found unsuitable for probation and suitable for reformative training. He asked the court to order reformative training for Leong, considering the seriousness of his offences. Defence counsel Audrey Koo asked for reformative training of a lower intensity and for a shorter period of six months. She argued that Leong has shown a willingness to change and has grown closer to his family and friends outside of his criminal organisation. Ms Koo said that since February, when her client was arrested, he has spent most of his time at home doing household chores, cooking for his family and taking care of his younger brother. She argued that a longer period in reformative training could lead to his relationship with his family growing estranged, when it was important for him to develop closer bonds with them. In response, Mr Chua said the fear that Leong and his family could grow estranged during reformative training was speculative, and not supported by evidence. The prosecutor said that Leong had multiple risk areas that needed intervention, including ""continued association with anti-social peers and his indulgence in unconstructive activities"". Reformative training at a higher intensity would offer psychology-based programmes, vocational training or extended studies and extensive family programmes to Leong over the year, he added. ""You have committed a number of serious offences - rioting, organised crime. And you are still young,"" said District Judge Kessler Soh in delivering the sentence. ""Because you are young, the court considered rehabilitation as the main sentencing consideration."" ""Despite what your counsel has said, there are many areas of your life that need to be improved – your attitude, your peers,"" the judge added. He also ordered Leong to speak to a court counsellor after his sentencing. The offence of facilitating the control of benefits from criminal conduct is punishable with up to 10 years' jail, a fine of up to S$500,000 or both. Those found guilty of being a member of a locally linked organised crime group can be jailed for up to five years, fined up to S$100,000 or both. The punishment for rioting is up to seven years in jail and caning."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-ex-girlfriend-nude-photos-spy-pinhole-camera-2789881,Man jailed for taking nude videos of ex-girlfriend with spy camera,"SINGAPORE: A man was jailed for eight weeks on Tuesday (Jul 5) for taking nude videos of his ex-girlfriend with a spy camera in the room that they used to share. The 48-year-old man pleaded guilty to one charge of insulting the woman's modesty. Another two similar charges were considered for sentencing. The victim's identity is protected by gag order, and the man's name cannot be published as it could lead to her identification. The court heard that the man and his girlfriend broke up in September 2019, and he moved out of the room they shared. But he still had access to the room as he knew the password for the lock. In October 2019, he installed a pinhole camera in the room. He hid the camera among luggage, covering it with a black sheet that was used to keep dust off the luggage. The victim discovered the camera in November 2019 when she took the luggage out to pack her belongings. She viewed the videos recorded by the camera and realised that several of them captured her nude. Deputy Public Prosecutor Ng Shao Yan sought two months' jail, noting that the use of technology to make the recordings increased the potential for circulation of the nude videos. Defence counsel Chung Ting Fai asked for four weeks' jail, arguing that his client was motivated by curiosity and jealousy over his failed relationship with the victim. Mr Chung told the court that his client and the victim had lived together for seven years and travelled to China to meet each other's parents, and that his client intended to marry her. But the lawyer said his client suspected his girlfriend was unfaithful after viewing footage from a closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera they placed outside the room for security. When he confronted her about this, she denied ever bringing another man into their home, according to the lawyer. This led the offender to feel betrayed, saddened and jealous, said Mr Chung. He then decided to install the pinhole camera to ascertain if the victim was bringing another man home. The prosecution acknowledged these motivations, and Mr Ng said the sentence sought already took into account that his conduct did not appear to be for nefarious purposes. District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt said that the man's actions nonetheless still constituted an invasion of the victim's privacy. The punishment for insulting a woman's modesty is up to a year in jail, a fine or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/renovation-fraud-scams-mha-law-change-penal-code-2789541,Singapore studying possible law change on renovation fraud,"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is studying if there is scope to amend existing laws to make it easier to establish fraud in cases where renovation works are not carried out. In response to a parliamentary question by MP Murali Pillai (PAP-Bukit Batok) on renovation fraud, Minister for Home Affairs and Law K Shanmugam said in a written answer on Monday (Jul 4) that the police investigated 100 cases involving errant renovation contractors between 2019 and 2021.  So far, 72 of these cases have been prosecuted in court, he said, adding that the ministry is unable to provide details of cases that happened this year as investigations are ongoing. Mr Shanmugam said that renovation fraud generally involves contractors getting victims to make payment for promised renovation works, which are either partially completed or not carried out at all. ""In most of these cases, the contractors become uncontactable after collecting payment, or provide excuses to explain why they were unable to complete the promised works,"" he said. Contractors who deceive victims into placing deposits without any intent to carry out renovation works can be charged with cheating offences under section 420 of the Penal Code. ""In some cases there could be genuine business distress, and the contractor may not have been able to do the work,"" said Mr Shanmugam. ""Further, where the economic situation changes suddenly, for example during the COVID-19 pandemic, some contractors might find themselves unable to fulfil their contracts. ""In each case, the question is whether there was fraudulent intent. Some other cases may involve fraudulent intent, but it may be very difficult to prove that in court."" He has asked MHA to study if there is scope to amend the law to make it easier to establish fraud in such cases, said Mr Shanmugam. The minister added that it can be difficult to recover the money lost in such scams, even if the culprit goes to jail, as they may no longer have the money. He advised homeowners to engage contractors with a good track record, such as those accredited under the joint accreditation between the Consumer Association of Singapore (CASE) and Singapore Renovation Contractors. In February this year, the owner of a renovation firm pleaded guilty to 29 charges, mostly for cheating. Chan Chee Kuen, 49, cheated 110 people of S$247,400 in refurbishment works and also targeted blocks selected by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) for the Home Improvement Programme. Last year, the number of complaints against renovation contractors jumped by almost 50 per cent. Nearly half of the complaints were about unsatisfactory workmanship or contractors failing to complete projects on time, data from CASE showed. The consumer watchdog said it received about 1,300 complaints against home renovation contractors in 2021. The increase in complaints was attributed to the prolonged shortage in manpower and raw materials arising from continued border restrictions due to COVID-19, pent-up demand in the residential property market, as well as a corresponding demand for home renovation last year. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/zhan-guotuan-chinese-businessman-singapore-restricted-property-east-coast-road-landed-2788621,Singaporean on trial for helping Chinese businessman buy restricted properties in East Coast,"SINGAPORE: A Singaporean man went on trial on Monday (Jul 4) for buying and aiding the purchase of three landed homes in East Coast that were allegedly held in trust for a Chinese businessman. The three houses at East Coast Road are restricted residential properties that foreign nationals must seek permission to own under the Residential Property Act. Singaporean Tan Hui Meng, 56, is accused of buying two of the houses in his own capacity and as the director of Hwampoa, a locally incorporated company. He is also suspected of aiding fellow Singaporean Guan Aimei to buy the other property.  This was allegedly done between 2007 and 2008 with the intention of holding the properties in trust for Chinese national Zhan Guotuan. Tan faces three charges under the Residential Property Act for the transactions. Mr Zhan allegedly planned to buy all the houses on that stretch of East Coast Road and redevelop the land into a condominium, a prosecution witness who worked for him will testify. The prosecution's case is that Tan ""cultivated and operated"" the ""extensive scheme"" to buy the properties in trust for Mr Zhan. Both Guan and Hwampoa earlier pleaded guilty and have been sentenced for their involvement. Restricted residential properties include vacant residential land, terrace houses, semi-detached houses, bungalows and shophouses, among others. The criteria to own restricted property includes holding permanent residency for a least five years and making ""exceptional"" economic contribution to Singapore, according to the Singapore Land Authority's website. In March 2007, Tan allegedly obtained an option to purchase the first property for S$1.55 million, aiding Guan's purchase of the house. The other properties were allegedly bought by Tan for S$2.3 million in April 2007 and by Hwampoa for S$2.4 million in January 2008. According to the prosecution, substantial amounts of the money to purchase and finance the loans for these houses came from two companies owned by Mr Zhan. These were Xin An Technology Group, which had Mr Zhan and his family as the only shareholders, and Alphaland International, of which Mr Zhan was the sole shareholder. Ownership of the three properties was eventually transferred to Mr Zhan's nephew or son, both of whom had recently obtained Singapore citizenship, between 2012 and 2013. The prosecution described the sale of the properties to Mr Zhan's family members as a ""sham"", as the money for the purchases originated from Mr Zhan or companies he owned and was ""round-tripped"" to make it seem like a legitimate sale had taken place. Tan faces another three charges related to making a false statutory declaration that Guan held one of the properties in trust for him, to support Guan's application for a Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat in 2010. As part of this, he is accused of instigating a solicitor to falsely certify an instrument of transfer for the land from Guan to himself. Tan is also contesting two charges of using the false statutory declaration and giving false evidence at the High Court in a lawsuit related to that property in 2014. Deputy Public Prosecutors Suhas Malhotra and Louis Ngia are leading evidence from Guan and her husband, who worked for Mr Zhan, as well as two CAD officers. Tan is represented by defence lawyer Loo Choon Hiaw. The trial continues on Tuesday with Guan and her husband taking the stand. The penalty for purchasing restricted property with the intention of holding it in trust for a foreign national, or abetting this offence, is up to three years in jail, a fine of up to S$50,000 or both. The offence of making a false statement in a statutory declaration is punishable with up to three years in jail and a fine. Those who use a false statutory declaration as true in a judicial proceeding or give false evidence in a judicial proceeding can be jailed for up to seven years and fined. Anyone who makes a false statement to HDB in relation to the purchase of a flat can be jailed for up to six months, fined up to S$5,000 or both. Those who falsely certify the correctness of an instrument of transfer, or abet such an act, can be fined up to S$5,000."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/heng-brothers-cheat-banks-suspected-money-laundering-scheme-russia-2788446,Brothers jailed for cheating banks in suspected transnational money-laundering scheme,"SINGAPORE: A man and his brother were recruited by a friend of more than 20 years to hold company directorships and bank accounts for a suspected transnational money-laundering scheme. Heng Boon Liang, 54, and younger brother Heng Joo Keng, 46, also known as Wang Yuqing, were on Monday (Jul 4) jailed for 18 days and 10 days respectively for their roles in the conspiracy. The older Heng was also fined S$18,600, after pleading guilty to seven counts of cheating and six charges under the Companies Act. Another 18 charges were considered for sentencing. The younger Heng, who pleaded guilty to four counts of cheating and two charges under the Companies Act, was fined S$4,500. Six more charges were considered for sentencing. The court heard that the older Heng was recruited into the scheme in June 2014 by long-time friend Glazov Maxim, a 57-year-old permanent resident from Russia. Heng, who was unemployed then, agreed to replace Maxim as the director of five companies he had incorporated: ASK Trading, JGHT Trading, MGHQ Import & Export, AMA Consultants and TB Logistics. Under this arrangement, Heng received a monthly salary of S$3,000 and an additional S$2,000 per company each year. He assisted with TB's operations, but otherwise the financial affairs and daily operations of the companies remained under Maxim's control. These companies are suspected to have been intermediaries for transactions involving parties in China, Russia and Eastern Europe, with none of the purported goods actually delivered to Singapore. Around March 2017, Maxim sold the five companies to Kritskiy Anton, a 37-year-old Russian national. In April 2017, Maxim told Heng that the banks were going to close the accounts of the five companies because of United States sanctions on Russian individuals and entities, and ""political issues"" between the two countries. He asked Heng to open bank accounts or take over as the bank account-holder for the five companies, in order to circumvent the banks' ""know your customer"" controls. To this end, Heng made false declarations to DBS Bank and RHB Bank that he was the ultimate beneficial owner of the companies ASK and TB. This passed the banks' due diligence checks as Heng was listed as the sole director and shareholder of the companies on their Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) profiles. About US$2.9 million (S$4 million) and €1.2 million (S$1.7 million) were transacted in the accounts for ASK and TB respectively. But Maxim and Heng soon started encountering more difficulties opening accounts for the companies. Anton also needed a Singaporean to act as the local nominee director and account-holder for two more companies, Gemini and Capricorn. Heng therefore decided to recruit his younger brother in May 2017, claiming that he was ""blacklisted"" by authorities and that Maxim and Anton could not use their names due to US sanctions. Heng would be paid S$2,000 per company each year. The younger Heng agreed, and falsely declared himself as the ultimate beneficial owner of Gemini and Capricorn in order to open accounts with DBS and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC). More than US$148 million and €78.9 million were transacted in these accounts. He went on to cheat Maybank and Associated Foreign Exchange (Singapore) in a similar manner. In May 2017, the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) was informed of a suspected money-laundering network in Singapore operated by Maxim and Anton. CAD found reason to suspect that most, if not all the purchases made by the companies were fraudulent or fictitious. Investigators found large amounts of money flowing through the seven companies that did not correspond to their turnover, paid-up capital, assets or age. They also found that the counterparties to the companies' transactions were not from the same industries, transaction amounts were disproportionately high and the companies bought similar goods from the same suppliers using repeat orders. Investigations into possible money-laundering offences are still ongoing. The Heng brothers also failed to exercise any due diligence when they were directors, as they were not involved in daily operations, did not conduct checks on the affairs and did not supervise the financial affairs of the companies. This constituted their offences under the Companies Act. Deputy Public Prosecutors Magdalene Huang and Tan Zhi Hao sought the jail terms imposed on the brothers, highlighting that the offences involved the deception of multiple financial institutions and deserved deterrent sentences. The cheating offences - carried out over a period of eight months by the older Heng and seven months by the younger Heng - were premeditated and difficult to detect, said the prosecutors. But the prosecutors acknowledged that there was no evidence the brothers were alerted to the probably fraudulent transactions conducted using the companies with which they were associated. Defence counsel Diana Ngiam argued that both her clients did not think there were and did not know of any illicit transactions happening in the companies. When questioned by District Judge Janet Wang on the brothers' education and employment, Ms Ngiam informed the court that the older Heng had obtained his O-Level certificate, while the younger Heng had graduated from the Institute of Technical Education and worked as a technician. The prosecution added that the older Heng worked in the food and beverage industry before working as a stationery shop assistant, where he met Maxim more than 20 years ago. Ms Ngiam also argued that the younger Heng was ""parachuted in to help his brother"", and his culpability was therefore lower. She added that both men were remorseful and cooperated fully with authorities. Maxim will appear in court to plead guilty to his charges later in July. Anton has absconded and is believed to be in Russia. A warrant for his arrest has been issued. Those convicted of cheating can be jailed for up to three years, fined or both. The punishment for failing to exercise reasonable diligence in discharging duties as a director is jail for up to a year, a fine of up to S$5,000, and any profit made or damage suffered by the company as a result. The penalty for failing to keep accounting and other records to explain the transactions and financial position of a company is jail for up to a year, a fine of up to S$5,000 and a penalty."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/company-director-charged-shell-companies-bank-accounts-money-laundering-2788196,Woman charged for role as director in suspected shell companies used for money laundering,"SINGAPORE: A woman was charged on Monday (Jul 4) for her role as a director in two suspected shell companies used for money laundering.  Susila Hyrawatty Hashim, 43, is facing two counts of offences under the Companies Act, for allegedly failing to exercise reasonable diligence in her duties as director of two Singapore firms - Noxt Lightings and Aubright Lightings.  She was also charged with possessing in a company bank account funds suspected of being another person’s benefits from criminal conduct, ""which she had failed to account satisfactorily how she came by"", said police in a news release.  Investigations showed that she had allegedly incorporated the two firms after being instructed to do so by an unidentified person. This person is thought to have accessed the companies' bank accounts to launder crime proceeds. Police highlighted a transaction in Aubright Lightings' bank account on Sep 30, 2021, where the firm received a sum of more than S$265,000. Susila, who is the company's sole director, could not ""account satisfactorily"" how the money came about.  For failing to exercise reasonable diligence in the discharge of her duties, she may be jailed up to a year, or fined up to S$5,000. Offenders may also be fined and disqualified from acting as a director for up to five years. Police advised the public to “consider their ability to act as directors for companies and ensure that they are able to exercise reasonable diligence in the discharge of their duties”. “Should a director exercise inadequate supervision over the company’s affairs, there is a risk that the company may be used to facilitate illicit activities, such as the laundering of criminal proceeds,” they added."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cheat-nus-corruption-procurement-lab-executive-2785026,"2 men jailed for conspiring with NUS lab executive to cheat more than S$350,000","SINGAPORE: Two men were on Friday (Jul 1) sentenced to jail for cheating the National University of Singapore (NUS) into awarding more than S$350,000 worth of supply orders to their companies. Gan Yee Aun, 35, and Sandy Tan Wei Jie, 34, each received 16 months and two weeks' jail for their role in a scheme initiated by then NUS employee Liaw Jinle. Liaw, 34, joined NUS' Centre for Advanced 2D Materials as a laboratory executive in 2016. He was earlier sentenced to 20 months and two weeks' jail for his role in the scheme. As a laboratory executive, Liaw was tasked with sourcing quotations for the centre's procurement needs. In 2017, Liaw approached Gan, whom he met in reservist training, with his idea of setting up a company and directing jobs from NUS there to earn profit. He knew that he could not register this firm himself due to conflict of interest. Gan agreed to the scheme, and in late 2017 set up two companies to secure jobs from NUS with Liaw's assistance. Over the next two years, he added two more firms to the arrangement. From November 2017 to February 2020, Gan cheated NUS of more than S$196,000 through 72 jobs awarded to his companies. He got information from Liaw on how to price quotations to ensure maximum profits, and took advice on how to fill in quotations and invoices to NUS so that they appeared more professional. The jobs generally had a profit margin of 10 to 30 per cent. Initially, the agreement was for Gan to get two-thirds of the profits. But in January 2019, both men agreed for Liaw's one-third share of the profits to go towards paying off the interest on his debts to Gan. Liaw had been borrowing money from Gan and licensed moneylenders since 2016, for purposes such as paying off his credit card bills and financing his wedding and renovation works. Tan and Liaw also embarked on a similar scheme. Tan admitted to deceiving NUS into paying more than S$162,000 to two companies that he owned between March and December 2019. Gan, who was represented by Mr Cory Wong, estimated his profit to be at least S$41,000. He voluntarily surrendered this amount a day before the hearing. He pleaded guilty to one count of cheating and two counts of corruption, with four more similar charges considered for sentencing. Tan estimated his gains to be around S$81,000, of which he has voluntarily surrendered about S$20,000. He was represented by Mr Ang Sin Teck. He pleaded guilty to two counts of cheating and corruption, with another two similar charges considered for sentencing. Deputy Public Prosecutor Victoria Ting told the court that as Liaw initiated the scheme, Gan and Tan's sentences should be adjusted with reference to his jail term. The prosecutor also acknowledged the full repayment and partial repayment made by Gan and Tan respectively of their profits from the scheme. But she added that in Gan's case, he was the main beneficiary of the profits from the arrangement with Liaw, and actively broadened the reach of the scheme to more companies. She sought the sentence imposed on Gan, and asked for at least 16 months for Tan in the interests of parity. Mr Wong sought no more than nine months and two weeks' jail for his client, and argued that Gan had repaired NUS' outstanding economic loss by paying back his full profits to the university. But District Judge Ronald Gwee said that some losses were immeasurable, such as the loss of confidence in ""a system where integrity plays a primary position"". He said that the prosecution's sentencing position was a reasonable compromise between Gan, Tan and Liaw's comparative levels of culpability. The punishment for cheating is up to 10 years' jail with the possibility of a fine. The penalty for a corrupt transaction with an agent is up to five years' jail, a fine of up to S$100,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/homemade-pipe-bomb-explosives-detonate-east-coast-park-youth-polytechnic-student-2782486,Probation for youth who detonated homemade bombs at East Coast Park,"SINGAPORE: A 19-year-old youth was on Thursday (Jun 30) sentenced to 18 months' probation for making and lighting up improvised pipe bombs at East Coast Park. The youth cannot be named as he was under 18 at the time of the offences and therefore protected by the Children and Young Persons Act. Deputy Public Prosecutor Sean Teh said the probation suitability report found that the youth, who is a polytechnic student, had no recent violent offences and no intention to hurt anyone with his actions. His fascination with fire and explosives was found not to be extensive, and he had moved on to other interests. The youth had also been cooperative and his parents were prepared to increase their supervision of him, said the prosecutor. The youth pleaded guilty in May to four charges of making explosives without a licence, committing a rash act with a dangerous substance likely to cause hurt or injury to others, and abetting such an act. Three more similar charges were considered for sentencing. His interest in explosives dated back at least to April 2019, when he and a friend brought improvised sparkler bombs that he made to the beach at East Coast Park. He asked his friend to light one of the sparkler bombs up and throw it into the sea. It detonated, emitting a series of flashes and a loud explosion. The youth started researching how to make bombs online during the COVID-19 ""circuit breaker"". Between May and June 2020, he bought 200 boxes of matchsticks to make pipe bombs. He brought two pipe bombs and several sparkler bombs to a skate park at East Coast Park on Jun 7, 2020. He first lit up the sparkler bombs, which produced flames but did not explode. He picked one up and threw it towards a grass patch, causing the bomb to explode on contact with the ground. He then placed the two pipe bombs on the same grass patch and lit them, before running away. One of them detonated, causing a loud explosion and emitting sparks. He took home the other pipe bomb that did not detonate and disposed of it in the rubbish chute. On both occasions, the youth had taken videos of the bombs going off and posted them on Instagram. Police were alerted to these posts on Jun 19, 2020. In sentencing, District Judge Kessler Soh said he hoped the youth would learn from this experience and not carry out such potentially dangerous actions again. Under his probation conditions, the youth must stay indoors from 10pm to 6am, perform 60 hours of community service and attend psychiatric or psychological treatment as necessary. His parents also executed a bond of S$5,000 to ensure his good behaviour during the probation period. The penalty for making explosives without a licence is up to three years' jail and a fine of up to S$10,000. Those who commit a rash act with a dangerous substance or combustible matter likely to cause hurt or injury to another person, or abet such an act, can be jailed for up to one year, fined up to S$5,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/osa-leak-lta-enforcement-officer-deployment-plan-pmd-rider-2782416,2 people get jail for leaking deployment plan to help PMD riders avoid enforcement,"SINGAPORE: A woman and man have been sentenced to one week's jail for leaking the deployment plan of active mobility enforcement officers in order to help other personal mobility device (PMD) riders avoid tickets and summonses. Syarifah Nur Nabilah Syed Omar, 24, was a former Certis CISCO auxiliary police officer at the time of the offences. She sent the deployment plan to Afendi Mohamed Rashid, 36, who then sent it to a WhatsApp group with about 211 members. On Thursday (Jun 30), each pleaded guilty to one charge of communicating information obtained in contravention of the Official Secrets Act. During her time with Certis CISCO, Syarifah served as a Land Transport Authority (LTA) active mobility enforcement officer. These officers patrol pedestrian walkways to detect errant PMD riders who use modified devices, speeding and compromising road safety. LTA staff would plan the areas for each team's daily patrol, and team leaders would come up with a daily deployment plan containing details such as the specific officers to be deployed to specific streets and park connectors, and patrolling times. These details changed from day to day and were not known in advance by the public.  Syarifah resigned on May 20, 2021, but remained in a WhatsApp chat group where her team leader would disseminate the daily deployment plans to the team. She continued to receive the deployment plans through the group from May 21 to Jun 1, 2021, the day of the offence. On the morning of Jun 1, 2021, Syarifah took a screenshot of the deployment plan sent to the group, and forwarded it to Afendi. She did this despite knowing she was not allowed to receive the information nor circulate it to other unauthorised people. Syarifah and Afendi met while doing food deliveries, and Afendi knew that she was a former active mobility enforcement officer. The court heard that they would pass each other information about such enforcement efforts so that they would know where to avoid the officers. Syarifah therefore wanted to warn him. After receiving the screenshot, Afendi forwarded it to a WhatsApp chat group along with a statement to the effect of: ""Don't I say I never protect ah. Today GM deployment."" Active mobility enforcement officers are colloquially known as ""GM"" or ""green men"" because of the vests they wear. There were around 211 people in this public chat group. The screenshot was subsequently forwarded by other people to at least three other WhatsApp chat groups for PMD riders. Later that same day, Syarifah's former team leader made a police report that one of his officers had come across the daily deployment plan leaked on an e-scooter WhatsApp chat group. Syarifah later deleted the screenshot and her message to Afendi as she was afraid the police would find them. Around the same time, Afendi deleted the screenshot and his chatlogs with Syarifah as well as the WhatsApp chat group. An investigating officer called Afendi on Jun 2, 2021 but he refused to go to the police station for an interview, and blocked the officer's phone number. He also hung up when another officer called him to come for an interview. Afendi was eventually arrested in December 2021. Deputy Public Prosecutor Seah Ee Wei asked for one to two week's jail for each offender. She argued that their culpability was similar, as both ultimately intended to help others avoid law enforcement. She argued that both offenders had aggravating factors. Syarifah was a former enforcement officer and had obtained the leaked information, while Afendi sent it on to 211 people. Both also tried to avoid detection. Syarifah's defence counsel Azri Imran Tan argued that his client's culpability was lower than that of Afendi as she had only sent the screenshot to one person, Afendi, and this was ""merely to help him"". Afendi was not represented. He asked the judge for leniency, saying he was the sole breadwinner of his family and needed to be with his wife, who suffers from anxiety. Deputy Principal District Judge Luke Tan said he saw no indication that Syarifah took steps to limit the spread of the screenshot to only one person, and noted that she was a former enforcement officer herself, which ""makes this worse"". He said that he would not make a distinction in sentence as Syarifah and Afendi each had their own sets of aggravating factors. They could have been jailed for up to two years and fined up to S$2,000."

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/piang-ngaih-don-myanmar-maid-abuse-killed-gaiyathiri-murugayan-appeal-2776606,Fatal abuse of Myanmar maid: Court of Appeal dismisses woman's plea to halve 30-year jail term,"SINGAPORE: The Court of Appeal on Wednesday (Jun 29) dismissed an appeal for a shorter sentence by a woman who was sentenced to 30 years' jail last year for abusing and killing her domestic helper. Gaiyathiri Murugayan, who admitted to the fatal abuse of her domestic helper Piang Ngaih Don in what a High Court judge called ""among the worst cases of culpable homicide"", had sought to reduce her jail sentence to between 12 and 15 years. Gaiyathiri, 42, had pleaded for judicial mercy on the grounds that her psychiatric disorder would cause disproportionate suffering. The three-judge panel rejected her appeal, upholding the sentence imposed by High Court Justice See Kee Oon. They said that that given the severity of her offences, judicial mercy could not be justified given the significant public interest in condemning her crimes. After their decision, Gaiyathiri informed the court that she would petition Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Ms Piang Ngaih Don, a 24-year-old Myanmar national, died of brain injury with severe blunt trauma to her neck on Jul 26, 2016, after 14 months of repeated abuse. She weighed just 24kg when she died. In the days before her death, she was starved, tied to a window grille at night and assaulted if she tried to rummage for food from the dustbin. Gaiyathiri appeared via video-link from prison and addressed the court herself on Wednesday. Her lawyer Joseph Chen also appeared before the court to observe proceedings. The appeal was heard by Justices Andrew Phang, Judith Prakash and Steven Chong. Gaiyathiri's petition canvassed some similar arguments from a previously dismissed application before the Court of Appeal, related to her psychiatric condition and treatment in prison. She argued that Justice See had failed to consider the opinion of defence psychiatrist Dr Jacob Rajesh, who had diagnosed her with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Gaiyathiri had qualified for the defence of diminished responsibility. She was found to suffer from major depressive disorder and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, both of which substantially contributed to her offences. She claimed that her condition had improved since being remanded and given treatment, as she refrained from violence towards other inmates despite ""bullying"". She argued that this showed her treatment of the victim was due to her psychiatric condition and lack of access to medicine. In her petition, she also claimed that she felt pressured into hastening her plea of guilt last year to expedite proceedings against her mother. She also argued that the judge did not give sufficient weight to her stressors in the form of her children's health, and her feelings of remorse during sentencing. Gaiyathiri then repeated claims she had previously made about verbal and sexual abuse by prison officers and other inmates, saying it was not a matter of the length of her sentence but how she would go through it. ""If you tell me I will be well and alive for the 30 years I will have nothing to say,"" she told the judges. Justice Prakash responded: ""It's useless to make the complaint to us because we do not control the prisons. What we are here to decide is simply how long the sentence should be."" The prosecution told the court that it had previously obtained an affidavit from the Singapore Prison Service and shown that the allegations about mistreatment in prison were false. Deputy Public Prosecutor Mohamed Faizal went on to argue that Justice See found that Gaiyathiri's actions were ""heinous"" based on the circumstances of the offence. ""The facts speak for themselves,"" said the prosecutor, citing the fact that the victim lost almost 40 per cent of her body weight during her employment and that dozens of scars and external injuries were found on her body. Delivering the judgment on behalf of the three-judge panel, Justice Phang said two issues arose from Gaiyathiri's petition. The first issue was whether she was allowed to rely on Dr Rajesh's report on her psychiatric condition in her appeal. The court found that she was not allowed to do so because this would qualify her plea of guilt, as the report contradicted the findings of another psychiatrist to which she had admitted. The second issue was whether Gaiyathiri had demonstrated any grounds to intervene in Justice See's sentence. The Court of Appeal found that the mitigating factors she raised were ""wholly without merit"", and upheld Justice See's findings on the appropriate weight to place on Gaiyathiri's psychiatric condition, alleged mental stressors and alleged feelings of remorse. Psychiatrist Dr Derrick Yeo had found that while Gaiyathiri's mental responsibility was impaired, she remained capable of exercising conscious deliberation and volitional control throughout her offences. Justice Phang said this was also supported by the facts of the case, as Gaiyathiri would hurt the victim due to perceived lapses, which meant she was purposeful in her criminal conduct. The judges also found that her alleged improved condition on remand was irrelevant, since it was already accepted that her psychiatric condition contributed to her offences, and post-offence conduct cannot be a mitigating factor. On Gaiyathiri's contention that she felt pressured into pleading guilty to hasten proceedings, the Court of Appeal said this was ""an afterthought concocted after receiving what she perceived to be an unfavourable sentence"". The judges also rejected Gaiyathiri's allegations that insufficient weight was given to her mental stressors, namely her children's ill health that she claimed was due to the victim's purported poor hygiene. Justice Phang said that this claim ""goes to demonstrate her patent lack of remorse as she seeks to blame anything and anyone but herself for her offending behaviour"". Gaiyathiri's husband, suspended police officer Kevin Chelvam, faces five charges linked to the case. Gaiyathiri's mother, Prema Naraynasamy, also has pending charges."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/r-kelly-sentenced-30-years-prison-sex-case-2780986,R&B singer R Kelly sentenced to 30 years in prison in sex case,"NEW YORK: R Kelly was sentenced on Wednesday (Jun 29) to 30 years in prison, following the multiplatinum R&B singer's conviction for exploiting his stardom and wealth over decades to lure women and underage girls into his orbit for sex. The sentence was imposed nine months after Kelly, 55, was convicted of racketeering and sex crimes, in a trial that amplified accusations that had dogged the singer of the Grammy-winning hit I Believe I Can Fly for two decades. United States District Judge Ann Donnelly in Brooklyn federal court said that the evidence reflected Kelly's ""indifference to human suffering"" and ""sheer brutality"" toward his victims. ""This case is not about sex. It's about violence and cruelty and control,"" Donnelly told Kelly. ""You left in your wake a trail of broken lives."" Kelly, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, is among the most prominent people convicted of sexual misbehaviour during the #MeToo movement against such conduct by prominent men. He did not speak during Wednesday's hearing, but has repeatedly denied sexual abuse accusations. The sentencing came after several accusers, some of whom were tearful, told the judge about how Kelly promised to mentor them and help them attain stardom, only to subject them to degrading sexual treatment and physical harm. Many said that the abuse led to mental health problems that persist. ""As a teenager, I didn't know how to say no to R Kelly when he asked me to perform oral sex on him,"" said a woman identified as Jane Doe No 2. She then paused, looked at Kelly, and asked: ""Do you remember that?"" Kelly wore a black face mask and beige prison clothing to his sentencing. Several accusers testified during the five-and-a-half-week trial about how Kelly would demand that his victims strictly obey his rules These included needing his permission go to the bathroom, calling him ""Daddy"" and writing ""apology letters"" that purported to absolve Kelly of wrongdoing, among others. The alleged victims included the singer Aaliyah, who prosecutors said Kelly fraudulently married when she was 15 to conceal earlier abuse. Aaliyah died in 2001. He was convicted on nine criminal charges, including one count of racketeering and eight counts of violating the Mann Act, which bars transporting people across state lines for prostitution. Prosecutors had urged a prison sentence of more than 25 years, saying that Kelly had demonstrated a ""callous disregard"" for his victims and shown no remorse. Defence lawyers said that Kelly deserved no more than 10 years, the mandatory minimum, arguing that his history as an abused child may have led to his adult ""hypersexuality"", and that he no longer posed a threat. ""This court must distinguish between what is boorish and bad behaviour, and what is criminal conduct,"" Kelly's lawyer Jennifer Bonjean said prior to the sentencing. Kelly has been in jail since July 2019. He will likely be transported soon to a jail in Chicago, where he faces an August trial in federal court on child pornography and obstruction charges. He also faces various state charges in Illinois and Minnesota. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-lie-have-covid19-ntu-research-study-2776401,Man fined for lying that he had COVID-19 to get out of research study,"SINGAPORE: A man was fined S$5,000 on Wednesday (Jun 29) for lying that he had COVID-19 in order to get out of a voluntary research study by Nanyang Technological University (NTU). Paul Chan Kin Nang, 42, was also ordered to compensate the university S$349 for logistical changes they had to make because of his lie. He pleaded guilty to one charge of transmitting a false message under the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act. The court heard that Chan, a civil servant, had signed up to be a paid research participant for an NTU study on mental processes in decision-making. Participants were informed that they could withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. There was no need to provide any convincing reason for withdrawal as the study was voluntary. Chan completed the first session of the research study on Sep 1, 2020. The second session of the study was scheduled for Sep 7, 2020. The day before the second session, one of the researchers emailed Chan to remind him about it. A few hours later, Chan replied saying: ""Hi, I am unable to attend the session tomorrow as I am (sic) tested positive for COVID-19 and is now quarantine (sic) in hospital."" This was a false message, as Chan had not tested positive for COVID-19. That same evening, the researcher replied to Chan asking him when his symptoms first started and when he tested positive, as the team had to report it to the university. Chan did not reply to her email, and the researcher alerted her team to the issue. On the morning of Sep 7, 2020, an NTU administration manager emailed Chan asking for his COVID-19 case number and whether he was symptomatic. She said this was because NTU had to check with the Education Ministry on what follow-up actions to take for the research staff who had been in contact with him. When Chan saw the email, he realised that government authorities would be informed. He replied claiming that his email had been hacked and used without authorisation to send the earlier email to NTU. ""Please be assured that I am perfectly fine,"" he wrote in the email. Later that day, the Health Ministry also informed NTU that Chan was not in its records of COVID-19 cases. The NTU administration manager made a police report on Sep 9, 2020. During police questioning, Chan admitted that he had sent the false message ""as he did not want to turn up for the second session but also did not want to formally reject NTU's reminder"", court documents stated. As a result of his actions, NTU placed two staff members on leave of absence, causing them worry and distress, until the Health Ministry clarified that Chan was not a COVID-19 case.  Research activities and data collection on NTU's campus were also suspended on Sep 7, 2020, and research activities were disrupted that week and the following week. Research staff also had to reschedule and follow up with all research participants until Chan's message was confirmed to be a false alarm. Deputy Public Prosecutor R Arvindren sought the fine that was imposed, calling Chan's actions ""plain irresponsible"" and ""inexplicable"" as he could have just withdrawn from the study. ""This is not a situation where the accused was trying to evade consequences from attending a compulsory event such as work or school,"" he said. ""There was no benefit to anybody, even the accused himself, when the accused resorted to this specific lie."" Mr Arvindren argued that Chan told his lie at a time when the COVID-19 vaccine was not yet available and there was considerable distress about contact with positive cases. But he added that Chan's actions had little potential to cause wider public alarm and wasted minimal public resources. Defence lawyer Josiah Zee also sought a fine for his client, saying that Chan's actions were ""foolish"" but that he had no malicious intent. He also cited a report from an Institute of Mental Health psychiatrist who found that Chan sent the false message because he was worried that the researchers would form a poor impression of him. Mr Zee said this was his client's first brush with the law, and the general observation from his colleagues' testimonials was that he was a person of good character. The lawyer also said that his client was willing to compensate NTU for the monetary loss incurred. The charge Chan pleaded guilty to is an offence that was added to the Act in January last year. He could have been jailed up to three years, fined up to S$10,000 or both for transmitting the false message. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/right-turn-car-accident-collision-motorcycle-lorry-driver-2774721,"Lorry driver jailed for careless right turn that killed motorcyclist, injured 2 others","SINGAPORE: A lorry driver was jailed for four months on Tuesday (Jun 28) for careless driving that killed a motorcyclist and injured two other riders. Shi Guohua, 48, was making a right turn from Jalan Boon Lay into Enterprise Road at the time of the accident on the morning of Feb 29, 2020. He was also banned from driving for eight years, after pleading guilty to one charge of driving without reasonable consideration for other road users. Two more charges in relation to the two other injured riders were considered for sentencing. The court heard that the 40-year-old victim worked at Exxon Mobil. He had finished work that morning and was travelling home with two colleagues. Each was riding his own motorcycle. At about 8.40am, the victim was travelling on the first lane of Jalan Boon Lay towards Jalan Bahar. His colleagues were in the first and second lanes.  Around the same time, Shi was driving on the first lane of Jalan Boon Lay in the opposite direction. He made a right turn into Enterprise Road, which was directly in the path of the three motorcycles. Shi admitted to doing this without checking to see if there were other vehicles nearby, court documents stated. The victim tried to avoid hitting Shi's lorry, but could not do so. He collided with the rear left part of the lorry and was thrown off his motorcycle. His two colleagues also collided with Shi's lorry and fell or were thrown off their motorcycles. The victim was taken to the hospital while unconscious and died about an hour later. His cause of death was multiple injuries consistent with those sustained in a road traffic accident. A Health Sciences Authority forensic report found that if Shi had been looking in the direction of oncoming traffic when turning, it was likely that he would have seen the victim. The forensic report also found that the victim was travelling at speeds of between 103 kmh and 139 kmh at the time, which was above the speed limit of 70 kmh. His two colleagues were also speeding. At the point of the collision, the victim was found to be travelling at 103 kmh to 111 kmh. No mechanical faults were found in Shi's lorry. Deputy Public Prosecutor Thiagesh Sukumaran asked for three to six months' jail, highlighting that Shi would have seen the victim if he had checked for oncoming traffic. He added that Shi was driving a long and heavy vehicle, and it would have been important to ensure it was safe for the entire lorry to make a right turn before proceeding to do so. Mr Sukumaran also noted that the victim and his colleagues were travelling at ""excessively high"" speeds above the speed limit. Their conduct therefore contributed to the accident, and this lowered Shi's culpability, he said. The penalty for driving without reasonable consideration and causing death is up to three years' jail, a fine of up to S$10,000, or both for a first offence."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/rape-trial-house-breaking-door-key-yap-pow-foo-2774336,Man on trial for raping intoxicated woman after breaking into her house,"SINGAPORE: A man has been accused of raping an intoxicated woman after breaking into her house following a night of drinking in 2017. Yap Pow Foo, 47, went on trial on Tuesday (Jun 28) for one charge each of rape and house-breaking. He also faces a charge of harassing a woman in a separate case, which is being stood down during the trial. Yap and the 39-year-old victim had a mutual friend but had never met before the events leading up to the alleged incident, said Deputy Public Prosecutors Chong Kee En and Susanna Yim. On Jan 29, 2017, the victim gathered with three other women and two men in her home, where they played mahjong and drank alcohol to celebrate Chinese New Year. In the evening, all six went to a KTV lounge in Bugis. Yap joined them towards the end of the night, and drove the victim and four other members of the group to their homes at around 12.45am on Jan 30, 2017. The victim was the first to be dropped off at home. She was heavily intoxicated at the time and had to be carried by two of her friends. Yap also found his own way to her apartment separately. After putting the victim to bed, closed-circuit television footage captured all three people, including Yap, leaving and locking the door behind them. One of the victim's friends slipped the key under the door, according to the prosecution. Yap then proceeded to drive the remaining members of the group home. But around 3.05am, he was captured on CCTV returning to and entering the victim's apartment by himself. He was seen on CCTV again leaving the victim's home at about 3.45am. About 25 minutes later, the victim called the police to report a case of rape. The prosecution's case is that Yap broke into the victim's home by extracting the victim's key from under her door and using it to unlock and enter the apartment. Yap is then suspected of raping the victim while she was unconscious. The victim woke up in the middle of the alleged act to find an unknown man, Yap, on top of her. Yap was arrested in the afternoon of Jan 30, 2017. According to prosecutors, his DNA was found on the inside of the victim's shorts and in a swab taken from the victim's body. Toxicology tests found that the concentration of alcohol in the victim at the time of the alleged offence would have been consistent with significant mental and physical impairment. During investigations, Yap admitted to a police officer that he went back to look for the victim because of her ""intimate"" behaviour with him earlier that night, according to a statement by the officer read out in court. He claimed that at the KTV lounge, the victim had hugged him, told him she was lonely and given him her phone number and condominium access number. He took this as an invitation for companionship. Yap told the police officer that at the victim's apartment, he managed to retrieve the house key which was slipped under her door. He said he knew the victim was not sober, but wanted to find out why she was not answering his calls. When he tried asking her about this, she opened her eyes and mumbled. Yap then claimed that he asked the victim if she wanted to change her clothes. She mumbled her reply but he could not understand what she said. He said that he took off the victim's clothes, leaving her in her underwear, then laid next to her and started touching her. He then admitted to taking off her undergarments and said he had more intimate contact with her. He claimed that she opened her eyes and looked at him.  According to the officer, Yap then claimed that he ""accidentally slipped"", referring to the sex act. The woman told him: ""I don't want."" The prosecution will lead evidence from 36 witnesses to prove its case against Yap. The victim and four of her friends who were with her that night will testify. The trial continues with the victim expected to testify in private in the afternoon. If convicted of rape, Yap faces up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning. If found guilty of house-breaking, he could be jailed for up to five years and fined. As he has past convictions for house-breaking, he may also be caned."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/103-arrested-police-checks-1500-nightlife-outlets-covid-19-2773116,"103 people arrested during islandwide checks on 1,500 nightlife, entertainment outlets","SINGAPORE: A total of 103 people were arrested following islandwide checks on 1,543 public entertainment and nightlife outlets in Singapore, the police said on Monday (Jun 27).  The enforcement operations were conducted between Apr 19 and Jun 14 this year as part of ongoing efforts to ensure a safe resumption of nightlife businesses in Singapore, they added.  The checks were carried out together with the Singapore Tourism Board, the Urban Redevelopment Authority, Enterprise Singapore, Singapore Food Agency, Singapore Land Authority, Sentosa Development Corporation and JTC Corporation. The police arrested 71 men and 32 women, aged between 16 and 53, for various offences such as being members of unlawful societies, possessing offensive weapons in a public place, causing annoyance while drunk and working without a valid work permit. Twenty-seven of these women were arrested under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act for purportedly working at nightlife establishments as freelance hostesses by providing companionship and drinking with patrons without a valid work permit. The women were of Thai, Chinese and Vietnamese nationalities, said the police.  Forty-eight licensed and unlicensed public entertainment and nightlife outlets were found to have committed various breaches.  Seven of these outlets were found to have flouted COVID-19 regulations. Among the offences were failing to minimise physical interaction between patrons and staff members, as well as failing to implement a system of checks for vaccination-differentiated safe management measures. Some of these outlets also did not ensure patrons remained masked while indoors. Four closure orders and six composition fines of S$1,000 each were also issued to operators for breaching safe management measures.  During a check on Apr 24, an outlet located in a shopping centre along Outram Road was found to have permitted a group of 11 unmasked patrons to gather within its premises. As the operator had failed to ensure that the group size of unmasked patrons did not exceed the prevailing limit of 10, it was issued with a 10-day closure order and fined S$1,000.  A separate check on a shophouse along Jalan Besar on May 14 found an outlet that was furnished with five private rooms. The rooms were equipped with karaoke systems, speakers, microphones and televisions.  ""Patrons were purportedly permitted to sing karaoke in these rooms even though the operator did not possess a valid public entertainment licence,"" said the police, adding that the operator is being investigated.  The offence of providing public entertainment without a valid licence carries a fine of up to S$20,000. For non-compliance with safe distancing measures under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Reopening – Control Order) Regulations 2022, individuals and operators found guilty may be jailed for up to six months, fined up to S$10,000, or both.  ""The police and agencies will continue to carry out enforcement operations at public entertainment outlets to suppress illicit activities,"" said the police.  The police added that members of the public and businesses should remain vigilant and continue to take the prevailing safe management measures seriously. ""The police have zero tolerance for irresponsible behaviour relating to the flouting of these measures, and offenders will be dealt with firmly in accordance with the law,"" they added. All nightlife businesses, including nightclubs and discotheques, were allowed to fully reopen from Apr 19 with Singapore further easing COVID-19 restrictions on Apr 26, with group size limits removed and safe distancing no longer required.  Nightlife establishments with dancing among patrons were no longer subjected to a capacity limit from Jun 14. Patrons are also no longer required to obtain a negative antigen rapid test (ART) result to enter such venues. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/father-daughter-rape-sexual-assault-13-years-sentenced-jail-2773176,Father jailed for sexually abusing daughter for 13 years,"SINGAPORE: For about 13 years, a man sexually abused his daughter in the family home when her mother was not around. The abuse started in 2007 when the victim was eight. It continued for years until his offences came to light in 2020. The 63-year-old offender was jailed for 26-and-a-half years on Monday (Jun 27) after pleading guilty to four charges of rape and sexual assault. Another 22 charges for similar offences were considered for sentencing. The man cannot be named in order to protect the identity of the victim.  The court heard that the victim lived in a three-room flat with her parents.  From a young age, the victim occasionally slept in her parents' master bedroom as there was no air-conditioning in her bedroom. The victim's mother was often out at work during the day. As her father had more flexible work hours, he was often alone with her in the flat. The abuse started in December 2007. The victim was sleeping in the master bedroom at the time when her father woke her up and sexually assaulted her for 15 minutes. He then told her not to tell anyone what had happened and left for work. She listened to him as she feared his temper. Deputy Public Prosecutors Sheldon Lim and Ng Yiwen said this was the first instance of what would become years of prolonged abuse. In January 2008, the man escalated to raping his daughter for the first time when her mother was out working. He continued to sexually abuse her from 2008 until August 2020, when she was 21 years old. The man also showed her pornography. The victim did not consent to any of the acts. While she wanted her father to stop the abuse, she did not know how to, said the prosecutors. ""She felt confused, lost and helpless because on the one hand she was afraid of the accused because of his temper and did not want her parents to divorce, but on the other, he was sexually exploiting her, and she felt shame and anger,"" they said. On the morning of Aug 2, 2020, the victim's father sexually assaulted her while her mother was in the shower. Early the next morning, the victim was sleeping in the master bedroom when she woke up to her father touching her chest. Her mother was also in the room at the time. ""This was the final straw that broke the camel's back,"" said the prosecutors. Later that morning, when the victim left the flat, she broke down as she could no longer take the abuse. She was also overwhelmed with guilt at the thought that she was ""betraying"" her mother, said the prosecutors. The victim told her boyfriend that she had been sexually abused since she was a child. At her boyfriend's encouragement, the victim also told her mother about the offences and made a police report. Her mother had not been aware of the sexual abuse and was overwhelmed when she learnt of the allegations. The man was arrested on Aug 3, 2020. During his initial police interview, he lied that he only had consensual sex with his daughter after she turned 18. He subsequently admitted to the offences. The victim was assessed at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH). She reported feeling helpless and harming herself as she was unable to cope with her internal distress. She also had brief thoughts of death and ending her life. The IMH psychiatrist found that the victim was abused from a very young age and would have found it difficult to understand what was happening. The offender was also seen at IMH, where he was found not to have any mental disorder and not to be of unsound mind at the time. Prosecutors asked for at least 28 years' jail for the man, arguing that he had abused his position and violated the trust placed in him by the victim, society and the victim's mother. ""No mother leaving for work in the morning would dream that in her absence, her husband would rape their daughter in their marital flat in the afternoon,"" said Mr Lim. They also highlighted his forcible rape of a young and vulnerable victim, and the fact that his actions exposed her to the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. The man cannot be caned as he is above 50, and the prosecution did not ask for a jail sentence in lieu. Defence counsel Ramesh Tiwary asked the court to give consideration to his client's guilty plea and his cooperation with authorities. He argued that his client had admitted to all the charges at an early stage, when allegations had only been made by the victim and there was no other evidence. Mr Tiwary also said that his client wished to have time to spend the last few years of his life with his family to earn their forgiveness. In sentencing, Justice Ang Cheng Hock said that the offender had a moral obligation to care for his daughter. His sexual exploitation of her was therefore a ""highly egregious"" breach of his role as a father. The judge said that the sentence had to be harsh enough to deter potential offenders, punish the man and take him out of public circulation for the appropriate amount of time. Justice Ang also placed some mitigatory weight on the offender's plea of guilty and cooperation with authorities, but said that his advanced age did not warrant a shorter sentence."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/paedophile-child-sexual-abuse-aggravated-rape-45-years-jail-2773126,'Extensive and sickening': Man jailed 45 years for sex offences against 8 children,"SINGAPORE: A man was on Monday (Jun 27) sentenced to 45 years' jail for committing sex offences against eight children, some of whom had learning difficulties. The 54-year-old man cannot be named to protect the identities of the victims. His offences came to light in 2018 when a woman who bought his laptop found photos and videos of the man sexually assaulting various children. The man pleaded guilty to six charges of aggravated rape against three victims, then aged five to nine. They were among eight victims he preyed on between 2002 and 2018. Eighty other charges involving sex offences against children and making and possessing obscene films were considered for sentencing. The offender had a history of watching pornography, including child sexual abuse material, on the Internet. ""(He) admitted that he found child sexual abuse material interesting and that he wanted to 'try' the same on real-life subjects,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutor Andre Ong. ""This is one of the worst cases of paedophilic sexual abuse that has come before the courts,"" said the prosecutor, describing the man's crimes as ""extensive and sickening"". The man was involved in a dance group. This was where he met the mothers of four of his victims. At the time of his arrest in June 2018, he was working as an ad-hoc tutor for children, including those with special needs. He told the parents of some of his victims that he was a qualified educational therapist with a diploma in learning disorders management and child psychology. He also gave tuition to ""gain access to a ready pool of children, including children with learning or physical disabilities"", said Mr Ong. Investigations revealed that the man was never a qualified educational therapist and was never employed in the education or childcare sectors. The earliest victim, identified as V5 in court documents, was five to seven during the offences from 2002 to 2004. There were a total of 21 charges in relation to her. The offender knew V5's mother and shared a close relationship with the family. He frequently brought the girl to watch movies or play arcade games at a mall. After many of these occasions, he would take the girl to a toilet in the mall and sexually abuse her there. He also committed aggravated rape against her in a dance studio. He placated V5 by buying her many gifts, including a computer, and told her not to tell anyone about the assaults. V5 complied as she was worried that her parents would have to pay him for the gifts if she did not. V5 cut ties with the offender around 2006 or 2007, at her mother's instructions. Another victim, identified as V4 in court documents, was five to six years old at the time of the offences and had a history of learning difficulties. There were six charges in relation to her. The offender and V4's mother were acquainted through the dance group.  After learning that the girl had hearing disabilities, the man offered to tutor her for free twice a week at her home at night. During V4's tuition sessions at her home, the man would close the door and ask V4's mother to sit outside in the living room so as not to affect her daughter's learning. In 2007, the offender moved in with the family and started a relationship with V4's mother. On four occasions that same year, he committed aggravated rape against the girl at her family flat. In October 2010, the offender also took photos of V4's brother, then 13, when he was naked. The offender and V4's mother eventually ended their relationship in 2015. Another victim, identified as V1 in court documents, was six to nine years old when the man committed the offences against her. There were 38 charges involving her. V1's mother got to know the offender through a friend in 2015. V1's mother was concerned about her daughter at the time as she was experiencing learning difficulties and had required speech therapy. The offender introduced himself as an educational therapist. V1's mother engaged him to tutor her daughter in weekly sessions from 2015 to 2018, held at his flat. The man cultivated a close relationship with V1's family. He was often invited to have meals with them and gained their trust. But under the guise of tuition and speech therapy lessons, he carried out ""a campaign of rapidly escalating intrusions"" upon the young girl, said the prosecutor. On three occasions in September and October 2017, following multiple incidents in which he molested V1 and took obscene photos of her, he committed aggravated rape against the girl. During these assaults, the man often manipulated the girl into complying by distracting her with games or videos on his mobile devices.  The police arrested the man on Jun 11, 2018, after the complainant who had bought his laptop made a police report. The man was found in possession of more than 3,200 obscene films as well as two pairs of children's underwear. An Institute of Mental Health psychiatrist diagnosed the offender with paedophilic disorder and found him to be at ""very high risk"" of reoffending, according to court documents. The psychiatrist noted that the man was evasive and inconsistent about committing the offences, and claimed selective memory loss over the number of times he had assaulted victims. The psychiatrist also found that the man had fabricated psychotic symptoms, such as claiming to hear voices, in order to minimise his criminal responsibility. The prosecution sought at least 45 years' jail for the man, who cannot be caned as he is above 50. Mr Ong argued that the offender's acts against his victims were ""the ultimate betrayal of trust and authority"" as he assumed paternal roles in relation to several of them. He also argued that the offender carried out ""premeditated conditioning"" of his victims using gifts and repeated requests for their silence and complicity. ""The fact that the law had not caught up with him earlier is indicative both of the victims' trust and confidence in him and his own sway over them,"" said the prosecutor."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ahmad-danial-felicia-teo-missing-teen-girl-murder-discharge-not-acquittal-2772466,Felicia Teo case: Man originally charged with murder given discharge not amounting to acquittal,"SINGAPORE: A man who was originally charged with the murder of a 19-year-old woman in 2007 was given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal on Monday (Jun 27). Ahmad Danial Mohamed Rafa'ee, 37, had his capital charge substituted with six new charges for lesser offences. He was also offered bail of S$20,000. He appeared in court via video-link, and members of his family were present in court. He will return to court to plead guilty to the new charges next Wednesday. Those granted a discharge not amounting to an acquittal can still be prosecuted for the alleged offence in the future should there be developments in the case, such as the emergence of new evidence.  Ahmad Danial was originally charged in December 2020 with the murder of Ms Felicia Teo Wei Ling, 13 years after she was reported missing by her mother. He had been accused of murdering her between 1.39am and 7.20am on Jun 30, 2007 at a flat in Block 19, Marine Terrace with suspected accomplice Ragil Putra Setia Sukmarahjana, who is at large. Ms Teo, who would have turned 34 this year, was reported missing on Jul 3, 2007. Ahmad Danial is now accused of leaving Ms Teo's body around Punggol Track 24 on or around Jun 30, 2007. He is also accused of intentionally omitting information about Ms Teo's sudden or unnatural death to the police, when he was legally bound to do so. Instead, Ahmad Danial allegedly misappropriated Ms Teo's Nokia or Blackberry mobile phone, MacBook Pro and Olympus camera and lenses at a flat in Marine Terrace. He is then suspected of fabricating false evidence by placing Ms Teo's phone near East Coast Park between 7.20am and 8.22am on Jun 30, 2007, purportedly to support false information given to the police that she had gone there. He is also suspected of fabricating false evidence by making calls to Ms Teo's phone, leaving her voicemails and messaging her on social media to create the false impression that he believed she was still alive. On Jul 11 and Jul 25, 2007, he then allegedly gave false information to two police officers to the effect that Ms Teo had left the Marine Terrace flat on her own on Jun 30, 2007 and that he did not know what happened to her. Mr Ragil, who was then 18, is named as Ahmad Danial's suspected accomplice in all six charges. Deputy Public Prosecutors Yang Ziliang and R Arvindren told the court that the main reason the prosecution was applying for a discharge not amounting to an acquittal was because Mr Ragil was still at large. They argued that there was no prejudice to Ahmad Danial and no excessive delay in the case as authorities had made and continued to make reasonable efforts to trace Mr Ragil. ""The Indonesian authorities have been informed and they are in the process of tracing (Mr Ragil),"" said the prosecutors. ""This is not a case where police have been trying for many years to trace (Mr Ragil),"" they said, adding that authorities only started tracing him after Ahmad Danial's arrest in 2020 and ""new facts came to light during the investigations"". They added that there was no evidence that Mr Ragil was dead, and that the murder charge was a serious one that carries the death penalty. Both prosecutors argued that a discharge not amounting to an acquittal would balance ""the public interest and the rights of the individual"". Defence counsel Shashi Nathan urged the court to grant his client a discharge amounting to an acquittal instead, citing a lack of evidence for murder. He gave the example of a skull fragment found by investigators that was still in the midst of being identified, and said that his requests for information on tests performed on the bone fragment had gone unanswered. He also argued that his client had served a long time in remand, asking: ""Who's going to pay him back for the one-and-a-half years that he sat in prison waiting for the gallows?"" Mr Nathan said that Ahmad Danial's family had gone through a ""terrible time"" during this period, with his wife having to move out of the home because of people bothering the family. Police investigators had treated Ahmad Danial's wife with ""disdain and impunity"", said the lawyer, adding that he had made a formal complaint and received an apology for this. Additionally, he argued that the prosecution's application for a discharge not amounting to an acquittal meant that the murder charge would hang over his client's head for ""an indeterminate time"". ""They're not just asking for a pound of flesh. What they're asking for is, after we've taken your pound of flesh, lay your head on the board and wait for the guillotine to fall on your head,"" he said. Taking issue with Mr Nathan's contention that this was originally a missing person case and not a murder case, Mr Yang argued that Ahmad Danial's alleged offences in 2007 created the impression that Ms Teo was alive. He said that when police uncovered evidence that this was not correct, investigations were launched and Ahmad Danial was arrested. He added that the fragment of skull mentioned by Mr Nathan was found in the area where Ahmad Danial said he had placed the corpse. Addressing Mr Nathan's analogy of the guillotine, District Judge Eugene Teo said: ""Sometimes such emotive language can portray the matter inaccurately."" ""I say inaccurately because (Ahmad Danial) continues to have counsel on record, and in the event that the guillotine is to be activated, due process must always prevail."" Judge Teo noted that the defence had raised two objections to a discharge not amounting to an acquittal. On Ahmad Danial's one-and-a-half-years in remand, the judge said that based on the chronology of the case, the period of remand was not for a ""futile reason"". On the prospect of an ""indefinite period"" of waiting after a discharge not amounting to acquittal, the judge said: ""I have to agree that there is no basis to grant an outright discharge amounting to an acquittal."" He added that arguments could be made about the need for finality and there could be a review of the case law on this, but said that this was not the appropriate time for that. Those convicted of depositing a corpse can be jailed up to six months, fined up to S$2,000 or both. Anyone who fabricates false evidence can be jailed up to seven years or fined. The punishment for misappropriating the property of a dead person is up to three years' jail and a fine. The penalty for omitting to give information to public servants as required by the law is up to one month's jail and a fine of up to S$500. Anyone who gives false information to a public servant can be jailed up to six months, fined up to S$1,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/police-officer-stalk-teenager-harass-text-messages-2768516,Police officer jailed for sending harassing messages to teenager he was investigating,"SINGAPORE: A police officer who was investigating a teenager for attempted suicide asked for her phone number and went on to send her harassing text messages over the next 18 days. He questioned the 19-year-old on who she was meeting, when she ate, showered and slept, and also asked her to meet him. When she ignored him, he pestered her to reply promptly. Leow Jin Jie, 33, was on Friday (Jun 24) jailed for 20 days after pleading guilty to one charge of stalking. He had worked in the Singapore Police Force (SPF) since 2009 and was an investigation officer when he was assigned to the victim's case in 2017. He said that he committed the offences because ""he had been having marital problems and wanted to test if he still had value with women"", according to court documents. The victim had a history of mental health issues and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder with borderline personality traits. Her identity is protected by a gag order. The court heard that Leow first met the victim when he went to her house to record her statement on Sep 27, 2017. He asked her parents to leave so he could take her statement alone, and asked her to sit next to him. After taking her statement, he asked to exchange phone numbers. The next morning, he started messaging the victim through WhatsApp. He initially asked about her well-being and encouraged her to eat properly and take tonics. But within 45 minutes, his messages started skewing towards asking when she would be meeting a male friend and what time she had slept. He also offered to drop by her place with things she needed. Leow ""knew he was only supposed to speak to her about investigation-related matters, and that his interactions with her after he recorded her statement were inappropriate"", said Deputy Public Prosecutor Yvonne Poon. The victim started to feel harassed when Leow sent her a message that morning saying: ""Don't be naughty. You haven't eat please go and eat. Don't make me angry."" ""She felt harassed as he was always checking on her, intimidated as he said he would get angry, and also felt like he was trying to control her by saying 'good girl',"" said Ms Poon. The victim also felt insulted when he commented on her body and was distressed as he would keep trying to meet her, added the prosecutor. Leow's messages to the victim continued daily until Oct 4, 2017. The messages ranged from asking her to inform him when she had reached home, to telling her she was pretty and inviting her over. On one occasion, he told her ""please please please do not have any sex"". He also said he was messaging the victim ""cause I think you look gorgeous the first time I met you"". During this time, Leow also repeatedly asked the victim to move their conversation to Snapchat as the messages would be automatically deleted. The victim felt harassed and was reluctant to further engage him, often leaving hours between her replies. In contrast, Leow responded within minutes, if not seconds. The victim would joke about the police having ""so much free time"", but did not dare to cut Leow off completely as he was much older than her, said the prosecutor. ""Not only was he a police officer, he was also the investigation officer for her case; she was afraid of what consequences she might face if she were to anger him,"" said Ms Poon. As the investigation officer for the victim's case, Leow also had access to the victim's psychiatric records and was aware of her depression and multiple episodes of self-harm. In mid-October 2017, the victim was taken to a hospital for a check-up. Annoyed by Leow's messages, she told him that she had not replied as she was hospitalised. The victim declined to give Leow her ward number and said she did not want visitors. Leow then told her he could check her ward number if he wanted to, but was refraining out of respect for her. Later, Leow was at the hospital to conduct investigations for a separate matter. He sent the victim a photo of the car park and again asked her which ward she was in. When the victim told Leow that her parents were around and he could not go up to see her, he told her he would wait for her downstairs. She did not reply. Leow later saw the victim at the smoking point, but did not approach her as she was with her mother. He took a photo of her surroundings and sent it to her, telling her that he had seen her and that she ""looked cute"", stated court documents. The victim felt scared and harassed, and eventually told her mother about Leow's actions after they had left the smoking corner. Unable to tolerate his harassment any longer, the victim deleted his messages and blocked his phone number. The offences were only discovered about two years later, in November 2019, when the victim was involved in another suicide attempt. The victim's mother requested that a female investigation officer be assigned to the case as the previous officer had sent her daughter inappropriate messages. The victim's mother was then advised to make a police report against Leow, and did so on Nov 19, 2019. The prosecution asked for 20 to 30 days' jail, highlighting Leow's abuse of his position, which granted him ""unfettered access"" to the ""extremely vulnerable"" victim. ""At all times this accused was a police officer who was supposed to be carrying out his duties without fear or favour,"" said Ms Poon. Instead, Leow ""policed multiple aspects of her life, from her social activities to the people she hung out with"". As her investigation officer, he was able to retrieve ""very intimate information"" about her psychological and physical condition, said Ms Poon. ""Despite knowing, in excruciating detail, that the victim was highly susceptible in multiple aspects ... (Leow) saw fit to use the victim as a sort of personal experiment for him to see if he 'still had value with women'. ""He patently thought nothing of toying with her mental and physical safety."" Defence lawyer Marcus Lim asked for no more than seven days' jail, arguing that Leow's offending took place over a ""short"" period, was limited to text messages and did not require the victim to adjust her lifestyle to avoid him. ""There is nothing to suggest that the victim had suffered any harm or trauma as a result of my client's conduct,"" said Mr Lim, citing examples like no loss of appetite. He added that Leow had received ""numerous awards for stellar performance"" during his career in SPF, and that his offending behaviour was out of character. The prosecution responded that the points raised by the defence were the absence of aggravating factors, rather than mitigating factors. While Leow was not physically present when he harassed the victim, the degree of intrusiveness from his messages was still significant, said Ms Poon. ""Law enforcement officers must be held to an unimpeachable standard,"" she added. In sentencing, District Judge Dora Tay said: ""I wish to assure the accused that I think it is important and I have considered the full context of the messages. But I also have to bear in mind the relationship of these two people that are speaking to each other and the explanations of the victim ... for why she said what she said."" The judge said it was aggravating that Leow targeted a vulnerable victim in terms of her age, relative position to him and the mental stressors she faced, and that he took advantage of his position to gain information about and access to her. In response to CNA's queries, SPF said that after the possible offences against Leow surfaced, they initiated investigations against him and removed him from frontline duties. He has been suspended from service since Nov 5, 2020 and SPF has commenced internal action against him following his conviction, they added.  The police said their officers are ""expected to uphold the law and maintain the highest standards of conduct and integrity"", adding that they deal severely with officers who ""break the law, including charging them in court"". The SPF said that it has measures in place for members of the public and officers to report against such matters. ""Any form of harassment will not be tolerated and any allegation will be fully investigated."" The offence of stalking carries a maximum penalty of up to a year in jail, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/npcc-honorary-officer-adult-leader-molest-sex-offences-teenage-boys-2766121,NPCC honorary officer jailed for sex offences against 2 teenage boys,"SINGAPORE: An honorary officer in the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) was sentenced to 10 months in jail and one stroke of the cane on Thursday (Jun 23) for committing sex offences against two teenage boys. He pleaded guilty to one charge each of committing an obscene act with a child under 16 and outrage of modesty. Another six similar charges, including for offences against two more teenage victims, were considered for sentencing. The identities of the victims and the offender are protected by a gag order. The offender's age was also redacted from court documents. An honorary officer is an adult leader deployed to help teacher officers train NPCC cadets in school, according to the Singapore Police Force website. They receive training at the Home Team Academy. As an honorary officer, the offender's rank in the school's NPCC unit was second only to the teacher officers. The two victims reported to him. The court heard that in 2016, the first victim, identified as A2 in court documents, was a member of the NPCC unit. In June that year, the offender was driving A2 from his home to school for an NPCC activity in the morning. When they arrived too early and were unable to enter the school, the offender drove to a car park near the boy's house. He then moved to the rear passenger seat, sat next to A2 and touched the boy's private parts. A2 felt uncomfortable and did not consent to being touched, but was too afraid to resist as the offender was in a position of authority over him, court documents stated. The second victim, identified as A1, worked closely with the offender and would go to his home multiple times a week in 2017. They would discuss NPCC-related matters in the man's bedroom or watch movies together. Over time, the offender became more physically intimate with A1, progressing from holding his hand to kissing his cheek. The offender told A1 that he was being physical in order to ""break the barrier"" between them, court documents stated. A1 was uncomfortable with these advances but would kiss the offender's cheek as he felt pressured to do so. This progressed until the offender started touching A1's private parts in his bedroom, without the boy's consent. He did this on five occasions in 2017, up to July that year. On Jul 20, 2017, the principal of the school made a police report on the offender's behaviour. The prosecution sought a jail term of 10 months to a year, arguing that the offender had a pattern of abusing his authority as a superior officer to make physical advances on his subordinates. The penalty for outrage of modesty is up to two years' jail, a fine, caning or any combination of these punishments. The punishment for committing an obscene act with a child or young person is up to five years' jail, a fine of up to S$10,000 or both for a first-time offender. Repeat offenders can be jailed for up to seven years, fined up to S$20,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cheat-amazon-google-cloud-computing-mine-cryptocurrency-marc-merrill-2765636,"Singaporean jailed for deceiving Amazon, Google into providing S$7.6 million worth of cloud services","SINGAPORE: A man was sentenced to 10 years' jail on Thursday (Jun 23) for impersonating two others to deceive Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google into providing about US$5.4 million (S$7.6 million) worth of cloud computing services. Ho Jun Jia, 32, also known as Matthew Ho, used personal and credit card information of two men that he got from a Dark Web forum to cheat both companies. One of his victims was Marc Merrill, the co-founder of video game developer Riot Games. Ho, who was unemployed at the time, used this computing power to mine about 1,468 units of the cryptocurrency Ether between Nov 21, 2017, and Mar 1, 2018. He later sold about 203 units of the illegally acquired Ether, making more than S$347,000, which he spent on personal expenses. In March, he pleaded guilty to 12 charges, including offences under the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act and cheating by personation. His total sentence includes three years and five months in prison for consuming methamphetamine and another drug-related charge. Another 14 charges were considered for sentencing. The court previously heard arguments from the prosecution and defence on the sentence to be imposed on Ho. Deputy Public Prosecutor Ryan Lim had asked for at least 10 years' jail for what he called a highly sophisticated scheme carried out entirely through the Internet, enabling Ho to hide his identity during the offences. ""It is crucial that would-be criminals are strongly deterred from using the Internet as a cheap, convenient and effective means to commit crime,"" he said last month. Mr Lim also highlighted the transnational nature of Ho's offences, arguing that they threatened to undermine Singapore's reputation as a financial and commercial hub. Defence lawyer S S Dhillon had said that while the amount involved in the offences was high, there were no ""actual physical monies"" lost. He argued that AWS and Google suffered a loss of revenue in the form of fees for the cloud computing services, but that the two men Ho impersonated did not lose any money. He also highlighted Ho's diagnosis of adjustment disorder from around the end of 2017 to August 2018, and his mental health history that saw him spend time as a patient at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) in the past. In her judgment on Thursday, District Judge Brenda Tan highlighted the magnitude and sophistication of Ho's offences and the extent of harm his actions caused. ""Through his deceptions, Mr Ho fraudulently obtained services worth a massive value of more than US$5.4 million, of which there has been no restitution or compensation,"" she said. She granted a one-month deferment of the sentence for Ho to attend medical appointments at IMH and for a check-up, and to see to his work commitments. Ho is currently out on bail of S$180,000. In 2017, Ho forged US driving licences on a Dark Web forum that styled itself as ""#1 Fraud Community"". In exchange, he was given access to a ""VIP"" section of the forum that contained people's names, addresses and credit card details. Around Oct 19, 2017, he obtained the information of 70 people including Marc Merrill, the co-founder of video game developer Riot Games, and another man named Harold Borland. Ho gained access to Mr Merrill's AMEX bank account and linked it to an email address he created. He then registered a new AWS user account using Mr Merrill's AMEX credit card number and the email address he created. While in Singapore, Ho deceived AWS into believing that he was Mr Merrill and delivering cloud computing services on at least 40 occasions between Nov 4, 2017, and Jan 28, 2018. Ho also did this with a Google Cloud Platform account registered in Mr Merrill's name around Nov 3, 2017, and deceived Google into providing cloud computing services up to Feb 23, 2018. The AWS and Google accounts were eventually suspended by the companies after failed attempts to process payment. Both companies refunded any payments that did go through to AMEX. Ho went on to run the same scheme with AWS using Mr Borland's details. Between Nov 19, 2017, and Apr 18, 2018, he deceived AWS into providing US$21 worth of cloud computing services. He also used Mr Merrill's details to register an account with Namecheap, which provided domain-hosting and other services, ringing up a bill of about US$900 between October 2017 and August 2018. On Sep 24, 2019, officers from the Technology Crime Investigation Branch raided Ho's home and arrested him. In October 2019, Ho was also charged with identity theft and wire fraud in the US."

Sun Sicong, 21, a student at Temasek Polytechnic, also made insensitive comments about a rape victim. He pleaded guilty last month to one charge of making the posts with the deliberate intention of wounding the religious feelings of Muslims. Another two charges, for his comments about rape and possessing obscene films, were considered for sentencing. The court heard that Sun, a Chinese national who is a permanent resident of Singapore, made the religiously offensive Instagram Stories posts between 2018 and 2019. In the posts, he described acts of violence against Muslims, threatened to burn religious texts and insulted Islamic teachings. He also said he would have ""no problem committing genocide"" if he were ""in a position of power"". At the time, no police reports were made in relation to the Instagram Stories posts, which are temporary posts that get automatically deleted after 24 hours. But they resurfaced online around Jun 7, 2020, after Sun took a screenshot of a rape victim's account of her ordeal and posted it with his insensitive comments. Other Instagram users were upset with these comments and responded to Sun. They referred to screenshots of the religiously offensive posts in the process. The religiously offensive posts then went viral, with the police receiving 62 reports from members of the public about them. Under his probation conditions, Sun must remain indoors from 10pm to 6am and perform 60 hours of community service. His parents also paid a bond of S$5,000 to ensure his good behaviour during the period. In response to CNA's queries, a spokesperson for Temasek Polytechnic said that Sun was suspended for two semesters following investigations by the school in June 2020. ""Temasek Polytechnic does not condone any action or behaviour that incites hatred and violence. The polytechnic will not be taking further disciplinary action,"" said the spokesperson. Probation is a community-based sentence under which offenders can continue most daily activities such as school and work. Community-based sentences were introduced in 2010 to give the courts greater flexibility for minor offences. Offenders retain no criminal records for the offence if the sentence is successfully completed. The penalty for making remarks with the deliberate intention to wound religious or racial feelings is jail for up to three years, a fine or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/iris-koh-healing-divide-cancer-treatment-permission-2765316,Healing the Divide's Iris Koh given permission to leave Singapore for cancer treatment,"SINGAPORE: The founder of Healing the Divide, a group with a known stance against vaccination, was on Thursday (Jun 23) given permission by a court to leave Singapore for cancer treatment in Malaysia. Iris Koh Shu Cii, 46, has been allowed to travel to Melaka from Jun 24 to Jul 17 to undergo a consultation at Makhota Medical Centre for alternative treatment for thyroid cancer. The court imposed additional leave jurisdiction conditions on Koh. She must put up an additional S$30,000 in bail, on top of her current S$20,000 bail. Upon her return, she must also provide supporting documents on the cancer treatment she received to the investigation officer handling her case. Other usual leave jurisdiction conditions also apply, requiring Koh to provide her complete travel itinerary and details of her overseas address and contact number before departure. She must also remain contactable by the investigation officer. Koh faces two charges. One is for conspiring with a doctor, Jipson Quah, to defraud the Ministry of Health (MOH) into believing people were vaccinated with the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine between July 2021 and January this year. The other is for obstructing a police inspector by refusing to sign and tearing up a copy of her statement while in lock-up in January. Koh had applied for permission to leave jurisdiction last week, and the matter was adjourned to Thursday for her to provide more information requested by the prosecution. Koh's lawyer, Wee Pan Lee, previously told the court she had intended to travel from Jun 19 to Jul 22 to undergo a consultation at Makhota Medical Centre in Melaka and receive treatment at Aenon Health Care in Negeri Sembilan. On Thursday, he updated the court that she would be travelling only to Melaka, and would return on the eve of her next court mention on Jul 18. ""The purpose of this travel is to seek a consultation for a second opinion with a view to alternative cancer treatment,"" said Mr Wee. He said that since Koh's diagnosis, doctors in Singapore had advised her on only one course of treatment, which was the removal of her thyroid gland. ""My client is apprehensive about this treatment because she is trained in music, she is trained in singing and she is a trained vocal coach. Before her arrest, she earned her living as a choir conductor, as a singer in a choir and teaching singing and giving vocal coaching lessons,"" argued the lawyer. ""The fear is that this surgery, which is going to be performed very near the vocal chords, might affect her voice.""  He said that since Koh was told about alternative cancer treatments that did not require removal of her thyroid gland, she wished to try this ""Plan B"". ""This is not the forum to adjudge or assess whether Plan B is medically correct or wrong,"" he added. Deputy Public Prosecutor Jiang Ke-yue said the prosecution was not objecting to Koh's application, but sought additional conditions for her to leave jurisdiction. He said that the documents initially furnished for Koh's application last week were ""inadequate"" and ""incomplete"" and contained discrepancies. He said the defence had since provided new information from the Singapore General Hospital ""confirming her cancer diagnosis and the need for thyroid removal surgery urgently or as soon as possible"". Mr Jiang also noted that Koh's application had ""narrowed"" from her initial application to travel to two destinations - with supporting documents naming a third institute in Kuala Lumpur - to one destination in Melaka, and for a shorter duration. But he argued that there were still gaps in information, such as no explanation of the link between the three institutes named in supporting documents, and the prosecution was therefore proposing the additional leave jurisdiction conditions. The prosecutor had initially sought additional bail of S$40,000, but Mr Wee, Koh's lawyer, argued that this was ""punishing"" and proposed an additional S$20,000 that could be furnished by another bailor besides Koh's current bailor, her husband, Raymond Ng. District Judge Ng Peng Hong granted Koh's application and the prosecution's request for the additional leave jurisdiction conditions, ordering that the additional bail of S$30,000 can be put up by another bailor. If convicted of voluntarily obstructing a public servant in the discharge of their public functions, Koh could be jailed for up to three months, fined up to S$2,500 or both. If convicted of criminal conspiracy to make false representations, she could be jailed for up to 20 years, fined or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-abuse-girlfriend-threaten-kill-knife-choke-2763421,"Man jailed for assaulting girlfriend multiple times, threatening to kill her with knives","SINGAPORE: A man assaulted and threatened to kill his girlfriend on multiple occasions over three months, holding knives and scissors to her body, hitting her with a kitchen towel holder and choking her. After accusing his girlfriend of meeting other men, Paartiban Maniam, 30, also smashed her phone, swallowed her SIM card and tore her passport. He was jailed for seven months and three weeks on Wednesday (Jun 22), a day after pleading guilty to six counts of criminal intimidation, voluntarily causing hurt and mischief. Another six charges were considered for sentencing. Some of the assaults were committed while he was out on bail. Maniam, a factory operator, had been in a relationship with his girlfriend, now 38, for two to three years at the time of the offences earlier this year. They lived together with the victim's uncle until late January. The victim ended the relationship in late February to early March this year. The court earlier heard that on Jan 23, Maniam and his girlfriend got into a fight when he was out having drinks with friends and he accused her of being with another man. At the void deck of their block, he slapped and punched the victim. At home, he took a knife and hovered it over his girlfriend's thigh, then placed it very close to her neck, threatening to kill her. He also hit his girlfriend on the head with a wooden kitchen towel holder. She got upset and used it to hit him back. The victim's uncle tried to break up the fight and eventually called the police. Maniam was arrested in the early hours of Jan 24. The victim was taken to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a minor head injury and given three days' medical leave. On Feb 28, the victim was having dinner and talking on the phone when Maniam appeared outside her home. She refused to let him in. Maniam got upset and managed to forcefully pull her metal gate until it dislodged from the wall. He then entered the unit, took the victim's phone and punched her face. An argument ensued, during which Maniam took a fruit knife, pointed it towards the victim's chest and said in Tamil: ""Today, I will definitely kill you."" He eventually dropped the knife, but then picked up a pair of scissors and pointed it at her stomach while repeating the threat to kill her. The victim managed to calm him until he dropped the scissors, after which he punched her shoulder. He continued shouting at and punching her while telling her to pack her belongings and leave with him. He also took her passport and tore it up, then told the victim to follow him. She was scared and followed his instructions. When they went down to the ground floor, the victim made an excuse that she had forgotten something, and got a passerby to call the police for her. Maniam was arrested again that night. During the last assault on Mar 11, Maniam asked to meet the victim to return his belongings. When they were at the ground floor of her residence, he pulled her to a car park. He said that he wanted to kill the victim that day and tried to flag a taxi to Little India, but the victim refused to board the vehicle. He then pulled her to some stone benches. Maniam took out a metal bottle cap, bit it to make it sharp and held it to the victim's neck. He checked her phone and accused her of calling other men the previous day. He then swallowed her SIM card and smashed her phone against the bench several times. He also took out a bottle of soju and tried to swing it towards the victim's head, but it did not hit her. Maniam drank the soju, smashed the empty bottle and placed it near the victim's neck. ""He told her that he would kill her today, and after he killed her, he would kill himself,"" court documents stated. Later, he put his right arm around her neck and used his hand to choke her until she felt pain. Maniam only left when he saw a police car come by on patrol. The victim then approached the police for help. Deputy Public Prosecutor Seah Ee Wei asked for seven to 10 months' jail, highlighting that Maniam was intoxicated during some of the offences. ""He had assaulted the victim and damaged her property, showing a disregard for her bodily integrity and her property,"" said the prosecutor. Those guilty of criminal intimidation can be jailed for up to two years, fined or both. The penalty for voluntarily causing hurt is jail for up to three years, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both. Those who commit mischief can be jailed for up to two years, fined or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/fat-melting-injection-no-medical-licence-illegal-2762676,Woman fined for giving 'fat-melting' injections without medical licence,"SINGAPORE: A part-time administrator decided to give ""fat-melting"" injections to earn more income, advertising her services online even though she was not a registered medical practitioner. Cheryl Ng Mui Hong, 43, obtained the injection serum without ascertaining if it was registered or could be used in Singapore, and bought injection needles online without determining if they were properly sterilised. She was fined S$10,000 on Wednesday (Jun 22) after pleading guilty to five counts of committing rash acts that endangered the personal safety of five women whom she injected. Another six similar charges were considered for sentencing. The court heard that in March 2020, Ng started offering ""fat-melting"" injections and other aesthetic services under the Instagram handle ZQ.aesthetic. Ng claimed that while learning about massage in Malaysia in 2019, she attended a five-day course where she learnt about such injections. The certification she claimed to have is not recognised in Singapore. ""She did not have the requisite licence and experience to conduct acts related to medical procedure, including administering injections,"" stated court documents. Ng bought the serum and needles from a Malaysian supplier. She planned to receive customers at home or travel to their residences, but also rented a room at a salon in Toa Payoh Central. As she knew the services she planned to offer were illegal, she told the landlord that she was only giving facial massages and treatment. Court documents stated that Ng's ""fat-melting"" injections had a moderate likelihood of bruising and scarring, and ""if these risks materialised and were not properly dealt with at the time, this could lead to discomfort and haemorrhage"". The injection solution Ng used also carried a risk of allergic reaction. ""She intended to stop providing the fat-melting injections by August 2020 as she was afraid that something might go wrong,"" stated court documents. Ng had at least seven customers from March 2020 until investigations against her started on Jul 8, 2020. Five of the customers, aged 27 to 33, contacted Ng after seeing her advertisements for slimming procedures on Instagram. Ng would administer injections containing a red solution on the women, including on their abdomen, thighs, upper arms and jaw area. She would usually first apply a cream, believed to be a numbing cream, on these areas. One woman agreed to pay S$548 for injections on three areas of her abdomen, while another agreed to pay S$180 for the injection to be administered on her face. Ng was aware that her act of injection and the solution she used carried risk of injury to the customers, stated court documents. She was also aware that the procedure risked her customers' personal safety as she did not have valid medical experience and the safety of the products she used had not been verified. Investigations against Ng started after an anonymous complaint about the ""fat-melting"" services offered on her Instagram account. Deputy Public Prosecutor Marcus Foo sought a S$12,000 fine, highlighting that Ng was not medically trained, was motivated by financial gain and did not stop her business operations until she was caught, even though she knew her actions were wrong. The prosecution also considered that Ng, who was defended by lawyer Andrew Chua, made restitution to her customers and there was no evidence that they suffered injuries. The punishment for committing a rash act that endangers the personal safety of others is jail for up to six months, a fine of up to S$2,500 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/colin-chua-voyeur-jail-fine-insult-modesty-obscene-films-uk-university-2762426,Jail for student from UK university who filmed illicit videos of women,"SINGAPORE: A Singaporean man who was studying at a university in the United Kingdom was on Wednesday (Jun 22) jailed for a year and fined S$2,500 for taking illicit videos of women, some of which he filmed during gatherings hosted at his home. Colin Chua Yi Jin, 24, pleaded guilty in July last year to seven charges of insulting the modesty of women and an eighth charge of possessing obscene films. Eight more charges for insult of modesty were considered for sentencing. In a departure from usual cases involving sex offences, Chua was named after 11 of his victims stepped forward to push for the gag order on his identity to be lifted. Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon ordered that Chua be named in September last year. Gag orders are usually applied to protect the identities of victims of sex offences. When the accused person is linked to the victims, the gag order can also extend to their identity although the intent is purely to protect the victims. The names of Chua's victims as well as how they are related to him and the schools they attended remain under the modified gag order and cannot be published. Chua filmed upskirt videos and videos of victims in the shower from 2014 to 2015 when he was in junior college in Singapore, from 2016 to 2018 when he was a full-time national serviceman, and from October 2018 when he was studying at a UK university. He would host gatherings for friends at his home and invite victims there but leave a recording device in his toilet to film them. Some of the videos wound up on pornography sites and were viewed thousands of times. Chua estimated the total number of voyeuristic videos he filmed to be ""maybe three digit"". He said he committed the offences when he felt stressed due to school or work, and felt that filming the victims ""was an addiction"" to him. In one instance, he filmed a 14-minute video of a 18-year-old victim showering. Chua had invited her and other classmates to share a hotel room after prom night in December 2015. The nude video was posted online, and the principal of the girl's school informed her of the video in early 2016. It was still circulating as of August 2020 and had been viewed at least 177,000 times. In a victim impact statement, the victim said she had received messages from friends and strangers about the video. She said she felt embarrassed, betrayed and wary of male friends. As a result of the experience, she had turned down social activities out of fear that she would have to use a public toilet. She also struggled with self-esteem issues and felt ""very unworthy"". Another victim was 19 when Chua invited her and other schoolmates to a Christmas gathering at his residence in 2016. He filmed an almost minute-long video of her relieving herself in the toilet. Almost two years later, the victim received an Instagram message from an unknown person containing screenshots of the video and asking if it was her. The victim searched the Internet and found the video on a pornography website. It had been viewed at least 38,000 times on Aug 17, 2020. The woman said she felt ""betrayed and shocked at the fact that such a horrible thing was done by a friend"" and felt a ""compulsive need to check if there are any recording devices"" when visiting a toilet. Between early 2016 to June 2019, the police received several reports alleging that two obscene videos featuring the complainants or their friends had been circulating online. Following investigations, Chua's home was raided on Jul 3, 2019 and seven of his personal devices were seized. Forensic analysis uncovered 16 offending videos and 124 upskirt photos in the devices. Of the two videos circulating online and 16 videos found in the devices, 14 of them were filmed in Chua's home. Deputy Public Prosecutors Tan Zhi Hao and Ng Shao Yan sought at least 13 months' jail and a S$3,500 fine, saying that Chua was a serial offender who leveraged on his friendships to film voyeuristic videos. The prosecutors described Chua's offences as ""one of the most premeditated cases of voyeurism to come before the courts"", arguing that he schemed to lure the victims and create the conditions to commit the offences. They highlighted the long-term harm and trauma caused to multiple victims, who described emotions of shock, betrayal and paranoia. Some victims also described feeling guilt for introducing their friends to Chua and potentially exposing them to his misconduct. ""His offences have caused the victims prolonged psychological trauma, and they continue to grapple with the consequences of the accused’s conduct even to this day,"" they said. The prosecutors argued that Chua lacked remorse, was uncooperative during investigations and gave ""contrived and incredulous responses"" to the police, including claiming not to recognise his own toilet and his friends. ""After charges were preferred, he first sought to abscond from Singapore and later commenced a 'wholly self-serving' criminal motion against this court's decision to lift the gag order against his identity,"" they said, quoting the Chief Justice's decision. The prosecutors also said that there were potentially many more unidentified victims given Chua's admission of filming ""maybe three digit"" worth of videos. Defence lawyer Kalidass Murugaiyan asked for nine months' jail, arguing that his client was continuing regular visits to a psychologist for treatment and had also subscribed to an Internet content filter. ""He is deeply apologetic for the hurt that he has caused to his victims. He is sorry for what he has done, he has learnt his lesson,"" said the lawyer, adding that Chua ""knows that he has a problem and he wishes to deal with it"". Mr Murugaiyan added that Chua has ""a good future ahead of him"" and ""an interest to further his studies"", with the potential to contribute to society. He highlighted Chua's ""troubled childhood"", noting that his parents divorced when he was 10 years old and that there was a family history of mental health issues. Mr Murugaiyan argued that there was no evidence that Chua had uploaded the voyeuristic videos, but Mr Tan countered that Chua's filming of those videos was still a ""necessary step"" to the harm suffered by the victims as a result of them being online. The prosecutors also took issue with Chua's attempts at rehabilitation being a mitigating factor, arguing that he had sought treatment with psychologists only to address his mood and not the root causes of his offending. ""It is our hope as well that given his young age, the accused can become a better person and reform himself. But that is not going to happen if he doesn't realise the error of his ways, properly appreciate the consequences of his conduct and show that he is genuinely remorseful,"" said Mr Tan. District Judge Tan Jen Tse said the sentence struck a balance between Chua's relative youth and the severity of his offences, and said he would give more weight to Chua's apparent remorse and attempts at rehabilitation than the prosecution. The punishment for insulting the modesty of a woman is jail for up to one year, a fine or both. Possession of obscene films is punishable with a fine of at least $500 for each film up to an aggregate of S$20,000, jail for up to six months or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/china-tangshan-restaurant-assault-police-deputy-dismissed-slow-improper-handling-2760736,Chinese police deputy dismissed amid investigations into 'slow and improper' handling of assault on female diners,"BEIJING: The deputy police chief of Lubei district in northern China’s Tangshan city where a group of female diners were assaulted has been dismissed. This comes as public outrage over the case continues, more than a week after it took place in the early hours of Jun 10. The incident was caught on security camera footage that later went viral. In it, a man is seen walking into a barbecue restaurant before approaching a female diner and touching her back. She pushes back at him, and the man reacts by beginning to hit her.  The woman is then dragged outside the restaurant by the man’s male companions, where she continues to be beaten and kicked while on the floor. Her friends who try to help are also attacked by the group. Netizens have since accused the police of responding slowly, questioning if they only acted after the video went viral. A statement by the Hebei province public security department on Tuesday (Jun 21) said police officers involved have been investigated for their “slow and improper” handling of the case. Police had arrived at the scene at 3.09am - 28 minutes after receiving a call about the incident at 2.41am. The group had fled the scene at 2.47am. Local authorities said the four women suffered “minor” or “slight” injuries, even as two remain in hospital, adding that their conditions were improving. The official response came amid calls by netizens for an update on the women’s well-being as rumours of their condition spread. Some also expressed scepticism, fearing that their injuries may be more serious than reported. Nine suspects – seven men and two women – were arrested. Authorities revealed that some of them had been involved in illegal activities, including provoking trouble and operating a gambling house. The graphic video of the attack has also sparked debate on gender-based violence in China. Tangshan native Wang Luoqing, 57, told CNA she was at home when she saw the clip. “After watching the video, I was so angry that I didn’t sleep all night,” said the retired policewoman who lives in Beijing. “I was shaking. I just couldn’t believe it.” Mdm Wang, who has a 32-year-old daughter, said she was also angered by some of the comments that followed. “What times and society are we living in now? Why can’t girls go out at night to have supper and only men can?” said Mdm Wang. She pointed to how there's still a difference in how society views men and women – referencing how former Chinese leader Mao Zedong famously said women are responsible for holding up “half the sky”. “Women hold up half the sky when they work, but when they go out to play or do other things, there is a prejudice,"" Mdm Wang said. The Beijing Youth Daily received backlash when it described the man, in a post which has since been taken down, as trying to “strike up a conversation” with the woman. A China Daily editorial added that the case should “never be interpreted as any form of sexual antagonism”. Headlines of authorities’ efforts are focused on reining in gang activity. Authorities said that investigations into whether the suspects were involved in organised crime is ongoing. But this isn’t the first time that gender-based violence has been at the forefront of discussion in China. Founder of Beijing-based women’s rights advocacy group Equality, Feng Yuan, told CNA that while more people are conscious of gender issues – the heated debate proves there are still polarised views. “The biggest factor is simply that the principle of equality between men and women advocated by our country, the degree of protection advocated, and the principle of rights and interests have not been made concrete by including it in our education - from school education, family education to social education, including mainstream media education,” said Ms Feng. She added that these issues are present in other countries as well.  Many women took to social media to share their own experiences, calling for more to be done about women’s safety, even as Chinese officials and state media seem keen to steer the narrative away from discussions about gender. More than 900 Weibo accounts were suspended for various violations, including stirring “gender confrontation”. “I think there is absolutely no need to suppress these discussions,” said Ms Feng. “These discussions are consistent with the constitution of our country and the basic political ideas and ideology of (the Communist Party) … even if there are different opinions on some issues, it is actually very normal in a pluralistic society.” CNA approached several women who had posted on social media about the incident, but requests for an interview were turned down. Some said they hoped to get the authorities’ attention through their posts, but the issue was too sensitive to speak to the media about. In recent years, authorities have clamped down on women's rights activists. “The government is only comfortable of pushing the issue forward in its own way, without any involvement of civil society, without any involvement from independent women's rights activists,” said Yaqiu Wang, senior China researcher with Human Rights Watch. She pointed out that while China has laws and regulations to address domestic violence, gender discrimination at the workplace and sexual harassment, it is still not good enough. “The laws are not perfect and they need to be improved, but they are still laws and the government needs to enforce them,” said Ms Wang. She added that the rhetoric from the Chinese government and state media as the country encourages more women to have children to address its ageing population is not helping, as it inadvertently perpetuates traditional gender roles."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-insider/polygraph-examiner-lie-detector-cheating-criminals-suspects-law-enforcement-2745356,"This polygraph examiner can sniff out lies, with or without equipment. Here’s how he does it","SINGAPORE: A sign marks the entrance to a room in security firm SecuriState’s office. It says: “In God we trust. All others, we polygraph.” Many alleged molesters, drug offenders and love rats have entered this room with trepidation. It is where they are strapped to equipment and their breathing, sweating and blood pressure come under Malaravan Ponniah’s scrutiny. They are people who have opted to undergo a polygraph or lie detector test, with Malaravan — or Ron, a moniker from his military days — as their examiner. They may be clients taking a polygraph exam to vindicate themselves. One man, for instance, wanted to prove to his father-in-law that he did not hit his wife. (She made it up to get a divorce because she was having an affair). Or they may be people under investigation whose lawyers have sent them to Ron before they decide whether to submit to a polygraph conducted by the police. Whatever the case might be, most people get nervous when they step into his exam room. “I’ll ask them to close their eyes and relax for a while … and I’ll check whether their readings are stable,” said Ron, 60, the managing director of SecuriState and one of a handful of commercial polygraph examiners in Singapore. And then the test begins. While polygraph exams cannot be used as evidence in Singaporean courts, they are widely used by law enforcement agencies here and round the world. In cases lacking evidence, polygraphs can aid law enforcers in decision-making. “It facilitates investigation,” said Ron. He was trained as a forensic polygraph examiner during his 32-year military career when he was selected to attend a three-month course in the mid-1990s. It was taught by United States instructors and covered physiology, psychology, instrumentation and interview techniques, he said. Participants had to undergo a polygraph test where they were asked about any previous drug activity, criminal record and other areas of their past. This was to see if they were suitable for the course. And to pass, each student had to conduct three exams in real-life cases. Ron remains proud of the fact that in one of the exams, he secured a confession from a rape suspect. “It was after the test. When I looked at the charts, I realised he wasn’t telling the truth,” recounted Ron, who switched off the equipment and persuaded him to come clean about it. “For example, you’ll tell them, ‘I know you never planned to do it, but it just happened, and you lost control of yourself. That’s what happened, correct?’” After reflecting and coming to terms with their actions, the subjects sometimes unload the truth, said Ron, who believes that to err is human. That said, he has met his share of hard-core suspects who — whatever the test results — listen to interviewers without emotion and then reply, “Okay, any other questions? Can I go?” “You can’t break them,” he said. Contrary to what some may think, there are no spontaneous questions or surprises during a polygraph exam. Ron does a pre-test interview lasting 30 to 40 minutes with the client, to go through the facts of the case and formulate his test questions. There is no need for mind games, he said. “You just need the facts of the issue … ask them to narrate the story — what happened — (and) don’t let them (give you the) runaround. “And then I’d follow with the questions. If I need more clarity, then I dig more into that particular answer.” The pre-test interview also allows him to read a person and get a sense of whether he or she may be telling the truth. Ron honed his people-reading skills through “patience and practice”. In the early days, he watched soap operas on mute to pick up the “behavioural attributes of actors”. “From Korean to Indian to English (soap operas) — just about anything,” he cited. There is no fixed telltale sign that someone is lying, he said. It is a cluster of behavioural attributes, such as breaking eye contact, facial expressions, straying from the storyline and attempts to buy time. “If you’re meeting a person for the first time, and you just engage in a normal conversation for about 10 to 15 minutes, you won’t be able to differentiate whether the person’s telling the truth or not. It takes some time,” he said. He does not make any conclusions until after the polygraph exam. The charts showing a person’s breathing, skin conductivity (sweating) and blood pressure “won’t lie” because “everything’s attached to the examinee’s body”. “I’m just interpreting the reactions to the questions,” said Ron, who described himself as “an X-ray department guy”. “Data interpretation is what we examiners do.” Ron began offering commercial polygraph services in 2012, a year after he retired from the army. He estimates that there might be four people here from three companies offering commercial polygraph services. These days, about 60 per cent of his cases involve cheating spouses. The rest come from law firms and from employers doing pre-employment checks. Couples usually go to him when both partners have suspicions or when one partner wants to prove something to the other, he said. As for pre-employment exams, clients are usually hiring people for cybersecurity, finance or management-level positions, he cited. For instance, firms may want to check to see if a potential employee has ever mishandled funds or manipulated data. Studies put the accuracy of polygraph exams at 80 to 90 per cent of the time, and Ron acknowledges that “there’s a small chance of error”. But this is akin to the chances of a successful surgery, he reckoned. “There’s no perfect result for everything.” To do his job professionally, he does not track the outcomes of cases he has tested. He does not scan the news when a case he has tested makes it to court, for instance. “I know examiners who do that, especially the nosy ones. But I think to be professional, you shouldn’t have attachments to the cases. Once you finish your job — you’re professional, your report is accurate, your findings are good — cut loose (from it),” he said. “The rest is in the hands of the police or law firms or the individual family.” It was not always so easy, however, to switch off from work. Ron said he took “quite a bit of time” to become less judgemental about people over simple matters. It could be a friend backing out of a gathering by citing “something to sort out” at home. “But you don’t believe him,” said Ron. “It took some time to take at face value what a person says.” His younger son, P M Gauthaman, can offer a trove of stories about growing up with a father who could sniff out lies. The 27-year-old recalled making meticulous plans and being on his toes as a child to avoid getting caught — like when using his father’s computer to watch cartoons. “I (wasn’t) allowed to use the computer to play games or watch cartoons until he was back from work,” said Gauthaman. “He had good intentions, because I was really lazy, and it was his way of keeping me on track.” But Gauthaman duplicated the key for the room where the computer was kept. He was careful to leave no digital trace. He even placed a tripwire toy at the lift outside their flat so he could get a signal on the control kit when someone walked out of the lift. “That’s when I’d just bolt out (of the room), shut the computer down. Mind you, I was nine years old,” he recounted with a laugh. “He’s the kind of guy who’ll nod his head and smile. And then … I’ll think I’m scot-free, and all’s good. At the end, that’s when he (lets on that he) knew all along.” Gauthaman is now SecuriState’s head of systems and technology. He oversees a new division in the company that deploys remotely operated vehicles, or underwater drones, to inspect structures underwater. His father is someone who “listens more than he speaks”, said Gauthaman, who remembers asking him why he was so quiet with friends or potential clients. The reply? It was to observe people and “read the room”. “Definitely, I’ve learnt to talk less and listen more,” said Gauthaman, who described his father as strict but caring. He has also long since given up trying to lie to his father — as have some of Ron’s friends. “They’ve told me right to my face, ‘I don’t want to lie, I better tell you the truth,’” said Ron. “I say, ‘Yah, good.’” To hear about the polygraph test the writer took, as well as memorable cases in Ron’s career, tune in to Heavy Duty by CNA Insider."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/taxi-driver-push-refuse-pay-fare-public-transport-workers-2753416,Serial offender jailed for pushing taxi drivers after refusing to pay his fare,"SINGAPORE: After being driven to his destination, a man refused to pay his taxi fare on three different occasions and pushed the drivers when they confronted him for payment. Tan Wee Ming, 33, was jailed for five weeks on Friday (Jun 17) after pleading guilty to two counts of criminal force and one count of assault. He admitted to using force against three taxi drivers in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Two more charges were considered for sentencing. On Aug 26, 2018, Tan and a friend took a ride from the first victim, a 63-year-old taxi driver, at Sultan Plaza. They headed first to Toh Tuck Road to drop Tan's friend off. Tan alighted and chatted with his friend for a short while before boarding the taxi again. The driver then took Tan to his destination at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3. Upon arrival, the driver woke Tan up and asked him to pay the fare of S$42 based on the taxi meter. Tan refused to pay as ""he felt it was too expensive to be correct"", alighted from the taxi and walked away, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Benedict Teong. When the driver confronted him, Tan pushed him on his shoulder, causing him to stumble backwards and almost fall. The driver called the police after Tan walked away. He was given three days' medical leave after seeking medical attention for pain in his shoulder. Police located Tan at a nearby coffee shop on the same day and placed him under investigation. The second incident happened on Mar 23, 2019. Tan refused to pay his full fare of S$14.20 a taxi ride to Block 133 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3, as he claimed that he had told the driver to drop him off at Block 130 instead. The 57-year-old victim had heard Tan saying that he wanted to go to Block 133, and noted that Tan reeked of alcohol. Block 130 was 50m away from where the taxi was, and the driver refused to accept partial payment. When Tan alighted without making any payment, the victim got out of the taxi and positioned himself in front of Tan to stop him from leaving. Tan then pushed him. In the third incident on Jan 10, 2020, Tan told a 58-year-old taxi driver he had to get money from his flat as he did not have any on him. The driver asked Tan to leave his belongings behind since he should be coming back, but Tan refused to do so and left. The victim followed Tan and tried to use his mobile phone to take a photo of him. Tan suddenly stepped towards the victim with his hands outstretched to snatch the phone away. Seeing this, the victim stepped backwards and lost his balance. He fell on his knee, suffering a small cut and a tear in his jeans.  On all three occasions, Tan acted without grave and sudden provocation from the victims, said Mr Teong. The first victim was offered S$62 for his medical fees and the taxi fare, but he refused to accept this as he felt Tan should also pay for his loss of earnings and taxi rental during his medical leave. The second victim refused to accept restitution. The prosecution sought the jail term that was imposed, highlighting that the offences involved violence against a public transport worker, and that Tan was previously also jailed for a similar offence. ""The accused has shown himself to be a recalcitrant offender who was unrehabilitated and undeterred by his previous jail term,"" said Mr Teong. Defence lawyer Chua Hock Lu argued that Tan's present offences showed ""some measure of de-escalation"" from his previous offence, and asked for a shorter sentence of 15 days. But the prosecution disagreed, arguing that Tan could not be given credit for ""resorting to violence at the end of the day"". ""If there was any restraint on the accused's part, I do not see it,"" said District Judge Wong Li Tein. ""Public transport workers deal with a big variety of people on a daily basis and should not have to suffer passengers who take them for a free ride, then turn violent when payment is demanded."" The judge also ordered Tan to pay S$14.80 in compensation to the third victim. The penalty for assaulting or using criminal force on a person without grave and sudden provocation is up to three months' jail, a fine of up to S$1,500 or both."

In one of the cases, CNB officers raided a residential unit near Tampines Street 12. A 32-year-old Singaporean man was arrested for suspected drug offences in the early morning of Jun 8.  About 18g of cannabis was seized from the unit, along with various drug paraphernalia.  During a follow-up operation on Jun 9, CNB officers raided another residential unit near Simei Street 3.  A 38-year-old Singaporean man was arrested for suspected drug trafficking offences and about 43g of cannabis was seized from the unit, as well as various drug paraphernalia.  Investigations into the drug activities of all arrested suspects are ongoing. “The Singapore Government’s stand on illicit drugs, including cannabis, is clear - they are harmful, addictive and can destroy lives, families and communities. “Examples of other countries have clearly shown that a permissive attitude towards the use of drugs exacts a high cost on society,” said CNB, adding that there are strict laws against the trafficking, possession, consumption, as well as import or export of illicit drugs, including cannabis and cannabis products.  CNB also reminded the public that cannabis is a Class A controlled drug listed under the Misuse of Drugs Act in Singapore. "

Johor Chief Minister Onn Hafiz Ghazi said in a press statement on Friday: “Yesterday, there was a viral video (showing) our borders being infiltrated by those who are irresponsible.”  He said the police have erected a canopy and deployed 24-hour police surveillance at the incident site and installed barbed wires next to the fence along the Tebrau Strait.  The police were also tracking down the individuals who had entered Malaysia via the illegal route, he added.  “I’ve also discussed this matter with the Ministry of Home Affairs, as part of attempts to resolve the endless issues at the immigration checkpoints,” said Mr Onn Hafiz.  “I hope the ministry will be more serious in overcoming these issues which impact the country and Johor state,” he added.   The land border between Singapore and Malaysia fully reopened on Apr 1, after prolonged closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Traffic has since soared at the checkpoints. In April, Mr Onn Hafiz said a task force had been set up to find solutions for the congestion issue at the Causeway."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/malaysia-abolish-mandatory-death-penalty-2747921,CNA Explains: The Malaysian government wants to end the mandatory death penalty. Where does it go from here?,"KUALA LUMPUR: The Malaysian government announced last Friday (Jun 10) that it has agreed to abolish the mandatory death penalty.  Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department Wan Junadi Tuanku Jaafar explained that capital punishment would be replaced by other types of punishment at the court’s discretion. This decision was reached following the presentation of a report on the study of alternative sentences for the mandatory death penalty during the Cabinet meeting on Jun 8. Crimes currently punishable by death in Malaysia include murder, drug trafficking, terrorism, kidnapping and possession of firearms. Dr Wan Junaidi, who is also the de facto law minister, added that the government will study other proposed punishments for 11 offences that currently trigger a mandatory death sentence and also 22 other offences that carry a potential death sentence at the court's discretion. The Malaysian government first “seriously considered” abolishing the mandatory death penalty in 2012, said Dr Wan Junaidi in his press conference on Monday.  In 2017, the parliament amended the Dangerous Drugs Act to insert Section 39B(2A), which abolished the mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking. This was later implemented officially in 2018, the minister added.  When campaigning for the 14th general election in 2018, Pakatan Harapan (PH) pledged to end mandatory death by hanging in all relevant laws. After PH came into power, its de facto law minister, the late Mr Liew Vui Keong, was quoted in 2019 by Malaysian media as saying the government was considering several options. These included total abolition of the death penalty, abolishing the death penalty for drug-related offences only, or to allow judges more discretion over the imposition of capital punishment.  PH, which later lost its grip on federal power, also imposed a moratorium on executions. The moratorium continues to be in place today.  On Jun 10, the Cabinet under Barisan Nasional's Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced that it has agreed to abolish the mandatory death penalty.  Mr Andrew Khoo, who is the co-chair of the Malaysian Bar Council’s constitutional law committee, told CNA that the announcement was in line with the country’s recent show of commitment at the international level to refrain from using the death penalty.  “Malaysia has voted twice now, in 2019 and 2021, to support the United Nations resolution for the worldwide moratorium on the use of the death penalty. And then in its campaign for a seat on the Human Rights Council for 2022-2024, the government highlighted its work in seeking to abolish the death penalty,” said Mr Khoo. In his press conference on Monday, Dr Wan Junaidi highlighted that as of Dec 31, 2020, a total of 144 countries had abolished the mandatory death penalty and another 55 countries still maintained it.  “For those with mandatory death penalty, there really are only a few countries left. Malaysia is among the group which has not yet done it,” said Dr Wan Junaidi.  “Thank god, this government is brave enough to move forward with this, so that we are seen to be more professional, more humane and understand that there are factors that may have led to an accused committing certain crimes,” he added. In a statement last Friday, the prime minister clarified that the death penalty in Malaysia remains, but it will no longer be mandatory for some cases and judges will be given discretion when sentencing offenders. “We are of the view that everyone deserves a second chance. If there are two options (of sentences), and if the offender is found to be a hardcore drug trafficker to the extent of causing hundreds of thousands of people to die (due to drugs), he can be sentenced to death and allowed to be sent to the gallows,"" Mr Ismail Sabri said, according to Bernama. “However, if the judge, in his discretion, felt that the offender should be given a second chance and decided to sentence him to life imprisonment with whipping, he can substitute the mandatory death penalty with that life sentence."" Mr Khoo of the Malaysian Bar Council said the announcement meant that judges will now have a choice in meting out other punishments for the 11 offences, which previously carried mandatory death penalty, if the accused was found guilty.  “The judge will have a choice of either imposing the death penalty, should the death penalty still apply to that offence, or pick other options such as incarcerations, or possibly whipping. It gives the judge a choice when before he or she had no choice,” he said.   Before the mandatory death sentence can be abolished, law amendments must first be passed through voting at the parliament’s lower house, or Dewan Rakyat, and the upper house, or Dewan Negara.  In his Monday press conference, Dr Wan Junaidi said that the Attorney-General’s Chambers are prepared to have the relevant amendments ready to be tabled in the Dewan Rakyat in October and in the Dewan Negara by December.  “So by January, we should be able to abolish the mandatory death sentence,” the minister said. Besides the voting process at both the lower and upper houses, Dr Wan Junaidi said that the government will conduct a survey to gauge public opinion on abolishing the mandatory death sentence and the Cabinet will be told if there is strong opposition.  “We would like to hear the people’s response on the matter. If there are more in opposition than those who agree, we will bring it to Cabinet to decide,” he said.  When asked if there could be a political dimension to the Cabinet's decision, especially in light of the upcoming elections, political analyst Oh Ei Sun told CNA that it is unlikely to be an attempt to win votes. ""If you look at the opinion polls, there are more people in Malaysia supporting the death penalty than those who are opposing it. So if you are trying to get votes by abolishing the death penalty or limiting the use of capital punishment, it may not be popular,"" said Dr Oh, who is the principal adviser for the Pacific Research Center of Malaysia.  Mr Khoo of the Bar Council provided a similar view. ""I doubt that abolition of the mandatory death penalty will be a vote-winner.  It would probably be used against the government as being weak on crime and punishment,"" he said.  Anti-death penalty advocates have lauded the move to abolish the mandatory death penalty, with many expressing hope that this step will be an intermediate point in the journey where the ultimate destination is the total abolition of death penalty in Malaysia.  Lawyer and anti-death penalty activist Ngeow Chow Ying told CNA that it was a crucial first step, and that Malaysia should take the next step to abolish capital punishment in its entirety.  “We have this arbitrary sentencing scheme which has been in Malaysia for so long, and it doesn’t have any impact or serve any justice. This is a good step to finally move away from this,” opined Ms Ngeow, who is with the Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network.  Mr Khoo said that any expectations that the death penalty will be completely abolished soon has to be “tempered with realism” as many Malaysians appear to still want the death penalty to be meted out as punishment for some criminal offences.  “There are religious and cultural conservatives who feel that the mandatory death penalty needs to be retained,” he said, adding that these people want to pre-empt the possibility of an eventual abolition of the death penalty.  “We will have to progressively and gradually engage with those segments of society which still want to retain the death penalty in the journey towards total abolition,” he added.  Dr Wan Junaidi said that the 1,342 convicts in Malaysia who are currently on death row will continue to have their sentences upheld until further notice. The government would form a tribunal to review their sentences, he added. “Apart from discussing alternative forms of punishment, we decided that sentencing for the 1,342 individuals sentenced to death while discussions were done on the abolishment of the mandatory death penalty will remain,” he was quoted as saying by Malay Mail. “This will stay as is until amendments to the law or we abolish the mandatory death penalty altogether,” added the minister.  Ms Ngeow, the anti-death penalty activist, said these death row inmates should be given the benefit of resentencing, but she acknowledged that there could be constitutional challenges given that they have already been sentenced. “Another challenge is that once the mandatory death penalty is removed, it has to be replaced with alternative punishments such as imprisonment. So the number of years et cetera has to now be decided by the government in the Penal Code,” she added. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/iris-koh-apply-leave-singapore-malaysia-cancer-medical-treatment-bail-2752671,Healing the Divide's Iris Koh seeks court permission to leave Singapore for cancer treatment,"SINGAPORE: The founder of Healing the Divide, a group with a known stance against vaccination, has applied to leave Singapore to receive treatment for thyroid cancer. District Judge Ng Peng Hong on Friday (Jun 17) adjourned the matter for Iris Koh Shu Cii to provide more information on her intention to travel to Malaysia for medical treatment. She will return to court next week. Koh faces two charges. One is for conspiring with Dr Jipson Quah to defraud the Ministry of Health (MOH) into believing people were vaccinated with the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine between July 2021 and January this year. The other is for obstructing a police inspector by refusing to sign and tearing up a copy of her statement while in lock-up in January. The 46-year-old is out on bail for S$20,000. People on bail are required to stay in Singapore, and must apply for the court's permission to leave jurisdiction if they wish to go overseas. They must provide information such as the purpose, destination and duration of their trip. Defence lawyer Wee Pan Lee had informed the court that his client was seeking permission to leave Singapore on Jun 19 to visit Malacca and Negeri Sembilan, before returning on Jul 22. In Malacca, he said Koh would go to Makhota Medical Centre for a consultation with a doctor, who is expected to recommend that she receive therapy at Aenon Health Care in Negeri Sembilan. The therapy is expected to last from Jun 19 to Jun 29. He said his client was unable to provide details of her transport and accommodation arrangements as these would only be made after her application to leave jurisdiction was granted. According to Mr Wee, a doctor at the Singapore General Hospital had recommended the removal of Koh's thyroid gland as treatment for her cancer, and she was seeking ""alternative therapeutic treatment"" as opposed to ""invasive surgical removal"". He added that Koh's bailor, Mr Raymond Ng who is her husband, would not be travelling with her. Deputy Public Prosecutor Jiang Ke-yue argued that the documents supplied for Koh's application were ""lacking"". He said the prosecution had asked for information on the nature of the treatment Koh would receive, the need to travel to Malaysia including whether alternative treatments in Singapore had been explored, and the necessity of travelling for one month and to two locations. Mr Jiang said that documents provided by Koh's lawyer also suggested that a third location in Kuala Lumpur, named Spectrum of Life, would also be part of her travel plans. He said that there was no explanation of the link between these three institutions in Malacca, Negeri Sembilan and Kuala Lumpur. ""I want to emphasise we are not standing in the way of Ms Koh's desire to seek alternative treatment of her choosing. We just need some answers, some clarification,"" he said. Noting that Koh made her application on Jun 13, he also asked: ""Why was this not started earlier so that information could be provided for the authorities' proper assessment?"" In response, her defence lawyer argued that the prosecution had not produced any evidence to suggest his client was a flight risk. Mr Wee also said Koh was ""devastated"" after her diagnosis, spoke to various doctors and made her application ""as soon as possible"". Judge Ng said that based on the information before him, Koh's medical condition ""doesn't appear to be life-threatening at this point in time"". ""It appears that we need some explanation,"" he said, adjourning the hearing of the application for the defence to provide more details. The Healing the Divide group has described COVID-19 vaccination as ""medical coercion"", while MOH said the group adopts an ""anti-vaccination stance"" and ""has a history of sharing misleading information about COVID-19 and its vaccines"". If convicted of voluntarily obstructing a public servant in the discharge of their public functions, Koh could be jailed for up to three months, fined up to S$2,500 or both. If convicted of criminal conspiracy to make false representations, she could be jailed for up to 20 years, fined or both."

These disciplinary measures, including threats to take away her ""privileges"", were one of the reasons why he believed she made up the allegations against him, the man testified at his own trial on Thursday (Jun 16). The man faces five charges of using criminal force to outrage his daughter's modesty. Deputy Public Prosecutor Sarah Siaw is proceeding on one charge for the trial. The identities of both the accused and victim are protected by gag order. In the proceeded charge, the man is accused of pulling up his daughter's shirt and outraging her modesty while she wore a virtual reality (VR) headset on the bed in his room between July and November 2018. The girl was 12 then.  The man took the stand for about five hours on Thursday and faced questions by defence lawyer Ashwin Ganapathy about his relationship with the victim. The man said the girl was ""the apple of my eye"". But their relationship went downhill in 2017 and became worse in 2019, according to him. ""There were much more frequent scoldings because of her attitude, she was being rude,"" he said, adding that there was also ""more lying"". Asked for examples, he told the court about times when the girl allegedly stayed out with friends after claiming she would come home straight from school, and stole money from her mother and grandmother. He described raising his voice, slapping and caning his daughter to discipline her on such occasions. Under examination by his lawyer, the man also admitted to punching the girl's stomach when she ran away from home once. ""At that moment in time, I was very, very angry with her for running away from home. I was very tired from work and furthermore, after seeing her, she saw me and still wanted to run away. ""That is where I really couldn’t control my emotion,"" he said. But he denied hitting the girl with a motorcycle helmet on that occasion, in contrast to what the victim's friend had testified being told by the girl. The man also described two particular occasions when he disciplined the victim in the days leading up to his arrest on Jan 15, 2020. He said that a few days before his arrest, the victim came home late. When her parents asked where she had been, she said she was at school. But the man said his wife later found out that the girl was spending time outside school with friends. The man said the girl continued to deny this when questioned and raised her voice, maintaining that she was at school. He then slapped and shouted at her, telling her he would take away ""all her privileges"", including deleting her social media accounts, taking her off her sports team and forbidding her from attending a school camp. ""I also even said that even if you want to eat, you ask permission. You want to watch TV, you ask permission. You want to play my PlayStation 4, you ask my permission. Basically anything you want to do inside the house, you ask my permission."" He said that the girl was crying but kept quiet and did not answer any questions as he scolded her. After this, he said there was another occasion before his arrest when he shouted at her over her school attire, as he ""noticed that her skirts were getting shorter and shorter"". The man said he felt shocked and sad when he learnt about her allegations after being arrested. He later told an investigating officer that he believed his daughter had made up the allegations against him because he recently disciplined her. When shown a VR headset in the courtroom, the man admitted to owning an identical model that he got online as an ""impulse buy"". But he claimed that he never gave the victim permission to use the headset because he thought it would damage her eyesight, as it consists of a slot that holds a phone right in front of the user's eyes. The trial continues, with the man's wife and mother-in-law expected to take the stand as defence witnesses. The couple have two other children. Aside from the victim, two of her friends, her teacher, her school counsellor, a child protection officer and a child psychologist have also given evidence as prosecution witnesses. If convicted of using criminal force to outrage the modesty of a child under 14, the man can be jailed for up to five years, fined, caned or any combination of these punishments. Editor's note: This article has been amended to correct a detail that stated that it was the victim's teacher who had testified on one occasion. It should have been the victim's friend. We apologise for the error."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/doctor-jailed-liposuction-patient-death-propofol-wong-meng-hang-2750391,Former doctor jailed for death of patient in 2009 liposuction procedure,"SINGAPORE: A former doctor was sentenced to four months' jail on Thursday (Jun 16) for causing the death of his patient during a liposuction procedure in 2009. Wong Meng Hang, 46, pleaded guilty to a charge of committing a rash act not amounting to culpable homicide. The patient, 44-year-old Franklin Heng Ang Tee, was undergoing a liposuction procedure at Reves Clinic on Dec 30, 2009 when he was placed under deep sedation and could not be roused. Wong admitted to instructing another doctor, Dr Zhu Xiu Chun, 59, to give Mr Heng an excessive dose of the sedative propofol. Wong also admitted to failing to monitor Mr Heng adequately. The excessive sedation caused Mr Heng to be unable to maintain his own airway, according to an expert anaesthetist. Mr Heng died of asphyxia due to airway obstruction, a coroner's inquiry found. Both Wong and Dr Zhu were found to lack the necessary training and experience to administer propofol as a sedative. Wong had no formal training on the use of sedatives, and had learnt by observing a freelance anaesthetist at the clinic. Dr Zhu had only used propofol in a minority of her cases and would usually involve a trained anaesthetist when sedation was required. In 2018, the Court of Three Judges ordered Wong to be struck off the register of medical practitioners, while Dr Zhu was suspended for 18 months. That court said the incident was ""among the most egregious cases of medical misconduct we have come across"". Some time after the liposuction procedure was completed, Wong noticed that Mr Heng looked pale and was drowsy. He took Mr Heng's pulse and found that the man could not be roused. Wong activated ""code blue"" for a life-threatening medical emergency and unsuccessfully tried to resuscitate Mr Heng. The clinic called an ambulance at about 4.30pm. When paramedics arrived, Wong twice lied to them that he had not given his patient propofol. At the hospital, Wong again lied to doctors that his patient was not given any sedation. Mr Heng was pronounced dead at 6pm, about an hour after arriving at the hospital. Wong later amended the timings in his post-procedure notes to shorten the time between his discovery that Mr Heng was drowsy and being unable to rouse him, from 20 minutes down to five minutes. During investigations, Wong was also inconsistent about the amount of propofol he ordered Dr Zhu to administer. All his claims were false as they would have resulted in much lower levels of propofol than that actually found in Mr Heng's blood, court documents stated. Deputy Public Prosecutors Kumaresan Gohulabalan, Andre Chong and Goh Qi Shuen sought four to six months' jail. Wong's rash acts were ""not once-off incidents but constitute a series of continued rash decisions"" over the course of the procedure lasting more than three hours, they said. ""The risk was plainly unnecessary as there was no need to use propofol, a potent sedative,"" argued the prosecutors. They also said that the manner in which the procedure was carried out breached at least five licensing conditions and international guidelines. Wong was charged and prosecuted after the conclusion of the coroner's inquiry, regulatory action by the Ministry of Health and Singapore Medical Council proceedings. TODAY previously reported that the High Court ordered Wong and Dr Zhu to pay Mr Heng's estate S$5.3 million in damages in 2015. Dr Zhu was earlier given a charge of abetting a rash act not amounting to culpable homicide. She claimed trial, which is set to commence in September. The offence of committing a rash act not amounting to culpable homicide, or abetting such an act, carries a penalty of up to five years' jail, a fine or both."

He did this from the corridor of their condominium. Tok Zhi Xiang, 22, pleaded guilty to two charges of voyeurism. Three other charges were considered for sentencing. The identities of the three victims, aged eight, 26 and 43, are protected by gag order. The court heard that Tok was on his way home at night on Mar 7 last year when he decided to take a walk around the condominium before returning home. He noticed light coming from the 26-year-old victim's toilet window and heard the sound of water flowing. He then went to the common corridor outside the toilet window with the intention of recording a video of her showering. At the window, Tok held up his mobile phone and aimed it inside the toilet for a few seconds on recording mode. The victim was showering in the toilet at the time. Tok checked the video and saw that it had captured her naked. He then continued recording a video of her. While showering, the victim suddenly noticed a phone at the window. She screamed and told her father and brother. Tok stopped filming when he heard the victim shout and immediately deleted the video from his phone. He was approached by the victim's father and brother, but claimed to have nothing to do with the incident and lied that he had seen two people walking away quickly. The men called the police. When they arrived, Tok admitted that he was the person who had filmed the victim showering. Tok's phone was seized, and police found 14 obscene videos. Forensic examination of the phone revealed that he had recorded the three victims naked in their toilets on at least three other occasions. Four days prior to being caught, Tok had recorded the 26-year-old victim, also by standing at the common corridor and filming through the toilet window. He recorded nine such videos of her over a period of two minutes. On Feb 9, 2021, while positioned in the common corridor, he also recorded two videos of the eight-year-old victim showering in her home. The penalty for voyeurism is jail for up to two years, a fine, caning or any combination of these punishments."

During demolition works in 2019, a floor slab on the second floor that was supported only on one end fell, killing one of the workers and seriously injuring another. Kong Chiew Fook, 55, pleaded guilty to one charge of performing a negligent act that endangered the safety of others. He had more than 30 years of experience in the construction industry and worked for Springview Enterprises at the time of the incident. In a statement after the sentencing, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) reminded all contractors of the need for thorough risk assessments for any demolition works. ""The sequence of demolition and control measures must be clearly communicated to the team and strictly adhered to during the demolition process,"" said Mr Sebastian Tan, MOM's director of occupational safety and health inspectorate. The court heard that Kong was the person in charge of the reconstruction of a two-storey semi-detached house at Aroozoo Avenue in Kovan. On Mar 4, 2019, Kong instructed three employees - the deceased worker Mr Santo and two others, Mr Ddin and Mr Ponnir - to hack walls at the site. As part of the day's work, they were told to hack the parapet wall of a balcony on the second floor. After giving the instructions, Kong left for another work site. At about 1pm, Mr Ponnir erected a one-tier scaffold as a working platform to hack the top of the wall of the balcony, and Mr Ddin started hacking there. At about 1.40pm, Mr Santo returned from his break and took over the hacking while Mr Ddin went for a short break. At that moment, the floor slab of the balcony suddenly collapsed. Mr Santo was standing on the floor slab, while Mr Ponnir was on the scaffold. The floor slab slipped as it fell, pinning Mr Santo under it. The scaffold also fell, throwing Mr Ponnit out. He landed about 2m away from Mr Santo. Other workers heard the impact of the fallen floor slab and rushed to the backyard. About five workers tried to lift the slab to extricate Mr Santo, but were unsuccessful. An excavator was eventually used to lift the slab up high enough for metal debris to be placed beneath, and for Mr Santo to be pulled out. Mr Santo was pronounced dead at the scene. His cause of death was found to be head injuries. Mr Ponnir was taken to the hospital with serious injuries, including fractures at his hip, elbow and wrist. He was hospitalised for almost two months. Kong was overseeing the demolition works at the site, plans for which had been approved by the Building and Construction Authority. Investigations showed that the demolition plans clearly indicated the works should be carried out in strict compliance with the code of practice on demolition. Kong was aware that the top-down demolition method, which proceeds from roof to ground, must be used to ensure structural stability. Instead, he had instructed the workers to follow an unsafe demolition sequence by hacking away supporting walls on the ground level before demolishing the balcony floor slab. This was done about one month before the incident. ""By removing the supporting walls on the ground level, the balcony floor slab on level two was thus left in a cantilevered position without any supporting pillars and was susceptible to collapse,"" court documents stated. Kong had ""no reasonable cause"" for this and only assumed that the floor slab was strong enough to hold on its own based on his experience, according to court documents. MOM prosecutor Mohd Fadhli sought 12 to 14 months' jail for Kong, arguing that as the workers were demolishing concrete structures, adherence to established practice was vital. Mr Fadhli argued that given Kong's industry experience, he would have known that there was a risk of the cantilevered structure collapsing. Defence lawyer Marshall Lim said his client was ""truly saddened"" by the death of a worker in his care, and had an ""impeccable"" safety record before the incident. In sentencing, District Judge Janet Wang said that Kong was lulled into a false sense of security when the slab remained cantilevered apparently without issue, until the day of the incident. Springview and its director Heng Kong Chuan also face charges for failing to take reasonable steps to ensure the safety of workers, said MOM. Kong could have been jailed for up to two years, fined up to S$30,000 or both under the Workplace Safety and Health Act."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/g-kannan-prosecutor-death-accident-agc-condolences-legal-community-2748176,"Veteran prosecutor G Kannan, 52, dies in an accident overseas","SINGAPORE: Veteran prosecutor Gnanasihamani Kannan has died after an accident while on overseas leave, the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) said in a statement on Wednesday (Jun 15). He was 52. The AGC did not specify the nature of the accident on Tuesday or where it happened. Mr Kannan was a senior director and senior state counsel at AGC's crime division. He joined the AGC in 1995 and had more than 20 years of experience as a prosecutor. He also served in the Ministry of Manpower for five years. Mr Kannan was involved in significant cases like the ongoing prosecution of Lim Oon Kuin, the founder of collapsed oil trading firm Hin Leong Trading who faces charges of cheating financial institutions. Earlier this year, Mr Kannan prosecuted the case of Andrew Gosling, who threw a glass bottle that killed an elderly man in what was described as an act of ""religious hostility"". He was also the prosecutor in the 2016 sedition cases of Yang Kaiheng and Ai Takagi, the couple behind The Real Singapore website. Mr Kannan was part of a team from AGC that led evidence during the 2018 Committee of Inquiry that looked into the cyberattack on SingHealth's patient database. ""His deep understanding of technology and computer systems was instrumental in enabling the AGC team to piece together and present the contributing factors of the incident,"" said AGC. It added that Mr Kannan's expertise and experience as a pioneer in the fields of technology crime and digital evidence were recognised internationally. He was invited to serve on various United Nations and Commonwealth expert groups on cybercrime. Mr Kannan's most recent posting was in AGC's commercial and technology crimes cluster. In 2018, he received a Long Service Medal as part of the National Day Awards. ""Mr Kannan was relentless in his pursuit of justice and was guided by a sense of mission to work towards building a fairer and safer society,"" said AGC. ""He will be missed by all at AGC. Our management and staff extend our deepest condolences to Mr Kannan's family during this difficult time."" Attorney-General Lucien Wong said Mr Kannan served with distinction in his various appointments during his career in the Singapore legal service. ""He leaves behind many dear friends and colleagues in the service and the legal community who deeply mourn his passing,"" he added. ""We have, with his passing, lost a remarkable and outstanding colleague."" Members of the legal community expressed shock and sadness at Mr Kannan's passing, and praised his legal acumen. Mr Remy Choo Zheng Xi told CNA that Mr Kannan was an eloquent advocate who had ""a particular rhetorical flair when he was on his feet"". Mr Choo was Mr Kannan's opposing counsel in The Real Singapore sedition cases. Mr Choo said that any courtroom aggression never translated into personal animosity. ""In fact, our teams got along well personally, and he set the tone. After a long day in court, we'd crack jokes with each other to lighten the atmosphere of a very highly charged trial. ""Years later, I met him for a coffee to speak to him about a difficult technology law problem, and he was generous with his time, and we reminisced about the trial,"" said Mr Choo, director of Peter Low & Choo LLC. ""He was a good lawyer and a great person. He will be missed."" Lawyer Alfred Lim said he was shocked when he received news of Mr Kannan's death on Tuesday evening. They had known each other for about 20 years and were colleagues for four years as public prosecutors, said the director of Fullerton Law Chambers LLC. Mr Lim described Mr Kannan as a ""great boss"" and ""trusted confidant"". ""He taught me the basics of court advocacy and showed me the ropes in court craft when I started out as a young prosecutor."" Mr Kannan was very serious about work and had high standards, added Mr Lim. ""Outside of work, he was a charismatic, witty person and we bonded over drinks, food and football."" Lawyer Ramesh Tiwary said he found Mr Kannan to be ""a tough and intelligent adversary"", but one who was also fair and compassionate. ""I'm really saddened at his passing and hope the family can find the strength to carry on,"" he said. Mr Lee Teck Leng, director of Legal Clinic, described Mr Kannan as sincere, honest and ""a good man"". ""I would regard him as a very good deputy public prosecutor and it is definitely a great loss to AGC."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/toilet-cubicle-peep-selfie-voyeur-tanglin-shopping-centre-2745991,Serial voyeur jailed for peeping at teen in Tanglin Shopping Centre toilet,"SINGAPORE: A man with a history of voyeurism was on Tuesday (Jun 14) jailed 10 weeks for peeping at a teenager in a toilet at Tanglin Shopping Centre. Reyes Ryan Jayson De Leon, 39, was working as a marketing executive in the mall at the time of the offence. The court heard that at about 12.30pm on Oct 18 last year, he entered a cubicle in one of the male toilets. The 17-year-old victim was in the adjacent cubicle at the time. His identity is protected by gag order. Reyes stood on the toilet bowl of his own cubicle and peeped into the victim's cubicle. At the time, the teenager was sitting on the covered toilet bowl taking a selfie. When the teen looked at the photo he had just taken, he noticed Reyes in the background, peeping into the cubicle over the partition wall. The victim confronted Reyes, who admitted to peeping into the cubicle. He was arrested by police on the same day. His mobile phone was also seized, and police found voyeuristic images when they examined it. Through investigations, police found that on Sep 7 last year, in the same toilet, Reyes had taken a photo of another victim's private parts without his consent. Reyes admitted to using his phone to photograph the victim from the bottom of the adjacent cubicle. The identity of this victim is not known. Reyes also admitted to having an urge to see the private parts of people in adjacent cubicles regardless of whether they consented or not, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Sivanathan Jheevanesh. He started peeping into occupied toilet cubicles a few years ago, and was able to see the occupants' private parts on some occasions, court documents stated. The court heard that Reyes' method was to first attempt to peep inside a cubicle if he knew that it was occupied, such as if he heard noises. If he was not able to peep inside, he would take a photo from under his own cubicle to see if it could capture any private parts. Reyes pleaded guilty to one charge each of intruding on the teen's privacy to insult his modesty, and voyeurism. Two other charges were considered for sentencing. Mr Jheevanesh asked for 10 to 12 weeks' jail, arguing that it was fortuitous the teenage victim's private parts were not exposed during the offence. He argued that Reyes' actions were premeditated as he ""targeted"" the same toilet on four occasions, and that the victim was young and vulnerable. Defence lawyer Mark Yeo countered that his client's offences were opportunistic and not planned. He said Reyes was remorseful and aware of ""underlying issues"" to be resolved, and had taken steps to be accountable to his church leaders and family. The lawyer added: ""He was literally chased around the block by the victim who was recording a video of him, which was uploaded on the Internet and went viral."" In sentencing, Deputy Principal District Judge Luke Tan said it was clear from the facts of the case that Reyes' offences were ""not spontaneous acts"". ""They do show a pattern of behaviour, they do show that these things don't just happen by chance,"" said the judge. The penalty for intruding upon the privacy of a person to insult his or her modesty is up to one year's jail, a fine or both. Voyeurism can be punished with up to two years' jail, a fine, caning or any combination of these punishments."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/nus-research-fellow-false-claims-expenses-40000-corruption-2745801,"Former NUS researcher admits making false claims for S$40,000 over 8 years","SINGAPORE: Over a period of eight years, a research fellow made almost S$40,000 worth of false claims from the National University of Singapore (NUS). To cover his tracks, Thomas Teh Kok Hiong, 42, doctored receipts and invoices to justify the false claims for personal purchases and purchases he did not actually make. On Tuesday (Jun 14), he pleaded guilty to five counts of cheating and two counts of forgery. Another 20 charges will be considered when he returns for sentencing in July. Investigations showed that Teh submitted expense reports containing false or inflated claims and claims for expenses that he did not incur, but were, for example, incurred by his family members. Between October 2010 and September 2018, Teh submitted 22 expense reports and duped NUS into reimbursing him close to S$40,000 for expenses he claimed were for research purposes. He also admitted to forging payment documents to get approval for claims on two occasions. In October 2017, Teh engaged a shop to install solar film for his car and paid S$300 for the personal purchase. He then used a blank invoice issued by the shop and reflected S$4,815 as the price for ""UV protective film for lab hood and cabinets"", which he submitted to NUS. In January 2018, he entered S$2,820 into a blank cash sale document to support an expense claim for research equipment. He had actually spent about S$1,000 on a labeller and radio for his own use. Court documents did not say how Teh's offences were discovered. Teh, who was with NUS' Department of Biomedical Engineering at the time of the offences, is no longer with the university, his defence lawyer told the court. He has since made full restitution to the university. Deputy Public Prosecutor V Jesudevan sought 24 weeks' jail, arguing that Teh cheated a public institution and there was a need to deter like-minded offenders. He urged the court to disregard a report by the defence's psychiatrist, which said that Teh suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder that had a contributory link to the offences. Mr Jesudevan argued that the psychiatrist's report was ""unreliable"" and that the defence had not aided the court in understanding the severity of Teh's mental condition. Defence lawyer Tan Hee Joek argued that the key mitigating factors were Teh's full restitution to NUS and the psychiatrist's report, which would explain some of Teh's ""rather bizarre behaviour"" over the years. This behaviour included his purchases of items that he did not need, said Mr Tan. The lawyer also said his client had expressed remorse and fully cooperated in investigations by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau and NUS. District Judge Christopher adjourned sentencing to consider how much weight should be given to the psychiatrist's report. The penalty for cheating is up to three years' jail, a fine or both, while the punishment for forgery is up to four years' jail, a fine or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/former-singtel-employee-cheat-friends-telco-scam-phone-2745541,Former Singtel employee jailed for cheating friends into signing up for mobile plans,"SINGAPORE: A former Singtel employee was on Tuesday (Jun 14) jailed for one year and eight months for cheating his friends into signing up for mobile plans and giving him the phones they received. While on bail for those offences, Aloysius Nah Ming Yuan also posed as a woman on dating apps and cheated two men into paying him for sexual services, and swindled a Carousell seller. The 28-year-old pleaded guilty to 10 counts of cheating, with another 16 charges considered for sentencing. The court heard that Nah used to work as a customer service officer with Singtel. In 2017, Nah decided to deceive his friends into signing up for mobile service plans with various telecommunication companies. He lied to his friends that they would not be charged any fees, and got them to pass him the phones they received from entering the agreements. He also told them that by signing up for the mobile plans, they would be helping him hit his sales quota as a Singtel employee. This was untrue, as he was dismissed in September 2017.  Nah received a total of 35 mobile phones worth almost S$39,000 from 11 victims in 2017. The victims were charged by the telcos and paid about S$32,000 in fees, with about S$12,000 outstanding. Nah made partial restitution of S$10,000 on Sep 29, 2019. In December 2019, while Nah was on bail for the telco scam, he reoffended by cheating a Carousell seller. The victim offered a service of making online payment for clients in return for a commission. Nah contacted the victim on Carousell and said he needed to make two online bank transfers totalling S$2,850 for business purposes. The transfers were actually for betting-related purposes.  The victim made the transfers. Nah did not reimburse or pay her for this, and he never had the intention to do so, stated court documents. He was only traced after the police conducted various screenings with Carousell and Google, among others, according to court documents. Nah did not make any restitution to the victim. Sometime before March 2021, Nah posed as a woman named ""Xiaohui"" on Tinder and OkCupid, using a photo of a woman he had found online. Using these accounts, Nah spoke to strangers who were interested in dating. He moved the conversation to other messaging platforms ""when he felt that he had a chance to cheat them of money"", according to court documents. He would propose entering into sexual relationships with them, subsequently telling them he needed money for personal expenses or to solve family problems. ""Throughout the entire period, the victims would be labouring under the impression that he was a woman named 'Xiaohui' who was looking to enter into a sexual relationship with them,"" stated court documents. Over eight occasions in March and April 2021, Nah deceived two men into transferring a total of S$2,650 to him. In total, he cheated victims of about S$3,700 through this scam. He has made restitution of S$500. The penalty for cheating is up to 10 years' jail and a fine."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/false-declaration-stay-home-notice-opt-out-dedicated-facility-jail-2745186,Man gets jail for making false declaration in order to serve stay-home notice at residence,"SINGAPORE: A man was on Tuesday (Jun 14) sentenced to three weeks' jail for making a false declaration in order to serve his stay-home notice at home instead of a dedicated facility. Lu Yi Yin, 49, went to Taiwan on Feb 17, 2021 and returned to Singapore on Jul 14 later that year. He pleaded guilty to one charge under the Infectious Diseases Act. On two occasions, he falsely declared that he would stay in his residence alone or with household members with the same travel history and stay-home notice duration. At the time, Singaporeans and permanent residents who had only visited Taiwan in the 21 days prior to their departure for Singapore could opt out of stay-home notice dedicated facilities if they met those conditions. Lu, a permanent resident, made the false declaration in an online form before leaving Taiwan. He was informed that his application was successful. Upon arrival at Changi Airport, he repeated the declaration in a physical form despite knowing that it was false. At the airport, an Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officer also reminded Lu of the terms of opting out of a dedicated facility, and these were reproduced on the stay-home notice issued to him. On Jul 15, 2021, ICA officers were informed by the ICA stay-home notice command post that Lu had made a false declaration. During a house check that day, they found Lu's wife and daughter living in the same residence as him. They did not share the same travel history as Lu and were not serving the same stay-home notice period. Lu tested negative for COVID-19 that same day. Deputy Public Prosecutor Foong Ke Hui sought the jail sentence imposed, arguing for the need to deter similar offences. She said that Lu had multiple opportunities to correct his mistake, but did not do so. Defence lawyer Chua Hock Lu asked for a fine, arguing that Lu had taken it upon himself to ""mitigate"" the risk of COVID-19 transmission by not being in contact with his family members. Deputy Principal District Judge Luke Tan noted that Lu committed the offence more than a year into the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore. He said that Lu was given numerous reminders but nonetheless made false declarations. He also noted the risk of exposure to the two others living in the same residence, and that there was no indication they stayed at home. ""If there had been a COVID-19 transmission, these two other persons could themselves not only been infected, but could have been infecting others,"" said the judge. As a first-time offender, Lu could have been jailed up to six months, fined up to S$10,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/johor-bahru-robbery-rolex-monet-restaurant-taman-mount-austin-2743746,Malaysian police tracking down 4 suspects for armed robbery involving luxury watches in JB restaurant,"JOHOR BAHRU: Johor police are tracking down four suspects, after they robbed employees of a luxury watch retailer who were waiting in a Johor Bahru restaurant to finalise a deal with a buyer. Waitress Chan Jia Yi, who was on duty at Monet Music Restaurant at Taman Mount Austin last Wednesday (Jun 8), told CNA that the masked suspects had entered the eatery from the back door, wielding parangs. She recalled how one of them pointed the sharp end of the weapon at her face and gestured for her to move aside.  “I froze in fear,” Ms Chan said when interviewed on Monday (Jun 13). “(I thought they) wanted to hold me at knife-point. I felt that my life was in danger.” However, the four men moved past her into a private VIP room, where a business transaction involving luxury watches was due to take place.  A man and a woman, who were representing a watch company, were inside the room along with another man who was their bodyguard,” said Ms Chan.  She said that the masked men then slashed the two men inside the room, before grabbing the luxury watches and a gold ring. The robbers then left via the same backdoor. “The whole thing happened within two to three minutes,” added Ms Chan.  In a statement issued last Thursday, Johor police said it was tracking down four male suspects for their suspected involvement in an armed robbery.  The statement added that the suspects were “tall and lean”, had worn black masks and were equipped with parangs. The police said that the suspects escaped in a grey Toyota Estima. They also said that three Rolex watches and a gold ring were stolen.  In response to CNA’s queries, officer in charge of the case Inspector Satishkuru S/O Kandasamy said on Monday that the police were still conducting investigations.  Ms Chan, the waitress, told CNA that in the immediate aftermath of the incident, she had rushed to the front counter to inform her colleagues about what was happening. This triggered chaos, as restaurant staff and customers fled the scene, many of them rushing out of the front door, she said.  However, Ms Chan said that a customer, whom she later found was a Singaporean, went into the private room after the suspects had left. The customer, along with a restaurant staff member, helped to tend to the injuries of the two men.  “One of them had a big gash on his arm while the other was bleeding from his back. It was only four hours later, around 5pm, that the restaurant resumed operations,” said Ms Chan.  The three individuals who were robbed were employees of local watch retailer V-Time. Director of V-Time, Mr Jimmy Cai, told CNA that one of his employees who injured his arm during the incident had to undergo an operation.  “He is suffering from nerve damage and doctors say it might take six months for him to recover fully,” said Mr Cai.  Mr Cai also told CNA that his employees had attended the meeting because they were scheduled to finalise a deal involving the luxury watches with a client who they had been in contact with.  He added that the client, who referred to himself as “Datuk Sim”, had booked a private room at Monet Music Restaurant last Wednesday and ordered food worth more than RM5,000 (US$1,131).  Mr Cai believed that the buyer had planned the robbery, as the latter’s representatives did not show up for the meeting. He also noted that the four suspects knew which room to enter to rob the victims. He also said the robbers left with three Rolex watches, including one which was worn by one of his employees, as well as a gold ring belonging to the female employee.  Mr Cai said that the watches stolen were worth around RM500,000 in total.   “I think we have to relook and ensure that our clients are genuinely interested to buy from us, for the safety of our employees,” said Mr Cai. Manager for Monet Music Restaurant Mr Sean Tay told CNA that the outlet was looking to step up security measures to ensure the safety of its customers.  “We have installed CCTV cameras but we also want to hire more security personnel as well,” said Mr Tay.  “We were not the target for this robbery but we are not taking anything for granted."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/woman-spit-abuse-grab-driver-never-wear-mask-2743686,"Woman fined for hurling abuse, spitting at Grab driver","SINGAPORE: A woman was fined S$3,500 on Monday (Jun 13) for hurling abuse and spitting at a Grab driver who told her and another passenger to wear their masks. Kwek Shu Yong, 33, pleaded guilty to two charges under the Protection from Harassment Act. A third charge of breaching COVID-19 regulations by failing to wear a mask was considered for sentencing. The court heard that at about 2.20am on Nov 15, 2020, the 59-year-old victim picked up Kwek and another passenger in Woodlands. The driver noticed that Kwek and the other passenger were not wearing masks and asked them to do so. They put on their masks before boarding the car. As the driver was about to move off, he checked his rear-view mirror and noticed that the other passenger had removed his mask. The driver turned around and told the man to put his mask back on or he would insist that both passengers alight from his car. Kwek was upset by the driver's request and shouted at him in a mixture of English, Mandarin and Teochew. ""Uncle, you this type of person like you ah, it's a matter of time before you get beaten up by others, really, you don't drive at night, you drive in the morning will do,"" she said, before using a vulgarity. The driver took out his mobile phone and told Kwek he would record her behaviour. Kwek then lowered her mask and made a spitting sound in his direction, causing some of her spittle to land on his face. Kwek also challenged the driver to call the police. He proceeded to drive the pair to a police centre. Deputy Public Prosecutor Timotheus Koh sought the fine that was imposed, arguing that the driver was a vulnerable victim. ""He is constantly exposed on the service frontline and left to fend for himself when confronted with difficult and/or unruly passengers,"" said the prosecutor. He also called Kwek's action of spitting at the victim ""plainly disgusting and irresponsible"" given the heightened anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those who use abusive words with the intent to cause harassment can be jailed up to six months, fined up to S$5,000 or both. Those guilty of insulting behaviour likely to cause harassment can be fined up to S$5,000."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/doctor-car-accident-96-year-old-woman-died-right-turn-2743476,"Doctor jailed over car accident that injured 96-year-old woman, who later died","SINGAPORE: A doctor was on Monday (Jun 13) jailed for one week and banned from driving for two years after injuring a 96-year-old woman in a car accident. The victim, Mdm Heng Fong Boey, died on Oct 12, 2019, four days after the accident. Dr Ernest Fu Weizhong, 39, a consultant at a hospital, pleaded guilty to one charge of causing grievous hurt by a negligent act that endangered human life. Mdm Heng was in a car driven by her son, Mr Soon Jin Joke, when they were hit head-on by Dr Fu's car on Tampines Avenue 12. Dr Fu admitted to failing to keep a proper lookout and to give way to the car driven by Mr Soon, which had the right of way. Another charge for a negligent act that caused hurt to Mr Soon, 68, was considered for sentencing. The court heard that Mr Soon was speeding at the time of the collision. Mdm Heng, who was sitting in the rear passenger seat, was not wearing a seatbelt. At about 8pm on Oct 8, 2019, Dr Fu was driving along Tampines Avenue 12 towards Tampines Avenue 9. He was on a right-turning lane, and intended to turn onto Tampines Expressway (TPE). The road he was on had two lanes for vehicles to turn right onto the TPE, with the traffic guided by a green arrow traffic light signal. In the absence of the green arrow signal, vehicles are permitted to execute discretionary right turns. Dr Fu came to a brief stop at the junction leading to the turn-off to the TPE along with other vehicles that were waiting to turn as well. Mr Soon's car was travelling in the opposite direction on the rightmost lane along Tampines Avenue 12 at the time. As Mr Soon's car approached the junction, he saw that the traffic lights were lit green in his favour and continued driving straight. At this point, Dr Fu made a discretionary right turn after the other vehicles ahead of him moved off. The green arrow traffic signal was not lit up at the time. Dr Fu did not stop at the white line to look for oncoming traffic from the opposite direction before making the turn. As a result, the front left side of his car collided with the front of Mr Soon's car. Mdm Heng was thrown forward and wedged at the front seat of the car. The impact also caused Mr Soon's car to roll backwards and hit a car behind him. Debris from the collision flew towards another car travelling on the middle lane, damaging its front.  The collision was captured by in-car cameras in Dr Fu's car and the car in the middle lane. The videos were played in court. Mdm Heng was taken to the hospital, where she was found to have bleeding in the skull and fractures at her cervical spine, rib, hip, thigh and pubic bones. She also had low blood pressure. She was admitted to the high dependency ward after being resuscitated. Her cause of death was determined to be hypertensive heart disease with pulmonary fat embolism following skeletal fractures. She did not receive active intervention due to her family's decision to limit the extent of care, and eventually succumbed to her injuries, court documents stated. Forensic analysis showed that Mr Soon's car was travelling at about 71kmh prior to braking, and at around 80kmh while travelling along Tampines Avenue 12 before that. The speed limit on Tampines Avenue 12 is 60kmh. The prosecution asked for one to two weeks' jail and a driving ban of two years, arguing that Dr Fu should have been able to see Mr Soon's car as it was already approaching the junction when he made the discretionary right turn. The defence argued that Mdm Heng's injuries were likely to have been more serious because the car she was in was speeding and she was not wearing a seatbelt. In response, the prosecution said that Dr Fu's negligence remained a ""substantial cause"" of the accident. Dr Fu could have been jailed up to two years, fined up to S$5,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/teacher-trial-molest-boy-student-school-hod-room-2743341,Trial opens for teacher accused of molesting 10-year-old schoolboy,"SINGAPORE: A 43-year-old man went on trial on Monday (Jun 13) for allegedly molesting a schoolboy who was then aged 10 to 11. The man, who was a teacher during the alleged offences, faces five charges of using criminal force to outrage the victim's modesty by touching the boy's private parts over his shorts. This allegedly took place in a head of department room in the school on five occasions in November 2017, March 2018, July 2018, August 2018 and October 2018. A gag order prevents the publication of any information that could lead to identification of the victim. This covers the accused's identity and the school where the suspected offences took place. The victim was a student at the school and a member of a co-curricular activity (CCA) of which the accused was the teacher-in-charge. The boy joined the CCA in 2016. In 2017, the boy started confiding in the accused about his family problems. The accused was aware that the boy did not have a good relationship with his stepfather. The victim's stepfather beat him, and the boy would sometimes turn up to school with bruises, according to court documents. In November 2018, the accused, the victim and two of the victim's friends had dinner together to celebrate the victim's birthday. Four days later, the school principal informed the accused of the victim's allegations. A day later, the victim made a police report that he had been molested. The accused was arrested on Jul 8, 2021. Deputy Public Prosecutors Lim Ying Min and Angela Ang are set to lead evidence from the victim, who will testify in camera, on Monday afternoon. The accused is represented by lawyer Mr Gino Hardial Singh. The defence is expected to lead evidence from five teachers over the course of the trial. Responding to CNA's queries, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said the teacher has been suspended since November 2018 and is no longer teaching in any school. ""MOE takes a serious view of staff misconduct and will not hesitate to take disciplinary action against those who fail to adhere to our standards of conduct and discipline, including dismissal from service,"" said a spokesperson. If convicted, the man could be jailed for up to five years, fined, caned or any combination of these punishments for each charge of using criminal force to outrage the modesty of a child under 14."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/former-chief-financial-officer-broadway-industrial-group-jail-insider-trading-2739961,"Former chief financial officer gets jail for insider trading, acquiring benefits from criminal conduct","SINGAPORE: A former chief financial officer was on Friday (Jun 10) sentenced to three months and two weeks' jail for insider trading and acquiring benefits from criminal conduct. Tan Chee Keong was CFO of Broadway Industrial Group Limited (BIGL) at the time of the offences, said the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in a media release on Friday. He was CFO of the company from Oct 5, 2015 to Aug 8, 2017. Between March and August 2016, BIGL was in discussions with Platinum Equity Advisors to sell two of its businesses. Tan had insider information on the deal and disclosed the information to two friends on numerous occasions, knowing that they would likely purchase BIGL shares, said MAS. ""The two individuals subsequently purchased and sold shares in BIGL and made profits,"" the authority added. In October 2016, Tan received S$30,000 in cash from one of these friends, which was his share of the profits from the insider trade. “Tan has paid S$30,000 to the state, as disgorgement of his share of the profits from the offence,” said MAS. The investigations against Tan arose after a referral by the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited, and he was investigated by MAS and the police's Commercial Affairs Department. The court proceedings against the two people who were alleged to have received insider information from Tan are ongoing, said MAS. Tan pleaded guilty to one charge of communicating non-public and material information about BIGL's shares to one of his friends. He was also convicted of a corruption charge after accepting a sum of money from that friend. A remaining charge of communicating insider information concerning BIGL shares to another friend was taken into consideration for sentencing. MAS' assistant managing director of policy, payments and financial crime Loo Siew Yee said: ""As the chief financial officer of a listed company, Mr Tan owed a duty to the company and its shareholders not to divulge price-sensitive information that has not been disclosed to the market at large. ""His act of conveying such information to his friends to benefit them and himself undermines public confidence in the transparency and integrity of our capital market. ""MAS will continue to pursue officers of companies who engage in such misconduct, to ensure a level playing field for all market participants."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sex-abuse-prominent-catholic-figure-crimes-jailed-timeline-2738126,Timeline: How a prominent Catholic figure’s sex abuse offences against teenage boys came to light,"SINGAPORE: A prominent figure in Singapore’s Catholic community was sentenced to jail last month for sex offences against two teenage boys. During investigations, it emerged that the man’s sexual misconduct was first uncovered in 2009 by leaders of a religious order of which he was a member. But it took years before it was reported to the police and for him to be charged and sentenced. The man, now in his 60s, cannot be named due to a court order that prohibits the publication of any information that could lead to identification of the victims. The gag order covers the offender’s designation, appointment, the school he was linked to, and the name of his Catholic order. Here is a timeline of events related to the case: 2005 TO 2006: SEX OFFENCES AGAINST VICTIM V2 The man came to know the first victim, identified as V2 in court documents, between 2003 and 2004, and they became close. In 2005, when V2 was between 14 and 15, the man committed an indecent act on the boy. This happened at the man’s residence Sometime from 2005 to 2006, he performed another sex act on V2, who was then aged 14 to 16, court documents said. APRIL TO DECEMBER 2007: SEX OFFENCES AGAINST VICTIM V1 The man also became close to another victim, identified as V1 in court documents. Between April 2007 and December 2007, the man performed a sex act and committed an indecent act on V1 when the boy was 14 to 15. Sometime after that, V1 transferred schools. 2009: RELIGIOUS ORDER LEADERS LEARN ABOUT OFFENCES In 2009, V1 confided in the sector leader of the man’s religious order about the incidents. The boy was “struggling emotionally and socially” and felt “disgusted” about the sex acts the man had performed on him, according to court documents. The sector leader counselled V1 and offered to escalate the matter to the police, but V1 refused, court documents stated. Upon being questioned by his religious superior about V1’s allegations, the offender admitted that they were true. He was immediately suspended from school activities by his superiors in the order, and prevented from returning to the school premises, according to court documents. JUNE 2009: OFFENDER LEAVES SINGAPORE In June 2009, the man left Singapore to receive treatment under a six-month therapy programme in the United States. He was not under police investigation then as no police reports were lodged by the victims, according to court documents. The man had no further contact with either victim after leaving for the US. After he completed the therapy programme, he was posted to a different country where “he was no longer involved with minors”, court documents said. He would return to Singapore for “one or two weeks at a time” to visit his family. MAY 2013: CHANGE OF ARCHBISHOP Archbishop William Goh succeeds former Archbishop Nicholas Chia, who retired after serving in the position since 2001. MARCH 2020: OFFENDER RETURNS TO SINGAPORE About 11 years after the offender admitted to the religious order leader about the sex abuse, he returned to Singapore to renew his missionary visa. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, he was unable to return to his country of ministry and remained in Singapore. LATE 2020: SCHOOL BOARD LEARNS ABOUT OFFENCES Sometime in late 2020, the man’s history was brought to the attention of a school board. OCTOBER 2020: ARCHBISHOP INFORMED Archbishop Goh was informed about the man’s offences in October 2020, according to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore. Responding to media queries in May 2022, the Archdiocese said: “The Roman Catholic Archbishop was only informed of the case in October 2020, during which time he gave instructions that the matter be reported to the police as it was a criminal offence and that a report be made directly to the Dicastery for Consecrated Life in Rome and to inform and update the Archbishop of the Diocese where the offence was committed in accordance with Vatican protocols.” The Archdiocese added that religious orders within the Roman Catholic Church are “separately constituted” and are governed by their own judicial proceedings and administration of law. MAY 10, 2021: POLICE REPORT LODGED After an internal inquiry, the chairman of the school board lodged a police report. The police followed up and started investigations immediately, according to court documents. JAN 18, 2022: OFFENDER ARRESTED Police arrested the man after the investigations were concluded. JAN 20, 2022: OFFENDER CHARGED The man was charged with two counts of voluntarily having carnal intercourse against the order of nature with V1 and V2, and two counts of committing indecent acts with the victims. He was remanded for psychiatric observation to evaluate whether he suffered from any abnormality of mind that could have impaired his mental responsibility for the acts. FEB 10, 2022: BAIL On Feb 10, he was offered bail of S$15,000. MAR 3, 2022: INTENTION TO PLEAD GUILTY On Mar 3, the man’s defence lawyer informed the court of his client’s intention to plead guilty to the charges, as opposed to claiming trial. MAY 5, 2022: OFFENDER IS CONVICTED AND SENTENCED The man pleaded guilty to his offences and was convicted. He was sentenced to five years’ jail. The prosecution asked for four to six years’ jail for the offender, citing his abuse of trust and authority, as well as the young ages of the victims. The defence lawyer said the victims had “moved on” with their lives and were “doing well”, with no evidence to suggest they had been “marred” by the experience. He asked for a shorter term for the offender, claiming the man had “lost himself” and was “overwhelmed” with his responsibilities. In sentencing, District Judge Shaiffudin Saruwan noted the ""egregious abuse of trust"" in this case. ""The accused has exploited his position of significant influence and authority,"" said the judge. He added that the sentence must convey society's disapproval of the harm caused by the man's actions, and the need to protect vulnerable victims. The judge said he also took into account the offender's remorse, seen through his cooperation with investigations and decision to plead guilty, sparing the victims from testifying at trial. MAY 5, 2022: ARCHBISHOP APOLOGISES On the morning of the man’s conviction, Archbishop Goh issued a pastoral letter to the Catholic community in which he apologised on behalf of the church. “It is with great sadness and regret that we have learnt of the case involving a member of our Church – who has committed sexual crimes against young people. Like many of you, I am dismayed, shocked, and ashamed,” said the Archbishop. “My heartfelt sympathy to those who have suffered on account of this crime. I pray that they will find healing and closure, and we journey with them as a Church through this pain. May justice be rendered accordingly.” MAY 6, 2022: CHURCH, POLICE RELEASE MORE INFORMATION The Archdiocese released more information on the case in response to CNA’s queries, including when Archbishop Goh learnt about the man’s offences. It said that Archbishop Goh was informed of the offences in October 2020, and he instructed that the matter be reported to the police and the Dicastery for Consecrated Life in Rome. It added that the Church offers victims and their families help in terms of providing counselling support and spiritual support. The Archdiocese declined to comment further on whether it made a police report. The police said that upon completion of investigations, they issued a written advisory to a 64-year-old man to “remind him of his legal obligations under Section 424 of the Criminal Procedure Code”. This was done after consulting the Attorney-General’s Chambers. Section 424 of the Criminal Procedure Code states that every person aware of the commission of or intention to commit certain offences must immediately give the information to a police officer. This is if it is “in the absence of reasonable excuse”, says the Code. Police did not specify who the 64-year-old man was or how he was related to the offender and the case. MAY 11, 2022: CHURCH SAYS IT IS INVESTIGATING In a statement, the Archdiocese said it was working with the offender’s religious order to “investigate the background of the case which occurred more than 10 years ago”. The Archdiocese said it was also “taking steps to see how more information about the case can be publicly released in light of the existing gag order”. It added that religious orders and boards of Catholic schools have been reminded of their obligation to report to the Archbishop immediately if they become aware of alleged offences against minors or vulnerable people. JUN 5, 2022: RELIGIOUS ORDER SAYS VICTIMS WANTED PRIVACY The Archdiocese said it had asked the religious order for more information on the case. A statement on the Archdiocese’s website included a statement from the religious order. In the statement from the religious order, it said an investigation was initiated by the superior of the order for Singapore. Only the local leader and the superior were involved in the investigations. The victims were repeatedly told they could make a police report and would be accompanied to a police station to do, said the religious order. “Both victims refused to do so and were insistent in wanting to keep the matter private,” added the religious order. “Out of respect for the stated wishes and requested privacy of the victims, the superior did not make a police report then.” The religious order said that the superior then focused on what to do about the offender, “who was remorseful and expressed willingness to accept all consequences”. He was removed from his position and prevented from returning to the school premises. It was also revealed that the six-month treatment in the US was paid for by the religious order. After the programme, the religious order abided by the recommendations of the treatment centre, which included not placing the offender in “any setting that involves working with minors”. “Hence, the offender had to be posted to a different country, where he could undertake work that did not involve minors. The local religious superiors there were informed of his background and of the key restrictions of his recovery programme,” said the order. The superior of the order for Singapore continued to monitor the offender’s adherence to the restrictions imposed by the programme and his commitment to therapy and recovery. “To our knowledge, there are no other victims and the offender confirmed this,” said the order. The order added that after the man’s actions were brought to the school board’s attention in late 2020, the order informed the Archbishop in October 2020. The Archbishop then gave instructions that the matter is reported to the police. It added that it has “fully cooperated with the authorities” in their investigations. JUN 5, 2022: CATHOLIC CHURCH SAYS IT ASKED FOR PARTIAL LIFTING OF GAG ORDER The Archdiocese also said it asked the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) to partially lift the gag order “for greater accountability and transparency”. It sought a partial lifting of the gag order in relation to the offender’s identity, the name of his religious order and details of his subsequent treatment and postings. “The AGC informed that they had carefully considered our request but were unable to accede to it,” said the Archdiocese. JUN 6, 2022: AGC SAYS GAG ORDER IS TO PROTECT VICTIMS In response to the previous day's statement by the Archdiocese, the AGC confirmed it did not apply to lift or vary a gag order. Doing so might lead to the identification of the victims, AGC explained. ""The gag order, which was applied for by AGC and issued by the Court, was specifically to protect the identity of the victims,” it said. “It was not in any way sought to protect the interests of the accused person, or of the Catholic order involved. “The gag order covered the identity of the accused because, based on the facts and circumstances of the case, the identification of the accused was likely to lead to the identification of the victims.” AGC said that after the case was brought to court, lawyers acting for the Titular Roman Catholic Archbishop (TRCAS) of Singapore wrote to AGC to request for a partial lifting of the gag order. “AGC’s paramount interest was, and remains, the protection of victims. We consider every request to lift a gag order carefully as victims’ interests are paramount. “Therefore, we could not accede to the request from TRCAS, and declined to apply to the court to have the gag order lifted or varied.”"

The Chinese national was deported on Jun 9, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) said on Friday (Jun 10) in response to CNA’s queries. He is also barred from re-entering Singapore, ICA added.  In September 2016, Yang, then 42, was sentenced to six years’ jail for cheating Madam Chung Khin Chun, who was 89 that year, into giving him control over her assets. The jail term was later extended to nine years after an appeal by the Attorney-General's Chambers. The pair met in 2006 and Yang acted as her tour guide in China two years later. Yang moved to Singapore in 2009 to live with Mdm Chung when her husband died. By 2010, the childless widow had made a will leaving all her assets to him. When she was diagnosed with dementia in 2014, her niece took Yang to court. Court documents during the trial showed that in early 2010, Mdm Chung had S$2.7 million in liquid assets. By August 2014, shortly before Yang’s arrest, the elderly widow’s bank account contained less than S$10,000. Yang was also found guilty of duping the authorities into granting him permanent residency by setting up a shell company, falsifying hundreds of receipts and paying small sums in tax.  Together with a 26-month sentence for fraud, Yang had to serve 11 years and two months in jail. He had been in remand since Oct 31, 2014, and served about two-thirds of his sentence. On Friday, ICA said that his PR status was revoked on Nov 1, 2016. "

He did so by providing the Personal Identification Number (PIN) of ATM cards. ""The bank accounts were used by criminals to launder proceeds of crime derived from three reported cases of Internet love scams,"" they added.  Police investigations revealed that the suspect had befriended an unknown person over social media platforms. This online persona then asked the man to help receive funds in Singapore for business purposes.  In order to cheat three local banks into opening accounts in his name, the man deceived the banks into believing that he was the person using these accounts. The man then mailed the bank ATM cards to an address in Malaysia and provided the PIN to the person he befriended online.  Three people fell prey to love scams after they met their supposed ""online lovers"" on Facebook or Instagram.  ""Over time, the victims transferred a total amounting to S$20,300, at the request of their online lovers, for a variety of purposes,"" said the police. ""Some money was transferred purportedly to help ease cashflow problems; money was also transferred on the pretext of paying for fees needed to release parcels sent by their online lovers."" Those found guilty of conspiring to cheat a bank into opening a bank account face up to three years in jail, a fine, or both.  For abetting persons to secure unauthorised access to a bank’s computer system, first-time offenders face a fine of up to S$5,000, up to two years' jail, or both.  The police said they take a serious stance against anyone involved in facilitating money laundering, and perpetrators will be dealt with in accordance with the law. ""To avoid becoming involved in money laundering activities, members of the public should always reject requests to share the use of their banking facilities to receive and transfer funds, as well as guard against disclosing their Singpass login details which can be misused for many transactions,"" they added.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/property-agent-jail-deceive-buyer-seller-double-commission-2737011,Property agent gets jail for deceiving buyer and seller of HDB flat to receive double commission,"SINGAPORE: A property agent was sentenced to 23 weeks' jail and fined S$11,000 on Thursday (Jun 9) for deceiving both the buyer and seller of a Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat to receive double the amount of commission. Toh Yew Hock, 52, pleaded guilty earlier this month to one charge of dual representation under the Estate Agents (Estate Agency Work) Regulations, and one count each of criminal breach of trust and cheating. He was a registered salesperson with PropNex Realty at the time of the offences. A Council for Estate Agencies (CEA) prosecutor told the court his registration will expire at the end of the year. The prosecutor said the discovery of the offences was ""entirely fortuitous"" as the buyer and seller were able to have a face-to-face discussion when Toh was late for an inspection of the flat. In April 2018, a couple who owned the flat engaged Toh to represent them in the sale of the flat. It was advertised online for S$820,000. An interested buyer came across the advertisement the following month and contacted Toh to arrange a viewing. On May 21, 2018, Toh told him that the owners had suspended all further viewings after receiving an offer of S$810,000. This was untrue. To secure a viewing, the interested buyer offered to match the S$810,000 offer and pay 3 per cent agent commission to Toh, comprising the buyer's 1 per cent and seller's 2 per cent commissions. The buyer was under the impression that Toh represented him in the sale because he had engaged Toh to do so. They later signed an estate agency agreement on Jun 15, 2018. He viewed the flat on May 24, 2018, after which Toh advised him to increase his offer, saying that the seller had rejected a similar offer previously. The buyer raised his offer to S$820,000 but did not offer to pay the seller's commission this time. He also issued a S$1,000 crossed cheque to cover the option fee and gave this to Toh to pass to the seller. The seller accepted the S$820,000 offer and issued the option to purchase the next day. Toh informed the buyer that his offer was accepted, but lied that the seller had added on the condition that he paid half the seller's commission. There was in fact no such condition. The buyer was reluctant and negotiated with Toh to pay a S$15,000 commission instead. This comprised the buyer's 1 per cent commission and half of the seller's 2 per cent commission, minus S$1,400, as a discount. A valuation report on Jun 11, 2018 established the flat's value as S$760,000 – about S$60,000 below the accepted offer. The buyer would therefore have to pay cash over valuation of S$60,000. The buyer forwarded the report to Toh, informing the agent that he was not upset or troubled about the valuation. He did not give any indication that he could not afford the additional S$60,000. However, about two weeks later, Toh called the seller and lied that the buyer faced difficulties securing a bank loan due to the low valuation of the flat. He also said that the buyer was only able to pay at most S$20,000 of the cash over valuation. This was also untrue. Toh said he would try to resolve the situation. The next day, he called the seller and proposed selling the flat for S$790,000 instead, S$30,000 less than the accepted offer. The seller grudgingly agreed to this arrangement as she had already paid an option fee for a new property, and urgently needed to sell the flat to finance the new purchase. On Jun 15, 2018, Toh and the buyer met to finalise the sale. Toh lied that the remaining S$4,000 of the option exercise fee should be paid with a cash cheque as the seller needed cash urgently. The buyer entrusted Toh with the cheque, which he misappropriated. Later, Toh met the seller and lied that he had negotiated with the buyer to buy the flat at S$797,800. As this supposed price was below the S$820,000 price listed on the option to purchase, Toh proposed to the seller a way to account for the difference of S$22,200. He lied that the buyer had asked for a waiver of the S$4,000 and a ""refund"" of S$10,000. He also lied that the buyer had asked the seller to pay the buyer's commission of S$8,200. The overall effect of this was to allow Toh to keep the S$4,000 cash cheque for himself while enjoying a double share of the buyer's commission, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Joshua Phang. The seller felt uneasy and asked Toh if the option to purchase could be amended or reissued to reflect the new lower selling price. But Toh said this would delay the sales process and could result in the buyer being unable to exercise the option to purchase before its expiry. The seller agreed with Toh as she did not want the sale to fall through, court documents stated. Toh kept the S$4,000 cash cheque for himself. He passed the S$10,000 ""refund"" to the buyer and claimed that the seller felt bad about the flat's lower valuation and wanted to give him compensation. Toh then received a S$15,000 commission from the buyer. The offences were discovered on Aug 18, 2018 during an inspection of the flat. Toh was supposed to be there but was running late. In his absence, the buyer and seller started discussing the sale and discovered that they were both paying the buyer's commission to Toh. When Toh arrived, they confronted him about this. The buyer also discovered that the seller had not received his S$4,000 cheque. Toh admitted he had kept the S$4,000, but claimed that ""he deserved it as he had worked hard and met the expectations of the parties in closing the transaction at the agreed price"", court documents stated. The buyer and seller reported these events to CEA and PropNex. Toh made full restitution of S$15,000 to the buyer and S$4,000 to the seller, via PropNex. The agency also waived the agent's commission payable on the transaction. Mr Phang said Toh's offences were premeditated and ""carefully calculated to exploit information asymmetries between his buyer and seller victims to maximise his personal benefit"". After the case was heard, CEA reminded consumers that an agent cannot represent and collect commission fees from both the buyer and seller, or tenant and landlord, in the same property transaction. ""Dual representation creates a conflict of interest as it is not possible for the agent to act in the best interests of both parties,"" the council said. However, an agent who has his or her client's consent can help the other party with paperwork. It must be clear to all involved that the agent is not acting for the other party, said CEA. After the transaction has been completed, the commission should be paid to the property agency and not the agent, it added. Property agencies and agents are also not allowed to handle transaction money, including the option fee, which should be handled by consumers themselves."

When he entered immigration (recently), the immigration authorities informed the police and we made the arrest,” said Mr Kamarul Zaman.  He added that the police were still on the lookout for other members of the syndicate.  “The case is still under investigation and other syndicate members are still at large. They have been placed on the wanted list too,” said Mr Kamarul Zaman.  Earlier on Wednesday, local news outlet the Star reported that the arrest of the 54-year-old Singaporean has led to the detention of two other Singaporeans, aged 48 and 49, in connection with the case. The report, citing anonymous sources, said that all three Singaporeans were businessmen in car-dealing operations.  Police were also looking for a Malaysian involved in the case, according to the Star.   The Malaysian was reportedly employed by the money changer for eight years before he absconded with the money on Mar 2, 2020.  Quoting sources, the Star said the man was tasked with transporting the money to the bank but fled with the cash in a company vehicle.  He then met the Singaporeans at Danga Bay and split the loot with them, before abandoning the company car.  CNA has approached Johor police’s commercial crime investigation department for more details on the arrests. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/hiv-risk-transmission-man-did-not-inform-sexual-partner-jail-2732376,HIV-positive man gets jail for not telling sexual partner about risk of infection,"SINGAPORE: A 48-year-old man was on Tuesday (Jun 7) sentenced to a year's jail for not informing his sexual partner that he was HIV positive. The offender cannot be named due to a gag order. He was a public relations consultant at the time of the offence, and the victim was in his 20s. The man was diagnosed with HIV in July 2017 and interviewed by a National Centre for Infectious Diseases official, who told him that he was required to inform sexual partners of his status regardless of his viral load and his perceived risk to others. He pleaded guilty last week to one charge under the Infectious Diseases Act. Another charge for the same offence against a different victim was considered for sentencing. On Apr 23, 2021, the man offered the victim a ride home from work in a private-hire vehicle that he booked. During the journey, both men decided to go to the offender's home instead. They engaged in unprotected sex in the victim's room after initial resistance from the victim. Before this, the offender did not inform the victim of the risk of contracting HIV from him and did not obtain his voluntary agreement to accept that risk, said Ministry of Health (MOH) prosecutor Andre Moses Tan. The offence was discovered on Sep 30, 2021, when an unidentified informant reported to authorities that the victim claimed he had been sexually assaulted by the offender. At the time, the offender was already under investigation for having sex with another man on Oct 10, 2019, without informing him of the risk of contracting HIV. The man was charged for that earlier offence on Oct 14, 2021, and it formed the charge taken into consideration. A test of the man's HIV viral load in January 2021 indicated that it was ""not detected"", while another test in July 2021 indicated that it was ""borderline"" with less than 20 copies per millilitre, stated court documents. According to a memo from a National University Hospital doctor cited in court documents, there was no difference between a ""borderline"" and ""not detected"" viral load. The doctor also said that ""there was effectively no risk of transmission of HIV from a person with an undetectable viral load to a sexual partner"", stated court documents. No report on the man's viral load at the time of the offence in April 2021 was available.  However, apart from the July 2021 result, his viral load consistently tested as ""not detected"" in tests taken every six months from November 2017 to January this year. It was therefore accepted that his viral load was likely to be ""not detected"" or ""borderline"" at the time of the offence, stated court documents. The prosecution asked for two years' jail, noting that ""the risk of transmission is low as the accused's undetectable viral load means that there was effectively zero risk of transmission"". However, the offender did not inform the victim that he was HIV positive, exposed two different victims to the risk of transmission of HIV and also reoffended while under investigation, said Mr Tan. ""While the accused did not use a condom when he engaged in sexual activity with the victim, we accept that this is mitigated by the fact that there was effectively no risk of transmission,"" said the prosecutor. Defence lawyer Sunil Sudheesan sought a high fine with no jail time, arguing that his client was unable to transmit HIV during the offences. The man had consumed alcohol before the offence, including one bottle of vodka, which clouded his judgment, added the lawyer. ""Our client did not disclose any risk of transmission to the victims only because he knew that there was no risk of transmission at all,"" argued Mr Sudheesan.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/yuk-tung-energy-north-korea-vessel-gasoil-un-sanctions-2732316,Jail for company director who obstructed investigations into suspected gasoil supply to North Korea,"SINGAPORE: A company director was on Tuesday (Jun 7) sentenced to 15 weeks' jail for obstructing investigations into his firm's suspected illegal supply of gasoil to a North Korean vessel. Manfred Low Cheng Jing, 31, was the director of Singapore-incorporated Yuk Tung Energy, an oil trading and bunkering company. In January or February 2018, he disposed of an iMac that he knew contained information relevant to police investigations into Yuk Tung Energy. The Singaporean pleaded guilty to one charge of intentionally obstructing the course of justice, with another similar charge considered for sentencing. Under international law, Singapore must implement United Nations Security Council (UNSC) sanctions and resolutions against North Korea to counter its nuclear weapons programme. Singapore has enacted domestic laws in the form of the UN Act and UN (Sanctions - Democratic People's Republic of Korea) Regulations to do so. UNSC resolutions prohibit the facilitation or engagement of ship-to-ship transfers of all refined petroleum products with North Korean-flagged vessels. In early 2018, local and international media reported on a suspected ship-to-ship transfer of gasoil from MT Yuk Tung to North Korean-flagged vessel Rye Song Gang 1 on Jan 20, 2018. There was a commercial arrangement for Yuk Tung Energy to charter MT Yuk Tung. The vessel was owned by another Cook Islands-incorporated company. On or before Jan 25, 2018, Low learnt about the news reports. He travelled to Kuala Lumpur on Jan 25, 2018. A day later, the Singapore Police Force's Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) received information about Yuk Tung Energy's suspected involvement and started investigations. Low's job at the firm included printing out and tallying invoices related to its business dealings. He also reviewed contracts and explained their contents to Benito Aloria Yap, another company director. Yap was the ""key decision-maker"" of Yuk Tung Energy, said Deputy Public Prosecutors Tan Ben Mathias, Regina Lim, Koh Mun Keong and Samuel Chew. He is still at large. Shortly after the news reports came out, Yap went to the company's offices to remove all physical documents, which were packed into boxes and placed in a car. He instructed an employee to remove a computer used by a shipping executive to process bank documents, payment vouchers, bills and claims. Yap also instructed that Low's iMac, which was used in Yuk Tung Energy's day-to-day operations, be removed. The iMac was taken to Low's home and he later disposed of it in an unknown dumpster in Singapore. It has not been recovered. CAD raided Yuk Tung Energy's offices on Feb 2, 2018. They did not find the iMac, nor the shipping executive's computer. A day after the raid, Low and other employees were in Johor Bahru with the owner of the Cook Islands-incorporated company that owned MT Yuk Tung. They met Yap there to discuss how to respond to the news reports. On Feb 13, 2018, the Singapore Government received a request from the United Nations Panel of Experts for an explanation for the ship-to-ship transfer between MT Yuk Tung and Rye Song Gang 1. The panel also sought other information, including the type and amount of petroleum product transferred to Rye Song Gang 1, the identities of the North Korean points of contact, and copies of documents related to the transaction. When Low got rid of the iMac, he was aware of the news reports flagging Yuk Tung Energy's suspected role in the alleged ship-to-ship transfer and contemplated that police would investigate the firm. He was also aware that the iMac contained information about Yuk Tung Energy that would be relevant to polices investigations, said prosecutors. Low was afraid that the police would find incriminating evidence as he ""knew that Yuk Tung Energy's business operations were shady"", they said. CAD was able to obtain some information and documents about Yuk Tung Energy's operations, including spreadsheets detailing the company's oil sales report. However, Low's disposal of the iMac frustrated CAD's ability to fully investigate the company's alleged sanction violations and those criminally responsible, said prosecutors. Low also lied to investigators that his mobile phone and laptop were destroyed when a car ran over his bag in January 2018. He later admitted that he had thrown away his phone, which contained information relevant to investigations. This formed the charge taken into consideration. MT Yuk Tung and Yuk Tung Energy were added to the UN sanctions list on Mar 30, 2018, making them subject to sanctions under Singapore's domestic laws. According to a Ministry of Foreign Affairs impact statement cited in court documents, Low's actions had a negative impact on Singapore's international reputation. ""The offence frustrated the Singapore authorities' ability to complete its investigations into the potential violation of the longstanding sanctions against the DPRK as required under international law,"" court documents stated. It also subjected Singapore to ""international scrutiny and criticism"" and ""raised questions from our international partners"" about the country's commitment to upholding its international obligations. The offence cast ""a negative light on Singapore's reputation as a clean, trusted, and law-abiding jurisdiction for legitimate commercial activity"", stated court documents. The designation of Yuk Tung Energy in the UN sanctions list also increased risks for Singapore's economic and financial sectors by impacting how other local companies are perceived in the global market. The prosecution sought three months to five months' jail, arguing that Low shielded not only himself but Yuk Tung Energy and other company officers from potential criminal liability. Prosecutors highlighted the ""substantial harm"" dealt to Singapore's international standing and reputation through Low's actions. The CAD's inability to fully investigate the suspected sanctions violation ""increases the perception that Singapore was derelict in complying with its international obligations"", they said. ""There had been significant international attention on the DPRK launching various missiles, projectiles, rockets and artillery shells, with at least 70 reported incidents from December 2010 and February 2018. ""The importance for Singapore to fully investigate and take actions against suspected contraventions of the UN DPRK Regulations - which are essential to counter the DPRK's nuclear activities - cannot be overstated."" Prosecutors also argued that Low's actions were premeditated, and that he persisted in being evasive after disposing of his electronic devices. Defence lawyer Diana Ngiam asked for around three months' jail, arguing that her client had acted impulsively and disposed of the iMac before he knew of any impending raid or investigations by CAD. She said her client ""did not know that Yuk Tung Energy's operations were shady to the extent that the operations may involve potential breaches under the DPRK Regulations"". ""It must be emphasised that our client was a young adult who had joined Yuk Tung Energy to learn the ropes of the oil trading trade from Benito Yap,"" said Ms Ngiam. Those guilty of obstructing the court of justice can be jailed up to seven years, fined or both."

The man cannot be named as it could lead to the identification of the victim, who is protected by a gag order. She is in her early 20s. He pleaded guilty to one count of threatening to distribute intimate images and recordings of the woman without her consent. The pair were in a relationship from 2018 to 2021. The victim had been lending the man money to repay his debts and continued to do so after they broke up in January last year. In July last year, the man agreed to gradually repay the victim in monthly instalments. According to her, he owed more than S$12,700 as of December last year. On Dec 10, 2021, the victim sent the offender a text message regarding payment for the month, which he had not made. They started arguing and the man said he would not repay the victim from then on. He said if the victim posted about him online, he would also make an online post about her and threatened to upload images and recordings that showed her nude and partially nude. He then sent her two recordings of her in the shower and seven images of her in her underwear. The victim's face could be seen in the recordings and some of the images. The man said that the victim had willingly lent him money and whether he wanted to return it was ""his business"", court documents stated. The victim was shocked to see the images and recordings, which had been taken without her consent. During their relationship, the man had entered the toilet once or twice while the victim was showering and waved his phone around, but the victim had told him not to take any photos. The woman felt afraid and distressed as she believed her ex-boyfriend would act on his threat, court documents stated. She made a police report that evening. After a few days, the man deleted the images and recordings. When police later screened his electronic devices, one of the images was found on his phone. He had not uploaded any of the materials online. The prosecution asked for three to four months' jail, arguing that the man committed the offence out of malice and that it was an attempt to blackmail the victim into giving up her debt claims. The man could have been jailed for up to five years, fined, caned or any combination of these punishments."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/airbnb-homeaway-subletting-short-term-stays-fine-court-real-estate-agent-2731666,"Why a former real estate agent was fined less than the S$1.25m revenue for subletting apartments on Airbnb, HomeAway","SINGAPORE: Last Monday (May 30), a former real estate agent was fined about S$1.16 million for a subletting scheme that drew a revenue of more than S$1.25 million. Simon Chan Chai Wan, 57, pleaded to nine charges under the Planning Act after providing short-term accommodation on platforms such as Airbnb and HomeAway. His girlfriend Zhao Jing was fined S$84,000 for helping him in the scheme. The fine handed to Chan was the largest amount given to a person in Singapore for such offences. Under URA regulations, a minimum stay of three consecutive months applies to all private residential properties rented out for accommodation purposes As part of the scheme, Chan rented out 14 properties – two under Zhao and the others under companies HTM Solutions, HTM Management and SNS Infotech Global – between Jun 30, 2017 and July 2018. The couple took turns being directors of HTM Solutions and HTM Management for periods of time between 2016 and 2018, and Chan was also the former director of SNS Infotech Global. The properties were mainly in prime areas of Singapore, including Orchard Road, River Valley, Tanjong Pagar and Keppel Bay. When he rented the properties from the owners, he did not tell them he would sublet them out. The scheme pulled in S$1,254,907.78 over 13 months – a monthly average of more than S$96,500. Chan pleaded guilty to nine charges under the Planning Act, with five remaining charges taken into consideration. Each charge was related to a unit that he leased. Under the Act, Chan was liable to a fine of up to S$200,000 per charge as a first-time offender. In sentencing, District Judge Lau Qiuyu said she was guided by a similar case in the High Court in 2020. In that case, a former real estate agent was also fined for a similar scheme, but on a much smaller scale. She explained that the fine comprises two parts – a disgorgement component and a punitive component. The disgorgement component refers to the repayment of ill-gotten gains, and the punitive component is the punishment. In her judgment, the judge set out with the premise, as with the previous case, that the ""entire revenue represents the offender’s profits"", and the court will only permit a deduction for “necessary expenses”. This is defined as expenses that enabled the offender to commit the offence. The defence asked for the following amounts to be deducted: The prosecution and the court agreed that rental payments and stamp duties should be deducted as “necessary expenses”. They also agreed that the payments totalling S$52,000 paid to Zhao was also such an expense, even though the defence did not claim it. But the court and prosecution disagreed with the defence regarding the other costs. In some cases, not enough evidence was produced, and the court ruled that the other expenses were not necessary. In considering the punitive component, the judge deemed the level of harm in this case to be “slight”, as there was no evidence of “tangible or appreciable harm or loss caused”. But Chan's culpability was deemed to be in the “medium” category – he was primarily motivated by profit and the duration of the offences was “fairly sustained”. “The business model in this case was fairly sophisticated … Chan did not own any of the properties that were leased for short-term accommodation,” said the judge, adding that this business model was self-funding with high returns. His guilty plea and cooperation with the authorities were also taken into consideration for the punitive component of the fine. CHAN'S S$1.158 MILLION FINE: The judge said the individual sentences and aggregate punitive fine imposed on Chan were “neither unreasonable nor excessive”. If he did not pay the fine, he would have to serve 95 weeks in prison in default. Zhao helped Chan set up and manage host accounts on the Airbnb platform and post listings advertising the units for short-term stays. Two of the 14 units were also rented under her name. She managed reservations by guests, answered queries and updated the calendar, court documents showed. Zhao was paid S$4,000 a month by Chan – a total of S$52,000 over 13 months. She was fined the entire S$52,000 as part of the disgorgement component. For the punitive component, her level of harm was deemed “slight”, and her level of culpability “low”. Her guilty plea and cooperation with the authorities were taken into account, and the judge ordered a fine of S$84,000 for her. If she did not pay the fine, she would have to serve 12 weeks in prison in default. ZHAO'S S$84,000 FINE:"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/grab-food-delivery-cyclist-hit-elderly-man-void-deck-jail-2729636,Grab delivery cyclist who hit elderly man at void deck gets jail,"SINGAPORE: A man was sentenced to three days' jail on Monday (Jun 6) for hitting an elderly man with his bicycle at a void deck at Bedok Reservoir. Shaikh Mohamad Irsyaad Shaikh Mohamed Ibrahim, 26, was a Grab food delivery rider at the time of the incident. He has since changed jobs. He pleaded guilty to one charge of causing grievous hurt by a negligent act that endangered human life. The court heard that Irsyaad started making deliveries in the morning of Oct 5, 2020 and stationed himself at a McDonald's in Bedok Reservoir. At about 5.50pm, he was cycling back after a delivery and rode his bicycle along the car park of Block 604, Bedok Reservoir Road. He entered the footway of the block and rode into the void deck. At the same time, the 70-year-old victim was collecting mail from his letter box. After collecting his letters, the victim turned to head towards the lift and was at the edge of the letter box area when he appeared at Irsyaad's right side. Irsyaad failed to exercise due care and was about to cut in between the letter box area and the void deck's seating area at fast speed, stated court documents. Upon seeing the victim, he jammed his brakes but was unable to stop his bicycle in time and collided into the victim. The victim did not have time to react and was already hit by the time he noticed the cyclist, stated court documents. Upon impact, both Irsyaad and the victim fell to the ground. The victim broke his fall with his right hand. Irsyaad and the victim both called the police for assistance, and Isryaad waited for the police to arrive. The victim was taken to the hospital and was found to have fractured his right wrist. He also suffered tenderness, bruising and abrasions on various parts of his body. He was given a total of 38 days' medical leave. Isryaad did not sustain any injuries. Although there was a police camera at the block, it did not capture the incident as it took place in a blind spot. Deputy Public Prosecutor Heershan Kaur asked for a short jail sentence, noting that the void deck had a ""no cycling"" sign. She highlighted that the incident took place during peak hour on a weekday, when there was a reasonable expectation that people would be returning home from work. ""The letter box area and the lift landing are common spaces that are often used by residents of the housing estate where the accused person should have taken extra care and precaution,"" she said. Ms Kaur also highlighted the victim's vulnerability as an elderly person who would take longer to recover from his injuries. However, she noted that Irsyaad had waited for the police to arrive after the collision, and that the victim did not suffer any permanent injuries. She also acknowledged that Irsyaad made restitution of about S$258 to the victim for his medical fees, pleaded guilty at the first opportunity and was a first-time offender. Irsyaad, who was not represented, told the court he was sorry and asked for a fine instead of imprisonment. He said he had been performing deliveries for two years without incident prior to the collision. He said he was also supporting his family with his income from his new job. The judge said there was a need to deter similar offences given the recent prevalence of incidents involving bicycles and personal mobility devices with pedestrians. ""This has to stop,"" said District Judge Shaiffudin Saruwan. ""The court cannot relent on this, we have to show that we will take a very strict view of such offences."" The judge granted Irsyaad's request to defer his jail sentence to a later starting date in order to settle work matters. He could have been jailed up to two years, fined up to S$5,000 or both for his offence."

Sooraj Selvaraj pleaded guilty to disposing of the items at Defu Lane 1 in Hougang during a job, the National Environment Agency (NEA) said on Monday (Jun 6). The case was heard in court on Thursday. Investigations revealed that Sooraj had been on assignment to transport a client’s unwanted furniture and household items to a recycling facility. The items included a dismantled wooden wardrobe and carton boxes containing hardcover binders and papers. “However, the recycling facility was closed when he arrived,” NEA said.  “Out of convenience, Mr Sooraj instructed his workers to offload the lorry-load of waste at a secluded alley along Defu Lane 1, while he kept a lookout for passers-by and vehicles.” Sooraj, a first-time offender, was convicted of one charge and sentenced to a court fine. First-time offenders could be liable on conviction to a fine of up to S$50,000, or a jail term of up to a year. Repeat offenders could be fined up to S$100,000 and jailed for at least one month and up to a year. NEA said the illegal disposal of waste “poses environmental and public health risks, and is a blight on public spaces”. It added that it will not hesitate to take strict enforcement action against those who illegally dispose of waste. Members of the public can report suspected cases of illegal disposal to NEA through their online feedback form or the myENV mobile application. They may also contact NEA at 6225 5632."

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/leak-sensitive-information-covid19-circuit-breaker-sfa-pa-2725676,Former PA at Singapore Food Agency jailed for leaking sensitive information about circuit breaker,"SINGAPORE: A former public servant has been jailed for six weeks for leaking draft documents detailing COVID-19 ""circuit breaker"" measures to her husband, who sent the information on to others. Noorain Jubli, 39, was then the personal assistant to the director-general of the Singapore Food Agency (SFA). She was sentenced on Friday (Jun 3) after pleading guilty to one charge of disclosing confidential information under the SFA Act. Another charge was considered for sentencing. Her husband Khairul Annuar Zakaria, 40, was fined S$2,000 after pleading guilty to one charge of abetting Noorain's disclosure of confidential information under the SFA Act. Khairul was then working as a technical officer. The couple have two children, who were aged four and nine at the time. The leak took place on Apr 3, 2020, about seven hours before the information was officially announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in a nationally televised address. The court heard that Noorain was bound by an undertaking to safeguard official information when she committed the offences. Her security clearance gave her access to two folders in the SFA director-general's email account, although she was unable to open secure emails. At about 9am on Apr 3, 2020, Noorain opened an email sent to the director-general that contained three attachments: A draft joint media statement by the Education Ministry and Social and Family Development Ministry on school closures, a draft Health Ministry press release on circuit breaker measures, and a draft Trade and Industry Ministry public guidance on suspension of workplace activities. She read the attachments and immediately used her phone to take a photo of two paragraphs in the draft joint MOE-MSF media statement on school closures. This portion of the draft media statement included references to other efforts to enhance safe distancing measures and further limit social interactions. Noorain sent the photo to her husband via WhatsApp, despite knowing that she was not supposed to do so, said Deputy Public Prosecutors Joshua Lim, Selene Yap and Lim Shin Hui. She told Khairul that the information captured in the photo was confidential and told him not to share it with anyone. She also informed him that she had seen a list of essential services that would continue operating during the circuit breaker, which was in the draft MTI public guidance. Khairul was made aware of the impending circuit breaker from Noorain, who knew about it from the draft MOH press release. When Noorain asked him about his work arrangements in light of the circuit breaker, he asked her to send him the list of essential services that would continue operating so he could check if his job was affected. Noorain took photos of the list and sent eight images to Khairul via WhatsApp despite knowing that the information was embargoed. Khairul took screenshots of the images to retain copies in his phone. After that, the couple had a short exchange over text where Noorain commented that people would ""panic buy"" once the measures were announced, and Khairul said this was ""as usual"". Noorain and Khairul therefore knew the information they had was sensitive and would cause panic buying, among other reactions, said the prosecutors. After receiving the image of the draft MOE-MSF media statement, Khairul cropped it so it would not show Noorain's laptop screen and her surroundings. He then sent it on to a WhatsApp chat group named ""Geng Shaffri"", which had 13 members. Khairul was aware at the time that the information was confidential and that the media statement was not public, said prosecutors. The information in the leaked draft media statement subsequently went viral as it continued to be disseminated by others. At about 1pm, Khairul was looking at social media during his lunch break when he saw an online article containing the image of the draft media statement. He deleted all the messages in the chat group relating to the image as one of the comments online suggested police would investigate the matter. He also told the chat group members to delete the image he had sent to them. Police were alerted to the leak at about 5.45pm on Apr 3, 2020, when a complainant reported that she received an image of the draft joint media statement at about noon that day. Investigations showed that the complainant received the image after it had been sent through 18 WhatsApp chats, and that she was not acquainted with Khairul. The prosecution called for 10 weeks to 12 weeks' jail for Noorain, arguing that public agencies had to redirect valuable resources from the fight against COVID-19 to deal with the leak. They also cited the widespread economic implications of leaking sensitive information on the school closures and essential services. The prosecutors said it was essential that sensitive information was released in a manner that prevented panic among members of the public. They also argued that there was a need to uphold public confidence in public servants as guardians of confidential and sensitive information. Defence lawyers Abdul Wahab Saul Hamid and Muhammad Hasif asked for not more than two weeks' jail for Noorain, highlighting that she was a first-time offender. They argued that she was motivated by concerns for her husband's job security and her children's education arrangements. Senior District Judge Bala Reddy said the leak of the embargoed and sensitive information ""had the potential to prejudice the interests of the state in its fight against the COVID-19 pandemic by causing confusion and panic in the population"". However, he noted that Noorain's offence involved the disclosure of the contents of a single email to one person, her husband, and that it was Khairul who was responsible for the onward transmission to others. SFA said last year that Noorain was suspended from her duties in April 2020. Noorain and Khairul could have been jailed for up to a year, fined up to S$2,000 or both for each charge."

The fake online articles claimed the trading programs generated ""massive profits"" and also portrayed the investments as ""highly lucrative"", added the police.  These online articles are usually paid online advertisements that act as ""clickbait"". When someone clicks on a link within the article, they will eventually be taken to a different website, offering investments through the trading of cryptocurrency or other financial products.  Those who provided contact details on the website would usually receive a call from someone from the scheme, said the police. Members of the public were strongly advised to be cautious when making investment decisions.  In April this year, the police issued a similar advisory on fake online articles showing Mr Lee purportedly endorsing investment in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. ""The police would like to inform the public not to deal with such companies that use false or misleading advertisements,"" they said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/agritrade-international-cfo-lulu-lim-beng-kim-four-counts-37-charges-2724876,Former Agritrade International CFO allegedly involved in multi-million dollar cheating case given 4 more charges,"SINGAPORE: The former chief financial officer of commodity firm Agritrade International who is accused of cheating financial institutions in a multi-million dollar case has been handed four additional charges on Friday (Jun 3). Lulu Lim Beng Kim now faces a total of 37 charges, police said in a news release. One charge relates to Lim allegedly deceiving a financial institution into believing that the consolidated financial statements for Agritrade International and its subsidiary companies for the year 2018 were audited, ""a fact which she knew to be false"", said police.  She is believed to have dishonestly induced the financial institution to deliver money through a credit facility to the company.  ""The total sum involved in the charge is up to US$24.5 million in drawdowns from the credit facility,"" said police.  The remaining three charges relate to Lim allegedly abetting the making of false entries in accounts belonging to Agritrade International. She is believed to have instructed an employee to make false entries in the firm’s management accounts on Jun 30, 2017, Jun 30, 2018 and Dec 31, 2018. In March 2020, Reuters reported that at least 20 banks had accused Agritrade International of fraud. The banks included United Overseas Bank and Malaysia’s Maybank, which were said to be owed nearly US$108 million each. Lim was first charged last September with cheating and dishonestly inducing a delivery of property.  In January this year, she was given an additional six counts of cheating, for allegedly deceiving three financial institutions of US$475 million. Three months ago, she was handed yet more charges, this time involving US$245.5 million. The offence of cheating and dishonestly inducing a delivery of property carries an imprisonment term of up to 10 years and a fine. For falsification of accounts, those convicted may be jailed up to 10 years, fined, or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-swinging-couple-girlfriend-sex-video-jail-2724636,Man gets jail for sending intimate video of girlfriend to couple he met on swinging app,"SINGAPORE: A 23-year-old man was on Thursday (Jun 2) sentenced to five weeks' jail for sending a video of his girlfriend having sex with him to a couple he met on a swinging app. He was also fined S$1,000 for possessing another obscene video of his girlfriend. He pleaded guilty to both charges, and a third charge of having three obscene images was considered for sentencing. The man cannot be named as it could lead to identification of the victim, who is protected by gag order. The court heard that he first came across an app for couples to exchange sexual partners or engage in threesomes between February and March 2020. He matched with another couple through the app, and they continued their conversation on Telegram. He initially contacted the other couple using his own Telegram account, but later also contacted them while identifying himself as his girlfriend, using an account he had created. On Jun 18, 2020, while impersonating his girlfriend, the man sent the other couple a video of him and the then 20-year-old victim having sex at a staircase landing. The victim was identifiable in the video, which captured the lower half of her body exposed. The video was filmed with her consent, but she had asked the offender not to send it to anyone else. The victim only found out that the video had been sent to others when the man, who was part of the other couple, contacted her on Twitter and asked her about it.  Upon learning that the video had been distributed to others, the victim felt distressed, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Melissa Heng. Additionally, the woman who was part of the other couple had sent explicit photos and videos to both Telegram accounts used by the offender. This was because she was under the impression that she was exchanging explicit content with both the offender and the victim, said the prosecutor. The victim lodged a police report on Sep 2, 2020. The offender's phone was seized, and an obscene screen recording of a video call between him and the victim was discovered during investigations. The prosecution sought five to six weeks' jail and a fine of S$1,000 to S$2,000, arguing that the sexual acts shown in the video would cause more harm to the victim than the offender. Ms Heng also highlighted the offender's breach of his girlfriend's trust, and his motive of gaining the trust of the other couple, which led to the woman sending him explicit content. She acknowledged that there was no malice in the offender's actions, and that the video was not uploaded on a public platform. Defence lawyer Mervyn Foo asked for a similar sentence, saying that his client was a ""sensible boy"" who offended in a ""moment of folly"" due to his immaturity and poor impulse control. He argued that the offender and victim had agreed to experiment with swinging and that the offender sent the video to a couple with whom he believed the victim would be open to exploring sexual relations. He said that his client had apologised to the victim and her family when they confronted him before a police report was made. He later also wrote her an apology letter. For the obscene video found in his client's phone, Mr Foo argued that this was intended for personal gratification only and that there was no commercial element to it. The lawyer said this was his client's first brush with the law, and he was pleading guilty at the earliest opportunity. The penalty for intentionally distributing an intimate recording of a person without their consent, while having reason to believe this would cause them distress, is up to five years' jail, a fine, caning or any combination of these. The offence of possessing an obscene film is punishable with up to six months' jail, a fine of up to S$20,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/geylang-knife-slashing-hin-sheng-coffee-house-man-charged-2724681,Man charged with slashing at Geylang coffee shop,"SINGAPORE: A man was charged on Friday (Jun 3) with slashing another man at a coffee shop in Geylang. Lee Han Leng, 45, was given one count of voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means. He is accused of slashing Koh Hee Yang's head and body with a knife at about 4.40pm on Wednesday at Hin Sheng Coffee House at 346 Geylang Road, according to charge sheets. He has been remanded at the Institute of Mental Health for psychiatric observation and will return to court later this month. Police earlier said that they received two calls for assistance near Lorong 18 Geylang on Wednesday at about 4.40pm. Upon arrival, they found a 21-year-old man with lacerations on his neck and head. He was conscious when taken to the hospital. It was established that the 45-year-old man had fled prior to the arrival of the police. Through investigations and with the aid of images from police and closed-circuit television cameras, the police established the assailant's identity and arrested him. Those convicted of voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means can be jailed for up to seven years, fined, caned or any combination of these punishments."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/niki-han-nimisski-fine-not-wearing-face-mask-live-stream-2722826,Far East Plaza boutique owner fined for not wearing mask on live streams,"SINGAPORE: A boutique owner who repeatedly did not wear a mask while live-streaming from her shop in Far East Plaza was fined S$3,000 on Thursday (Jun 2). Niki Han Jiayi, 34, pleaded guilty to three counts of failing to wear a mask while outside her home. Another 18 similar charges were considered for sentencing. Han was working at her fashion store Nimisski on all 21 occasions detailed in the charges, which took place between Sep 20, 2020 and Oct 21, 2020. The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) was alerted to the offences by an information report. Court documents did not state who the informant was. STB then carried out online checks of certain Facebook Live videos streamed from Han's shop to promote goods sold in the store. In the videos, Han was seen in the background talking to customers while not wearing a mask on the three occasions in the proceeded charges. On one of these occasions, she was also seen modelling a dress and verbally promoting it without a mask on. The prosecution asked for a fine, and noted that Han had an unrelated prior conviction for possessing counterfeit goods in 2018. Han's defence lawyer asked the court to consider her medical condition of sinusitis, which caused her to have a dry throat and runny nose during the live streams. The lawyer said this was why Han removed her mask, although she should not have done so nor interacted with customers without a mask on. For each count of failing to wear a mask when not in her ordinary place of residence without a reasonable excuse, Han could have been jailed up to six months, fined up to S$10,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-molest-junior-colleague-chalet-party-jail-2722546,Man gets jail for molesting junior colleague after chalet party,"SINGAPORE: A man was sentenced to one year and three months' jail on Thursday (Jun 2) for molesting his junior colleague after a work party at a chalet in 2018. He was found guilty last month after claiming trial to one charge of using criminal force to outrage the woman's modesty. The man has filed an appeal against the conviction and sentence. He cannot be named as this could lead to identification of the victim, whose identity is protected by gag order. The victim, who was in her early 20s, joined the company less than a month before the incident. She worked in the same team as the offender, who is now 50. In 2018, the company held a party at a chalet that started in the late afternoon and went on until around midnight. Those at the party were allowed to stay overnight if they wanted, and several remained to chat after the party had ended. The victim, who had drunk alcohol, fell asleep on a couch around 11pm. Another person there then helped her upstairs to rest in one of the bedrooms. The prosecution's case is that sometime that night, the offender entered the room while the victim was sleeping, kissed her and squeezed her chest. According to documents from the prosecution, during the trial, the victim testified that the next thing she remembered after falling asleep was someone asking if she was okay. She mumbled and fell back asleep. She then felt many light touches around her upper body, but did not know who was touching her as she did not open her eyes to check. She turned her head and saw another colleague, identified as PW1 in court documents, prop herself up in the next bed. She heard voices before falling asleep again. The victim woke up later when she felt a hand squeeze her chest ""aggressively"" while someone kissed her mouth. She opened her eyes when she realised what was happening, saw the offender for ""a brief second"" and identified him from his features. She estimated that the assault lasted for three to five minutes. She tried to push the man away but was unable to do so due to her tiredness. The assault suddenly stopped when she heard voices coming from the door. The victim said she did not tell anyone what happened that day as she was ""in shock"", because the offender had always been nice to her. She later spoke to PW1 and another colleague about the events of that night, and from what they told her, believed that he had intentionally assaulted her. She decided to report the matter to the police and her human resources department. At trial, both colleagues testified as prosecution witnesses. PW1 gave evidence that she was resting in another bed in the same room as the victim that night. She said that she saw the offender in the room, sitting on the victim's bed and leaning close to her, and heard a noise that sounded like kissing. PW1 felt shocked and frightened, and pretended to wake up by pushing herself up from the bed. She said that the offender sat up quickly and spoke to her briefly before leaving the room. She then went downstairs to look for others to help her get the victim home. She and two other colleagues went back upstairs to the room. PW1 testified that when they entered, she saw the offender sitting on the victim's bed. He stood up very quickly and walked out of the room. During the trial, the offender denied committing the offences, and said that he had only entered the room for innocuous reasons. He claimed that he had climbed into the bed the victim was in to sleep off a dizzy spell. He denied knowing who was in the bed, and said that he only touched the other person on the hip or shoulder to try and make space for himself. The man could have been jailed up to two years, fined or both for using criminal force to outrage a person's modesty. He cannot be caned as he is 50."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/restaurant-manager-flee-7-years-steal-bornga-korean-2722376,"Jail for ex-Bornga employee who was on the run for 7 years after stealing S$32,000","SINGAPORE: A manager of a Korean restaurant was given a chance to repay sales proceeds he had stolen after his actions were discovered. Instead, he continued stealing and eventually pocketed a total of almost S$32,000. When confronted again, he fled Singapore for seven years before he was arrested last year. Lim Beng Chuan, now 57, was jailed for a year on Thursday (Jun 2) after pleading guilty to one count of criminal breach of trust by an employee. At the time of the offence in 2014, he worked as a manager at Bornga restaurant in The Star Vista. The eatery has since closed down. As the restaurant's manager, Lim was entrusted with monitoring and collecting sales proceeds, and depositing them in the eatery's bank account three times a week. On Mar 11, 2014, the director of the restaurant discovered that Lim had not been depositing sales proceeds in the account since Feb 19, 2014. During that period, Lim pocketed about S$25,000 worth of sales proceeds in cash. When confronted, he admitted to taking the money and claimed that his brother had financial difficulties. The director decided to give Lim until the end of March to repay the money. He continued to work in the restaurant, and to be entrusted with depositing the sales proceeds on a daily basis. Lim was also tasked with showing the director documentary evidence of the daily deposits. However, the director later discovered that Lim had again failed to deposit sales proceeds from Mar 21 to Mar 24, 2014. He had taken another S$6,800 in cash during this period. When confronted on Mar 24, 2014, Lim again admitted to taking the money to settle his personal problems. The restaurant director called the police on Mar 26, 2014 to report that Lim had pocketed sales proceeds and that he suspected Lim was leaving the country. Lim fled to Malaysia that night, after another confrontation with the director. He remained on the run for more than seven years, until he was arrested at Chinatown MRT station on Dec 14 last year. Deputy Public Prosecutor Sivanathan Jheevanesh sought 10 to 12 months' jail, citing Lim's absconding as a key aggravating factor. He also argued that Lim betrayed the high degree of trust placed in him as restaurant manager. In mitigation, defence lawyer Rajan Supramaniam highlighted that his client made full restitution of the stolen money. When District Judge Bala Reddy asked why Lim ran away for several years, his lawyer said he was in a ""panic state"" because of personal financial issues. Lim has prior convictions for theft, cheating and criminal breach of trust, but the prosecution argued that these should not weigh significantly on the sentence as his last offence was committed a decade before the present one. He could have been jailed up to 15 years and fined for committing criminal breach of trust as an employee."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/two-french-bulldogs-left-car-boot-die-heat-stress-animal-trainer-fined-2720346,Dog trainer fined after two French bulldogs left in car boot die of heat stress,"SINGAPORE: A dog trainer was on Wednesday (Jun 1) fined S$8,000 for leaving two French bulldogs in her car boot for one-and-a-half hours, causing their deaths from heat stress. Sabrina Sim Xin Huey, 30, was also banned from running any animal-related business for a period of six months. She has filed an appeal against the ban, which will not come into effect until the appeal is decided. District Judge Carol Ling said she did not disagree with the defence that ""forgetting is human error"". But ""the fact is, outcomes matter"", she said. ""Even if the accused was lacking in intent, the severity of harm ... caused by the accused's actions was high and cannot be downplayed,"" said the judge. The two dogs, named Chocoby and Hunniby, were imported by their owner from Australia to Singapore. Sim, who has been a dog trainer since 2014, was engaged to train them. The arrangement involved the dogs staying with her during the entire training period. On Aug 25, 2020, Sim finished a training session, placed the two dogs in the boot of her hatchback and drove home. She reached home at about 2.30pm and parked, turning off the engine and air-conditioning. The windows were wound up and the car was parked in an unsheltered spot in the open-air car park. As Sim exited the car, she was distracted by a social media post and forgot to let the bulldogs out of the car. She closed the car door, leaving both dogs in her car boot, and went up to her apartment. At 4pm, about one-and-a-half hours later, Sim realised she had left the dogs in the boot. She immediately ran to the car and found both dogs unresponsive. She took them to a nearby veterinary clinic, but they were both dead by the time they arrived. A post-mortem examination found that Chocoby had been in a stressful state prior to its death with increased turnover of red blood cells. Sim pleaded guilty in May to one charge of failing to take reasonable steps to ensure that Chocoby was not confined in a manner that subjected it to unnecessary pain and suffering. Another similar charge involving Hunniby was considered for sentencing. National Parks Board prosecutor Andy Dinesh previously told the court that there was a need to maintain high industry standards for accredited dog trainers. As a professional dog trainer, Sim could have adopted a standard operating procedure to check her parked car before leaving, he said. He added that it was important to deter such conduct among pet owners as Singapore is a tropical country with high vehicle ownership. Defence lawyer Clement Julien Tan previously argued that since the offence, Sim had gone on to train more than 40 dogs without incident, receiving positive reviews for her work. Pet owners continued to seek Sim out and place their trust in her even though they were aware of the incident, Mr Tan argued. He also highlighted that dog training was her livelihood and that she was supporting her elderly parents on her income. In sentencing, Judge Ling noted that this was Sim's first brush with the law, and that there was no evidence of recklessness or risk-taking on her part. Sim's conduct showed that she was genuinely sorry for what had happened, and she took steps to compensate the dogs' owner in a confidential settlement, said the judge. Judge Ling said that while this meant a jail term was not warranted, a ban was still necessary to meet the objective of deterring other potential offenders. As an accredited dog trainer, the duty of care expected of Sim was higher than that of a regular person in charge of a dog, said the judge. The sentence underscored the greater responsibility borne by animal-related businesses to provide care to animals, she added. The punishment for failing to take reasonable steps to ensure that an animal is not confined in a manner that subjects it to unnecessary pain and suffering is jail for up to two years, a fine of up to S$40,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/reticulated-pythons-euthanise-illegal-smuggling-fine-2720131,"Driver fined, 2 reticulated pythons euthanised after illegal smuggling","SINGAPORE: A driver was fined S$5,000 on Wednesday (Jun 1) for smuggling two reticulated pythons into Singapore through Tuas Checkpoint. The two pythons were euthanised after they were found to have severe, chronic and irreversible health conditions. Pulenthiran Palaniappan, 51, was sentenced after pleading guilty to one count of importing a protected species without a permit. Two more charges of failing to take reasonable steps to ensure the pythons were not transported in a safe manner were considered for sentencing. The reptiles were seized on Apr 7 by Immigration and Checkpoints Authority officers who inspected a Malaysia-registered container truck driven by Palaniappan. They were found hidden in cloth bundles in a Styrofoam box concealed in an overhead compartment above the driver's seat. Investigations revealed that Palaniappan agreed to help a man in Malaysia deliver the animals to an unknown recipient in Singapore. He was to be paid RM300 for the job. He collected the box containing the reptiles in Johor Bahru on Apr 7, as he intended to deliver cement to a company in Singapore that day. After the seizure at night, the pythons were brought to the Mandai Wildlife Group for health examinations the next day. A doctor with the conservation, research and veterinary department verified that both pythons had injuries associated with poor handling and environmental conditions. This led to spinal deviation, mouth inflammation and swelling of the eye in both animals. ""These were severe health conditions which were chronic and irreversible; and thus the two pythons were humanely euthanised due to welfare considerations,"" stated court documents. A National Parks Board (NParks) veterinarian also assessed that the pythons suffered from chronic diseases that could cause pain and discomfort, and that the transport conditions caused them unnecessary suffering. NParks prosecutor Ron Goh asked for the fine that was imposed, arguing that there was public interest in deterring such smuggling cases. He highlighted the substantial risk to public health from smuggling wildlife, which might contain unknown diseases, if they are not subject to quarantine or checks. Defence lawyer Dhillon Surinder Singh asked for a lower fine of S$3,500, arguing that his client, a Malaysian, was a first-time offender of poor means who had no employment during the investigations. The lawyer also argued that it was unclear whether the pythons' medical conditions were pre-existing or whether they were the result of the transport conditions, as Palaniappan did not open the box after collecting it. The judge agreed with the prosecution that a deterrent sentence was necessary. The penalty for importing a scheduled species without a permit is jail for up to two years, a fine of up to S$50,000 for each scheduled species, up to a total of S$500,000, or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/accident-man-e-bike-die-polytechnic-student-van-driver-jailed-2720021,Polytechnic student gets jail for causing e-bike rider's death in crash at Jurong West car park,"SINGAPORE: A polytechnic student was on Wednesday (Jun 1) sentenced to six weeks' jail for causing the death of a 55-year-old e-bicycle rider in a crash at a Jurong West car park. Muhammad Adham Ishak, 24, was also disqualified from driving for eight years after pleading guilty to one count of driving without due care and attention. He was only about a week into his job as a delivery driver when the collision happened on Feb 18, 2020. At about 7pm that day, Adham completed a delivery at Jurong West Avenue 1 and was going to his next delivery location in the area. He was exiting the car park of Block 537, Jurong West Avenue 1 in a van, driving on the first lane of a two-lane road. He intended to make a right turn onto the main road. At the same time, the victim was riding a power-assisted bicycle on the second lane of the two-lane road, from Adham's right side to his left. According to court documents, the victim's wife believed her husband was either on his way home or going to buy dinner for their son. As Adham drove his van forward and out onto Jurong West Avenue 1, he collided with the victim in the yellow box in front of the car park exit. The victim fell onto the road and Adham immediately alighted from the van to check on the victim, who was breathing but unresponsive. He then moved his van away from the main road of Jurong West Avenue 1 after a passerby told him it was obstructing traffic. A member of the public called the police to report the accident at about 7pm. Police officers on the scene observed that there was no in-vehicle camera in the van. There was also no Land Transport Authority or closed-circuit television camera near the accident site. The victim was taken to the hospital and admitted while comatose. A scan showed that he had head injuries and he underwent emergency surgical procedures. His condition did not improve and he died on Feb 20, 2020. An autopsy confirmed that the cause of death was a head injury. A mechanical inspection of the van in June 2020 showed that its engine, transmission, steering and braking systems as well as tyres were all in serviceable condition. The e-bicycle's tyres, steering and rear braking systems were found to be in serviceable condition during a mechanical inspection in August 2020. Its front braking system was found not to be in a serviceable condition, said court documents. The conclusion from the mechanical inspection reports was that there were no mechanical faults to the van and the e-bicycle that could have led to the accident, court documents added. Deputy Public Prosecutor Benjamin Samynathan asked for one to three months' jail and the mandatory minimum driving ban of eight years to be imposed. He argued that Adham was careless and failed to keep a proper lookout while moving into the yellow box. ""He should have done so, as he would then have seen the victim cycling from the accused’s right to his left,"" said the prosecutor. Mr Samynathan also highlighted that Adham was driving a larger vehicle, and that he should have exercised greater care near residential areas like the car park. Defence lawyer Ramesh Tiwary argued that his client suffered a ""momentary lapse of judgment"" and had immediately stopped to help the victim after the collision. Other mitigating factors were Adham's relatively young age of 22 at the time of the accident, and his cooperation with authorities. The penalty for causing death to another person by driving without due care and attention is jail for up to three years, a fine of up to S$10,000 or both, for a first-time offender."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/airbnb-homeaway-ex-real-estate-agent-sublet-rented-condo-units-2717841,How inspections at night unravelled a S$1.25 million subletting scheme on Airbnb and HomeAway,"SINGAPORE: Inspections at night at rented properties in the heart of Singapore helped unravel a former real estate agent’s scheme to sublet homes for short-term accommodation. Simon Chan Chai Wan, 57, was fined about S$1.16 million on Monday (May 30) for providing such accommodation on platforms such as Airbnb and HomeAway. His girlfriend Zhao Jing, 43, was fined S$84,000 for helping him in the scheme by renting two properties and managing the online accounts. The fine given to Chan was the largest amount handed out to a person in Singapore for such offences, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) said on Monday. Chan rented out 14 properties – two under Zhao and the remaining under companies HTM Solutions, HTM Management and SNS Infotech Global – between Jun 30, 2017 and July 2018. They were directors of HTM Solutions and HTM Management for certain periods between 2016 and 2018, and Chan was also the former director of SNS Infotech Global. Chan chose properties in the central areas of Singapore – River Valley and Orchard Road – as well as Keppel Bay, Tanjong Pagar and Telok Ayer. The properties were rented for several months to a year and Chan paid between S$3,700 to S$4,200 per month to the property owners. But at no time did either Chan or Zhao tell the owners they were being sublet for short-term accommodation. Under URA regulations, all private residential properties rented out for accommodation purposes must have a minimum stay duration of three consecutive months.  Court documents show that Certis officers first inspected a unit at a condominium in River Valley, Residences @ 338A, on Dec 5, 2017 at 7.37pm. An Indonesian man was found staying in the unit with his family for a period of seven nights, for which they paid rent of A$2,680.97 (S$2,640). He told officers they had secured the short-term accommodation from Chan by making a booking on the Airbnb platform. Officers followed up with more inspections at night from April 2018 to June 2018. In April that year, they visited two units at 10 Anson Road, International Plaza, knocking on the doors at about 10pm. On Apr 26, 2018, officers found an Australian man with his family, paying A$811.27 (S$799) for a two-night stay. He had booked the unit from Chan on the Airbnb platform, court documents showed. Investigations later revealed Chan had used HTM Solutions to enter a tenancy agreement with the unit’s owner, agreeing to a 12-month lease, with rent payable at S$4,200 per month. Acting as Zhao’s agent, he told the owner that Zhao and her child would be occupants of the unit, but they never had the intention of staying there. The next day, officers visited another unit in International Plaza, where they found an American man staying there with his wife for three nights. They had also rented the unit from Chan on the Airbnb platform. Officers found other units in May and June that year. At around 10.15pm on May 18, 2018, they visited a unit at Centrepoint Apartments in Orchard Road. They found a man and his family in the unit, who said they had rented the property from Chan via Airbnb for two nights, paying S$442.78. Officers then visited a unit at Robinson Suites twice – on May 23 and Jun 2, 2018 – at around 9.15pm each time. On the first occasion, a woman told officers she was in Singapore for a holiday with her family and confirmed their host was Chan. The following week, officers inspected the same unit and found a man who was staying with his family for five nights, also confirming that their host was Chan. Similar inspections at night at units in Caribbean at Keppel Bay condominium and back at Residences at 338A in June found similar infractions. In total, officers made eight visits to Chan’s properties, each time finding people on short-term stays. Between Jun 30, 2017 and July 2018, Chan obtained a total revenue of S$1,254,907.78. Within the first month, he had received more than S$130,000 from subletting the units. From July 2017 to the end of that year, he made more than S$670,000 in revenue, and from January 2018 to July 2018, he received nearly $585,000 in revenue. He paid Zhao a monthly salary of S$4,000 for helping him in the scheme. Chan was “motivated solely for profit” and the provision from the short-term accommodation provided him with a regular source of income, the URA prosecutor said. “The criminal business model in this case was fairly sophisticated,” and the offences were perpetrated over a sustained period of time, the prosecution added. It became a “self-funding model with high returns”, they said. ""Property owners should also exercise due diligence to ensure that their properties are not used by their tenants for unauthorised purposes,"" said URA. ""Unauthorised short-term accommodation with frequent turnover of transient guests not only changes the residential character of a property, but also causes dis-amenities to neighbouring residents. ""URA will continue to take strong enforcement actions against short-term accommodation offenders, including property owners, tenants, agents and anyone found to have assisted in such illicit activities, in order to safeguard the interest of the community."" In response to CNA's queries, Ms Mich Goh, Airbnb's head of public policy for Southeast Asia, India, Hong Kong and Taiwan, said the company introduced a policy last year which requires hosts in Singapore to provide their licence numbers or confirm authorisations to continue hosting. Listings that do not set a minimum required stay length of at least three months or are not updated with licence numbers or confirmation of relevant authorisations are no longer allowed to be listed on the platform in Singapore, said Ms Goh. A ""majority"" of the listings complied with the new policy, she added."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/bukit-batok-interchange-bus-collision-driver-jailed-2717986,Former bus driver jailed for injuring 14 people in Bukit Batok interchange collision,"SINGAPORE: A former bus driver was on Tuesday (May 31) jailed for causing a two-bus collision at Bukit Batok interchange that injured 14 people last year. Loo Eng Chai, 66, was sentenced to six weeks' jail and a five-year driving ban after pleading guilty to one charge of causing grievous hurt to six people through a negligent act. Another charge of causing hurt to eight people through a negligent act was taken into consideration for sentencing. At about 5.05pm on Jul 11, 2021, Loo had just started to drive bus service 945 operated by Tower Transit. Before starting the route, he checked the vehicle to ensure it was in safe working order. Loo had reversed out of his parking lot and was driving along Bukit Batok Interchange when he approached the stop line at a T-junction. However, he failed to stop. He continued driving and turned right into the junction without keeping a proper lookout for oncoming vehicles that had the right of way. At the same time, another Tower Transit bus was entering the interchange from the main road. Loo failed to give way to this bus, which was travelling from his left to his right. Loo collided with the other bus, causing it to topple to the left, fall down a slope and land on its left side. He also admitted to stepping on the accelerator lightly before the collision. The impact of the other bus uprooted the roadside fencing at the accident site. The other bus also collided into a bus captain who was taking a break at the lower pavement at the bottom of the slope. The incident was captured in photos and security camera footage that were circulated online. Videos of the incident were played in court on Tuesday. All 14 injured people were taken to the hospital. This included 12 passengers as well as the driver of the bus that Loo collided into and the bus captain who was on a break. The driver of the other bus suffered nasal fractures, hematomas and lacerations on his body. He received 43 days of hospitalisation leave. The bus captain who was on a break suffered rib and other fractures and head injuries. He received 83 days of hospitalisation leave. Deputy Public Prosecutor Chee Ee Ling sought six to eight weeks' jail and a five-year driving ban, arguing that Loo was driving a heavy vehicle with higher potential for harm. Loo continued driving without due regard for the other bus, which had the right of way, said the prosecutor. She highlighted that the six victims who experienced grievous hurt suffered injuries of a ""very serious or permanent nature"", which required significant surgical procedures. Ms Chee also said that Loo's plea of guilt, show of remorse and absence of prior convictions were mitigating factors. She added that the prosecution would not be seeking a compensation order as Loo did not have the means to pay. Loo, who was unrepresented, told the court that he was now working as a cleaner, and that he needed to pay rent and support his family in Johor Bahru. He asked for leniency so that he could be released ""as soon as possible"" to work and support his family. In sentencing, District Judge Brenda Tan said that Loo's actions had caused serious harm and that his culpability was of a moderate to high level. For causing grievous hurt through a negligent act that endangered the personal safety of others, Loo could have been jailed up to two years, fined up to S$5,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/gleneagles-hospital-misappropriate-steal-money-forge-patient-signature-2717656,"Man jailed for misappropriating S$343,000 from Gleneagles Hospital, forging patients' signatures","SINGAPORE: A manager at Gleneagles Hospital misappropriated more than S$343,000 from his employer by amending patients' bills and pocketing their cash refunds, forging some patients' signatures in order to avoid detection. Thomas Ng Eng How, 48, was on Tuesday (May 31) jailed for three years and nine months after pleading guilty to one amalgamated charge of criminal breach of trust by an employee and eight charges of forgery. Another 30 similar charges were considered for sentencing. The offences, which took place from 2016 to 2018, were only discovered through an extensive audit on Gleneagles Hospital and other facilities under Parkway Hospitals Singapore. Auditors noticed a large amount of cash refunds issued by Gleneagles Hospital as a result of Ng's actions, and the hospital made a police report in January 2018. As a business office manager, Ng was able to make amendments to patients' bills in the hospital's computer system, although he was instructed to first obtain his superiors' authorisation. During his employment, Ng learnt that the hospital had a practice of offering patients discounts or bill reductions by downgrading their hospital beds from time to time. The discounts and reductions were implemented by amending the patient's bill. This could be done even after the bill had been fully paid and the patient discharged. The patient would then be issued a cash refund. Ng saw in this an opportunity to misappropriate cash belonging to the hospital, the court heard. Each month, he would identify bills involving patients who were foreigners, that were not covered by any insurance, and that amounted to more than S$30,000. He selected these patients as he believed they were unlikely to return to Gleneagles Hospital as often as local patients, and less likely to discover that cash refunds had been issued in their name. After these patients had made full payment to the hospital and been discharged, Ng would amend their bills to reduce the final amounts or instruct his subordinates to do so. He would then process the cash refunds and keep them. In some cases, Ng tried to avoid detection by forging the signatures of the affected patients on cash refund slips issued by the hospital, to give the impression that they had acknowledged receiving the payments. He forged such signatures on 36 occasions from March 2017 to January 2018, for amounts ranging up to more than S$26,000. Ng used the misappropriated money to fund his personal expenses, including gambling and buying a car. He was arrested on Jan 12, 2018. About S$10,700 was recovered at the time, which was returned to Gleneagles Hospital. Ng later made partial restitution of S$48,000 to the hospital in March 2018. Deputy Public Prosecutor Dhiraj G Chainani sought at least four-and-a-half years' jail, arguing that Ng's offences took place over a significant period of time and were difficult to detect. Ng abused the trust placed in him as a manager and ""carefully adopted a modus operandi"" to misappropriate the money, said the prosecutor. In sentencing, the judge also took into consideration Ng's remorse shown by his plea of guilt and partial restitution. Ng was immediately terminated by Gleneagles Hospital after it uncovered sufficient evidence of his wrongdoing and made a police report, the hospital told CNA. ""We trust all our employees to perform their roles with the highest integrity. It is unfortunate when this trust is broken,"" said Dr Melvin Heng, CEO of the hospital. Ng could have been jailed up to 15 years and fined for committing criminal breach of trust as an employee. The offence of forging a document purporting to acknowledge payment is also punishable with up to 15 years' jail and a fine."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/wedding-night-bride-groomsman-sexual-assault-outrage-modesty-guilty-2716291,Groomsman found guilty of sexually assaulting bride on wedding night,"SINGAPORE: After a night of drinking, a groomsman sexually assaulted the bride of his close friend in the bridal suite on the couple's wedding night. The offender was convicted on Monday (May 30) after contesting two charges of sexual assault and using criminal force to outrage the woman's modesty at trial. The identities of the offender and victim are protected by gag order. Details of the wedding, which took place in 2016, are not published as they could lead to identification of the parties involved. The court heard that the victim and her husband have since divorced. The offender, now in his 40s, was part of a group of groomsmen and bridesmaids who were invited to an after-party in the couple's bridal suite when the banquet ended. Alcohol was available during the meal, and the group ordered and consumed more alcohol while in the suite. Around 1am, the victim felt tired and left to shower and was alone in the bedroom while the group stayed in the living room. The after-party ended at about 3am with everyone leaving except for the accused and victim's husband, who had fallen asleep in the living room. Principal District Judge Victor Yeo said the main issues at trial were the facts of what had happened, and said that he believed the victim's testimony over the offender's. At trial, Deputy Public Prosecutors Ng Yiwen and Goh Yong Ngee argued that at about 6am, the victim woke up and felt she was being touched at her chest and private part. She thought it was her husband and spoke to him, asking him to shower and sleep on the left side of the bed that she had left empty for him. After each time she spoke, there was no response and the touching would momentarily stop before resuming. The woman thought that the person might not be her husband as she felt the texture of jeans, which was not what he wore at the banquet. However, she did not say anything as she did not think anyone besides her husband was in the bedroom with her. After some time, she began to think that something was amiss and tried to look but the room was very dark and she could not see the person's face clearly. The offender did not reply when she asked him to identify himself, and the victim became scared. Leaving the bedroom, she saw her husband in the living room and woke him up. At that moment, the offender came out of the bedroom and started talking to the victim's husband. The victim saw that he was shirtless and wearing jeans. She later confronted the offender and accused him of touching her. The offender initially denied this, then later admitted to the victim's husband that he had touched her chest but not her private part. The victim's husband told the offender to leave and the victim decided to make a police report. Defence lawyers Edmond Pereira and Jessica Cheung argued that the offender believed he had woken up in his own bed at home. He admitted to touching the victim's chest, saying that he had mistaken her for his wife. However, he denied sexually assaulting her. The man claimed to have immediately retracted his hand when he heard the victim, which did not sound like his wife. When he got out of bed and turned around, he said he was shocked to see that the person next to him was the victim. He claimed that he went to the living room, where he woke the groom up and said he was sorry he had touched the victim's chest as he thought he was at home. The man said he then left for home after he had put on his clothes and the groom told him he would settle the matter. Judge Yeo said the offender's account of events was a ""desperate excuse"" conceived retroactively to explain his actions, and that his defence of mistaking the victim for his wife was ""unbelievable"". If the offender believed he was at home, then he failed to explain why he deviated from his usual practice of sleeping on the floor instead of the bed if he had not showered, said the judge. The offender's claim that the sounds he heard from the victim was also ""clearly a fabrication"" that differed from her evidence, said Judge Yeo. Additionally, the man's behaviour with the groom in the living room after the incident was more consistent with guilt, and the offender was ""clearly trying to portray that he had owned up to his error immediately"". In contrast, the victim was a credible and honest witness, whose account of events was ""unwavering"". It was also consistent and corroborated by evidence from her then husband, said Judge Yeo. This made her evidence ""unusually convincing"", and meant the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt, said the judge. The offender, who has a prior conviction for distributing uncensored films, will return to court for sentencing in July. The punishment for sexually penetrating another person without consent is punishable with up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning. The penalty for using criminal force to outrage a person's modesty is up to two years' jail, a fine, caning or any combination of these punishments."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/gilbert-goh-activist-trial-protest-outside-ica-placard-ban-flights-india-2716096,Activist Gilbert Goh on trial for protesting outside ICA without permit,"SINGAPORE: Activist Gilbert Goh Keow Wah went on trial on Monday (May 30) for staging a protest outside the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) without a permit and refusing to sign a police statement. Goh, 60, was represented by lawyer Lim Tean, who said he will argue that his client ""was not publicising a cause"" and that the charge against him is ""vague"" and ""fundamentally flawed"". On May 1, 2021, Goh held up a placard outside the ICA building that read: ""Please ban all flights from India we are not racist! Just being cautious"". This took place soon after the Government barred some visitors from India from entering Singapore in response to a surge in COVID-19 cases there. Goh thereby allegedly took part in a ""public assembly to publicise a cause, namely, to persuade the Government to ban all flights from India"", charge sheets stated . Daryl Sim Pei Xuan, a 31-year-old public affairs consultant, accompanied Goh to the ICA building and photographed him holding up the placard. Between 11.30am and 11.43am on May 1, 2021, the pair moved to three different locations around the ICA building to take the photos. Goh held the placard up for ""a few seconds"" to up to about 29 seconds on these occasions, according to court documents. The pair's activity around the ICA building was captured in closed-circuit television footage, which was played in court. After taking photos at the third location, Goh tore up the placard and threw it away in a rubbish bin nearby. The placard has not been recovered. At about 1.30pm that same day, Goh uploaded one of the photos on his Facebook page. This post has received about 730 comments, 2,500 shares and 2,700 likes as of May 13. The police were alerted to the case on May 1, 2021 and started investigations. Goh subsequently uploaded other photos of himself holding the placard in five posts on his Facebook page on May 14, May 18, May 22, Jun 3 and Jun 14, 2021. Some of these posts had captions like ""Save Singapore"" and ""Stop Singaporean genocide close the border"". They are still accessible to the public. Goh is also accused of refusing to sign a police statement recorded from him by a Singapore Police Force investigation officer at about 3pm on May 11, 2021. He refused to sign the statement despite being informed by the officer that failure to do so was an offence. Goh was accompanied by several supporters in court on Monday. Deputy Public Prosecutors Andre Chong and Yohanes Ng are leading evidence from three witnesses, all of whom testified on the first day of trial. The first witness was Mr Sim, whom the prosecution said received a call from Goh the day before the alleged offence asking him to help take some photos. On the stand, Mr Sim said he became acquainted with Goh more than five years ago and that they met from time to time, although not since the alleged offence. He said that he agreed to Goh's request without being told what he would be photographing and what the photos were for. He also testified that he took the photos on Goh's phone. In cross-examination, Mr Lim asked Mr Sim if he was in fact the one who had suggested that Goh go to the ICA facility and take photos there. Mr Sim said that he could not recall whether this was the case, and repeated this answer when the question was put to him a few times. Mr Lim suggested to Mr Sim that his memories of how he took the photos would be ""vivid"" because the police investigations started shortly after their activity at the ICA building. However, Mr Sim replied that this was not so because the case ""closed"" for him after the police took his statement, and his memory of it ""faded"". Mr Lim then asked Mr Sim whether he had in fact taken the photos on his own phone, to which Mr Sim said he could not recall whether this was so. The prosecution and defence also questioned the investigating officer who took Goh's statement and a member of the public who reported Goh's Facebook post to police. Mr Lim then asked for time to make submissions, describing Goh's case as a ""novel situation"". The trial continues on Tuesday. Under the Public Order Act, those who take part in a public assembly without a permit can be fined up to S$3,000. The punishment for refusing to sign a police statement is jail for up to three months, a fine of up to S$2,500 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/airbnb-homeaway-real-estate-agents-fined-million-sublet-rented-properties-2715971,"Man fined S$1.16 million for subletting properties on Airbnb, HomeAway","SINGAPORE: A man was fined about S$1.16 million on Monday (May 30) for providing unauthorised short-term accommodation on platforms such as Airbnb and HomeAway. Simon Chan Chai Wan, 57, leased 14 units and sublet them out for short-term accommodation. His girlfriend Zhao Jing, 43, was fined S$84,000 for aiding him. The fine imposed on Chan is the largest amount given to a person in Singapore for such offences, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) said. He pleaded guilty to nine charges, while Zhao pleaded guilty to four charges. Under the Planning Act, first-time offenders can be fined up to S$200,000 per charge. Chan and Zhao were both licensed real estate agents at the time, court documents showed. They were also the directors of two companies - HTM Solutions and HTM Management - for certain periods between 2016 and 2018. Chan was also the former director of a company called SNS Infotech Global. Court documents showed that Chan leased various private residences to provide short-term accommodation to both local and foreign guests through the three companies, according to court documents.  The 14 units were in areas such as River Valley Road, Orchard Road, Killiney Road, Robinson Road and Keppel Bay. The properties include Claremont, Centrepoint Apartments, Caribbean at Keppel Bay and Robinson Suites. The transactions took place on various platforms, including Airbnb and HomeAway, which allowed users to post listings for apartments or houses for short-term stays.  “(Chan) leased units for the purposes of subletting them out for short-term accommodation,” court documents said, adding that he also persuaded Zhao to enter into tenancy agreements with the owners of two of the units. Throughout the tenancy period, Chan and Zhao did not inform the owners of the units that they were being sublet out for short-term accommodation. They knew that doing so was illegal, court documents showed. Besides helping Chan rent two units as part of the scheme, Zhao also helped him to set up and manage host accounts on the Airbnb platform and to post listings for the units. She registered the first host account on Airbnb in 2016 under the name “Jing” and listed several units. She also managed guest reservations, answered enquiries and updated the calendar. ""Without Zhao’s assistance, Chan would not have been able to carry out the STA operation. Chan took care of matters outside of the accounts, that is, the day-to-day running of the units,"" court documents said. Investigations showed that Chan illegally provided short-term accommodation at 14 premises from Jun 30, 2017 to July 2018. The total revenue that he obtained was S$1,254,907.78. Zhao was paid S$4,000 monthly for helping him in the scheme. Between Jun 30, 2017 and Aug 3, 2018, she received an income of about S$52,000. Chan pleaded guilty to nine charges under the Planning Act, with another five taken into consideration for sentencing. Under URA's regulations, all private residential properties rented out for accommodation purposes are subject to a minimum stay duration of three consecutive months.  ""Property owners should also exercise due diligence to ensure that their properties are not used by their tenants for unauthorised purposes,"" said URA. ""Unauthorised short-term accommodation with frequent turnover of transient guests not only changes the residential character of a property, but also causes dis-amenities to neighbouring residents. ""URA will continue to take strong enforcement actions against short-term accommodation offenders, including property owners, tenants, agents and anyone found to have assisted in such illicit activities, in order to safeguard the interest of the community."" In response to CNA's queries, Ms Mich Goh, Airbnb's head of public policy for Southeast Asia, India, Hong Kong and Taiwan, said the company introduced a policy last year which requires hosts in Singapore to provide their licence numbers or confirm authorisations to continue hosting. Listings that do not set a minimum required stay length of at least three months or are not updated with licence numbers or confirmation of relevant authorisations are no longer allowed to be listed on the platform in Singapore, said Ms Goh. A ""majority"" of the listings complied with the new policy, said Ms Goh. ""Based on inventory analysis, we understand that of those that failed to do so and were removed, most were inactive or had not had more than two bookings during the 18 months prior to the policy update,"" she added.  “We continue to work collaboratively with the Singapore government to sustainably grow tourism in a way that benefits all Singaporeans and delivers positive outcomes for guests, hosts and the wider community,"" Ms Goh said.  A spokesperson from the Council for Estate Agencies (CEA) told CNA on Tuesday that Chan and Zhao are no longer registered property agents. ""Chan’s and Zhao’s registration expired at the end of 2019 and 2020 respectively, before they were convicted in court,"" said the spokesperson. ""Property agents are expected to comply with the relevant laws that apply to property transactions, including HDB and URA's regulations governing short-term accommodation (STA) at residences,"" the spokesperson added.  The spokesperson said that CEA takes a serious view of agents who flout government regulations. ""For former property agents with past convictions (such as committing STA-related offences) who wish to rejoin the real estate agency industry, CEA will take into account their prior offences and the rehabilitation period when assessing their re-applications."" "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/dee-kosh-pleads-guilty-sex-offences-exploitation-underage-teenage-boys-2715696,Former radio DJ Dee Kosh pleads guilty to sexual offences involving two teenage boys,"SINGAPORE: Former radio disc jockey Dee Kosh on Monday (May 30) admitted to sexual offences involving two underaged teenage boys. The YouTuber, who was named Darryl Ian Koshy in court documents, pleaded guilty to attempting to procure an indecent act from a young person and communicating with a minor to obtain sexual services. He also pleaded guilty to a third charge of making an obscene film. Another four charges will be considered for sentencing. The judge ordered Kosh, 33, to undergo a psychiatric examination at the Institute of Mental Health to assess whether he has a paedophilic disorder and his risk of reoffending. Kosh rose to fame on YouTube and was a presenter on radio station Power 98, a position he held during the offences. Kosh admitted to soliciting paid sexual services from three victims from 2017 to 2020, including the two teenagers. All of the victims' identities are protected by gag orders. In March 2018, he used his verified Instagram account to message the first underaged victim, identified as A1 in court documents. A1 told Kosh he was under 16 years old. Kosh then suggested moving their conversation to a Telegram ""Secret Chat"". In the Secret Chat, messages could be set to be automatically deleted and Kosh would be notified if a screenshot was taken. The messages could not be forwarded to others. On this platform, Kosh offered A1 S$100 to S$250 in exchange for sexual services. A1 was shocked and initially thought Kosh was joking, but the man's persistence made him realise it was not a joke, the court heard. A1 gradually stopped talking to Kosh after he made another offer of money for sex. Their conversations took place over four months until June 2018. A1 did not cease communications immediately as he was afraid of offending Kosh. Kosh saw the second victim, identified as A2 in court documents, outside Takashimaya on Orchard Road during a video shoot in February 2017. He approached A2 for a short chat and was later put in touch with him through social media. They communicated on WhatsApp, with A2 informing Kosh that he was under 18 years old. Kosh suggested that A2 work for him, offering to teach the boy about production work, how to take selfies and ""help create a confident boy"", the court heard. They started talking, with Kosh initiating a ""question game"". He started to ask the victim questions of a sexual nature. This led to Kosh telling A2 that he had an ""indecent proposal"". He suggested that they move their conversation to Snapchat, which shares some of the features of a ""Secret Chat"". He asked A2 for a shirtless picture so that he could ""blackmail"" him if he talked. A2 did not send the photo, but assured Kosh that he would not talk. Kosh then asked A2 what it would take for him to allow someone to perform a sexual act on him, adding that he would be blindfolded and would not know the gender of the person. Eventually, Kosh revealed that the person who would perform the sexual act was himself, and offered S$400 if the victim would let him do so. He gradually raised this amount to S$2,000 after A2 repeatedly declined the offer. Their conversation was recorded on video by A2's roommate using another phone. In 2016, Kosh started following the third victim, identified as A3 in court documents, on social media. This victim was 23 years old to 25 years old at the time of the offences. While chatting online, Kosh invited A3 over to his home. The victim accepted the invitation as he thought it might lead to a recruitment opportunity at Kosh's production company. At Kosh's home, they chatted for a while before going into the bedroom, where Kosh performed a sexual act on A3. After this, A3 continued to go to Kosh's house to hang out and engage in paid and unpaid sexual acts from 2016 to 2020. On one of these occasions between 2016 and 2017, Kosh used a hidden camera to film them having sex. This was done without the victim's knowledge or consent. None of the victims reported the offences to the police immediately after they had taken place. ""They each thought they were the only ones whom the accused offered paid sexual services to and were afraid of the consequences of going against the accused whom they all viewed to be a celebrity with a large following,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutor Lim Ying Min. For example, A1 said he was afraid that Kosh would ""turn the world against him"", said the prosecutor. Allegations of sexual misconduct by Kosh surfaced online in August 2020, when a man posted on Instagram that he was sexually harassed by Kosh. Shortly after, more victims came forward and shared about their encounters with Kosh on social media. Kosh initially denied all the claims made online, but later addressed them on social media, admitting that there was some truth to them. The victims realised that they were not the only ones targeted by Kosh, and A1 made a police report on Aug 16, 2020, that Kosh had offered him money in exchange for sexual services. Kosh was arrested on Oct 5, 2020. Several of his electronic devices were seized, and a total of 25 obscene videos were found on a central processing unit and phone. Power 98 previously said that Kosh was suspended since being charged in August last year. Before that, he was placed on no-pay leave pending investigations. If convicted under the Children and Young Persons Act for attempted sexual exploitation of a young person, he could be jailed for up to five years, fined up to S$10,000 or both. If found guilty of communications for the purpose of obtaining sexual services of a minor, he could be jailed for up to two years and fined. The penalty for making an obscene film is a jail term of up to two years and a fine of between S$20,000 and S$40,000."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/maid-abuse-slap-hit-domestic-worker-jail-fine-2715466,"'If you do it your way, I slap you': Woman gets jail for repeatedly assaulting maid","SINGAPORE: A woman who was unhappy with the way her domestic worker did housework repeatedly assaulted the maid by slapping and hitting her. Zhao Lin, 35, was on Monday (May 30) sentenced to five months' jail and a fine of S$1,000. She pleaded guilty last month to four charges of voluntarily causing hurt and one count of mischief for damaging a phone that the victim bought to contact her family. Another four charges were considered for sentencing. The court previously heard that the victim, a Myanmar national, started working for Zhao in February 2016. Zhao was her first employer. The victim's job scope included taking care of Zhao's son, who was aged about four at the time. Zhao started abusing the victim in 2017 by hitting her because her work or attitude was purportedly not satisfactory. She also deducted S$100 to S$200 from her maid's S$500 salary each month for mistakes made at work, such as breaking crockery. The victim accepted the salary deductions as she ""did not know what would happen to her if she refused"", said Deputy Public Prosecutor Teo Lu Jia. Zhao was working as a nurse at the time of the offences on Aug 25, 2018, which were captured by closed-circuit television cameras around the home. The abuse started around midnight that day, when Zhao accused the victim of not keeping her son's toys properly. Zhao told the victim, then 25, to ""stand properly"" and slapped her forcefully 10 times, loudly counting several of the slaps. The victim did not retaliate. After slapping her, Zhao went on to sort her son's toys while saying: ""I will do it until you are really, really scared."" The victim subsequently teared and cried quietly when she was alone. In the morning, Zhao slapped the victim 10 times again as punishment for forgetting to wash some laundry. A more sustained assault took place later that day, at about 4.30pm. The victim was cleaning the living room when Zhao suddenly asked her to stop and slapped her. Zhao scolded the victim for the way she was vacuuming the floor and told her to ""use your eyes to see"". Shortly after, Zhao slapped the victim again forcefully. The victim was shocked and spoke to the accused. Zhao then shouted at the victim: ""Do it my way! What you're doing is your way! Everything I teach you, everything cannot remember!"" Zhao continued shouting at the victim, who replied again. Zhao got angry and hit the victim's arm and pulled her hair while shouting. She swung her hand and hit the victim's cheek and arm, and kicked her twice at her upper thigh. When the victim used her hands to block the blows, Zhao shouted, among other things: ""How dare you?!"" Zhao's son was in the living room during this assault and asked his mother why she was hitting the maid, to which she replied that the victim ""did wrong"" and ""hit mum"". When Zhao stopped hitting her, the victim continued with housework while Zhao shouted various things, including: ""If you do it your way, I slap you. I will make sure you remember that, and my slap is always harder."" About half an hour later, still unhappy with how the victim had done housework earlier, Zhao walked up to the victim and slapped her forcefully again. The victim did not retaliate. For the next 15 minutes, Zhao continued scolding her about various issues. She pulled the victim's hands, kicked the victim at her upper thigh and hit her arm repeatedly while scolding the woman for ""arguing"" with her. At about 5.15pm, the victim called the police. She had not reported the assaults earlier as she was afraid of losing her job and feared Zhao, the court heard. While the victim was making the police report, Zhao stared at her. When the call ended, Zhao immediately slapped the victim forcefully, hit her head, pulled her hair and kicked her while shouting. When police arrived, they asked to view the CCTV footage but Zhao refused to show it to them. Zhao's husband returned home later and informed the police officers that there were memory cards in the CCTV cameras. These were seized for investigations. The victim was taken to the hospital, where she was found to have a contusion on her forehead and abrasions on various parts of her body. Zhao also suffered bruises from the victim's efforts to defend herself against the assaults. The prosecution sought at least five to seven months' jail and a fine of about S$1,000, highlighting the victim's vulnerability as a migrant without a support network and in a subordinate position to her employer. Ms Teo argued that the sustained abuse caused increasing psychological harm with each escalating incident, adding that the victim would cry and feel traumatised when she recounted what happened. The nature of the abuse was also ""humiliating"", as it was calculated to bully the victim into submission, said the prosecutor. Defence lawyer John Koh raised Zhao's post-natal depression in mitigation, although Ms Teo argued that this was found not to have a significant contributory link to Zhao's offences. Zhao earlier made voluntary compensation of S$6,300 to the victim for the pain and suffering she experienced, her prospective earnings during unemployment and the damage to her phone. The punishment for voluntarily causing hurt is jail for up to two years, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both. Zhao was liable for an enhanced penalty of one-and-a-half times the maximum punishment as she committed the offences against a domestic worker. The offence of mischief is punishable with jail for up to one year, a fine or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-sentenced-eight-months-jail-harbouring-immigration-offender-2711856,"Man gets jail for harbouring immigration offender, who fell to her death while evading arrest","SINGAPORE: A 47-year-old man was on Friday (May 27) sentenced to eight months' jail for harbouring an immigration offender, who fell to her death while trying to evade arrest two years ago. Chan Kok Keong had rented two units, at Kembangan Plaza and Eunos Crescent, said the the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) in a news release. The Singaporean then signed tenancy agreements to allow a friend - female Chinese national Gong Xiuxian - to stay and manage both units from July to September 2019 and from October 2019 to November 2020, added ICA.  Chan claimed that he assumed Gong held a valid Dependant’s Pass and thus did not verify her immigration status. “Investigations revealed that Gong had overstayed in Singapore since 2014,” said ICA.  On Nov 2, 2020, ICA officers conducted checks on the unit at Eunos Crescent.  Gong tried to avoid arrest and climbed out of the unit’s bedroom window, but fell off the window ledge to the ground floor. She was pronounced dead on-site by paramedics.  ""For not exercising due diligence to ascertain if Gong’s immigration pass was valid when he allowed her to stay at the unit located at Eunos Crescent, Chan had committed an offence of harbouring an immigration offender with reckless disregard under the Immigration Act,"" said ICA.  The agency reminded those who wish to rent out their premises to exercise due diligence in checking the immigration status of their prospective foreign tenants. It listed three mandatory steps: Check the tenant's original immigration or work pass; cross check the particulars on the pass against the passport's; and verify the validity of the pass with the issuing authority.  Anyone convicted of harbouring overstayers or illegal immigrants recklessly (by carrying out only one of the three checks) or knowingly may be sentenced to imprisonment for a presumptive minimum term of not less than six months and not more than two years, and a fine of up to S$6,000.  If found guilty of harbouring overstayers or illegal immigrants negligently (by carrying out only two of the three diligence checks), they can be jailed for up to 12 months, fined up to S$6,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/police-advisory-phishing-scam-parcel-delivery-2711861,"More than S$483,000 lost this year to scammers posing as parcel delivery companies: Police","SINGAPORE: The police on Friday (May 27) warned the public about a resurgence of phishing scams involving the delivery of parcels. At least 350 victims have been cheated of more than S$483,000 in total since January 2022, the police said in a news release. Victims of the phishing scams would receive emails or text messages from scammers impersonating well-known logistics companies. They would inform the victims that there was a parcel waiting for delivery and instruct them to click on an URL link to make payment. After clicking on the links, victims would then be redirected to fraudulent websites, where they would be tricked into providing their credit or debit card details and one-time password (OTP), said the police. “Victims would only realise that they had been scammed when they discovered unauthorised transactions made to their credit or debit card,” they added. The police advised members of the public not to click on URL links in unsolicited emails and text messages and always verify the authenticity of the information with the official website or sources. They should also never disclose their personal or Internet details and OTP to anyone, and report any fraudulent credit or debit card charges to their bank and cancel their card immediately. Last week, the police said that at least S$70.8 million had been lost this year to scammers impersonating business partners or employees via spoofed emails. The Ministry of Manpower also recently warned the public about a fake email from scammers impersonating its officers, claiming that the ministry requires employers to submit a declaration every month on salary payments. Anyone with information on scams may call the police hotline at 1800-255-0000 or submit information online."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sex-minor-harajuku-style-group-man-jailed-2711686,Man jailed for having sex with teenage girl he met in Japanese street style group,"SINGAPORE: A man was on Friday (May 27) sentenced to two years and four months' jail for having sex with a teenage girl he met in a Japanese street style group. The man, now in his 30s, started having sex with the girl when she was under the age of 16. Both of their identities are protected by gag order. He pleaded guilty to three counts of having sex with a minor. Another four charges were considered for sentencing. The duo met in 2018, when the victim joined a local group that embraces ""Harajuku culture"", referring to a street style popular in Japan. The offender was then already part of the group, whose members regularly met up in town dressed in Harajuku style and lunched together. ""The victim also attended several of these lunches on weekdays with the accused and began to develop feelings for the accused,"" stated court documents. In May 2018, the victim sent the offender a text message saying that she felt insecure about her hair, which she had recently cut. The man suggested that they go to his house where he could help straighten her hair and cut it. She agreed. He cut the girl's hair at his house, and they went into his room where she started studying. Some time later, the offender suggested the victim rest with him on the bed. They then had sex. They continued to have sex at the offender's house on subsequent occasions. The man was aware that he was having sex with a minor and that this was against the law, stated court documents. The offences were discovered when a family member of the victim received an anonymous message on Instagram that claimed the victim was sleeping with someone. The family member knew that the victim spent time with people from the Harajuku culture group and informed the victim's mother. The victim's mother then confronted the girl, and she confessed to having sex with the offender. The victim's mother made a police report after confronting the offender. Deputy Public Prosecutor Colin Ng sought at least two-and-a-half years' jail, highlighting that the offence is intended to protect minors, who are considered vulnerable people. ""Any consent ostensibly given by the ... victim in this case cannot be endorsed as positive consent because the victim lacked the requisite maturity,"" he said. Mr Ng argued that the offender exploited the victim's young age and also ""morally corrupted"" her by teaching her how to perform sex acts. He also cited the impact on the victim, who still suffers from panic attacks, developed ""trust issues"" and became ""extremely emotionally volatile"" after the offences. Her studies, friendships and potential romantic relationships were also adversely affected, he said. Mr Ng added that the offender did not show any remorse and pushed responsibility to the victim when confronted by her mother. Defence lawyer Wee Hong Shern pointed out that no force or violence was used in the offences, although the prosecution countered that this was not a mitigating factor. Mr Wee sought a shorter sentence of one-and-a-half years' jail, arguing that his client was found to suffer from an intellectual disability. The offender also developed anxiety after the commission of the offences, which showed he did not treat the matter in a ""cavalier"" fashion, said the lawyer. In response, the prosecution said that no causal link was found between the offender's disability and his offences, and he was able to differentiate right from wrong. District Judge Jasvender Kaur granted a deferral of the sentence in order for the offender to receive treatment for medical issues. He will start serving his sentence in June. Those who have sex with a minor below 16 can be jailed up to 10 years, fined or both. Editor's note: A previous version of this article said that the offender committed statutory rape. This is incorrect. The offence committed was sexual penetration of a minor below 16. We apologise for the error."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cannabis-drug-trafficking-death-sentence-acquit-court-appeal-2711101,Court of Appeal acquits man on death row accused of trafficking 1.8kg of cannabis,"SINGAPORE: The Court of Appeal on Friday (May 27) overturned the conviction of a man on death row accused of trafficking more than 1.8kg of cannabis, after finding that it was a case of mistaken delivery. Raj Kumar Aiyachami, 40, was convicted in 2020 of possessing the Class A controlled drug for the purpose of trafficking, which carries a mandatory death sentence. The Court of Appeal also acquitted a second man involved in the case, Ramadass Punnusamy, 41, who was previously sentenced to life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane after being found guilty as a drug courier. Both men were nabbed on Sep 21, 2015, when Ramadass, a lorry driver for a transport company in Johor Bahru, drove into Singapore and delivered a red plastic bag to Raj at Senoko Drive. Central Narcotics Bureau officers knew the delivery would be taking place that day, and arrested both men shortly after. At trial, Raj and Ramadass did not dispute that they were in possession of the drugs. Delivering the court's judgment, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon said that both men's appeals turned solely on whether they had actual or presumed knowledge of the nature of the drugs found. The court ruled in favour of Raj's defence that he had ordered chemically-sprayed tobacco, known as ""Butterfly"", and that the cannabis was delivered to him by mistake. It found that the trial judge erred in rejecting the testimony of Mark Kalaivanan Tamilarasan, a man Raj first met in prison between November 2017 and January 2018. During one conversation in the prison yard, after learning the circumstances of Raj's arrest, Mark told Raj that he was also at Senoko Loop on Sep 21, 2015 to collect ""ganja"", the street name for cannabis, but ended up receiving ""Butterfly"" instead. Raj told Mark to inform his lawyers Anand George, Ramesh Tiwary and Sankar Kailasa Thevar Saminathan of this, and Mark subsequently gave his evidence in court. Mark testified that he remembered the transaction took place on Sep 21, 2015 because his pet hamster died that evening and he got a tattoo with the date. The trial judge rejected Mark's testimony after finding that there was ""ample opportunity"" for him and Raj to ""collude and manufacture the story"". However, Chief Justice Menon said that without a specific finding of actual collusion, Mark's evidence should not have been rejected. ""There is an immense difference between having the opportunity to do something and actually doing that thing,"" said the court. The court also noted that by giving his evidence, Mark was implicating himself in a very serious offence that he had not been charged with or investigated for. ""The fact that Mark had effectively confessed to having at least attempted to commit a serious offence is a weighty factor in evaluating his evidence,"" the judges said. The Court of Appeal also disagreed with the trial judge's finding that Raj must have known he was in possession of cannabis because of the smell emanating from the package. The appeal by Ramadass, represented by Ms N K Anitha, Mr Eugene Thuraisingam and Mr Johannes Hadi, contested the reliability of statements that he gave to police on the day of his arrest. The prosecution had argued that Ramadass admitted to actual knowledge of the nature of the drugs in these statements. The Court of Appeal found that numerous discrepancies and inconsistencies regarding the words that Ramadass used in the statements, as well as the times they were recorded at, made them unsafe to rely on. ""Where the case against an accused person turns on the specific words that are reflected in a statement, as is the case here, it is critically important that the court be satisfied as to the accuracy of the statement,"" said the court. The court also noted that Ramadass consistently maintained that he believed he was bringing in chemically-sprayed tobacco, and found that he successfully rebutted the presumption of knowledge of the nature of the drugs. The appeals were heard by a panel of three judges comprising Chief Justice Menon, Justice Andrew Phang and Justice Belinda Ang. CNA has asked the Attorney-General's Chambers for more information, including what will happen to the men following their acquittal."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/shell-pulau-bukom-fuel-heist-farhan-technician-jailed-2709401,"Shell Pulau Bukom fuel heist: Jail for former technician who received more than S$730,000","SINGAPORE: Another former Shell employee linked to the S$128 million marine fuel heist at the company's refinery in Singapore was jailed for 15 years and four months on Thursday (May 26). Muhamad Farhan Mohamed Rashid, 34, received more than S$730,000 from his participation in the scheme. He used part of the proceeds to invest in Hararu Izakaya Restaurant with heist masterminds Juandi Pungot and Muzaffar Ali Khan Muhamad Akram, and also invested in property in Batam and Brazil. He pleaded guilty in March to 13 charges of abetting criminal breach of trust, four charges of laundering criminal proceeds and one charge of taking methamphetamine. Another 25 charges were considered for sentencing. The misappropriation of marine fuel by Shell employees took place between 2007 and 2018 at the Pulau Bukom refinery, Shell's largest petrochemical production and export centre in Asia Pacific. The syndicate arranged and conducted illegal loadings of marine fuel onto vessels at below-market rates, distributing the criminal proceeds among themselves. The large-scale conspiracy involved several Shell employees, middlemen, ship captains as well as external surveyors who were bribed to not accurately report the volumes of fuel transfers. Juandi, one of three masterminds in the heist, received at least S$5.6 million in criminal proceeds. He previously pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 29 years in jail. Farhan joined Shell in 2010 and worked as a process technician or control panel operator, with responsibilities that included facilitating the transfer of petroleum products to client vessels. He was recruited into the syndicate by Juandi and Muzaaffar in 2014, where his role was that of a ""black oil panel man"", said Deputy Public Prosecutors Christopher Ong, Stephanie Chew and Ryan Lim. Farhan was directed to open and close bypass valves so that vessels could receive the stolen fuel without being detected by Shell's custody transfer meters. He also assisted Juandi in switching off the radars to fuel storage tanks, in order to prevent the recording of data about the amount of fuel inside. He aided the misappropriation of almost S$60 million in marine fuel from 2014 to 2016, said prosecutors. The prosecution had sought a slightly longer sentence of 15 years and eight months. ""The sheer scale of the offending in this case is without precedent. It strikes at the core of a strategic industry and must be met with a resounding deterrent sentence,"" said the prosecutors. ""The staggering losses have not been made good. Indeed, there is little hope that any of the offenders will be able to make any meaningful restitution."" While Farhan's role was subordinate to masterminds such as Juandi, ""he was an active and willing participant in ensuring the successful commission of the offences"", they added. The sentence imposed by District Judge Luke Tan also included three years' jail for taking methamphetamine while on bail in September last year. Farhan, who was represented by lawyer Anand George, started serving his sentence on Thursday after he was unable to raise bail for a one-week deferment."

Officers from the Criminal Investigation Department conducted enforcement operations along Bedok North Street 2, Boon Keng Road and Rivervale Crescent on Wednesday. More than 800 purported trademark-infringing goods comprising of apparel, bags, cosmetic products and accessories were seized during the operation, said the police. The seized items have an estimated street value of more than S$18,000, they added. Investigations are ongoing. Those found guilty of selling or distributing goods with falsely applied trademarks face a fine of up to S$100,000, a jail term of up to five years, or both. The police said that they take a serious view of intellectual property rights infringement and reminded the public that the distribution and sale of counterfeit goods are serious offences. “The police will not hesitate to take tough action against perpetrators who profit at the expense of legitimate businesses and consumers,” they added."

He Yanjun, 45, was sentenced on Thursday (May 26) to six weeks' jail after pleading guilty to two counts of using criminal force to outrage the woman's modesty. Another four similar charges were considered for sentencing. He started to inappropriately touch the victim, whose identity is protected by gag order, in December 2019. The victim tried to be vigilant about He's presence around her to avoid his touch, but he was still able to catch her off-guard, the court heard. In one such instance on Jan 17, 2020, the victim was bending down to clean the floor with a spray hose when He approached her from behind and hugged her midriff. The victim angled the hose to spray water at He, who then walked to her front and bent the neck of the hose so that water was unable to flow out. He only walked away after the woman grabbed a second hose lying on the floor and brandished it at him. Sometime later that month, He approached the victim while she was in a store room, hugging her from behind and holding her wrist. The woman was fearful that no one else would enter the store room and come to her help. She struggled forcefully to free herself, but the more she did so, the tighter He's grip became. She then tried to break free by lowering her body until she was lying on the ground. At this point, He let go and left the store room. He continued to touch the victim inappropriately. On Feb 14, 2020, he pinched the victim's buttock and she decided to inform her supervisor of this. The supervisor initiated internal investigations and asked the victim if she wanted to make a police report. She decided to make a police report on Feb 17, 2020, and was escorted to a police centre to do so. Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Jing Min asked for six to eight weeks' jail, arguing that this was a case of workplace harassment with a need to deter other potential offenders. She highlighted that there was an element of restraint in both charges, as He approached the victim in enclosed spaces and used his arms or other parts of his body to restrain her. Defence lawyer Foo Ho Chew said his client was remorseful and noted that this was his first offence of any kind. ""He has vowed to change his ways with female acquaintances and friends in the future,"" said Mr Foo. However, Ms Tan pointed out that He had previously claimed trial to the charges, and argued that he only decided to plead guilty after seeing the weight of evidence against him. District Judge Victor Yeo said he took into account the element of restraint and number of incidents occurring in the workplace to determine the jail sentence. He, a permanent resident, will start serving his sentence next week after the judge granted his request for a deferment to settle matters related to his work and family. He is no longer working at Mandai Hill Camp. He was accompanied to court by his wife, who is also his bailor. The punishment for using criminal force to outrage the modesty of a person is up to three years' jail, a fine, caning or any combination of these punishments."

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/josh-duggar-19-kids-and-counting-reality-tv-prison-child-pornography-2708251,Former reality TV star Josh Duggar sentenced to 12 years in prison for child pornography,"Former reality TV star Josh Duggar was sentenced on Wednesday (May 25) to 12 years and seven months in prison after he was convicted of receiving child pornography. Duggar was also convicted of possessing child pornography in December, but US District Judge Timothy Brooks dismissed that conviction after ruling that, under federal law, it was an included offense in the receiving child pornography count. Prosecutors had asked US District Judge Timothy Brooks to give the maximum term of 20 years to Duggar, whose large family was the focus of TLC’s 19 Kids And Counting. They argued in a pre-sentencing court filing that Duggar has a “deep-seated, pervasive and violent sexual interest in children”. The judge sentenced Duggar to 12 years and seven months in prison, one day after denying a defense motion to overturn the guilty verdict on grounds of insufficient evidence or to order a new trial. US Attorney David Clay Fowlkes said he was pleased with the sentence. “While this is not the sentence we asked for, this is a lengthy sentence,” Fowlkes said outside the courthouse. Duggar, whose lawyers sought a five-year sentence, maintains his innocence. Defense attorney Justin Gelfand said he is grateful Brooks declined to impose the full 20-year sentence requested by prosecutors. “We’ll immediately file the notice of appeal within the next 14 days,” Gelfand said. Duggar was arrested in April 2021 after a Little Rock police detective found child porn files were being shared by a computer traced to Duggar. Investigators testified that images depicting the sexual abuse of children, including toddlers, were downloaded in 2019 onto a computer at a car dealership Duggar owned. TLC cancelled 19 Kids And Counting in 2015 following allegations that Duggar had molested four of his sisters and a babysitter years earlier. Authorities began investigating the abuse in 2006 after receiving a tip from a family friend but concluded that the statute of limitations on any possible charges had expired. Duggar’s parents said he had confessed to the fondling and apologised. After the allegations resurfaced in 2015, Duggar apologised publicly for unspecified behaviour and resigned as a lobbyist for the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian group. Months later, he publicly apologised for cheating on his wife and a pornography addiction, for which he then sought treatment. In seeking a 20-year sentence, prosecutors cited the graphic images – and the ages of the children involved – as well as court testimony about the alleged abuse of Duggar's sisters. Duggar's past behaviour ""provides an alarming window into the extent of his sexual interest in children that the Court should consider at sentencing”, federal prosecutors wrote in their sentencing memorandum. “This past conduct, when viewed alongside the conduct for which he has been convicted, makes clear that Duggar has a deep-seated, pervasive, and violent sexual interest in children, and a willingness to act on that interest” the court filing said. Prosecutors also noted that Duggar's computer had been partitioned to evade accountability software that had been installed to report to his wife activity such as porn searches, according to experts. “There is simply no indication that Duggar will ever take the steps necessary to change this pattern of behaviour and address his predilection for minor females,” prosecutors wrote. “Duggar accepts that he is before this Court for sentencing and that this Court must impose a penalty,” his attorneys wrote. “That is justice. But Duggar also appeals to this Court’s discretion to temper that justice with mercy.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/maid-abuse-bai-yihong-kick-head-drag-victim-delete-cctv-footage-2706701,"Woman jailed for kicking maid's head, trying to drag her out of flat after months of abuse","SINGAPORE: Just one day after employing a domestic helper, a woman jabbed the maid's head and punched her when she could not understand an instruction. These acts of abuse continued over almost a year, culminating in a final, sustained assault when the woman repeatedly kicked the maid's head and tried to drag her out of the flat. Bai Yihong, 34, was on Wednesday (May 25) jailed for eight months and six weeks after pleading guilty to two charges of voluntarily causing hurt and one charge of attempting to obstruct the course of justice. Another four charges were considered for sentencing. Bai, previously a Chinese language tutor, was unemployed and living with her mother, Hai Yulan, in a second-floor flat in Hougang at the time of the offences. Hai, then 57, was in December last year fined S$3,000 for helping her daughter drag the victim out of the flat. The second-floor flat belonged to Bai's husband Chua Bee Seng, who normally stayed with his parents and sister in a flat on the fourth floor of the block. Mr Chua died last year and their son, aged just over two, is now in the care of Bai's mother, the defence lawyer told the court. The victim was employed by Mr Chua to clean, cook and care for the infant on Nov 17, 2019, when Bai was pregnant. Bai gave birth in December 2019. The victim, a Myanmar national, was not fluent in Mandarin. She tried to communicate with Bai and Hai in Mandarin, but could not understand them at times. One such occasion took place on Nov 18, 2019, one day after the victim started working for the family. Bai asked her maid to take a pear from the refrigerator, but the victim could not understand the Mandarin word used and was unsure which fruit to take. Bai then used her finger to jab the victim's head and punched her shoulders a few times, causing pain. In December 2019, angry that the victim used normal detergent instead of baby detergent to wash her son's blanket, Bai dragged the victim to the closet and broke her bra strap in the process. Bai hit the victim's shoulders several times, jabbed her forehead and asked her in Mandarin ""whether she had a brain"", stated court documents. During another incident around May to June 2020, Bai was angry as she believed the victim was handwashing her own clothes but machine-washing the family's clothes. She grabbed the victim's shirt and punched her shoulders several times. The victim told Bai she wanted to stop working for her, and Bai told her to pack her bags. Bai then pushed the victim in the storeroom, causing the maid to hit her head against the wall and suffer a bump on her head. In October 2020, Bai saw the victim drop a water container on the floor. She questioned the maid, who denied dropping the container as she was fearful. Bai then poked the victim on her chest, temple and cheek, and slapped her face. Bail also told the victim that the floor was ""filled with pesticide and that her infant son might consume pesticide if the container had contact with the floor"", stated court documents. The day before the final assault, the victim had a stomach ache and was told to stay in the fourth-floor flat as Bai was afraid her son might catch an illness from her. Bai expected the victim to return to work the next day, on Nov 6, 2020. However, the victim told Mr Chua that she did not want to work for his family because Bai had hit her before. That morning, Bai went to the fourth-floor flat to bring the victim back. The maid was sitting on the floor of the living room when she arrived. Mr Chua, his parents, Hai and the couple's infant son were also there. Closed-circuit television cameras partially captured the sustained assault, which started when Bai demanded that the victim return to the second-floor flat. The victim refused and told Bai she did not want to work for her anymore. Raising her voice, Bai scolded the victim. She accused the maid of theft and threatened to inform her agent so that she would be sent back to Myanmar. The victim cried and refused to leave the flat, requesting that her agent fetch her. At this point, Bai pulled the victim by her arm to drag her out of the flat. The victim resisted and Hai joined her daughter to pull her out of the house. When the victim continued resisting and started to fend for herself, Bai kicked her stomach, slapped her shoulder and kicked her in the head at least 11 times. These kicks caused the victim's back to hit a wheelchair that was behind her. Bai continued to kick the victim as she lay on the floor wailing in pain. Bai's mother-in-law eventually managed to restrain her, while Mr Chua raised his voice and told his wife to stop. The victim lay on the ground crying and writhing for some time. Bai's blows had caused her lips to bleed onto her shirt, and Bai brought a bowl of water for the victim to clean her lips. She then sat down next to the victim and said: ""I ask you to calm down and then we will talk, if this things (sic) blows up, you cannot go back to Myanmar, what will happen to your children, think about your children"". Bai continued asking the victim to calm down, telling her: ""I guarantee that you will get nothing if you continue screaming and shouting"" and ""if you are like this, you will not get money and will not be able to see your children already"". She did this ""knowing that the victim could be making a police report against her"", stated court documents. After the fracas, Bai instructed her husband to delete the CCTV footage as she knew it contained evidence of her kicking and hitting the victim. Mr Chua pretended to comply with Bai's request, but later provided all the relevant footage to the police. When the victim's agent arrived later that morning, Bai gave a fictitious account that the victim hit her first and fell down, resulting in her injuries. The agent left the flat with the victim, who made a police report that same day. A clinical examination found that she had a lip laceration, facial contusion, wounds on her left arm and muscle strain in her back. She is now fearful of loud noises and cries when she recalls the incident. She also has a scar over her lip and perceives herself to be disfigured, stated court documents. The victim was unemployed for a month after the incident and had to pay two months' salary for her agent fees to secure a new employment contract. Deputy Public Prosecutor Claire Poh sought the sentence imposed, arguing that the abuse took place across multiple instances over a year. By the time of the final assault, ""the victim was already destabilised and especially vulnerable due to the previous incidents"", said Ms Poh. The prosecutor also noted that Bai was suffering a major depressive episode at the time of the offence and there was a contributory link as she was in an ""irritable mood"". However, Bai's judgment was not severely impacted, said Ms Poh, citing an Institute of Mental Health report. Defence lawyer Kevin Liew said that Bai was ""fighting battles within herself"" and that her actions were ""not a case of pure malevolence"". He sought five months and four weeks' jail, highlighting that Bai was her infant son's only remaining immediate family member. He also argued that Bai had shown genuine remorse by refusing bail and pleading guilty. She also made restitution of S$5,580 to the victim for loss of income and pain suffered. In sentencing, District Judge Kamala Ponnampalam stressed that Bai carried out a sustained assault on ""essentially a helpless victim"" in front of the entire household. While the physical injury sustained by the victim was not severe, she suffered significant psychological harm, said the judge. Those guilty of voluntarily causing hurt can be jailed for up to three years, fined up to S$5,000 or both. Bai was liable for an enhanced penalty of twice the maximum punishment for committing the offence against a domestic worker while a member of the employer's household. For attempting to obstruct the course of justice, she could have been jailed up to seven years, fined or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/pokka-drinks-north-korea-un-sanctions-123-duty-free-2706296,"Two companies charged with exporting Pokka drinks, alcohol to North Korea","SINGAPORE: Two beverage companies were on Wednesday (May 25) charged with exporting Pokka drinks and alcohol to North Korea. The first company, 123 Duty Free, faces five charges under the Regulation of Imports and Exports Regulations. It allegedly supplied more than S$341,000 worth of Pokka drinks, including milk coffee, melon milk and strawberry milk, to North Korea from April to August 2018. Singapore imposed a complete prohibition on commercial trade with North Korea in November 2017. TODAY previously reported in August 2019 that the Government was investigating the alleged export of Pokka products to North Korea. In a statement on Aug 5, 2019, Pokka International's then group CEO Rieko Shofu said that media reports about the alleged exports contained ""many false and unsubstantiated claims"". ""Pokka is committed to ensuring that it complies with all national laws and UN sanctions, including ensuring that it has no dealings with North Korea,"" said Ms Shofu then. ""We enforce a firm policy not to trade with distributors that export to North Korea directly or indirectly and have robust internal policies in place that would prevent the execution of a trade with a distributor in North Korea."" She also said the company was not aware of any distributor exporting Pokka products to North Korea. The second company, 123 Holdings, faces five counts under the United Nations Act for allegedly supplying wines and spirits worth more than S$720,000 to North Korea ""via China"" between November 2016 and July 2017, according to charge sheets. On Friday, a spokesperson for Pokka told CNA that the company ""has never had a known relationship"" with 123 Duty Free. ""However, between April 2018 and August 2018 Pokka supplied certain products to 123 Holdings Pte Ltd,"" the spokesperson said. ""This was done with the clear expectation that these products would be distributed in compliance with the law."" The spokesperson said Pokka has not been charged with any offences relating to exports of its products to North Korea. ""Pokka has a strict management policy not to trade with distributors that export to North Korea directly or indirectly. Furthermore, Pokka would immediately suspend business with customers, in and outside Singapore, that are suspected of trading in North Korea,"" the spokesperson added. If convicted, 123 Duty Free could be fined up to S$100,000 or three times the value of the goods, whichever is higher, for a first offence. For repeat offences, the fine is raised to up to S$200,000 or four times the value of the goods, whichever is higher. If convicted of supplying designated luxury items to a person in North Korea, 123 Holdings could be fined up to S$1 million."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/child-abuse-mother-schizophrenia-scissors-cut-son-arm-2705906,Mother with mental illness admits cutting son's arm with scissors,"SINGAPORE: A 43-year-old woman on Wednesday (May 25) admitted to cutting her son's arm with a scissors and hitting her daughter with a lamp when she was angry with them. The woman, who has schizophrenia, cannot be named as her identity is protected by gag order. The identities of the victims are also protected. She pleaded guilty to two charges of voluntarily causing hurt and one charge of breaking bail conditions. Another three charges will be considered for sentencing. District Judge Tan Jen Tse called for a report to assess the woman's suitability for a mandatory treatment order, which directs an offender suffering from certain treatable psychiatric conditions to undergo psychiatric treatment. The court heard that the woman has three children, including the two victims - a girl now aged 15 and a boy now aged 14 - and a 12-year-old girl. She divorced the children's father in 2018 and shared custody with him, but retained care and control of the children. Sometime in February 2020, when the woman was not at home, the three children entered her bedroom to use her mobile phone to call their father. They spoke to him and left the room, but the youngest daughter wanted to speak to their father again. She tried to climb through the window of her mother's toilet in order to get into the room, but broke the shelving inside the toilet. When the two elder siblings heard their mother opening the main door, they distracted her while their younger sister left the toilet and room. The woman then discovered what had happened and ""flew into a rage"", said Deputy Public Prosecutor Susanna Yim. After scolding her children, she got a pair of scissors from the kitchen and cut her son's forearm at least three times by lifting and pressing the blades together, causing bleeding. She also threatened to ""chop"" his finger the next time he went into her room, causing him to cry, and threw a broomstick that missed him, said Ms Yim. In another incident in May 2020, the woman became angry with her elder daughter for dirtying her underwear. The girl said this was because they had run out of toilet paper at home. The woman slapped the girl many times before leaving the room. She soon returned, took a table lamp and hit her daughter more than three times with it. The girl raised her arm and the blows landed there. The woman only stopped when the light bulb of the lamp became dislodged. She then took the bulb and threw it at her daughter. It landed on the girl's leg, and the woman left the room. On Jun 2, 2020, the elder daughter's school counsellor wanted to speak to her. During their conversation, the girl said that her mother had scolded and physically abused her the previous month. A child protection officer brought the three children to KK Women's and Children's Hospital for examination. The elder daughter was found to have bruises on her arm and scars on her arm and leg. A psychologist assessed her to have some trauma symptoms including intrusive thoughts and hypervigilance. The son had two scars on his arm and was also assessed to have some symptoms of post-traumatic stress such as negative moods. The woman was arrested on Jan 1, 2021 and released on bail. However, she failed to report to police twice in June last year, when required for investigations. She was later arrested again in March this year. The prosecution urged the court to call for a mandatory treatment order suitability report for the woman, who is unrepresented. An Institute of Mental Health (IMH) report in April indicated that the woman was likely experiencing a relapse of schizophrenia during the offences, said Ms Yim. The report also found a contributory link between the woman's mental condition and her offences, added the prosecutor. ""Given her medical vulnerabilities, poor social support with limited insight into her illnesses and history of poor compliance, she will benefit from a period of mandatory inpatient admission and rehabilitation,"" said Ms Yim, citing the IMH report. The woman will be remanded at IMH for assessment and return for sentencing in June. The punishment for voluntarily causing hurt is up to three years' jail, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both. The penalty for failing to be available for investigations when on bail is jail for up to three years, a fine or both."

The police received a report on Saturday at about 9pm that a unit along Kovan Road had been broken into, and jewellery and other accessories amounting to more than S$83,000 were purportedly stolen. A watch in a green and beige case, and a handbag in an orange box were among the items shown in photos provided by the police. Officers from Ang Mo Kio Police Division identified the man and arrested him on Monday, said the police, adding that all the stolen items were recovered. The man will be charged in court on Wednesday with housebreaking and theft. If found guilty, he can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined. The police also advised property owners to secure all doors, roller shutters, windows and other openings with good quality grilles and closed-shackle padlocks when leaving their premises unattended. They should also install a burglar alarm, motion sensor light and/or closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras, to cover the access points into their premises and ensure that they are tested periodically and are in good working condition. Property owners should also refrain from keeping large sums of cash on their premises, said the police."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/former-history-teacher-top-school-sexually-exploited-student-committed-suicide-2703171,Former history teacher jailed 15 months for sexually exploiting student who later committed suicide,"SINGAPORE: A 46-year-old man was sentenced to 15 months' jail on Tuesday (May 24) for sexually exploiting a student while working as a history teacher in a secondary school, reported TODAY.  The former teacher pleaded guilty in November 2020 to two criminal charges of committing an indecent act with a young person under the Children and Young Persons Act. Two other similar charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. The man will begin serving his sentence next week and remains out on a S$20,000 bail. The man, and the school he taught at, cannot be named due to a court order to protect the victim’s identity. According to TODAY, the man was 36 when he started a ""relationship"" with the student, then 15, and committed indecent acts with her on campus in 2011. After a few months, he ended things and she graduated.  The victim returned to the school three years later to work as a relief teacher. But the sexual acts only came to light another four years later, prompting the principal to lodge a police report.  The victim committed suicide in May last year at the age of 25. She had been diagnosed with anorexia and major depressive disorder several years earlier. The accused left the Ministry of Education in 2018 around when his offences were reported, said TODAY.  The court previously heard that the accused has a history of bipolar disorder, but a psychiatrist found that a mandatory treatment order was not suitable for him.  This is a community sentencing option offered to offenders suffering from mental conditions that contributed to the offence.  TODAY reported that the accused met the victim in 2009, the same year he was posted to the school as a history teacher.  In August 2010, they spent more time together as she was the student head of the co-curricular activity that the accused was in charge of. He also taught an advanced history class which she attended.  During this time, the accused and the victim began talking about personal matters with each other over coffee and through text messages. They also stayed in contact when the man went to London for a holiday in December that same year, sharing that they missed each other.  According to TODAY, Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Asoka Markandu told the court that the girl understood from their conversations that he wanted her to treat him like a partner.  When they returned to school in January 2011, the accused and the victim began to meet more frequently in school. By end-February, they were in a ""relationship"" and held hands when alone on campus.  TODAY reported that between March and May 2011, the pair were alone in a room when the accused grabbed the victim's wrists, lifted them above her head and pressed her against the wall.  He told her: “I can do anything now” before letting go of her wrists after several seconds. DPP Markandu told the court the victim recalled feeling confused and embarrassed by his actions but did not react or say anything.  Around the same time, the pair were alone in the room again when the accused groped her private parts under her underwear. Taken by surprise, the victim did not say anything and stepped away when he removed his hand.  They continued to communicate and met during the June holidays in 2011.  When the new term started, the accused told the victim that their relationship was over and did not make further advances towards her. They stayed in touch when she left the school.  The victim returned to the school as a relief teacher in January 2014 to teach history for six months. TODAY reported that during this period, the victim began showing signs of an eating disorder. The accused accompanied her to Singapore General Hospital where she was referred for treatment.  The victim stopped contacting the accused in November on her psychiatrist's advice. She later told a friend about what had happened between her and the accused.  The matter was escalated to the principal who filed a police report on the victim's behalf, said TODAY.  DPP Ng Jean Ting, who sought at least 12 months’ jail, said that the victim developed suicidal ideation after the accused broke up with her.  She felt like he had ""broken her"" and she should ""disappear and not exist"", TODAY reported.  The victim's weight fluctuated significantly due to her eating disorder and she could not concentrate in school. She was formally diagnosed with anorexia and major depressive disorder in 2014. In that same year, she also attempted suicide three times and was warded in the hospital for 10 days before being referred to a psychiatrist.  In 2016, the victim told her psychiatrist that she was distressed about her relationship with the accused. She followed her psychiatrist's advice to stop communicating with him. However, this triggered her suicidal ideations once more. The victim was warded again for four weeks in October 2017 for electroconvulsive therapy. In May last year, the victim took her own life, said DPP Ng.  As for the accused's bipolar disorder, another psychiatrist found that the mental illness did not have a contributory linked to his offences, said TODAY. The accused clearly knew what he was doing given that he had made his advances only when they were alone in the room.  For each charge of committing an indecent act, he could have been jailed for up to five years or fined up to S$10,000, or both. Editor's note: An earlier version of story stated that the accused pleaded guilty in 2021. It should have been 2020.

The order against Nancy Tan Mee Khim, the former managing director of Noble Consulting Group, took effect on May 18. Under this, she is prohibited from performing any regulated activity or taking part in the management of, acting as a director of, or becoming a substantial shareholder of a holder of a capital markets service firm. Tan was sentenced to eight months’ jail in June 2020. She appealed against her conviction and sentence, but it was dismissed by the High Court in March last year. Tan had consented to carrying on a business of dealing in securities without holding a capital markets services licence, MAS said on Monday (Apr 23).  She was the managing director of Noble, which helped small and medium enterprises raise funds from the public, between July 2013 and December 2015. “Noble organised multiple seminars, participated in investment exhibitions, created and disseminated marketing materials to potential investors and raised a total of S$15,355,000 from 145 members of the public,” MAS said. “The Investment or Loan Agreements that the investors entered into with Noble’s client companies were found by the State Courts to be debentures, a form of securities.” Lenders were promised interest payments of 12 per cent to 28 per cent per year, according to the police in June 2020. Two SMEs subsequently defaulted on their loans, with more than 100 lenders suffering losses totalling about S$9.5 million. Individuals who deal in securities and capital market products “must take steps to ensure that they comply with the licensing requirements under the Securities and Futures Act”, said Ms Loo Siew Yee, assistant managing director (policy, payments and financial crime) at MAS. “MAS’ licensing regime protects members of the public by admitting only fit and proper persons, who must carry out regulated activities in accordance with business conduct and other requirements. “MAS will take stern action against errant companies and individuals who conduct regulated activities without a licence.”"

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/smu-student-molest-woman-study-session-appeal-2695506,SMU student who molested woman in overnight study session fails in appeal,"SINGAPORE: A High Court judge on Friday (May 20) dismissed the appeal of a Singapore Management University (SMU) student convicted of molesting a woman during an overnight study session. Justice Chua Lee Ming rejected the defence's arguments that the man believed the victim had given her consent based on what happened earlier that night and during the act itself. Lee Yan Ru, 25, was sentenced to 10 months' jail and three strokes of the cane last year after being found guilty of using criminal force to outrage the modesty of the woman. He had contested the charge at trial, during which he argued that the victim consented to the act and the defence accused her of lying. The identity of the woman, now 23, is protected by gag order. Lee and the victim, who became acquainted on Instagram, agreed to meet up at SMU in the early hours of Jan 8, 2019. Throughout the night, Lee repeatedly made advances on the victim, who was not a student at the university. After watching a movie and taking several smoke breaks on campus, the pair lay down to sleep in separate parts of the study room. The woman was woken up by Lee kneeling over her body and rubbing his private parts on her chest. Lee's lawyer Thong Chee Kun argued that his client believed he had consent based on ""a series of acts of growing intimacy"" that night, and the woman's reaction during the act itself. He argued that by the time the act took place, Lee had touched the victim's chest twice and put his private parts on her thigh, and believed that he had her consent for these actions. Later, during the act itself, the victim told Lee to stop and Lee said ""awhile more"". The victim, who was ""not restrained"", kept still and did not say anything else, said Mr Thong. Lee therefore believed he had communicated his wish to continue and the victim had consented during this exchange, argued the lawyer. Deputy Public Prosecutor Andre Chong countered that this was different from the defence's position at trial, where the defence argued that Lee took ""stop"" to mean ""carry on"". He argued that the basis on which Lee claimed to believe he had the victim's consent was ""factually flawed"", as Lee and the victim gave different accounts of how she reacted when he groped her breast. The actions before the act of molestation did not give rise to any ""blanket consent"", said the prosecutor. During the defence's arguments, Justice Chua questioned Mr Thong about several incidents that he said indicated Lee ""knew the sum of his advances were being rejected by her"". He found that the victim's reactions to Lee's advances, which escalated in physical and sexual intimacy throughout the night, showed that she did not consent to those actions. These included her prying his fingers off when he groped her breast and, after Lee put his private part on her thigh, asking him to take her for a smoke break so they could leave the study room, said the judge. He also found that Lee's own testimony and police statement showed it was clear to Lee that the victim found his actions ""unacceptable, to say the least"". ""In light of the above, I cannot see how the appellant could possibly have believed that the complainant consented to him rubbing his (private parts) across her chest,"" said the judge. Upholding both the sentence and conviction, the judge also said it was clear that the victim expressed disagreement during the act itself, and that Lee understood her rejection. ""The truth is, as the appellant admitted in his statement to the police, he 'just (wanted) to release', it 'was a moment of lust' and he was 'purely thinking with (his) private part',"" said Justice Chua. Lee remains suspended from SMU. An SMU spokesperson said the university will ""decide and determine the appropriate additional disciplinary sanctions"" that Lee should receive. He will start serving his sentence in a week after the judge granted him a deferral to settle matters related to his studies."

He made two improvised pipe bombs and lit them up at East Coast Park in 2020, detonating one. No one was hurt in the incident. The youth, now 19, pleaded guilty on Thursday (May 19) to four charges of making explosives without a licence, committing a rash act with a dangerous substance likely to cause hurt or injury to others, and abetting such an act Another three charges will be considered for sentencing, which is set for June. The youth cannot be named as he was under 18 at the time of the offences and therefore protected by the Children and Young Persons Act. He is currently an aerospace engineering student in a polytechnic, and has received treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder.  The youth previously told the court that he committed the offences because he liked to do ""hands-on stuff"", but realised ""there's a right way and a wrong way to do it ... that's why I like engineering"". District Judge Kessler Soh ordered a report to assess the youth's suitability for probation, but did not rule out the option of more severe reformative training. ""You may like to tinker with things, experiment, but there's a right way to do it, as you said,"" the judge told the youth, stressing that he and his friends could have been injured. The youth was already interested in explosives in April 2019, when he and a friend brought improvised sparkler bombs made by him to the beach at East Coast Park. The youth asked his friend to light one of the sparkler bombs up and throw it into the sea. It detonated, emitting a series of flashes and a loud explosion. The youth recorded this and posted the video on his Instagram account. Between May and June 2020, he decided to make improvised pipe bombs and bought 200 boxes of matchsticks for this purpose. After making two such bombs, on the evening of Jun 7, 2020, he and another friend went to a skate park at East Coast Park to try setting them off. The youth brought along his two pipe bombs and several sparkler bombs. He first lit up the sparkler bombs, which produced flames but did not explode. He then picked up one of the sparkler bombs and threw it towards a grass patch. This caused the bomb to explode on contact with the ground. After that, the youth placed the two pipe bombs on the same grass patch and lit them, before running away. One of the pipe bombs detonated, causing a loud explosion and emitting sparks. He recorded this and posted the video on his Instagram account. He took home the other pipe bomb that did not detonate and disposed of it in the rubbish chute. Police were alerted to these actions on Jun 19, 2020, when they received an online report that an Instagram user was posting photos and videos of homemade explosives. They raided his home at 1am the next day and seized several materials used to make improvised pipe bombs. The penalty for making explosives without a licence is up to three years' jail and a fine of up to S$10,000. Those who commit a rash act with a dangerous substance or combustible matter likely to cause hurt or injury to another person, or abet such an act, can be jailed for up to one year, fined up to S$5,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/e-bike-pmd-ride-footpath-elderly-woman-fall-injured-2692916,"Jail for delivery rider who rode e-bike on footpath, caused elderly woman to fall","SINGAPORE: A man was jailed four days on Thursday (May 19) for riding his power-assisted bicycle on a footpath, causing an elderly woman to fall and fracture her shoulder. S Davanand, 33, a part-time Deliveroo rider, pleaded guilty to one count of causing hurt by a rash act that endangers the personal safety of others. Another charge of riding the e-bike on a footpath was considered for sentencing. On the afternoon of Mar 30, 2020, the victim, then 72, was walking along a footpath at Lorong 1 Toa Payoh to pick her granddaughter up from school. At the same time, Davanand was riding his e-bike from the opposite direction on the footpath. The e-bike weighed 20.05kg, which was slightly over the maximum permissible weight of 20kg. Davanand was aware that there was high pedestrian traffic on the footpath as he saw a number of people picking children up from the primary school, said the prosecutor. However, he continued to ride his e-bike on the footpath, going past the victim and failing to keep a safe distance from her. This caused the victim's umbrella to become hooked to his e-bike, and she fell. Her jaw and right shoulder hit the ground, and she was dragged along the footpath for a short distance. ""The collision occurred so quickly that the victim did not know that she had been hit,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutor Kenny Yang. Davanand stopped his e-bike and engaged the victim, before riding away. A medical report dated May 12, 2020, showed a fracture on the woman's right shoulder. She amassed more than S$17,000 in medical bills, of which Deliveroo reimbursed S$8,000. The victim paid about S$550 after insurance, for which Davanand compensated her. Both prosecution and defence asked for a short jail term. The prosecutor highlighted that Davanand was riding his e-bike on a crowded footpath during school dismissal hours. He also said the footpath was marked by many pillars that would have made it even more dangerous to ride an e-bike nearby. Defence lawyer Ashvin Hariharan said his client was riding the bicycle manually at the time, with no power assistance. He asked the court to consider Davanand's full restitution of the victim's out-of-pocket expenses, and the signed letter of apology he gave to the victim. He also argued that the e-bike was only slightly overweight by 50g, and that there was no evidence this resulted in more serious injuries. District Judge Melissa Tan said she took into consideration the excess weight of the e-bike as well as Davanand's early plea of guilty and voluntary compensation for sentencing. For committing a rash act that endangered the personal safety of others, Davanand could have been jailed up to one year, fined up to S$5,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/founder-pro-democracy-group-charged-spy-us-china-hong-kong-politician-2692816,Founder of pro-democracy group accused in the US of spying for China on prominent Hong Kong politician,"A China-born American citizen who founded a pro-democracy group in the United States has been accused of spying for China on other activists, including a prominent Hong Kong politician. Wang Shujun was arrested in March and charged with spying on prominent pro-democracy activists, dissidents and human rights leaders, the US Department of Justice said on Wednesday (May 18). The 73-year-old was a well-known academic who became a US citizen in 2003. While living in China, he was a professor at Qingdao College of Social Sciences. In 1994, he came to the US as a visiting scholar for a two-year term at a university in New York City, before becoming a citizen less than a decade later. In 2006, he founded a pro-democracy group in Queens, New York, with the group’s directors being “well-known pro-democracy dissidents” who oppose the Chinese government, said an affidavit to the court. Wang was the secretary general of the group. But a US investigation found that he was allegedly acting as an agent of the Chinese government, using his position within the Chinese community in New York and the group to collect information about dissidents. One of them was a prominent Hong Kong democracy activist, who was not named in the court documents and was only known as Dissident #1. The activist was described as a “well-known solicitor and politician” in Hong Kong, a former chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, and the former chairman of the Democratic Party. He was also a former member of the Legislative Council. Wang told investigators in the US that he knew Dissident #1, and had called him on Nov 16, 2016. They spoke about the Legislative Council's chief executive position, and about the pan-democratic alliance’s candidates running for office. The politician also asked Wang when he planned to visit Hong Kong again. Wang offered to meet at his daughter’s restaurant after the Chinese New Year, and he offered to treat Dissident #1 and his family. He also offered to host him when he visited New York. After the phone call, Wang allegedly told an official from China’s Minister of State Security (MSS) about the call, and was ordered to detail the conversation and statements about the activities of pro-democracy organisations in a diary. Wang also later told an undercover agent that he was ordered to treat Dissident #1 to a meal to ask him about his opinions on the Hong Kong elections. The accused stated that he spent more than US$4,000 to have a meal with the activist and his family and that he wrote up the details of their conversation. The affidavit to the court said Wang’s reporting to the MSS about the dissident “likely represented only a portion of a multifaceted effort” by the Chinese government to track him. On Apr 18, 2020, Dissident #1 was arrested for organising a banned protest on Oct 1, 2019. He was sentenced to two concurrent jail sentences of 18 months on May 28, 2021, for inciting people to participate in an unlawful assembly and organising such an assembly. On that date, nine defendants, including activists Albert Ho, Figo Chan, Lee Cheuk-yan and Leung Kwok-hung were sentenced to up to 18 months’ jail, Reuters reported. Media tycoon Jimmy Lai was also given a 14-month jail sentence on that date. Wang was also found in April 2019 to be in possession of names and contact information of other Hong Kong democracy activists. According to the affidavit, he reported to the MSS information about Chinese dissidents and members of the democracy movement in the US and elsewhere. Four Chinese intelligence officers were charged with Wang, the US Department of Justice said on Wednesday, including one they referred to as “boss”. Court documents showed Wang met the MSS officials during trips to China, and used a messaging app to receive messages and files from them. He would also record information that he collected in email “diaries”, which included details about his private conversations with “prominent dissidents as well as the activities of pro-democracy activists and human rights organisations”. Among these entries were his “analysis” about possible protests during Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to the US, and an assessment about the pro-democracy movement within the Chinese community in Flushing, Queens. In July last year, an undercover law enforcement agent equipped with a recording device met Wang at the academic’s home in Connecticut. The agent said he was sent by “boss” to deliver a message to Wang, and gave the MSS officer’s name. He was invited into Wang’s home, where the agent explained he was sent by “the headquarters”. Wang allegedly confirmed to the agent that he knew two of the MSS officers and that they worked for the government. He claimed he “no longer had frequent contact with them since the pandemic began”, said the court documents. The agent told Wang that MSS had received information that he was under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and that Wang’s communications may have been monitored. The academic asked the undercover agent for help, and the agent said he could help Wang get rid of the “diaries” and other messages in certain email accounts. Wang described how from 2005, he would write the diary entries for “friends”, and that he wrote about two or three entries per month. He allegedly asked the undercover agent to help him “delete the diaries”, and provided the agent with passwords for his email accounts. He asked the agent to delete one entry, skip the next, and repeat this process. Wang also discussed Dissident #1 with the agent, stating that he was “very close” to the activist and had spent thousands on a meal with the dissident. On Aug 11, 2021, FBI agents approached Wang at his home and he initially denied much of the interaction he had with the undercover agent, according to court documents. “However, after further questioning, while denying that he worked for the MSS as a foreign agent, Wang confirmed that he had a relationship with the MSS,” said the affidavit. The US Department of Justice said about 163 diary entries were found during a search of Wang's residence.  When asked about the case at a press conference on Thursday, China Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said he was ""not aware of the specific situation"". ""I would like to stress in principle that the Chinese side always asks overseas Chinese citizens to comply with host country laws and regulations. We firmly oppose acts by the US that groundlessly malign and smear China,"" he added."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/former-lawyer-struck-upskirt-photos-colleague-2692616,"Former lawyer at top legal firm struck off for taking upskirt, other intrusive photos of colleague","SINGAPORE: A former Drew & Napier lawyer was on Thursday (May 19) ordered to be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors for taking upskirt and other intrusive photos of his colleague in the office. The man's name cannot be published due to a gag order on his identity. The victim's identity is also protected. He was previously sentenced to four weeks' jail in June 2020, after pleading guilty to two charges of insulting the modesty of a woman. The Court of Three Judges on Thursday released its ruling on disciplinary action against the lawyer after an application by the Law Society of Singapore, which had called for his suspension. In April 2017, the man and the victim were both working late in the office when he decided to take photos of her to ""ease his stressful state"", noted the court.  Pretending to read the victim's computer screen, the man leaned over from behind, resting his body on her chair. He took photos of her brassiere and chest, which were exposed because the neckline of her dress was loose. He went back to his room to view the photos, then returned to the victim's cubicle a few minutes later and took several photos of her underwear before leaving. He looked at all of the photos before deleting them. In October 2017, the man entered the victim's room when she was having lunch. He struck up a conversation and proceeded to take upskirt photos of her. Each time the victim swivelled her chair back to face her desk, the man continued talking to her to get her to turn towards him again. When the victim crossed her legs, the man ""asked her whether it was painful for females to sit cross-legged for too long, and how long she could sit in that way"", noted the court. He then stood up, rested his buttocks on the victim's desk and pressed his thigh against her upper arm. He subsequently returned to his room and looked at the upskirt photos before deleting them. The victim lodged a police report in November 2017 that a colleague had outraged her modesty. The man resigned from the firm about a week later. The victim called the man one of her ""closest friends"" in the office in a victim impact statement, and said she had suffered from nightmares about him after the incidents. She said that the man had asked her to drop the case after the police informed him of the allegations, and that he had carried out ""emotional blackmail"" by invoking their mutual friends, his ill mother and even his own safety. This led to her harming herself. She described how she would continue to run into the man in his court robes, and how tense this made her. ""I feel safer walking the streets ... at midnight than the halls of the Supreme Court by day,"" she said. The man initially claimed trial to the criminal charges, and the victim also described the emotional toll the pending trial took on her as she played back the offences in her head in preparation for cross-examination. The Court of Three Judges noted that the man did not respond to multiple attempts to notify him of the disciplinary proceedings in person and by courier, phone call and email. He did not attend any of the hearings. Delivering the judgment on behalf of the court, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon said the man's misconduct pointed to character defects that made him unfit to be a member of the legal profession. The judgment cited his ""premeditated and persistent"" misconduct, his ""opportunistic exploitation"" of the victim's expectation of safety in the workplace and his pressuring of the victim to drop the case. ""Instead of evincing genuine remorse, the respondent attempted to save his own skin by waging a war of emotional attrition against (the victim), in the hope that she would buckle under the pressure. We find this deeply disturbing,"" said Chief Justice Menon. The judges also considered the man's failure to plead guilty at an early stage and his absence from the proceedings, which indicated ""at worst, his disdain"" for the disciplinary process. Finally, they found that his ""egregious"" conduct caused grave dishonour to the standing of the legal profession. The Court of Three Judges is the highest disciplinary body to deal with lawyers' misconduct. The panel for this hearing comprised Chief Justice Menon, Justice Steven Chong and Justice Andrew Phang. A spokesperson from Drew & Napier said its firm has ""a strict zero-tolerance policy towards misconduct of any nature"".  ""Our colleagues work hard to maintain a supportive and respectful work environment with an open-door policy. We are fully committed to ensuring that every single member of our firm feels safe and that reported cases of misconduct, sexual or otherwise are responded to swiftly. Appropriate steps were taken when the allegations came to light."" Editor's note: This story has been corrected to reflect that it was the offender, and not the victim, who resigned about a week after the police report was made in November 2017. We apologise for the error."

In an advisory on Thursday (May 19), police warned the public of cases where scammers befriended victims and deceived them into either making payments to receive purported gifts, or into providing financial assistance. In most cases, the scammers would claim to have sent valuable gifts to the victims. The victims would then receive calls purportedly from delivery couriers, informing them that the parcels were detained by the authorities. ""The scammers would request for the victims to make online payment to third party bank accounts in order to secure the release of the items,"" police said.  In another variant, scammers would ask victims to provide financial assistance by buying gift cards and sharing the activation codes with the scammers, or by transferring the money to third party bank accounts. ""Victims would eventually realise that they have been scammed when they contacted Singapore Customs to enquire about the delivery charges or when they felt suspicious about the encounter and decided to enquire with the police,"" they said.  To avoid falling for these scams, the police advised members of the public to adopt the following precautionary measures: • Exercise caution when befriending strangers online • Never send money to people whom you do not know or have not met in person before • Do not provide the gift card activation codes to people whom you do not know or have not met in person before • When in doubt, always verify the details of the call with the relevant government agencies Anyone with information on such scams may call the police hotline at 1800-255-0000 or submit information online."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/prudential-insurance-agent-false-entries-coaching-forms-2692491,Two Prudential insurance agents charged with falsifying coaching form entries,"SINGAPORE: Two insurance agents of Prudential Assurance Company were on Thursday (May 19) charged with falsifying entries in coaching forms. Eunice Yuen Pui Leng, 44, and Grace Tan Zhen Zhi, 38, were each given two charges under the Financial Advisers Act. Yuen also received another three counts under the same Act, and one count of obstruction of justice. The women are suspected of making false entries in seven coaching forms each for two other financial consultants between Sep 14 and Sep 16, 2018. Yuen was the agency supervisor for the two, and allegedly asked Tan to make the false entries before giving the coaching forms to a Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) investigating officer on Sep 17, 2018. The forms purportedly contained false or misleading information about the dates of coaching sessions and details of matters discussed during the sessions, according to charge sheets. Yuen was charged with falsely telling the same MAS investigating officer on Oct 5, 2018 that she personally filled in the coaching forms. She also stands accused of obstructing the course of justice by deleting WhatsApp messages when she knew that these were likely to be required by MAS for its investigation. Both women will return to court next month. Under the Financial Advisers Act, it is an offence for an agent to make a false entry in any document of the business, affairs, transactions, conditions or assets of a financial adviser. This is punishable with up to two years' jail, a fine of up to S$100,000 or both. The offence of furnishing false information can be punished with up to two years' jail, a fine of up to S$50,000 or both under the same Act. Those guilty of intentionally obstructing the course of justice can be jailed for up to seven years, fined or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/teen-sex-scam-cheating-locanto-lie-police-2690476,"Teen gets probation for running online sex scams, lying to police","SINGAPORE: An 18-year-old teenager was on Wednesday (May 18) given one-and-a-half years' probation for offences including running online sex scams and lying to the police. The teen cannot be named as he was under 18 at the time of the offences and therefore protected under the Children and Young Persons Act. The names of other individuals involved were also redacted from court documents as they could lead to his identification. The teen pleaded guilty to five charges of cheating, acquiring benefits of criminal conduct, giving false information to a public servant and voluntarily causing hurt. Another nine charges were considered for sentencing. The court heard that the teen and a 20-year-old man masqueraded as women to run sex scams on Locanto, an online classifieds website. They posted advertisements for sexual services using photos of women they had downloaded, and communicated with victims on Telegram. The duo asked victims to transfer payments to local bank accounts, and would block the victims on Telegram after receiving the money. One victim fell prey to the scams after coming across an advertisement for sexual services on Locanto on Apr 5, 2020. He transferred S$100 to a bank account provided by the offender, after which the offender blocked him and became uncontactable. The next day, the victim reported to police that he had been cheated. The teen also recruited other people to provide their bank accounts to receive illicit proceeds from the sex scams, in order to evade detection from the police. They would withdraw the proceeds from their accounts and hand them to the offender in cash. He acquired more than S$12,000 in criminal proceeds from two such people. When questioned by police on Feb 26, 2020, the offender lied that he would ""randomly"" receive messages from another person asking him to withdraw and hand over sums of money. The teen also instigated his friend, who was helping to receive criminal proceeds in his bank account, to lie to police that he was recruited by the same person. This caused police to start investigating the person and take his statement ""to his annoyance, as he was not involved in the accused's illicit activities"", stated court documents. On May 19, 2020, the teen admitted to lying to police about this person's involvement in his criminal activities. The teen also admitted to punching another person who got into an argument with his friend while playing an arcade game in March 2020."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/woman-smash-ex-lover-car-house-window-trespass-2690381,Woman admits smashing ex-lover's car with golf club after trespassing into his home,"SINGAPORE: A woman on Wednesday (May 18) admitted to smashing her former lover's car with a golf club after climbing over the gate to enter his home. Zhou Dani, 37, pleaded guilty to one charge each of criminal trespass and mischief. Another charge of criminal intimidation, for sending the man a threatening text message that read ""I will kill all you b*******"", will be considered for sentencing. The judge ordered a report to assess Zhou's suitability for a mandatory treatment order, which directs an offender suffering from certain treatable psychiatric conditions to undergo psychiatric treatment. Defence lawyer CK Teo said his client was diagnosed with adjustment disorder, and her psychiatrist was of the opinion that there was a contributory link to the offences. He said she was receiving treatment. The court heard that Zhou and the victim, a 46-year-old man, were romantically involved in the past. They had known each other for about four-and-a-half years at the time of the offences last year. The incident started with Zhou's arrival at the victim's home at about 8.30pm on Sep 1, 2021. She took photos of the residence and sent them to him on WhatsApp. ""She was feeling emotional about the status of the relationship between the victim and herself, and intended to try to compel the victim into making a commitment to her, even though the victim was married and had a child,"" stated court documents. ""Referring to a previous claim made by her, that she had two children with the victim, (Zhou) demanded over WhatsApp that the victim come out from his house."" When the victim refused, Zhou repeatedly rang the doorbell, gaining the attention of the victim's family members who attended to her. The victim urged Zhou not to cause a nuisance, but she did not leave. Around 9.15pm, Zhou climbed over a gate and entered the residence. She sent the victim a photo of his car, threatening to ""crush"" it, and the main door. She also threatened to kill the victim's mother if he did not come out. A few minutes later, she took a golf club belonging to the victim and proceeded to smash his car and the windows of his house, breaking the club in the process. This caused more than S$18,000 worth of damage, of which more than S$17,000 was for damage to the car alone. Police were called. Zhou was still in the midst of smashing the victim's house windows when they arrived at about 9.45pm. She stopped when ordered to by police, and admitted to them that she had been drinking beer beforehand. She was arrested shortly after. Zhou has said she was willing to make compensation for the damage if the victim agreed to see her, according to court documents. When the criminal intimidation charge was read to her on Wednesday, Zhou interjected that the victim had sent similar messages to her in the past. ""Whenever we quarrel he would threaten to cut off my limbs and confine me in a cage,"" she told the court through an interpreter. She later admitted to all the charges. The prosecution did not object to the defence's request for a mandatory treatment order report. In mitigation, Mr Teo said his client felt ""humiliated"" when the victim refused to come out of the house to see her. The lawyer said ""things boiled over"" after the victim called Zhou ""crazy"" and ""mentally unsound"" in front of his family members. ""This is not the behaviour of someone in control of her senses,"" he said. Zhou will undergo an assessment at the Institute of Mental Health, and return to court for sentencing next month."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/foreign-journalist-calum-stuart-illegal-freelance-work-pass-thomson-reuters-yahoo-2689686,Foreign journalist fined for illegal freelancing with news publishers,"SINGAPORE: A foreign journalist was on Tuesday (May 17) fined S$6,500 for doing freelance work without a valid work pass. Calum Arthur Alistair Stuart, 36, pleaded guilty to one charge under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act. Another similar charge was considered for sentencing. The two co-accused who engaged his services - Refinitiv Asia and media professional Muhammad Firdianshah Salimat - were also fined S$5,500 and S$4,000 respectively. Stuart, a Briton, married a Singaporean in 2014 and was on a long-term visit pass when he offended in 2015 and 2016. The Ministry of Manpower received information against Stuart for possible illegal employment in September 2019 and investigated. Stuart admitted to doing freelance television and video production work for Refinitiv, then known as Thomson Reuters, while he did not hold a valid work pass. He was paid about S$30,000 for work done over more than half a year from Nov 25, 2015 to Jul 8, 2016, except for a period of about three weeks in June 2016. The court heard that Stuart was offered an assistant producer role with Refinitiv's news business in August 2015. He agreed to the offer but did not sign the employment contract. The company subsequently applied for an employment pass on Stuart's behalf, but the application was rejected on Sep 9, 2015. The company then applied for a letter of consent for Stuart to work for them on Nov 23, 2015. This was rejected on Dec 23 that year. Around Nov 25, 2015, while waiting for approval of the letter of consent, Refinitiv offered freelance work to Stuart at a rate of S$4,500 a month. Stuart accepted despite knowing that he was prohibited from engaging in any profession without a valid work pass, according to court documents. The prosecution asked for a fine of S$7,000 to S$8,000, arguing that while Stuart did not take active steps to be illegally self-employed, he accepted the offer only two days after the company had applied for his letter of consent. Stuart also made ""significant"" gains from his illegal employment, said Ministry of Manpower prosecuting officer Houston Johannus. Stuart's defence lawyer Remy Choo said his client's main offence was in failing to check the status of his letter of consent, and disagreed that the amount he earned was relevant to sentencing. On Refinitiv's part, the company admitted to being aware that Stuart did not hold a valid work pass when it made the freelance offer. The company pleaded guilty to one charge of abetting Stuart to commit the offence of being a self-employed foreigner without a valid work pass. Stuart's other co-accused Firdianshah, 30, is the founder of online publisher Popspoken, according to court documents. Popspoken said he had already left the company at the time of the offence. He similarly pleaded guilty to one charge of abetting Stuart to commit the offence of being a self-employed foreigner without a valid work pass. In May 2015, Firdianshah signed an agreement with Yahoo Asia Pacific to provide three to five original pieces of writing every weekday on news and current events. Firdianshah would be paid S$150 for each piece published on the Yahoo! Singapore news website. Around this time, Firdianshah became acquainted with Stuart through Stuart's wife, and offered him a job as a freelance writer. Stuart expressed his interest in the job on Jun 6, 2015, and both men worked out an arrangement. Although Stuart had highlighted the issue of seeking the necessary approval before starting work, Firdianshah still chose to engage him despite him not holding a valid work pass, according to court documents. Both men signed an agreement on Jun 27, 2015 for Stuart to provide Firdianshah with three to five original pieces of writing every weekday. Firdianshah would then submit these to Yahoo for consideration, and pay Stuart S$100 for every published piece after taking a S$50 cut. He would also be in charge of vetting Stuart's articles. Between Jun 27, 2015 and late August 2015, Stuart wrote seven articles mostly about Singapore's current affairs that were published by Yahoo. He was paid S$700 in total, while Firdianshah received S$350. Mr Johannus said Firdianshah ""showed a cavalier attitude towards the law"" in choosing to engage Stuart. Firdianshah's defence lawyer Tiffanie Lim highlighted that her client was only 22 at the time and offended due to a lack of due diligence. She said that Stuart's work pass was ""simply not something in (Firdianshah's) headspace at the time"". The penalty for being a self-employed foreigner without a valid work pass, and abetting such an offence, is up to two years' jail, a fine of up to S$20,000 or both for a first-time offender. This is increased to between one month and two years' jail and a fine of up to S$20,000 for repeat offenders."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cyclist-jailed-punch-man-filmed-pedestrian-assault-road-rage-2689446,Cyclist jailed for punching man who filmed him assaulting a pedestrian,"SINGAPORE: A cyclist was on Tuesday (May 17) jailed five months for punching a passerby who filmed him assaulting another pedestrian. Sivakarthik Bernard, 28, pleaded guilty to one charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt. Two other charges of voluntarily causing hurt and harassment were considered for sentencing. The victim, a 56-year-old man, suffered a fracture to his eye socket, a haemorrhage in his eye and a facial laceration from the assault. The court heard that on Jul 22 last year at about 6.45pm, Sivakarthik was cycling on a pavement near Block 96A Henderson Road. He was behind a 63-year-old man who was walking while listening to a voice message on the phone. Sivakarthik rang his bicycle bell but failed to get the man's attention. He then narrowly squeezed past on his bicycle. The pedestrian shouted at Sivakarthik and both men got into an argument, each using vulgarities while accusing the other of inconsiderate behaviour. As the argument grew heated, Sivakarthik showed his fist to the man, who asked if Sivakarthik wanted to punch him. Sivakarthik punched the pedestrian on the forehead, causing him to fall. He continued punching his head and also landed two hard kicks on the man's backpack. The victim and another passerby witnessed this attack. While the other passerby intervened to separate them, the victim started recording a video of them on his phone. Sivakarthik asked the victim why he was recording a video, and the victim replied: ""Why, what you want?"" Angered, Sivakarthik punched the victim in the face, causing him to fall. He continued to punch the victim on the head at least twice more, only stopping when he saw that the man's face was bleeding. The victim covered his head with his hands to shield himself from Sivakarthik's blows, and did not retaliate during the assault. He was taken to a hospital and another passerby called the police, who arrested Sivakarthik that evening. The prosecution sought six to seven months' jail for Sivakarthik, highlighting that the eye was an especially vulnerable part of the face and that the victim's injury could have resulted in impaired vision. Deputy Public Prosecutor Etsuko Lim said that the assault was unprovoked, and that Sivakarthik had assaulted two strangers in the span of ""mere minutes"". She also argued that, similar to cases of road rage, there was a need to deter other offenders as Sivakarthik's violence ""stemmed from differences arising from the shared use of a public space"" by pedestrians and cyclists. In sentencing, the judge also ordered Sivakarthik to compensate the two men he assaulted for their hospital bills, which came up to a total of about S$1,017."

Court documents show he also made other insensitive remarks during the lecture. Between Aug 10, 2020, and Sep 13, 2020, Tan also allegedly gave religiously insensitive answers on the online forum Quora.com. In response to a question about ""people being overcome by the Holy Spirit"", Tan allegedly said that ""people under the influence of drugs or epilepsy have the exact same experience"". In response to another question on whether a food item was halal, he allegedly made insensitive remarks about Islam. The prosecution on Tuesday sought an adjournment of three weeks and said that a plea offer was pending, adding that no more charges were expected. Tan is represented by defence lawyer Johannes Hadi. He was offered bail of S$5,000, and will return to court for a pre-trial conference next month.

Another 29 similar charges were taken into consideration during sentencing, Singapore Customs said in a press release on Saturday.   ""Foong’s fraudulent actions resulted in the underpayment of GST to Singapore Customs,"" the agency said. The amount of GST evaded by Foong totalled S$15,128.26. Singapore Customs had commenced investigations into Swiftfox for suspected underdeclaration of value of goods after discrepancies were found in some cargo clearance permits. Investigations revealed that one of Foong’s customers engaged his company to handle the customs clearance of their shipments from China. The customer’s China freight forwarder would provide Foong with a consolidated manifest to apply for cargo clearance permits. As part of the services, Swiftfox would be declared as the importer for the shipments, said Singapore Customs.  ""Foong would intentionally suppress the value of the goods by amending their values on the consolidated manifest, before furnishing it to the declaring agent to apply for cargo clearance permits,"" Singapore Customs said. The declaring agent would pay Singapore Customs the GST based on the suppressed values stated in the consolidated manifest it received from Swiftfox, and then bill Swiftfox accordingly, added Singapore Customs. Foong would then collect the GST payable based on the original documents from his customer and profit from the differences.  Foong did this with 52 cargo clearance permits between April and August 2019. The 15 charges he pleaded guilty to involved 18 cargo clearance permits, with a total S$7,677.95 in GST evaded.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/upskirt-video-voyeur-jurong-shopping-malls-jem-2683356,Man jailed for taking upskirt videos in Jurong shopping malls,"SINGAPORE: A man was jailed 14 weeks on Friday (May 13) for taking upskirt videos of women around shopping malls in Jurong over two years. Ho Li Yang, 29, pleaded guilty to two charges of voyeurism. Another charge was considered for sentencing. He was caught trying to take an upskirt photo with his phone in a stationery and gift shop in Jem on May 8, 2021. Before he could take the photo, the victim, a 27-year-old woman, sensed someone standing behind her. She turned and saw Ho, who apologised and quickly walked away. He tried to take a photo of her again a short while later. The victim felt something touch the inside of her legs, turned around and again saw Ho standing behind her. Ho tried to leave the shop, but the victim sought help from the shop assistants to detain him, as she suspected he was trying to take an upskirt image of her. When told that his actions were recorded on closed-circuit television footage, Ho admitted that he was trying to take an upskirt image, and the police were called. His laptop was seized from his home that night and 15 upskirt videos of 10 women were found on the device. Ho admitted to recording the videos with his phone in shopping malls in Jurong from 2020 to 2021 without the women's consent. He did not know any of the victims. The prosecution sought the jail term that was imposed, highlighting that Ho pursued a sustained pattern of offending over one year and targeted multiple victims. The penalty for voyeurism is up to two years' jail, a fine, caning or any combination of these punishments."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/us-cities-are-backing-banning-facial-recognition-crime-rises-2681186,US cities are backing off banning facial recognition as crime rises,"OAKLAND: Facial recognition is making a comeback in the United States as bans to thwart the technology and curb racial bias in policing come under threat amid a surge in crime and increased lobbying from developers. Virginia in July will eliminate its prohibition on local police use of facial recognition a year after approving it, and California and the city of New Orleans as soon as this month could be next to hit the undo button. Homicide reports in New Orleans rose 67 per cent over the last two years compared with the pair before, and police say they need every possible tool. ""Technology is needed to solve these crimes and to hold individuals accountable,"" police Superintendent Shaun Ferguson told reporters as he called on the city council to repeal a ban that went into effect last year. Efforts to get bans in place are meeting resistance in jurisdictions big and small from New York and Colorado to West Lafayette, Indiana. Even Vermont, the last state left with a near-100 per cent ban against police facial-recognition use, chipped away at its law last year to allow for investigating child sex crimes. From 2019 through 2021, about two dozen US state or local governments passed laws restricting facial recognition. Studies had found the technology less effective in identifying Black people, and the anti-police Black Lives Matter protests gave the arguments momentum. But ongoing research by the federal government's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has shown significant industrywide progress in accuracy. And Department of Homeland Security testing published last month found little variation in accuracy across skin tone and gender. ""There is growing interest in policy approaches that address concerns about the technology while ensuring it is used in a bounded, accurate and nondiscriminatory way that benefits communities,"" said Jake Parker, senior director of government relations at the lobbying group Security Industry Association. Shifting sentiment could bring its members, including Clearview AI, Idemia and Motorola Solutions, a greater share of the US$124 billion that state and local governments spend on policing annually. The portion dedicated to technology is not closely tracked. Gaining new police business is ever more important for Clearview, which this week settled a privacy lawsuit over images it collected from social media by agreeing not to sell its flagship system to the US private sector. Clearview, which helps police find matches in the social media data, said it welcomes ""any regulation that helps society get the most benefit from facial recognition technology while limiting potential downsides"". Idemia and Motorola, which provide matches from government databases, declined to comment. Though the recent studies have eased lawmakers' reservations, debate is ongoing. The General Services Administration, which oversees federal contractors, said in a report released last month that major facial recognition tools disproportionately failed to match African Americans in its tests. The agency did not respond to requests to provide details about the testing. Facial recognition will be reviewed by the president's new National AI Advisory Committee, which last week began forming a subgroup tasked with studying its use in policing. Virginia approved its ban through a process that limited input from facial recognition developers. This year, company lobbyists came prepared to advance legislation that better balanced individual liberties with police investigation needs, said State Senator Scott Surovell. Beginning Jul 1, police can use facial recognition tools that achieve 98 per cent or higher accuracy in at least one NIST test with minimal variation across demographics. NIST declined to comment, citing practice against discussing legislation. Tech critics said the standard is well-intentioned but imperfect and that warrants should be required for facial recognition use. ""Addressing discriminatory policing by double-checking the algorithm is a bit like trying to solve police brutality by checking the gun isn't racist: Strictly speaking it's better than the alternative, but the real problem is the person holding it,"" said Os Keyes, an Ada Lovelace Fellow at University of Washington. Virginia barred real-time surveillance, and face matches cannot serve as probable cause in warrant applications. Misuse can lead to a misdemeanor. Parker, the lobbyist, called the law ""the first in the nation to require the accuracy of facial recognition technology used by law enforcement to be evaluated by the US government"" and ""the nation’s most stringent set of rules for its use"". Former Virginia Delegate Lashrecse Aird, who spearheaded last year's law, said companies this year wanted a model to defeat bans across the country. ""They believe this ensures greater accountability - it’s progress, but I don’t know,"" she said. It contrasts with a Washington state law that requires agencies to conduct their own tests beforehand ""in operational conditions"". California in 2019 banned police from using facial recognition on mobile devices such as body-worn cameras. But the prohibition expires on Jan 1 because of a provision state senators added. Now, news reports about rising retail theft and smash-and-grab robberies have captured lawmakers' attention, said Jennifer Jones, a staff attorney for ACLU of Northern California. As a result, ACLU has faced resistance from law enforcement to make the ban permanent. ""Police departments are exploiting people's fears about that crime to amass more power,"" Jones said. ""This has been for decades, we see new technologies being pushed in moments of crisis."" Activists in New York are also pressing for a facial recognition ban despite increased crime. Eric Adams, who became mayor in January, said a month later that it could be used safely under existing rules, while his predecessor Bill de Blasio had called for more caution. In West Lafayette, officials have twice failed to enact a ban on facial recognition over the past six months, citing its value in investigations. “To ban it or chip away from its application would be a little short-sighted,” said Mayor John Dennis, a former police officer. David Sanders, the city councilor behind the ban proposals, said concern about worsening low morale among officers was ""dominating people’s reactions"". After the loss in Virginia, civil liberties groups are escalating in New Orleans. Ten national organisations last week told council members to strengthen, not repeal, its ban, citing the risk of wrongful arrests based on faulty identifications. The local group Eye on Surveillance said New Orleans ""cannot afford to go backward""."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-stalk-ex-girlfriend-social-media-passwords-singtel-customer-information-2680281,"Former Singtel employee gets jail for stalking ex-girlfriend, unauthorised access to customer information","SINGAPORE: A former Singtel employee was sentenced to eight weeks' jail on Thursday (May 12) for stalking his ex-girlfriend and accessing customer information without permission. Yap Wee Chian, 35, pleaded guilty to two charges of unlawful stalking and unauthorised access to computer material. Two more charges were considered for sentencing. Yap was previously a customer service officer with Singtel from 2011 to 2019. He and his then girlfriend, now 32, started a relationship in April 2019, and she moved in with him in November that year. The court heard that during their relationship, Yap was possessive and often suspected that his girlfriend was speaking to other men. Sometime in 2018, Yap was given access to a computer system to manage Singtel customers' complaints and verify their claims for mobile services. He was able to access customers' mobile data usage, phone models, types of mobile apps used and other information through the system. Yap was told that he should not use his access for personal reasons. In October 2019, Yap noticed that his girlfriend received a number of WhatsApp messages from another man, and became insecure. Yap memorised the man's phone number. Between Oct 24, 2019 and Dec 13, 2019, he put in queries in the computer system to access the man's account information on 22 occasions. Yap did this to determine whether the man and his girlfriend used mobile apps at the same time, according to court documents. The police were alerted when a Singtel call centre manager made a report on Mar 10, 2020. The court heard that during their relationship, Yap's girlfriend gave him the pin code to unlock her mobile phone. They also shared their email passwords. Yap bought a new phone for his girlfriend in January 2020. He transferred all the data from her old phone to the new one, and took over her old phone. In September 2020, Yap changed the password to his girlfriend's Facebook account by accessing her account on the old phone, resetting the password, and then accessing her email account to get Facebook's notification. Yap's girlfriend ended their relationship on Oct 2, 2020 because she felt that he was insecure and controlling. She moved out to a room that she was renting in another flat. Yap found out that the victim had moved to the flat and tried to meet her on several occasions to mend their relationship, but was unsuccessful. After the split, he accessed the victim's Instagram account and changed the linked email address to his own. He then accessed her Facebook and Instagram accounts on at least 139 occasions to check who she was speaking to on those platforms. The victim found out about this and made a police report on Nov 7, 2020 as she feared for her safety. By March 2021, it had become ""clear to the accused that the victim no longer wanted to be together with him"", stated court documents. On Mar 9 last year, Yap took three pairs of the victim's shoes from the flat where she was staying and threw them away. He did this because ""he now hated the victim and felt that she had hurt him"", according to court documents. Between Mar 8 and Mar 10 that year, he also took two pairs of shoes belonging to the victim's landlord, who was related to her, and threw them away. Deputy Public Prosecutor Thiagesh Sukumaran sought the sentence of eight weeks' jail. He said that while Yap's ex-girlfriend did not feel any significant harassment, the stalking happened over a prolonged period of at least six months. Yap also continued to stalk her even though she had made a police report, and despite knowing he was being investigated for offences under the Computer Misuse Act, said the prosecutor. Mr Sukumaran also said that while Yap abused his role at Singtel to surveil the victim and the other man, he did not use the customer information for any ""nefarious purposes"". As Yap and the victim had been in an intimate relationship, he was liable for enhanced punishment for the unlawful stalking offence. Those convicted of unlawful stalking can be jailed for up to a year, fined up to S$5,000 or both. The penalty for unauthorised access to computer material is jail for up to two years, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/lim-tean-charged-criminal-breach-trust-stalking-2679696,"Lim Tean charged with misappropriating S$30,000 and unlawful stalking","SINGAPORE: Lawyer and politician Lim Tean was charged on Thursday (May 12) with criminal breach of trust, unlawful stalking and being an unauthorised person who acted as an advocate or solicitor. The 57-year-old faces one charge of criminal breach of trust for allegedly misappropriating S$30,000 that was entrusted to him between Nov 14, 2019, and Dec 4, 2019, according to charge sheets. The police said on Tuesday that the sum was awarded to Lim's former client as a settlement in a motor injury civil suit. Lim also faces three charges of being an unauthorised person who acted as an advocate or solicitor. He is suspected of commencing, carrying on or defending court proceedings for clients on 32 occasions between Apr 1, 2021, and Jun 4, 2021. These include attending a hearing in the defamation suit that Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong brought against Mr Terry Xu, chief editor of the now-defunct The Online Citizen, on Apr 19 last year. Lim was Mr Xu's lawyer. He is also suspected of preparing documents and instruments relating to court proceedings on 33 occasions between Apr 1, 2021, and Jun 9, 2021, and suing out a writ of summons when acting for Jiangsu New Huaming International Trading on Apr 1, 2021. The police said on Tuesday that Lim was alleged to have acted as an advocate or solicitor without a valid practising certificate. Practising certificates are renewed on an annual basis for every practice year, which runs from Apr 1 to Mar 31 of the following year. Lim was also charged with unlawful stalking. The charge relates to the alleged harassment of a former employee of Lim's law firm in 2020. Police previously said that the employee referred them to text messages that she and Lim had exchanged. Between April and May 2020, Lim is accused of repeatedly sending her flirtatious text messages, causing her distress, according to charge sheets. Deputy Public Prosecutor Edwin Soh said the police required another two months for investigations into further potential offences that involve cheating and criminal breach of trust, with a possibility that Lim would be given more charges. Lim will return to court in July for a pre-trial conference. A number of his supporters attended the hearing at the State Courts on Thursday morning. After the hearing, Lim addressed them outside the building, thanking them for their support. Among the group were Ms Iris Koh, founder of the Healing the Divide Group, her husband Mr Raymond Ng and blogger Mr Leong Sze Hian. Lim, a lawyer with Carson Law Chambers, was arrested for alleged criminal breach of trust in 2020 and also investigated for alleged unlawful stalking at the time. His arrest came after he failed to attend a compulsory interview to assist with investigations, alleging that the investigations against him were ""politically motivated"", the police said in 2020. The offence of criminal breach of trust is punishable with jail for life, or jail for up to 20 years and a fine. Those convicted of unlawful stalking face up to a year in prison, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both. Unauthorised people who act as an advocate or a solicitor face up to six months in prison, a fine of up to S$25,000 or both, for first-time offenders. For repeat offenders, the maximum punishment is doubled."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/police-warn-job-scams-spoofed-smses-lazada-2678306,Police warn of job scams involving SMSes spoofing Lazada,"SINGAPORE: The police on Wednesday (May 11) warned about job scams involving unsolicited spoofed messages purportedly sent by Lazada offering job opportunities. There have been at least 50 victims since May, with losses amounting to at least S$430,000, said the police. ""In these cases, victims would receive unsolicited messages advertising highly paid affiliate marketing related jobs via SMS, WhatsApp or social media platforms,"" the police said in the news release on Wednesday. The fake SMSes will be shown in the same conversation as the authentic messages from the e-commerce platform, as the scammer had spoofed the platform's number or name, said the police. The scammers would tell victims that commissions would be given upon the completion of simple tasks online. They would then be directed to provide their personal details when they sign up for an account on a spoofed website resembling Lazada's. After doing so, they would be asked to complete tasks in order to earn commissions. The jobs would often begin with simple tasks such as liking products on the websites, where victims would earn S$2 commission for each like, said the police. Victims would be convinced that it was a legitimate job opportunity after being able to withdraw the initial commissions earned. They will then be promised commissions of up to 30 per cent if they were to purchase the items on the spoofed website. To make the purchase, the victims would have to transfer money to bank accounts belonging to ""unknown individuals"" for credit in their accounts. ""These victims would eventually discover that they had been scammed when they were unable to withdraw from their accounts, or when the spoofed Lazada website has been removed,"" said the police. A spokesperson from Lazada said that the e-commerce platform is aware of scammers misusing their name.  ""The spoofed messages are disguised to look like the real thing, but Lazada does not make job offers on unofficial channels,"" Lazada said. ""We are working closely with Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) in our fight against scammers and are on the SMS SenderID Protection Registry (SSIR) as part of our protective measures to safeguard customers, and ensure a safe shopping experience for everyone."" The police reminded people that Lazada does not conduct recruitment via SMS, WhatsApp or Telegram chats. It will also never direct users to a third-party website or request personal details to sign up for jobs. People should not accept dubious job offers that promise ""lucrative returns for minimal effort"", said the police, adding that people should never download applications from unverified sources. They should also never send money to anyone whom they do not know or have not met in person before.  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-racial-insults-librarian-healthcare-worker-chinese-2678161,"Man jailed for using racial insults on librarian, polyclinic workers","SINGAPORE: A 69-year-old man was sentenced to six weeks' jail on Wednesday (May 11) for using racial insults on a librarian and polyclinic workers on three occasions. Peethambaran Dilip pleaded guilty to one count of uttering words with deliberate intent to wound racial feelings, and two counts of using insulting words on public service workers. Three more charges were also considered for sentencing. The court heard that the first incident happened when Dilip went to Clementi Public Library on Jun 9 last year.  Closed-circuit television footage captured him lowering his mask, opening up a dustbin and spitting into it. A cleaner saw this and reported it to the library's management. Before Dilip left, a library officer approached him and advised him not to spit into the dustbin as it was unhygienic, especially with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The library officer was aware that Dilip had previously done the same thing, according to court documents. Dilip became unhappy and uttered remarks containing racial slurs towards the person.  The two other incidents involved workers at Marine Parade Polyclinic, where Dilip was known to staff as he had scolded workers there on previous occasions. On Jul 22 last year, Dilip went to the polyclinic to replenish his medication. He walked into a health monitoring station that was manned by a patient service associate. Dilip threw his queue ticket on the counter and uttered insults.   The patient service associate told Dilip to stop, but he did not. She informed the security guards who were on duty of this incident. On Oct 15 last year, Dilip again went to the polyclinic and approached a pharmacist at the pharmacy counter. The pharmacist asked Dilip if he was collecting his medication, to which he initially did not respond. When the pharmacist repeated the question, Dilip said: ""Of course, I am here to collect my medication. If not, why am I here for?"" before hurling racial abuse.  Dilip was liable for enhanced punishment for the two offences in the polyclinic due to a prior conviction under the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Orderand Nuisance) Act. The prosecution asked for at least six weeks' jail, noting that Dilip had violence-related antecedents. In 2017, Dilip was convicted and jailed six weeks for punching and slapping a bus driver. ""It is clear that the accused has a proclivity to treat service workers abusively. He escalated his abuse in the present case to incorporate racist insults,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Zhi Hao. ""This should be dealt with sternly, given the need to preserve racial harmony in Singapore."" He also noted that Dilip committed two of the offences against frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, and there were strong considerations to deter such conduct. The punishment for uttering words with deliberate intent to wound racial feelings is up to three years' jail, a fine or both. Those convicted of using insulting words on public service workers can be jailed for up to a year, fined up to S$5,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/religious-orders-boards-catholic-schools-report-archbishop-sexual-offences-2678166,"Religious orders, Catholic schools to report alleged sexual offences against minors and vulnerable people to archbishop immediately","SINGAPORE: The Catholic Church has reminded religious orders and Boards of Catholic schools of their obligation to report to the archbishop immediately once they are aware of alleged sexual offences against minors or those who are vulnerable. In a statement issued on its website on Wednesday (May 11), the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore added that all Catholic schools are also required to follow the Ministry of Education’s protocols and Singapore laws on reporting incidents involving sexual abuse of minors. The statement came after it emerged that the sexual offences committed by a prominent figure in the local Catholic community had been uncovered at least 11 years before the archbishop was said to have been informed of the abuse. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore said it is working with the religious order to investigate the background of the case which happened between 2005 and 2007. It added that it is concurrently taking steps to see how more information about the case can be publicly released in light of the existing gag order. The Singaporean man, a member of the religious order, was jailed for five years on May 5 for sexual offences against two teenage boys. The man was accused of having carnal intercourse by performing a sex act on a boy aged between 14 and 15 sometime between April 2007 and December 2007. He was also accused of performing the same act with another boy aged between 14 and 16 between January 2005 and December 2006. He had pleaded guilty to one charge of carnal intercourse against the order of nature and one charge of committing an indecent act with a young person. Two more charges for similar offences were considered for sentencing. “As the Church carries out its work … to prevent future incidents, we humbly seek the understanding of our Catholic community and members of the public; to give us the time and opportunity to make the necessary investigations and reviews,” said the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/delivery-rider-die-e-bike-accident-driver-jailed-2677916,Man jailed for careless driving in crash that killed delivery rider on e-bicycle,"SINGAPORE: A man was jailed for five months and banned from driving for eight years on Wednesday (May 11) for careless driving in a crash that caused the death of a delivery rider on a power-assisted bicycle. Ter Chee Kwang, 55, pleaded guilty to a charge of driving without due care or attention, causing the death of 42-year-old Leow Cheer Keong. Ter, who was a cleaning supervisor at the time of the offence, failed to keep a proper lookout while driving towards a junction along Sungei Road on the morning of May 13, 2021. The court heard that earlier that morning, Ter met his former colleague at a coffee shop for breakfast. At about 9.30am, Ter drank about three-quarters of a can of beer. Both men left the coffee shop at about 10am, with Ter agreeing to drive his companion to Beach Road. Sometime before 10.25am, Ter was driving his rental car along Sungei Road towards Kelantan Road. Mr Leow was riding his e-bicycle on the first lane of a two-lane road along Arab Street, a major road, towards Weld Road. Mr Leow, who had the right of way, then drove into the non-signalised cross junction of Sungei Road and Arab Street and continued straight from Ter's right side. Ter admitted to failing to keep a proper lookout and failing to give way to Mr Leow at the junction. Instead, after looking right then left, Ter accelerated forward into the junction without stopping, and went straight across it. At the junction, the front of Ter's car hit Mr Leow, flinging him off the e-bicycle and onto the pavement along Arab Street. Ter notified the police, who arrived with an ambulance at about 10.40am. Mr Leow was taken to the hospital unconscious. He was found to have sustained injuries including a skull fracture and pooling of blood at his head. Mr Leow underwent emergency surgery, but was pronounced dead at about 6pm. The cause of death was determined to be head injury. After the accident, Ter was made to take a breath analyser test as he reeked of alcohol. He failed the test and was arrested. Footage of the accident, captured by a Public Transport Security Command close-circuit television camera, was played in court. Forensic analysis of the video showed that the average speed of Ter's car at the time of the collision was about 34kmh to 41kmh. The speed of Mr Leow's e-bicycle could not be estimated with enough certainty. The analysis report also found that at the point of collision, the e-bicycle was likely to have been partially visible to Ter through the front windscreen. It could not be determined if Ter and Mr Leow could see each other's vehicles before the collision. However, Ter's view of oncoming traffic along Arab Street towards Weld Road would have been limited by some concrete with a guardrail, according to the report. That was at the stop line where drivers should stop to check the traffic before crossing the junction where the accident happened. The analysis similarly found that the concrete with a guardrail would have limited Mr Leow's view of traffic emerging from Sungei Road. The prosecution sought five to six months' jail and a driving ban of at least eight years. Deputy Public Prosecutor Shen Wanqin said the accident happened at an uncontrolled junction where vehicles travelling on the major road, such as Mr Leow's e-bicycle, have the right of way. She said that according to the Highway Code, a road user at a junction must look right, then left, then right again, and must not move off until they are sure it is safe to do so. ""Had (Ter) conducted adequate checks by, for example, looking right a second time, he would have seen the deceased and would not have accelerated into the junction,"" said Ms Shen. ""If his view of the oncoming traffic was affected, he could have, for example, inched his car out slowly, to check and ensure that it was safe before moving into the junction,"" she added. Ter, who was unrepresented, told the judge that he ""really did not have time to react as the bicycle was moving too fast"" and that he was remorseful. He said driving was his only way to earn a living and that he was supporting his wife, three-year-old daughter and elderly mother in a nursing home. In response, the prosecutor said that the conduct of the victim had no bearing on Ter's culpability and there was no evidence to show Mr Leow was travelling at a very fast speed. Those convicted of causing death by driving without due care or reasonable consideration can be jailed for up to three years, fined up to S$10,000 or both."

In a statement on Tuesday (May 10), the SPF said a police report was lodged on Apr 27 against a woman who had purportedly acted as an advocate and solicitor on at least three occasions, even though her practising certificate had expired. Acting on the report, investigations against the woman for an offence under Section 33 of the Legal Profession Act have begun, the police said.  According to the Singapore Courts website, all solicitors must apply for a practising certificate for every practice year - referring to the period between Apr 1 and Mar 31 - before acting in the capacity of an advocate and solicitor.  An unauthorised person found to have acted as an advocate or solicitor faces a fine of up to S$25,000 or a jail term of up to six months, or both. For subsequent offences, the penalty is a fine of up to S$50,000, imprisonment for up to 12 months, or both. The police declined further comment, citing ongoing investigations. CNA understands the woman in question is Ms Violet Netto, who represented Malaysian drug trafficker Nagaenthran Dharmalingam in his appeal against the death sentence.  Attempts to contact Ms Netto for comment were unsuccessful.  On Apr 26, the Court of Appeal dismissed a last-minute plea by Nagaenthran and his mother Madam Panchalai Supermaniam. Nagaenthran was hanged on Apr 27."

The club added that the group claimed they deserved priority as they had booked a sofa - one of the more premium tables at the nightspot.  After being told that all guests were ""treated equally"" and they would have to wait until there was sufficient space, the group then began verbally abusing the club's staff.  ""We explained the situation to them but the group continued to shout at our staff aggressively and demanded for the managers to come forward,"" said a Cherry Discotheque spokesperson.  As patrons waiting to reenter the club ""started to look frightened"", one of the managers then decided to refuse entry to the group because of their behaviour, the nightspot said.  ""Our staff informed the person whom the reservation was under that we were unable to re-admit them given their behaviour towards our staff,"" Cherry Discotheque said.  ""We invited him back into the club to claim the belongings of his group of friends, and refunded them for their unconsumed beverages."" The club said other members of the group were unhappy with the situation and started acting violently, pushing other patrons, knocking over queue poles and throwing punches at some staff members. ""The bouncers retreated and closed the door because they were afraid that the group would enter and attack other patrons as well,"" the club said.  After being hit by a queue pole in the head, Cherry Discotheque said its manager walked away from the group and tried calling the police. ""However, before the call could go through, he was assaulted by another member of the group,"" the club stated, noting that two other members of the group came over to kick the manager in the head while he was lying on the ground. ""A female patron tried to cover the manager’s head in a bid to stop the attack, but the group continued kicking the manager’s head,"" said Cherry Discotheque, adding the group then walked away.  Another employee called the police as the manager was being assaulted, while other staff members - who were previously inside the club - were made aware of what was going on and proceeded upstairs to help to control the situation, the nightspot said.  Cherry Discotheque told CNA that a few of its employees had to be medically assessed after they were injured.  ""One of the managers who suffered attacks to his head had to get stitches behind his ear, and was advised to go for further checks with a specialist,"" said a club spokesperson.  The manager went to the accident and emergency department that night and visited a brain and spine specialist earlier this week, the club said, without giving further details.  While waiting for the police to arrive, the group came back and started attacking Cherry Discotheque's staff again, the club said.  ""In order to defend themselves and the patrons in the queue, the bouncer threw the queue pole to create a distance between the group and the club. ""The actions taken by our staff were made purely out of self-defense and for the protection of themselves and our patrons,"" said the nightspot.  The group had left the scene when the police arrived.  “Our goal at Cherry Discotheque is to provide a safe and fun environment for people to enjoy good music and drinks responsibly. The well-being of our patrons and staff are most important to us,"" the club said.  Footage of the brawl outside the popular nightspot at 133 Cecil Street was widely shared on social media.  Videos posted by Facebook user Hebe Duanphen Lim showed men throwing queue poles and chairs at others at the entrance of the club. One man could be seen wrestling another to the ground.  The police said in a news release on Tuesday that five men, aged between 20 and 59, were arrested for rioting. Two others, aged 21 and 30, were sent to the hospital. Police investigations are ongoing."

There have been several victims since April, with losses amounting to at least S$2,000, said the police. In the first variant scammers would submit a request through a delivery platform. They would then contact the assigned courier and ask for help in purchasing iTunes gift cards from convenience stores at the pick-up location and delivering the gift cards to the drop-off location. Then, the scammer would ask the courier to scratch and reveal the code behind the card and send a photo of the code as proof of purchase.  After the courier has done so, the scammers would become uncontactable without reimbursing the courier’s payment for the gift cards. In the second scam variant, a remittance agency would be indicated as a pickup location for a delivery. The scammer would then contact the assigned courier and ask the courier to transfer a certain amount of money to an overseas account, promising an attractive tip of at least S$100 per remittance.  Victims would only realise they had been cheated when the scammers then became uncontactable and they found no one at the delivery location to make payment for the remittance. The police advised members of the public to observe these crime prevention measures: Providing remittance services without a licence is an offence that carries a fine of up to S$125,000, up to three years' jail, or both, the police warned. For more information on scams, members of the public can visit the scam alert website or call the Anti-Scam Hotline at 1800-722-6688."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/lorry-driver-hit-retiree-loading-bay-injuries-jail-driving-ban-2674881,"Lorry driver gets fine, ban for colliding into retiree at loading bay","SINGAPORE: A lorry driver was fined S$1,000 on Tuesday (May 10) for colliding into a retiree at a loading bay, causing injuries. Balakrishnan S Subramaniam, 68, also received a 10-month driving ban for class 4, 4A and 5 vehicles, which includes heavy vehicles. He pleaded guilty to a charge of endangering the personal safety of others through a negligent act. The court heard that Balakrishnan was driving a lorry at the loading and unloading bay of Valiant Industrial Building at around 11.50am on Apr 14, 2021. He parked the lorry beside a container chassis to wait for a parking lot. The victim, a 61-year-old retiree, was walking around the bay then and decided to go between the lorry and the container chassis. At the same time, Balakrishnan decided to move his lorry to park in a lot that had freed up. When he did so, he failed to keep a proper lookout and did not notice the victim walking between his lorry and the container chassis, according to court documents. The left side of the lorry collided into the victim, who was taken to the hospital. He was found to have sustained bilateral rib fractures and a liver contusion. He was hospitalised for four days and given 14 days of hospitalisation leave. Deputy Public Prosecutor Ang Siok Chen sought a fine of S$1,000 to S$1,500 and a driving ban. She said the injuries caused were relatively serious and amounted to grievous hurt. Defence lawyer Lolita Andrews asked for a fine of not more than S$1,000. She also asked for the driving ban not to exceed five months, and to cover only class 5 vehicles. She said that Balakrishnan was the sole breadwinner of his family, and that driving had been his livelihood for the past 30 years. She also argued that there were safety cones around the area that would have ensured pedestrians did not pass through such areas. ""We submit that it is humanly impossible for anyone to go through such a narrow space,"" said Ms Andrews. ""Yet the victim wiggled his way through these areas."" In response, the prosecutor said that Balakrishnan's charge was already reduced from his original charge of causing grievous hurt by a negligent act, which carries a higher penalty. This took into account any contributory actions by the victim, said Ms Ang. The judge granted an application for Balakrishnan's driving ban to be delayed by a month, giving him time to hire a driver to fulfil business contracts at his firm. The punishment for endangering the personal safety of others through a negligent act is jail for up to three months, a fine of up to S$1,500, or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/chan-soo-sen-ex-mp-man-jailed-recruit-hitmen-attack-2673361,Man jailed for organising assault on former MP Chan Soo Sen,"SINGAPORE: A man was jailed for more than one year and four months and fined S$20,000 on Monday (May 9) for offences including organising an assault on former Member of Parliament (MP) Chan Soo Sen. Khoo Tsu Peng, 68, pleaded guilty to a charge each of abetting an offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, abetting an offence of voluntarily causing hurt, and remote gambling. Another charge was also considered for sentencing. Mr Chan, 65, was a People's Action Party MP for East Coast Group Representation Constituency followed by Joo Chiat Single Member Constituency from 1997 to 2011. The court heard that sometime in October 2019, a man named Ho Soo Foong told Khoo that he wanted to teach Mr Chan a lesson by getting someone to assault him for a five-figure sum. Ho told Khoo that he was enraged as he suspected that his daughter, or his friend's daughter, was having an affair with Mr Chan. In fact, Ho suspected that his wife was having the affair, but did not reveal this to Khoo as he was embarrassed, according to court documents. As part of their arrangement, Ho showed Khoo a photo of Mr Chan. Khoo offered the job to Mohd Ali Osman, 59, who agreed to do it for S$25,000. Ali in turn recruited another assailant, Muhammad Raimi Saharudin, 30, telling the younger man that he would be paid if he threw chilli powder and broke the victim's leg. Ali also told Raimi that Mr Chan would usually take the bus at a bus stop along Pasir Panjang Road, and both men travelled there to scout the area. On the evening of Dec 26, 2019, Ali called Raimi and told him to head to the bus stop. Bringing a wooden stick with him, Raimi rushed there on a motorcycle and waited for Mr Chan.
 
Near midnight, Mr Chan alighted from a bus. Raimi recognised the victim from a photo Ali had shown him. He approached Mr Chan and threw a packet of reddish orange powder at him, then hit him on his back with a wooden stick several times. The victim fell to the ground. After this, Raimi shouted: ""You know what you have done."" He then rode away on his motorcycle, stopping at a petrol station to throw the wooden stick away. The next day, Ali told Khoo and Ho that the job was done. In total, Ho passed S$20,000 to Ali for the job, of which Raimi received S$3,000. Ho did not pay the remaining S$5,000 as ""he was unhappy that the police had commenced investigations against him"", according to court documents. Mr Chan made a police report on the night of the attack. He suffered bruises over his left elbow and knees and a contusion on his back.  Forensic analysis on the reddish orange powder found that it contained carbohydrates, capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin, which are substances found in chilli peppers. Raimi was previously sentenced to jail for his involvement, while Ho's and Ali's cases are still being dealt with. In a separate case, Khoo admitted to organising another attack on a 44-year-old man who was in a dispute with Khoo's good friend over alleged gambling winnings. The victim was punched and kicked by two men near a coffee shop, and sustained a nasal fracture and blunt injury with contusions to his face, scalp and clavicle. Khoo also admitted to facilitating participation by others in illegal horse betting and 4D betting. Deputy Public Prosecutors Sean Teh and Deborah Lee said that Khoo's culpability was high in the attack on Mr Chan as he ""facilitated the recruitment of a hitman"" when he knew this was a revenge attack. Asking for a total sentence of one-and-a-half years' jail and a S$20,000 fine, the prosecutors also cited the significant planning and premeditation and the use of a weapon in the attack. Those convicted of abetting an offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt can be jailed for up to 10 years, fined and caned. Khoo cannot be caned as he is over 50. Those guilty of abetting an offence of voluntarily causing hurt can be jailed for up to three years, fined up to S$5,000 or both. The penalty for facilitating a remote gambling offence is up to five years' jail, a fine between S$20,000 and S$200,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-charged-child-abuse-young-daughter-punch-kick-2672811,"Man charged with repeatedly abusing young girl by punching, kicking her","SINGAPORE: A 50-year-old man was on Monday (May 9) charged with repeatedly abusing a young girl in his care by punching and kicking her. The man cannot be named as this could lead to identification of the victim. He was given five charges of ill-treatment of a child, and a charge of voluntarily causing hurt to a 29-year-old woman. On Sep 28, 2018, when the girl was six, he allegedly punched the side of her face once and caned her arms, legs, back and buttocks. In 2021, when the girl was nine, he allegedly caned her face, back and arm. On another occasion that year, he is also accused of punching and kicking her arm and back, and caning her hand. On Feb 1, he allegedly punched the girl's head and body and kicked her multiple times at about 8am. More than four hours later, he allegedly caned her back and head. The man is also accused of punching the older woman in the head and hitting her back multiple times on Feb 1. He was granted bail of S$15,000 and will return to court later this month.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-kick-4-year-old-stepdaughter-stomach-died-jail-2672731,"Man given jail, caning for kicking stomach of 4-year-old stepdaughter, who later died","SINGAPORE: A man was sentenced to nine years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane on Monday (May 9) for kicking the abdomen of his four-year-old stepdaughter, who later died. Muhammad Salihin Ismail, 29, was convicted in March of voluntarily causing grievous hurt after a High Court judge acquitted him of murder. He had contested the capital charge at trial. The assault took place on Sep 1, 2018, when Salihin pushed the girl, causing her to fall down, and kicked her twice in the abdomen while she lay on the floor. This happened after the girl urinated on the floor instead of the toilet bowl. The court previously heard that she was being toilet-trained in preparation for school. After the assault, the victim complained of stomach ache in the evening, lost her appetite and vomited periodically overnight. Salihin and the girl's mother applied ointment on her stomach. They did not seek medical attention until she collapsed the next morning. She was then taken to the hospital and pronounced dead. An autopsy found that the girl died from blood within the peritoneal cavity due to blunt force trauma to the abdomen. In March, Salihin was acquitted of murder after Justice Pang Khang Chau found that the prosecution did not prove that he intentionally inflicted injury on the victim. The man had testified that he was reacting angrily when kicking the girl and ""simply kicked what was in front of him, which happened to be the victim's abdomen"", said the judge then. ""The accused's action when applying ointment on the victim's abdomen after she complained of stomach ache corroborates that the accused did not know where his second kick landed,"" he said. ""Thus, although the accused had kicked the victim intentionally, there was no intention to strike the part of the body where the injury was found and also no intention to strike with sufficient force to cause the kind of injury found to be present."" The prosecution has appealed against Salihin's acquittal on the murder charge and will also appeal against his sentence, the Attorney-General's Chambers said on Tuesday morning. Two other charges of child abuse by Salihin against the same victim were considered for sentencing. In 2017, he placed a showerhead with hot water flowing out of it on the girl's back for five to six seconds, causing scald marks. In 2018, he slammed the girl's head against the floor, causing bruising. Deputy Public Prosecutor Senthilkumaran Sabapathy sought 10 years' jail and caning, citing the young age and vulnerability of the victim, as well as the abuse of trust and authority involved in the offence. Mr Sabapathy argued that Salihin's failure to seek medical help for more than 12 hours, until the victim lost consciousness and it was ""far too late"", was an additional aggravating factor. Salihin delayed seeking medical attention out of self-preservation, argued the prosecutor, who noted the man's admissions during the trial that he also did not tell his wife about the incident with the girl. If Salihin had been candid about his actions, it would have been apparent that the girl's stomach ache and vomiting were serious and that she needed care, argued the prosecutor. Instead, the victim ""suffered a very slow and painful death"". He also argued that this was not an isolated incident. In 2017, when Salihin scalded the victim with hot water, this caused extensive peeling of her skin but no medical attention was sought, said the prosecutor. Defence lawyer Suang Wijaya sought seven-and-a-half years' jail and caning, arguing that Salihin was genuinely remorseful and had cooperated with investigations. He cited Salihin's young age of 25 when he committed the offence, and the fact that he had admitted the particulars of the incident to investigators at an early stage. He also contended that there was insufficient evidence to prove Salihin knew the victim needed emergency medical care, and not enough evidence to infer that he prioritised self-preservation or showed blatant disregard for her welfare. Justice Pang said that as a general principle, delay in seeking medical attention for the victim was not relevant as an aggravating factor. This was because the offender's culpability should relate to the manner in which the offence was committed, and not what happened after, said the judge. However, he accepted that in cases where a vulnerable victim was dependent on the offender for care and attention, such a delay might be a relevant factor. Justice Pang said that he agreed with the defence that there was insufficient evidence to show deliberate delay on Salihin's part. This was because the victim had no visible external injuries, and her discomfort and vomiting may not have sufficiently alerted Salihin that she had sustained serious injuries, said the judge. The penalty for voluntarily causing grievous hurt is a jail term of up to 10 years and a fine or caning."

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/catholic-order-prominent-figure-sex-offences-archbishop-informed-2020-2668326,Catholic Church says archbishop of Singapore was informed in October 2020 of sex offence cases involving prominent figure,"SINGAPORE: The archbishop of Singapore William Goh was informed about sex offence cases involving a prominent Catholic figure in October 2020, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore said on Friday (May 6). During the man's trial, it emerged that his offences had been uncovered in 2009 by a leader of the Catholic order of which he was a member - at least 11 years before the archbishop was said to have been informed of the cases. On Thursday, the man was sentenced to five years' jail. Separately, the police also said on Friday they have issued a written advisory to a man for not reporting the offences to the police after learning about them. Once alerted to the cases, the archbishop gave instructions for the matter to be reported to the police and to Catholic authorities in Rome. In response to CNA queries, the archdiocese said: ""The Roman Catholic Archbishop was only informed of the case in October 2020, during which time he gave instructions that the matter be reported to the police as it was a criminal offence and that a report be made directly to the Dicastery for Consecrated Life in Rome and to inform and update the Archbishop of the Diocese where the offence was committed in accordance with Vatican protocols.” Archbishop William Goh became leader of the Catholic Church in Singapore in May 2013, taking over from former archbishop Nicholas Chia, who held the top post from 2001 to 2013. In 2009, one of the victims had told the sector leader of the Catholic order in Singapore about what had happened. The sector leader counselled the boy and offered to escalate the matter to the police. However, the boy refused. The offender was questioned by his religious superior about the victim's allegations, and he admitted that they were true. He was immediately suspended from his responsibilities. In June 2009, the offender left Singapore to receive treatment under a six-month therapy programme at an institute in the United States. ""As no police reports were lodged by the victims, he was not under police investigation then,"" court documents stated. On Friday, the police said upon completing the investigations, they have - in consultation with the Attorney-General’s Chambers - issued a written advisory to a 64-year-old man to remind him of his legal obligations under Section 424 of the Criminal Procedure Code. ""Organisations and members of the public are advised to report sexual crime cases to the police,"" they said. ""Police investigations are confidential, and police officers are trained to manage victims sensitively and appropriately."" The Archdiocese said on Friday that religious orders within the Church, such as the one the man belonged to, have their own systems of governance. “Religious orders within the Roman Catholic Church are separately constituted and are governed by their own judicial proceedings and administration of law,” the archdiocese said. “The Archdiocese regrets that we cannot offer more information than what has been provided because of the gag order imposed by the courts.” After completing the therapy programme, the man was posted to a different country where his work did not involve minors. He would return to Singapore for one to two weeks at a time to visit his family, and had no further contact with the victims. In March 2020, the offender came back to Singapore to renew his missionary visa, which was expiring. However, he was unable to return overseas due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In late 2020, the offender's history was brought to the attention of the board of a school to which he was linked. On May 10 last year, following an internal inquiry, the chairman of the school board lodged a police report. The police started investigations and arrested the offender on Jan 18 this year. He was charged in court two days later. On Thursday, the man was sentenced to five years in prison for sexual offences against two teenage boys. He had pleaded guilty to one charge of carnal intercourse against the order of nature and one charge of committing an indecent act with a young person. Two more charges for similar offences were considered for sentencing. The offences took place sometime between January 2005 and December 2007. The identities of the victims are protected by gag order. The man cannot be named due to gag orders prohibiting the publication of his name, designation, appointment and a school to which he was linked. On Thursday morning, Archbishop Goh said that he was ""dismayed, shocked and ashamed"" over the case, adding that the incident was a ""wake-up call for us all to take our spiritual life seriously"". ""As Archbishop and leader of the Catholic Community in Singapore, I humbly apologise on behalf of the Church,"" he said in a letter posted on the Archdiocese's website. ""My heartfelt sympathy to those who have suffered on account of this crime. I pray that they will find healing and closure, and we journey with them as a Church through this pain. May justice be rendered accordingly."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-stab-wheelchair-bound-wife-suspect-having-affair-2667741,Man jailed for stabbing wheelchair-bound wife over delusion that she was having an affair,"SINGAPORE: More than 30 years into their marriage, a man suspected that his wife was having an affair with the head of a community services centre who had assisted them three years ago. On an early morning in August 2019, Fong Tuck Whye attacked his wife with four knives to prevent her from leaving him, including stabbing her in the vaginal area.  Fong, now 67, was jailed for five years on Friday (May 6) after pleading guilty to a charge of attempted culpable homicide. He and the victim, now 63, divorced last year. The victim suffered from polio, and had been mostly confined to a wheelchair and unable to work since 2006. After the attack, Fong was diagnosed with psychosis of late onset with delusional disorder that substantially impaired his mental responsibility. In sentencing, Justice Valerie Thean noted that Fong's psychosis was causally linked to his offence. The court heard that in 2014 to 2015, around the time Fong stopped working as a driver, he became ""protective"" of the victim and would not allow her to leave their flat alone or carry a phone. In 2016, the victim approached social service agencies for help as she felt that her husband had a mental illness. The male head of a community services centre visited the couple to assist them, and staff members from the centre delivered food to them in February that year. However, Fong went to the community services centre later that month and accused the centre head of being an ""imposter"". He refused further assistance and there was no more interaction between the couple and the centre head. Fong also began telling the victim's siblings that she was having an affair with the centre head, but they did not believe him. Three years later, in early 2019, the victim had a fall and moved into her brother's flat so he could care for her. Fong would sometimes stay overnight. On Aug 10, 2019, Fong decided to attack the victim to prevent the head of the social services centre from taking her away from him, according to court documents. In the early hours of the morning, he covered the closed-circuit television cameras in the living room with newspapers. Between 6am and 7.20am, he took knives from the kitchen into the victim's bedroom, woke her up and attacked her by stabbing and slashing her multiple times. The victim tried to defend herself and called to her brother for help, but he was unable to stop the attack and called the police. During the attack, Fong tried to spray insecticide into the victim's eyes to stop her from resisting. He also used a knife to stab her in the vaginal area as he wanted her to feel pain so she would not be able to have an affair with the centre head, according to court documents. When police arrived, they saw Fong squatting next to the victim who was lying in a pool of blood with a knife still plunged into her body. He was arrested at the scene. The victim suffered extensive incised wounds over her face, partial amputation of her right ear and wounds over her chest, abdomen and upper limbs. Her head and face were permanently disfigured by the attack, due to multiple scars sustained from the injuries. She also suffered significant blood loss. She was given 53 days of hospitalisation leave and assessed to be recovering well and coping well psychologically. An Institute of Mental Health (IMH) psychiatrist found that Fong suffered from pathological jealousy and persecutory beliefs, which resulted in an abnormal state of mind during the attack. This abnormal mental state rendered Fong ""significantly less able to control his spiralling emotions regarding his paranoid suspicions"", according to court documents. The psychiatrist also said that Fong remained a ""highly dangerous"" person, and suggested that involuntary detention in a psychiatric institution could be in his best interests. Both the prosecution and defence agreed that a sentence of five years' jail was reasonable. Fong cannot be caned as he is over 50. Deputy Public Prosecutors Timotheus Koh and R Arvindren said that the sentence would provide a long enough runway for an assessment of whether Fong could be safely released.  ""If the accused is still dangerous at the end of his imprisonment term, he can still be detained under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act,"" they said. Defence lawyer Ng Pei Qi also submitted a letter from Fong's sister indicating that he could live with her after his release, and that he would have family support. Justice Thean said that the five-year term, backdated to Fong's arrest in August 2019, would give medical professionals time to make considered decisions on his longer term care and future. Those convicted of attempt to commit culpable homicide can be jailed for up to seven years, fined or both. Anyone who causes hurt to another person by such an act can be jailed for up to 15 years, fined, caned or receive any combination of such punishments."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/fairprice-employees-bribes-fish-suppliers-2667706,"2 former FairPrice employees charged with receiving bribes of more than S$500,000 from fish suppliers","SINGAPORE: Two former employees of grocery chain NTUC FairPrice were charged on Friday (May 6) after they allegedly received more than S$500,000 in bribes from fish suppliers over seven years. Three other people linked to the fish supply business will also be charged in connection with these alleged offences.  Lim Kian Kok, 47, and See Hock Lam, 69, were working as senior team leader and team leader respectively at the company at the time of the offences, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) said in a news release. They were accused of conspiring to corruptly obtain bribes of about S$532,000 from various individuals involved in the fish supply industry from 2013 to 2020. “The gratification was allegedly obtained as inducement for (Lim) to further the business interests of various fish suppliers with NTUC FairPrice,” CPIB said. Lim received 34 charges under the Prevention of Corruption Act. Of these, 31 are linked to his alleged acts of conspiring with See. The remaining charges were for purportedly obtaining bribes of about S$28,300 from other people in the fish supply business in 2020, also to help further their business interests with FairPrice. See received 31 charges. The three other people charged in connection with Lim and See’s alleged offences are 47-year-old Chew Kim Hwee, 65-year-old Heah Han Huat and 57-year-old Ng Keng Meng.

Heah, who was sole proprietor of Ocean Trust Trading, and Ng, who was a partner of Nam Soon Sin Kee & Co, will each face eight charges for corruptly giving Lim bribes of S$43,500 and S$217,500 respectively from 2013 to 2020."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/quah-su-ling-john-soh-guilty-market-rigging-8-billion-penny-stock-crash-2013-2666246,Duo found guilty of 349 charges over S$8 billion penny stock crash in 2013,"SINGAPORE: A High Court judge on Thursday (May 5) convicted two people linked to a scheme that wiped out S$8 billion from the Singapore stock market in 2013, in what prosecutors called ""the most serious case"" of market manipulation in the country. John Soh Chee Wen, a prominent Malaysian businessman, and Quah Su-ling, former CEO of Singapore Exchange(SGX)-listed IPCO International, were convicted of 180 and 169 charges respectively. From August 2012 to October 2013, Quah and Soh artificially inflated the share prices of three penny stocks, Blumont, Asiasons and LionGold. The scheme unravelled on Oct 4, 2013 when the share prices of the three companies crashed, erasing S$8 billion in market capitalisation from SGX. The duo's offences included false trading, price manipulation, deception and cheating. Soh was also convicted of witness tampering. The verdict came at the end of a trial that was heard before Justice Hoo Sheau Peng over almost 200 days, involving close to 100 prosecution witnesses. Justice Hoo found that Soh and Quah conspired to manipulate the market for and price of the three penny stocks by controlling, obtaining financing for, conducting illegitimate trading activity in, and coordinating their use of 189 securities trading accounts. These accounts were held with 20 financial institutions in the names of 60 individuals and companies. The prosecution's case was that the duo drew on personal and professional relationships to obtain control over 164 accounts, with the remaining 25 accounts under Quah's own name or companies under her control. The bulk of their charges - 106 counts of deception - were for deceiving financial institutions by concealing their involvement when giving instructions to make orders and trades. Soh was additionally found guilty of witness tampering by asking four witnesses to lie to investigators after the stock market crash. The hearing was adjourned for sentencing on another date. Quah remains out on bail, while Soh has been on remand and wore a purple prison jumpsuit to court.  A third co-accused, 59-year-old Goh Hin Calm, was previously sentenced to three years' jail in 2019 after pleading guilty to two charges of false trading and market rigging. Goh, then a senior finance and administrative manager at IPCO, provided Soh and Quah with multiple trading accounts opened in his and his wife's name, and received and made payments for the scheme."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/trainer-pleads-guilty-french-bulldog-die-car-boot-2666136,Dog trainer pleads guilty after two French bulldogs left in her car boot die,"SINGAPORE: A dog trainer pleaded guilty on Thursday (May 5) after two dogs that were in her care died as a result of being left in a car boot for around 90 minutes. Sabrina Sim Xin Huey, 30, had been accused of failing to remove the two French bulldogs from her car after she had parked, resulting in them being subjected to heat exposure and eventually dying from heat stress. Court documents showed that in January 2020, Sim - who has been a dog trainer since 2014 - had been engaged by the complainant to train one of her dogs for 10 sessions.  Sim was subsequently engaged to train her other dog when it arrived in Singapore as well.  The dogs, named Chocoby and Hunniby, were both imported by the complainant - who was not named - from Australia into Singapore.  ""The arrangement involved boarding and training services where both dogs would stay with the accused during the whole training period,"" said National Parks Board prosecutor Andy Dinesh in his statement of facts.  On Aug 25, 2020, Sim drove both dogs in her car to a training session, which started at about 12.30pm and ended at around 1.45pm. The dogs were placed by Sim in the boot of the vehicle, which was a hatchback with an open boot area. ""After the session, the accused placed both dogs in the car boot of her car and drove home,"" said Mr Dinesh, noting the vehicle's air-conditioning was switched on during this journey. Sim reached home at about 2.30pm and parked her car, turning off the engine and thus ending the airconditioning, said Mr Dinesh, noting the vehicle's windows were also wound up.  The car was parked in an unsheltered spot in the open-air carpark, the prosecutor added.  ""Distracted by a social media post involving a former customer’s second dog being bitten by another dog, the accused forgot to remove both dogs from the car when she exited the car,"" he said.  Sim then closed the car door - leaving both animals in the car boot - and went up to her apartment. At about 4:00 pm, she realised she had left the two dogs in the car and immediately ran to the vehicle, finding both animals unresponsive. Sim then sent both dogs to a nearby veterinary clinic, which she reached at about 4.30pm, where they were examined by the vet. Both dogs were found to be dead by the time they arrived at the clinic. Tissue samples from Chocoby were sent for a post-mortem examination, with the veterinary pathology report stating that the French bulldog had been in a stressful state prior to its demise with increased turnover of erythrocytes, or red blood cells.  ""A medical summary dated Apr 3, 2022 stated that the histopathology findings showed no evidence of infection nor inflammation and supported the diagnosis of heat stress as the cause of death,"" said Mr Dinesh.  Sim pleaded guilty to one charge of failing to take reasonable steps to ensure that the dog was not confined in a manner that subjected it to unnecessary pain and suffering, with another charge taken into consideration.  Sim will return to court for sentencing on Jun 1.  She faces a fine up to S$40,000 or imprisonment for up to two years, or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/china-official-impersonation-scam-victim-shares-story-ransom-money-2665871,'I really trusted them': Victim of China official impersonation scam shares his story,"SINGAPORE: When he received a call from someone claiming to be a Chinese government official about a plot to have him or his family members kidnapped, 21-year-old Sam* found himself agreeing to help with investigations.  The officials on the phone claimed that they needed photos and videos of Sam with makeup of bruises on his face to smoke out the people behind the ploy. Believing that he needed to comply and assist with official investigations, Sam met them at a specified location and complied with their instructions.  What began as a bid to keep his family safe ended in a scam. The scammer posing as the Chinese official sent the photos and videos to Sam’s parents in China and asked for 1 million yuan (S$208,000) in ransom money for his release.  “I feel ashamed and guilty ... If I had been more careful, then things wouldn’t have turned out this way. ""Because of this, a lot of people got involved and a lot of people were worried about me. I want to say sorry to them,” Sam told journalists over Zoom on May 5 (Thursday).  Adding that he wanted to share his story so that other people can avoid making the same mistake, he said: “They spent a lot of time building up my trust. And I really trusted them.”  Sam, who is a university student here, received a call from the scammer on Apr 25, instructing him to go to a location to take photos and videos of himself with bruises and tied up with a rope. After taking the photos and videos of him, they told him to meet a government official at Changi Airport. (*Not his real name) On Mar 4, the police warned against the re-emergence of the China official impersonation scam. In April, the police said there were at least 109 victims who lost a total of at least S$14.6 million since January to scammers impersonating Chinese officials.  According to senior investigation officer Kor Ching Kiat with the Singapore Police Force’s (SPF) anti-scam command and commercial affairs department, the scammer first got in touch with Sam in late March, and made constant contact.  “I think they swore him to secrecy and tried to isolate him from his family and friends,"" he said.  ""I think that will help to perpetuate the crime if they feel so helpless they have no other means but to really listen to these persons who are now impersonating government officials that they are the only person that can help them."" While victims have previously gone missing under the instructions of scammers in other cases, the introduction of makeup for bruises to suggest duress or violence to make the family members feel more pressured to send the ransom money was new, said ASP Kor.  The scammer made a very convincing Chinese government official, Sam said, adding that they used methods that made them look like the real thing. He declined to elaborate more as investigations were still ongoing.  “They posed as government officials, and said they caught some people. In their documents, they said they saw plans to kidnap me or my family,” he said, stressing that the scheme was very elaborate.  “Because I wanted to keep my family safe, I listened to the plans of these ‘officials’. They asked me to help to find the people behind these ‘plans’. Of course, now we know that this is false, but it was a very long process in gaining my trust.”  He was found by the police at Jewel Changi Airport on Apr 27, after his next-of-kin in Singapore reported his disappearance.  When the police arrived, he thought it was regarding the alleged case that the “officials” were investigating. But he soon understood that he had been tricked.  While he thought about contacting his parents to let them know he was safe before following the scammer’s instructions, they convinced him not to talk to his parents as the matter was urgent.  “I did think about contacting my parents first, and then going to the police together. But I wasn’t able to talk to them that day,” Sam said.  “In hindsight, I also find it a bit funny that I chose to believe the scammers because I wanted to keep my family safe. But because I believed them, my family members were so worried.”  He is also not sure how the scammer got hold of his parents’ phone numbers in China. According to screengrabs of messages between them provided by the police, Sam’s parents had asked the scammer for a video call with their son to guarantee his safety. However, the scammer declined and urged them to send the money instead. His parents then asked for more time to gather the money, but no transfer of funds was ever made.  “I think need to reflect on this. Why did I listen to them? Why was I tricked by them? I think it was very foolish,"" Sam said on Thursday.  ""I want to let more people know who might get tricked, to not be like me. Luckily, we did not suffer any losses. I’m very sorry for all the trouble I’ve caused."" While his parents did not scold him too much and were just relieved to see him safe, Sam said his biggest regret was getting them involved in the case.  “Because of something totally false, my parents were hurt and felt very sad and worried for me. This is not something I want to see. When I talked to them after it was all over, I said 'sorry' many times,” he said.  “Even though I was the one who got tricked, I feel the worst about getting my parents involved ... After making a mistake, you need to know how to reflect, to make sure that it doesn’t happen a second time.”  A 25-year-old man has been arrested and a 15-year-old boy is under investigation for their alleged involvement in this China official impersonation scam, the police said on Apr 29.  The man and the boy are also believed to be victims of a China officials impersonation scam, the police added. These two individuals received similar calls like what Sam had - from scammers impersonating as government officials, said ASP Kor.  “They have also been isolated in a way that they can only believe that only these impersonators can only help them, and therefore assisted them in some way with their actions to perpetuate this crime,"" he said.  The man had purportedly given Sam a mobile phone with a SIM card for him to communicate with the scammer, acting on the scammer’s instructions.  The teenager allegedly bought and handed over several items - such as a mobile phone with a SIM card, dried food, cosmetics, rope and bandage tape - to the victim under the scammer’s instructions. The Chinese police, Interpol or any other law enforcement agency do not have jurisdiction in Singapore to arrest people, or request them to assist in any form of investigations, without the approval of the Singapore Government, said ASP Kor.  Requests to assist with an investigation and then being asked to keep it a secret are telltale signs of a scam, he added. Other signs include scams that ask for bank details, passwords or those that ask individuals to make payments.  “They should take care when they receive calls from unsolicited numbers, or those that they do not understand or those they do not know the origins of, such as those with the prefix +65 or from any other countries,” said ASP Kor.  “Most important is what I said about isolation. When in doubt, they should seek help."" When someone is isolated, they may have behavioural changes, and family members should look out for these changes as well and find out the reason behind it, he added. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tuas-checkpoint-car-crash-police-chase-passengers-jail-2665936,Jail for 2 passengers who were in car that crashed at Tuas Checkpoint during police chase,"SINGAPORE: Two passengers who were in a car that crashed when it tried to dash through Tuas Checkpoint last month were jailed for five weeks on Thursday (May 4). Chinese national Chen Songqing, 35, and Vietnamese national Ho Thi My Nhung, 31, each pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal trespass. Both had another charge of failing to present a valid travel document considered for sentencing. An Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officer was injured in the incident at Tuas Checkpoint on Apr 8, which triggered a lockdown of the entire complex. The driver of the car, 46-year-old Singaporean Teo Thiam Leng, faces a charge each of dangerous driving and abetting the importation of methamphetamine in 2016. He is set to return to court next week. Teo was wanted by the police and Central Narcotics Bureau at the time of the incident, the ICA previously said. The court heard that Teo had an outstanding drug offence in Singapore and absconded to Malaysia in 2017, where he was also involved in drug-related offences. At about 2am on Apr 8, Teo was driving a Malaysia-registered car in Malaysia with Chen and Ho in the back seat. They were headed to Chen's home in Malaysia. While driving, Teo spotted a Malaysian police car with its blinkers on, and assumed that it wanted to arrest him. He decided to drive quickly to get away from the police car. Teo sped away, and the police car gave chase. Chen and Ho told him to stop, but he continued to drive all the way to the Malaysian checkpoint. There, he dashed through Malaysia's toll and checkpoint counters. He then sped towards Singapore with the police car continuing to give chase behind him. Teo continued to drive quickly towards the motorcycle arrival zone at Tuas Checkpoint. At about 2.15am, three officers at the entrance signalled for Teo to stop his car as the area was only for motorcycles. Teo instead dashed through the entrance. One of the officers had to quickly move out of the way to avoid being hit by the car. Teo continued speeding into the motorcycle arrival zone, where he crashed into one of the drop-arm barriers. ICA officers rushed towards him, shouted at him to stop and tried to contain the car. However, Teo continued to drive dangerously back and forth, crashing into metal barriers and structures inside the arrival zone. Chen and Ho got out of the car and were instructed by an ICA officer to stay put by the side where it was safer. However, Teo suddenly reversed his car towards the officer, who fell down. At this point, Chen and Ho decided to escape from the scene as they did not want to get into trouble with Singaporean authorities, according to court documents. As they ran away, the ICA officer who had fallen down could not chase after them, while other officers remained focused on containing Teo's vehicle, which posed an immediate danger to security. They jumped off a parapet at the motorcycle arrival zone and went towards a cargo arrival zone that was restricted to cargo vehicles only. ""Chen and Ho knew that they should not enter the area without permission, as there were metal barriers at the area and there were numerous cargo vehicles there awaiting clearance,"" stated court documents. Both committed criminal trespass by entering the cargo arrival zone. They continued walking inside while trying to evade detection. As the entire complex was on lockdown by then, the officers stationed at the cargo arrival zone were on high alert. They spotted Chen and Ho walking around and shouted at them to stop. Chen and Ho stopped trying to escape and were arrested. Teo was also separately detained. As a result of the incident, Tuas Checkpoint Complex was under lockdown for almost 40 minutes, during which officers were on high alert and traffic could not proceed. More than 15 law enforcement officers were activated to attend to the incident, including patrolling and reviewing CCTV footage to ensure all those involved were arrested. The Police Coast Guard was also activated to conduct a sweep of the sea off Tuas Checkpoint to ensure there were no other people trying to enter by sea, according to court documents. The punishment for criminal trespass is jail for up to three months, a fine of up to S$1,500 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/11-charged-fraud-jobs-support-scheme-covid-19-police-2665626,"11 people charged over defrauding Jobs Support Scheme, 2 other COVID-19 government grants","SINGAPORE: Eleven people were charged in court on Thursday (May 5) for allegedly attempting to defraud government financial support schemes.  The individuals, aged between 28 and 65, allegedly tried to obtain payouts under the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS), said the police in a news release. Three of them also face similar charges in connection with the COVID-19 Support Grant and the Temporary Relief Fund. Gay Kah Leong and Tan Zhong Lin from Deidrea of Kings Spa SG were charged with allegedly attempting to cheat the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) into disbursing a JSS payout of about S$50,000.  This was in respect of 36 people who did not perform work or receive salaries as declared, said the police.  The duo, along with seven other individuals, were also charged with alleged involvement in falsifying the employment contracts and payslips submitted to IRAS, as well as furnishing false information. Gay and two others were additionally charged with allegedly cheating or attempting to cheat the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) into disbursing funds under the COVID-19 Support Grant and Temporary Relief Fund when they did not suffer job or income loss due to the pandemic. The police also said Teoh Wong Har of TK Manufacturing and Wholesale Centre and Wong Lai Kook of Double Ace Associates were charged with allegedly attempting to cheat IRAS into disbursing JSS payouts in respect of individuals who were either not employed or who did not perform the work as declared.  The payouts would have amounted to about S$15,000. The three financial support schemes were launched by the Government during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The JSS, administered by IRAS, offered wage support to employers so they could retain their local employees.  To ensure that JSS payouts were fairly and correctly disbursed, the police said IRAS conducted reviews of higher risk cases using data analytics and information provided by the public. It then adjusted or denied JSS payouts to employers who were unable to substantiate their eligibility. Egregious cases, such as those suspected of submitting false documents to IRAS, would be referred to the police.  The COVID-19 Support Grant and the Temporary Relief Fund administered by MSF offered financial support to Singaporeans who suffered job loss or income loss. Those found guilty of cheating face up to 10 years in jail and are liable to a fine, while those found guilty of falsification of accounts may be imprisoned for up to 10 years, fined, or both.  Those who are found to have furnished false information may be jailed up to three years, fined, or both.  The police said they take a serious stance against the abuse of government grants, especially where this involves the “diversion of resources from those in genuine need of assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic”.  Offenders will be dealt with severely in accordance with the law, they added.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/wirecard-citadelle-false-documents-charge-british-national-osullivan-2665506,British national linked to Wirecard case given two more charges for allegedly abetting to falsify documents,"SINGAPORE: A British national linked to a case involving collapsed German payments firm Wirecard was on Thursday (May 5) given two additional counts of allegedly abetting to falsify documents, said the Singapore Police Force (SPF).  James Henry O'Sullivan, 47, had purportedly instigated R Shanmugaratnam - the director of local accounting firm Citadelle Corporate Services - to issue letters to Wirecard that falsely confirmed that Strategic Corporate Investments, another company, held certain sums of money under escrow in its bank account, which it did not. In September last year, O'Sullivan had been handed five charges of abetting Shanmugaratnam in the falsification of documents.  Strategic’s director Thilagaratnam Rajaratnam, 58, was also charged in court on Thursday. He was alleged to have failed to use reasonable diligence in the discharge of the duties of his office, by signing letters confirming that Strategic held certain sums of money under escrow in its bank account, without ascertaining whether the contents in these letters were true, said the police.  If found guilty of abetting the falsification of documents, O'Sullivan faces a jail term of up to 10 years, a fine, or both. For breaching the duties of a director under Section 157(3)(b) of the Companies Act, Thilagaratnam faces a fine of up to S$5,000, or up to one year in prison.  In a media release, the SPF said its Commercial Affairs Department and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, had been investigating Citadelle, Senjo Group and its subsidiaries for the suspected offences of falsification of documents under the Penal Code, as well as carrying on a trust business without a licence under the Trust Companies Act. Shanmugaratnam has been charged with 14 counts of falsification of documents for allegedly issuing 14 letters from Citadelle to Wirecard, its subsidiaries and an audit firm. The letters falsely claimed that Citadelle held large sums of money in its escrow accounts at various points in time between 2015 and 2017, when the company did not maintain such accounts or hold such balances in its accounts. The proceedings against Shanmugaratnam are ongoing, the police said.  In June 2020, Wirecard filed for insolvency in Germany after admitting that €1.9 billion in cash was missing from its accounts. Several Wirecard executives, including former chief executive Markus Braun, have been arrested on fraud charges. In September that year, MAS directed Wirecard to cease their payment services in Singapore and to return all customers' funds by Oct 14."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/catholic-order-prominent-figure-sex-offences-teenage-boys-jail-5-years-2665396,Prominent figure in Catholic community jailed 5 years for sex offences against 2 teenage boys,"SINGAPORE: A prominent figure in the local Catholic community was jailed for five years on Thursday (May 5) for sexual offences against two teenage boys. The Singaporean man, a member of a Catholic order, had taken a vow of celibacy and has never married, according to court documents. The identity of the victims is protected by gag order. The man cannot be named due to gag orders prohibiting the publication of his name, designation, appointment and a school to which he was linked. He pleaded guilty to one charge of carnal intercourse against the order of nature and one charge of committing an indecent act with a young person. Two more charges for similar offences were considered for sentencing. The court heard that the first victim, identified in court documents as V1, often saw the offender at chapel. The man extended care and concern to V1 and would ask him how he was doing. The pair grew close. They started to exchange hugs, which escalated into back and leg massages that the man gave V1. On multiple occasions, the man performed sex acts on the boy, who was between 14 and 15 years old at the time. The second victim was identified in court documents as V2. The boy and the man were close and affectionate, and would hug often. The man would go out for meals with the boy's family, and the boy confided in the man. The man developed ""strong feelings"" for V2 and started giving him full-body massages, the court heard. These escalated into sex acts on multiple occasions in 2005 when the boy was between 14 and 15 years old. In 2009, V1 was struggling emotionally and socially and felt ""disgusted"" about the sexual acts the offender had done, according to court documents. V1 confided in the sector leader of the Catholic order in Singapore, who counselled him and offered to escalate the matter to the police. However, the boy refused. The offender was questioned by his religious superior about V1's allegations and admitted that they were true. He was immediately suspended from his responsibilities. In June 2009, the offender left Singapore to receive treatment under a six-month therapy programme at an institute in the United States. ""As no police reports were lodged by the victims, he was not under police investigation then,"" stated court documents. After completing the therapy programme, the man was posted to a different country where his work did not involve minors. He would return to Singapore for one to two weeks at a time to visit his family, and had no further contact with the victims. In March 2020, the offender came back to Singapore to renew his missionary visa, which was expiring. However, he was unable to return overseas due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In late 2020, the offender's history was brought to the attention of the board of the school to which he was linked. On May 10 last year, following an internal inquiry, the chairman of the school board lodged a police report. The police started investigations and arrested the offender on Jan 18 this year. He was charged in court two days later. Deputy Public Prosecutors Sarah Siaw and Gail Wong asked for four to six years' jail for the offender, citing his abuse of trust and authority. The prosecutors highlighted the young age of the victims during the offences, and the fact that the sex acts took place multiple times. Defence lawyer Edmond Pereira said that the two victims were now working adults with their own families. He said they had ""moved on"" with their lives and were ""doing well"", with no evidence to suggest they had been ""marred"" by the experience. Asking for a shorter jail term, the lawyer said that during the time of the offences, the offender had ""lost himself"" and was ""overwhelmed"" with his responsibilities. However, this was not an excuse for his actions and he has apologised for his wrongdoing, said Mr Pereira. He cited a report by an Institute of Mental Health psychiatrist stating that the man's risk of reoffending was very low given his treatment with therapy. In sentencing, District Judge Shaiffudin Saruwan noted the ""egregious abuse of trust"" in this case. ""The accused has exploited his position of significant influence and authority,"" said the judge. He added that the sentence must convey society's disapproval of the harm caused by the man's actions, and the need to protect vulnerable victims. The judge said he also took into account the offender's remorse, seen through his cooperation with investigations and decision to plead guilty, sparing the victims from testifying at trial. Archbishop of Singapore Reverend William Goh on Thursday morning said that he was ""dismayed, shocked and ashamed"" over the case, adding that the incident was a ""wake-up call for us all to take our spiritual life seriously"". ""As Archbishop and leader of the Catholic Community in Singapore, I humbly apologise on behalf of the Church,"" Reverend Goh said in a letter posted on the Archdiocese's website. ""My heartfelt sympathy to those who have suffered on account of this crime. I pray that they will find healing and closure, and we journey with them as a Church through this pain. May justice be rendered accordingly."" He said that the Archdiocese takes the provision of a safe environment very seriously, especially where children and young persons are present. ""The cold reality of having an incident like this on our shores is sobering,"" wrote Reverend Goh. ""Many good Church leaders have sacrificed much to remain faithful to the gospel and have worked hard to instil the values of our Catholic faith in the young. ""A cloud of suspicion now hangs over those who have given themselves to live a life of service."" The offence of carnal intercourse against the order of nature, which has since been repealed, is punishable with up to 10 years' jail and a fine. Committing an indecent act with a young person is punishable with up to two years' jail, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both for first-time offenders. The maximum punishments are doubled for repeated offenders."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/piang-ngaih-don-gaiyathiri-murugayan-maid-abuse-appeal-2663376,Fatal abuse of Myanmar maid: Court of Appeal rejects woman's request to introduce fresh evidence,"SINGAPORE: Gaiyathiri Murugayan, who was sentenced to 30 years' jail last year for killing her maid, failed in her attempt on Wednesday (May 4) to seek further records in support of her appeal against her sentence. The Court of Appeal dismissed her application seeking the disclosure of additional materials and permission to introduce these as fresh evidence, ruling that they were irrelevant for her appeal. Gaiyathiri's appeal against her sentence for her crimes has not yet been heard. The fresh evidence included records of WhatsApp messages between Gaiyathiri and the victim's next-of-kin that purportedly showed the family had forgiven her. Gaiyathiri also requested permission to introduce a psychiatrist's report. The victim, Myanmar national Ms Piang Ngaih Don, died on Jul 26, 2016 after being repeatedly abused over the course of 14 months. The High Court judge called her ordeal ""undoubtedly among the worst cases of culpable homicide"". Ms Piang Ngaih Don weighed just 24kg when she died of brain injury with severe blunt trauma to her neck. In the days leading up to her death, she was starved and tied to a window grille at night and assaulted if she tried to rummage for food from the dustbin. In February last year, Gaiyathiri pleaded guilty to 28 charges including culpable homicide and voluntarily causing grievous hurt by starvation. Another 87 charges were considered in sentencing. She was sentenced to 30 years' jail in June last year. Her mother, Prema Naraynasamy, and husband, Kevin Chelvam, also face charges of maid abuse. Delivering the judgment on behalf of a three-judge panel, Justice Andrew Phang dismissed the entire application, saying that there was no legal basis for the court to order the disclosure of the additional materials, which were irrelevant to any appeal. Gaiyathiri addressed the judges herself, telling the court that many things had transpired in prison including ""confrontations between inmates and the officers treating us badly"". Aside from the WhatsApp messages, she sought her and her mother's prison medical records, claiming that they had not been provided appropriate treatment and care by the Singapore Prison Service (SPS). She also asked for incident records from SPS in relation to her complaints about being physically and sexually abused by fellow inmates, which she claimed SPS had not properly investigated, as well as her children's private medical records. She also sought permission to introduce a further report by the defence's psychiatrist Dr Jacob Rajesh, and for a Newton hearing to resolve differences in opinion between him and Institute of Mental Health psychiatrist Dr Derrick Yeo. A Newton hearing is done to settle certain issues that both defence and prosecution are unable to agree on. Deputy Public Prosecutors Mohamed Faizal, Senthilkumaran Sabapathy and Sean Teh said that Gaiyathiri's application only proved a ""complete lack of remorse"" on her part and that there were no grounds to disclose the materials requested. ""With respect, the entire application reeks of an attempt to fish for evidence with the fanciful hope that some of the evidence could be used in her favour,"" said the prosecutors. They said it was ""implausible"" that the WhatsApp messages between Gaiyathiri and Ms Piang Ngaih Don's next-of-kin existed as there would have been no opportunity for such an exchange. They noted that Gaiyathiri was arrested soon after the victim's death on Jul 26, 2016 and has been in custody since then, with no access to her mobile phone or any device with WhatsApp capability. They also argued that her claims about being denied proper medical treatment and not having her complaints about other inmates fully investigated by SPS were false. They added that the defence would have received the medical reports if an appropriate request had been made, and that it was ""deeply disturbing"" Gaiyathiri's lawyer had not attempted to do so before making this application. The prosecutors also said all of Gaiyathiri's children's medical reports in their possession had already been disclosed, and that she could request further reports through SPS and her lawyer. As for her request regarding Dr Rajesh's psychiatric report, the prosecutors said that this was a ""clear abuse of the process of the court"". Gaiyathiri's psychiatric condition was a central issue in the court below, and in her plea of guilt, she made an informed and considered decision to accept the opinion of Dr Yeo, said the prosecutors. Gaiyathiri was assessed multiple times by psychiatrists, with a 2019 report concluding that she suffered from major depressive disorder and obsessive compulsive personality disorder, both of which substantially contributed to her offences. She qualified for the defence of diminished responsibility, with her obsessive compulsive personality disorder a significant risk factor for aggravating the severity of depressive symptoms of peripartum onset. It would have worsened her depression to an extent that partially impaired her mental responsibility for her actions, the court below heard. ""The applicant therefore is clearly seeking to have her cake and eat it; having already had the charge reduced on the basis of the reasoning found in Dr Yeo's report, she now disingenuously seeks to disavow it to demand a better deal,"" said the prosecutors. The Court of Appeal noted that there was no more dispute over Gaiyathiri's guilt following her unqualified plea of guilt in the court below. The only issues that could remain were the propriety of the plead-guilty procedure, and whether her sentence was excessive. In that regard, there was no basis for the court to order disclosure of the materials that Gaiyathiri requested as they were irrelevant to those issues, said the court. In particular, the existence of the WhatsApp messages with the victim's next-of-kin was ""at best, speculative"". The court also pointed out that it had not seen the further report by Dr Rajesh, and that it was unclear there was a disagreement between the two psychiatrists or that the further report even existed. They added that the alleged report by Dr Rajesh would have been relevant in the court below and should have been raised there, and that this would militate against granting permission to introduce the report as evidence now. The prosecutors sought personal costs to be paid by Mr Joseph Chen, Gaiyathiri's lawyer during the time she made the application, and the court ordered both parties to submit arguments on this within eight days."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/internet-love-scam-syndicates-6-men-arrested-singapore-malaysia-2657856,6 men arrested in Malaysia for being part of Internet love scam syndicates,"SINGAPORE: Six men were arrested in Malaysia for their suspected involvement in Internet love scams following a joint investigation by Singapore's Commercial Affairs Department and Malaysia's Commercial Crime Investigation Department.  They are believed to be part of two transnational syndicates responsible for at least 10 cases in Singapore, involving more than S$310,000, said the Singapore Police Force (SPF) in a news release on Saturday (Apr 30). Between Mar 22 and Apr 7 this year, the police received reports from two 46-year-old women who said they had fallen prey to Internet love scams. The first victim met a man on a dating application in March 2021 and developed a relationship with him, said the police. He claimed to be a US citizen and that he was working in Singapore as a petroleum engineer. The man told the victim he needed money to pay for equipment and custom clearance fees as his bank account was frozen. The victim transferred a total of S$15,000 to a bank account provided by the man. After these transfers were made, the man purportedly asked for more money and the victim realised it was a scam. The second victim also met a man on a dating application in February this year. He claimed he was a geologist and was going to visit the victim in Singapore. On Mar 6, he purportedly asked the victim for S$20,000 to pay for his expenses in Singapore and she transferred the money. On Mar 20, he asked for another S$20,000, but the victim refused to provide the money. He kept asking for money and the victim “later felt suspicious” and reported the incident to the police. Joint investigations between the Singapore and Malaysia police forces established that the syndicates suspected to be behind the cases were based in Malaysia. On Apr 22 and Apr 23, officers from both forces conducted raids at two apartments in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur. Six men from Nigeria were arrested in Malaysia for their suspected involvement in Internet love scams. During the raids, laptops, mobile phones and credit cards were seized. The Singapore team in Malaysia also discovered several Singapore mobile numbers and bank accounts in the electronic devices. Anti-scam officers in Singapore conducted interventions to prevent potential victims from falling prey to the scam and managed to “avert further losses for three victims”. The two syndicates are believed to be responsible for at least 10 cases in Singapore involving more than S$310,000. Director of the Commercial Affairs Department David Chew said: “These syndicates often make use of Singapore bank accounts to launder their illicit proceeds. We will deal hard blows to the syndicate by conducting prompt investigations to deprive them of their criminal proceeds.” He thanked his Malaysian counterparts for their “strong support and leadership”. SPF said this was the first successful joint collaboration between both police forces in dismantling Internet love scam syndicates this year. “In such scams, fraudsters would cultivate online relationships with victims, and then ask for money from the victims to pay fines and fees after falsely claiming that they were detained by government authorities, or that their gift parcels meant for victims are withheld at customs, and money was needed to pay for the fines,” said SPF. “In most cases, the fraudsters posed as successful or attractive individuals.”"

These fake online articles portray the investments to be ""safe and highly lucrative"", said the police in a news release. ""The online articles are usually paid online advertisements that are disguised as news articles. They act as 'clickbait',"" the police added. Once someone clicks on the link within the article, they will be taken to a different website, offering investments through the trading of cryptocurrency or other financial products. Those who provided contact details on the website would usually receive a call from someone from the scheme. ""The police would like to inform the public not to deal with such companies that use false or misleading advertisements,"" they said. People should ask as many questions as they need to fully understand the investment opportunity, and be wary if the company is unable to or avoids answering their questions, said the police. They should check on the company, its owners, directors and management members to assess if the opportunity is genuine, and confirm the company's and representative's credentials by using the available resources, including the Financial Institutions Directory."

Sumiyati, who goes by one name, allegedly murdered Mr Low Hoon Cheong at a flat in Block 222, Bishan Street 23 between 4pm and 8.46pm on Thursday. The Indonesian national appeared in the State Courts via video link from remand and followed court proceedings through an interpreter.  She was remanded for psychiatric observation and will return to court next month. Sumiyati nodded to show that she understood the proceedings and did not ask any questions. The police said on Friday that they were alerted at about 8.50pm on Thursday to a death in a flat along Bishan Street 23. Upon arrival, they found the victim lying motionless inside. He was later pronounced dead by paramedics at the scene. The maid, who worked in the victim's household, was subsequently arrested. The offence of murder carries the death penalty."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/beach-road-chopper-bystander-effect-social-media-kindness-2655671,Commentary: Beach Road incident shows bystander effect is sometimes a myth,"SINGAPORE: Many of us watched in horror the videos of a bloodied man swinging a chopper and attacking a woman at Beach Road on Apr 14. Several employees from a nearby steamboat restaurant threw things they found on hand to stop the attacker – plastic chairs, bins, signboards – and two other men grabbed ladders from their lorry to push him back. A waitress sought help from employees of a nearby hotel, who alerted the police. The police said that the group's actions helped to distract and disorientate the man, helping to prevent him from further hurting the woman. In all, 10 people received Public Spiritedness Awards from the police for their efforts. The 46-year-old man has since been arrested and charged with attempted murder. Just last month, a man was charged with voluntarily causing hurt after swinging a samurai sword, injuring a pedestrian and hitting passing cars at Buangkok Crescent. Four men helped pin him to the ground, while a fifth person kicked the weapon away. Videos of both incidents have gone viral on social media. But what caught my attention was not the unusual level of drama seldom seen in Singapore. It is the bravery of the people who ran towards danger instead of away from it. But don’t we always mock people in Singapore for being “bochap” (indifferent or not caring)? Many lament we would sooner whip out their phones to take videos of fights at a safe distance than intervene. Before rushing to judge, let’s remember such videos are a big part of why we’re awed by the courage displayed in the Beach Road and Buangkok attacks. And it’s possible we underestimate how often onlookers intervene in smaller situations, simply because no videos were taken. As Mr Wei Chen Xiang, who helped fend off the Beach Road assailant, said, “Anyone who saw such a thing would have done the same”. Are these acts of bravery simply human decency? It’s not always straightforward for an onlooker to step in. Psychologists call it the bystander effect – when a crisis happens in a public place, we are less likely to come forward to help when there is a crowd. Research shows the average response time increases when more people are present, diluting the pressure to take action which results in inertia. “Someone else must have called the police by now” or “If no one else is doing anything, why should I?”, goes the thought process. It has elements of social assimilation as well – if others fail to take action, individuals might see this as a tacit sign that a response is not needed. And of course, there’s also the fear factor when a confrontation is violent. When faced with an assailant armed with a chopper, samurai sword or even bare fists, we quickly do the math and conclude that discretion is the better part of valour. But what if the altercations are less obvious or take place out of sight? One powerful video in the Ministry of Family and Social Development’s “Break the Silence” campaign against family violence portrayed the anguish of an elderly lady concerned about the shouts and cries coming from a neighbour’s flat but hesitating to take action. We may be afraid of intruding into the personal lives of others, or worried that we’ve jumped to conclusions about the situation. But as the campaign makes clear, things like family violence aren’t a private matter. Taking a first step to check our suspicions may help to prevent and interrupt an attack. In 2019, veteran diplomat Professor Tommy Koh lamented that Singaporeans lacked the civic mindedness that citizens of an advanced country should have. In an opinion piece, he set out five tests that Singaporeans must pass to “qualify as a First World people”: Stop littering; have cleaner public toilets; cultural literacy; love for nature and the environment; and importantly, civic mindedness and good manners. Civic mindedness is a sense of responsibility of a citizen for the wellbeing of society. It is exercising a duty to foster common good for the benefit of all. Hence, kindness, which is defined as other-centeredness, is a form of civic mindedness. To instil a greater sense of consideration towards others, the Singapore Kindness Movement launched two videos last year. In true Choose Your Own Adventure style, viewers are challenged to decide what they would do when they find a little girl’s lost dress, or when a new resident moves into the neighbourhood.  These were intended to illustrate how small actions (or the lack thereof) can lead to larger consequences. By erring on the side of kindness in life's grey areas, we would more often than not find ourselves better off in the long run. In golf, we are often taught to “visualise the shot”. Even if campaigns tend to bring out situations where there’s a clear right and wrong, there’s no reason why we can’t use them to practise and visualise civic mindedness. For example, by running through different scenarios and considering how we would respond before they happen – a woman is being attacked; a child is being shouted at; an elderly person is being shoved – we can increase the speed at which we respond when such things do happen. We’ve already gamed out what we would do in such situations, a sort of muscle training that allows us to scale up to intervene in more critical situations.  What would visualising kindness look like? How about thinking of everyday scenarios – holding the lift for a neighbour; giving up a seat on public transport for a pregnant woman; helping a senior to carry some groceries; or simply giving a nod of greeting or gratitude for a kindness received. Giving and receiving kindness can become second nature. We become less hindered by doubts or self-consciousness and more considerate in our shared spaces. By visualising kindness, we prime ourselves to show courage before the need arises. We build our personal sense of right and wrong: That personal integrity which says “I couldn’t live with myself if I did nothing”. That compassion, together with empathy – rather than sympathy for the victim – will generate the needed courage to overcome our natural fears.  Practising kindness as a lifestyle will help us be more other-centred and less bochap.  In time, I believe that stepping in to help rather than standing by to look will become our default action – not just an exceptional pro-social behaviour. The heroic examples of recent interventions give me hope that we are moving past the bystander mindset towards civic mindedness. People in Singapore have shown that when push comes to shove, they won’t hesitate to step in. Dr William Wan is the General Secretary of the Singapore Kindness Movement."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/lawyer-jailed-aye-accident-motorcyclist-killed-2655636,Lawyer jailed over death of motorcyclist in AYE accident involving multiple vehicles,"SINGAPORE: A lawyer was jailed for two weeks on Friday (Apr 29) for causing the death of a motorcyclist in an accident on the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE) in 2018. Laurence Goh Eng Yau side-swiped the motorcycle of Mr Wong Yew Wai when he abruptly swerved to avoid a collision with the car ahead of him. The impact pushed Mr Wong, who was 33 at the time, out into the path of an oncoming lorry in the next lane. He was run over by the lorry and pronounced dead at the scene. Goh, now 57, pleaded guilty to one count of negligent driving earlier this month. He had admitted to failing to keep a proper lookout for traffic conditions and to keep a safe following distance from the car ahead of him at the time. Goh is a lawyer and the sole proprietor of his eponymous legal practice, according to a search on the Ministry of Law's website. He was heading to Bukit Panjang from his office when the accident took place near exit 7A of the AYE at about 5.20pm on Sep 12, 2018. The exit is near Portsdown Road in the direction of Tuas. After his abrupt swerve, another two cars behind him crashed into each other and hit the two cars in front. Deputy Presiding Judge S Jennifer Marie on Friday also banned Goh from driving for five years. She said that Goh had displayed ""genuine remorse and contrition"", noting that he handed his licence over to the investigating officer and had stopped driving since the accident. Judge Marie also noted that defence lawyer Ramesh Tiwary had asked the court to consider that Goh checked his blind spot before abruptly swerving. ""A life was lost and you carry the burden of knowing that your negligent act had resulted in this,"" said the judge. ""This serves as a timely reminder of the importance of abiding by traffic rules and being alert in driving."" Additionally, Judge Marie said that she considered Goh's medical conditions in assessing the length of imprisonment he should serve. The court heard that Goh has prescriptions for medication to treat angina, a type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. Goh's wife was present in court, and he requested to speak to her before being led away to start serving his sentence. Those convicted of causing death by a negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide can be jailed for up to two years, fined or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/leeden-national-oxygen-lab-explosion-chemist-killed-director-fined-2655466,Ex-director of gas firm fined over 2015 laboratory blast that killed chemist,"SINGAPORE: A former executive director of an industrial gas company was fined S$45,000 on Friday (Apr 29) for his part in a laboratory explosion that killed a chemist in 2015. Gary Choo Pu Chang, 64, was the executive director of Leeden National Oxygen (LNOX), a firm that produces and sells specialty gases. His responsibilities included overseeing the safe operation of the laboratory. The fatal explosion at the firm's Tanjong Kling premises on Oct 12, 2015 killed 30-year-old Lim Siaw Chian, who had just returned to work after giving birth. Choo resigned on Aug 12, 2015, before the incident happened, but admitted to not establishing safe work procedures that could have prevented the blast. Earlier this week, he pleaded guilty to one charge of failing to take measures to ensure the safety and health of his employees at work. Last year, LNOX and the firm's CEO Steven Tham Weng Cheong were fined S$340,000 and S$45,000 respectively for similar offences. Ms Lim was carrying out gas analysis on a cylinder when a series of explosions broke out at 21 Tanjong Kling Road on the day of the incident. She was killed instantly. Three of her colleagues in the lab and four other employees were hurt as well. Their injuries included brain haemorrhage, lacerations and abrasions. In closed-circuit television footage of the incident, Ms Lim was last seen touching a regulatory valve assembly connected to a gas cylinder before the video went black. The primary failure was found to be an unqualified weld joint in the bullet stem of the regulatory valve assembly, that had been modified and not properly checked before use. As a result, a flammable methane-oxygen-nitrogen mix leaked from the equipment when the cylinder was being tested and was likely ignited by frictional heat. Investigations found that during the time Choo oversaw the laboratory, LNOX did not have any system for tracking and maintaining regulatory valve assemblies. No records were kept of when the regulatory valve assemblies were bought, who were their suppliers, which ones were modified and whether the modifications were approved. Instead, the equipment was ""randomly kept"" in a toolbox cabinet and not individually accounted for, stated court documents. There was also no periodic testing or maintenance. Investigations also found that there was no system in place for the accurate tracking of gas cylinders, including their contents. Additionally, court documents stated that a safety manager discovered in October 2014 that the gas leakage indication lights of the gas detection system would blink occasionally without any obvious triggers, and the system was therefore not reliable. Around May 2015, the manager received a quotation for his proposal to revamp the entire gas detection system at LNOX. He showed Choo the proposal, but was informed that LNOX did not have the budget for this and was told to push the proposal in the following year. The fatal blast happened before the next year's budget process. Ministry of Manpower prosecutor Khong Zi-wei sought a fine of S$45,000 to S$60,000, arguing that Choo's culpability was higher than Tham's as he had ""significantly more experience"" in gas manufacturing and worked more closely with laboratory operations. Choo was previously the deputy managing director of National Oxygen, which merged with Leeden to form LNOX on Oct 1, 2014. He also oversaw the laboratory in that capacity. ""While actual harm did not take place during the accused's tenure, the potential for harm was always present, and it was only fortuitous for the accused that this harm did not materialise until after his resignation,"" said Mr Khong. Defence lawyer Gregory Ong had argued that his client was less culpable than Tham, and said Choo could not be expected to ""micro-manage"" every LNOX department under his charge. Choo could have been jailed for up to two years, fined up to S$200,000 or both for failing to take necessary measures to ensure the safety and health of employees."

Yvonne Cecilia de Silva is accused of conspiring with an ""Edmond Chin"" and a ""Chris"" to cheat the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC) respectively, according to charge sheets. She was also charged with giving these people the online banking login credentials and an ATM card. ""The bank accounts were used by criminals to launder proceeds of crime derived from three reported cases of Internet love scams,"" said the police. The victims met the scammers on Facebook and Instagram, and over time transferred a total of S$121,000 at the request of the scammers. ""Some money was transferred purportedly to help ease cashflow problems. Money was also transferred on the pretext of paying for fees needed to release parcels sent by their online lovers,"" said the police. Investigations revealed that the 64-year-old woman befriended the unknown people on Facebook in 2019. They asked for help to receive funds in Singapore for their businesses. The woman allegedly cheated two banks into opening two bank accounts in her name, by deceiving them into believing that she was going to use these accounts. She allegedly mailed a bank ATM card to an address in Malaysia and provided the online banking login credentials to the person. She is also accused of accepting S$6,000 into her MayBank account for the purpose of transferring the proceeds to another party. Anyone found guilty of conspiring to cheat a bank into opening a bank account can be jailed for up to three years, fined, or both. For abetting others to secure unauthorised access to a bank’s computer system, a first-time offender can be fined up to S$5,000, jailed for up to two years, or both. Those convicted of carrying on the business of providing a payment service in Singapore without licence can be fined up to S$125,000, jailed for up to three years, or both. “The police take a serious stance against anyone involved in facilitating money laundering, and perpetrators will be dealt with in accordance with the law,” the police said. “To avoid becoming involved in money laundering activities, members of the public should always reject requests to share the use of their banking facilities to receive and transfer funds, as well as guard against disclosing their Singpass login details which can be misused for many transactions."""

Staff who contravene the code of conduct will face disciplinary sanctions which may include dismissal for serious breaches.”  The police confirmed on Friday that a report was lodged and investigations are ongoing. In 2020, two NUS professors - Dr Jeremy Fernando and Professor Theodore G Hopf - were sacked after internal investigations following investigations into allegations of inappropriate behaviour and sexual misconduct.  Dr Fernando, a professor at Tembusu College, had an ""intimate association"" with an undergraduate and was dismissed in October 2020. Prof Hopf, who was also part of the department of political science, was dismissed in December 2020 after investigations found that he had sexually harassed a student in physical, verbal and written forms.  A third, Professor Zheng Yongnian, who was formerly with the university’s East Asian Institute, left the university before investigations concluded. NUS eventually found that he had acted inappropriately in a professional setting by hugging a colleague without her consent.  Another research employee at NUS was sacked after two students reported that they were sexually harassed by the staff member. The report was made on Mar 25, 2021 and investigations concluded on Apr 7, 2021.  The staff member admitted to touching the student’s knees and making inappropriate remarks, said the university in an August 2021 report on complaints of sexual misconduct made available on the university’s website. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-molest-9-year-old-girl-family-friend-tuition-2653141,Man convicted of molesting 9-year-old daughter of family friends during tuition,"SINGAPORE: A 59-year-old man was on Thursday (Apr 28) convicted of molesting a nine-year-old girl who is the daughter of family friends, during the girl's tuition lesson with his wife in their home. He had claimed trial to a count of outraging the modesty of a minor in 2016, and a count of attempting to outrage the modesty of a minor in 2019. The offender cannot be named in order to protect the identity of the victim. The court previously heard that he and his wife were close family friends with the victim's parents. The offender had known the victim since she was about three, and was especially close to her among her siblings. According to the prosecution, he would exclusively buy presents for the victim during her birthday and when she did well for her examinations. ""This is a case where the accused, a trusted family friend whom the young victim felt closer to than her own parents, took advantage of his position and her ignorance to violate her on multiple occasions,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutor Lee Zu Zhao. The molestation went unreported for years until 2019, when the offender asked the victim if her younger sister had already grown pubic hair. This greatly alarmed the victim, who became afraid that her sister would also fall prey to the man. She decided to talk to a friend about this, and eventually told a school counsellor about what had happened. The prosecution's case was that in 2016, the victim and her younger sister were having tuition in the offender's home when the victim had a breakout of hives on her arm. The offender's wife offered to apply powder on her arm. They went into the master bedroom to do so and saw the offender there. The offender told his wife that he would help to apply the powder so she could resume teaching the victim's younger sister outside. His wife then left the room and he closed the door. The offender told the victim to pull her pants down and molested her. The victim said she did not know what the offender had done was wrong at the time. She only realised this when she learnt what a ""bad touch"" was in a Primary 5 sex education class, which led to her breaking down in school. Even then, she did not tell anyone because ""a part of her did not want to believe that it happened"", said the prosecution. The victim also testified that she did not report the matter to her parents as she was not close to any of her family members then, and was in fact closer to the offender at the time. The prosecution also made the case for a second offence committed sometime between Sep 9 and 13, 2019, when the victim was again at the offender's house for tuition. She had resumed tuition despite what happened earlier as her parents wanted her to do it since her Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) was nearing. During one of the breaks, she was sitting on the edge of the sofa in the living room when the offender came and sat next to her. The offender tried to put his hand down the back of her pants. When the victim felt his touch, she swept his hand away and he stood up and left. According to the victim's medical report, she would sometimes have flashbacks and nightmares of the incidents, and bad dreams about people whom she trusts. She also had thoughts of self-harm. The offender denied all the allegations at trial. For the first incident, he claimed that he had applied powder on the victim's body in the presence of his wife. He claimed to have done this from the victim's back to her legs, touching her buttocks in the process. For the second incident, he claimed to have put his arm across her shoulder while telling her to stop playing games on her mobile phone. He claimed that he unsuccessfully tried to kiss her cheek with his cheek, and kiss her forehead with his lips. Delivering his judgment, District Judge Victor Yeo said that he found the victim's evidence at trial to be consistent, logical, coherent and ""unusually convincing"". He agreed with the prosecution that the victim's ability to recount details of the 2016 incident showed that it had left an ""indelible impression"" on her, and noted that her evidence remained ""unshaken"" under rigorous cross-examination. In contrast, he said that the testimony of the offender, who denied all the allegations, was inconsistent and not credible. The judge said he was therefore satisfied that the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt. The offender will return to court for sentencing next month.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/police-doze-wheel-car-hit-ntu-students-zebra-crossing-2650626,"Police officer jailed for dozing at the wheel, hitting 2 students at NTU","SINGAPORE: After a night of disrupted sleep, a police officer dozed off at the wheel of a police car and hit two university students at a zebra crossing. The two victims, both women now aged 24 and 25, suffered fractures and were hospitalised for about a week. Norimawati Abdullah, 31, was jailed for three months on Wednesday (Apr 27) and banned from driving for five years after her release. She pleaded guilty to a charge of driving without reasonable consideration for other people using the road. Norimawati had been working at SPF for about eight years at the time of the offence last year. She holds the rank of staff sergeant. The accident took place at around 6.20pm on Jan 1, towards the end of her shift. She was driving a police car along Nanyang Avenue near Hall 11 of the Nanyang Technological University at the time. Her duty partner and a reservist officer were also in the car. The two victims and a third friend were crossing a zebra crossing along Nanyang Avenue. Two of them were holding umbrellas as it was drizzling slightly. As the police car approached the zebra crossing, Norimawati dozed off at the wheel. Her duty partner noticed that she was not slowing the car down and turned to look at her. He saw that her eyes were closed and immediately shouted ""Ma'am! Ma'am!"" to wake her up. She woke abruptly and applied the emergency brakes, but failed to stop the car in time. The front of the car hit the two victims with some force. The impact flung one victim towards the left rear of the car, and carried the other victim on the car's bonnet for a few seconds before flinging her 2m to 3m in front of the vehicle. All three police officers got out of the car to help the victims, and Norimawati called for an ambulance. The victim who was carried on the car's bonnet sustained fractures to her neck and pelvis, and underwent surgery. She was eventually discharged with 24 days of hospitalisation leave. The victim who was flung to the car's rear suffered a pelvic fracture and cuts on her face. She also received surgery and was discharged with 62 days of hospitalisation leave. The accident also caused about S$1,440 of damage to the police car. During investigations, Norimawati said that she had five to six hours of disrupted sleep the night before her shift, which was from 8am to 7.30pm on the day of the incident. She admitted that she had been feeling sleepy before the accident but went ahead to drive the police car despite this. Deputy Public Prosecutor Tay Jingxi asked for a sentence of three to four months' jail, while defence lawyer Amarjit Sidhu asked for four to six weeks' jail. Mr Sidhu asked the court to consider Norimawati's efforts to balance her responsibilities as a young mother and professional police officer in sentencing. The Singapore Police Force (SPF) said on Friday that it initiated investigations against Norimawati after the accident. Following her conviction, SPF has commenced ""internal action"" against her, it said. ""Officers of the Singapore Police Force are expected to uphold the law and maintain the highest standards of conduct and integrity,"" said SPF. ""We deal with officers who break the law severely, including charging them in court."" The penalty for causing grievous hurt by driving without reasonable consideration for other people using the road is jail for up to two years, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both. Editor's note: An earlier version of this article said that Norimawati Abdullah has been suspended from SPF, according to her defence lawyer. SPF has clarified that it has commenced internal action against her following her conviction."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/nagaenthran-dharmalingam-drug-trafficker-death-sentence-agc-false-allegations-2650061,AGC warns against repeating false allegations in case of Malaysian drug trafficker,"SINGAPORE: The Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) on Wednesday (Apr 27) warned people against repeating false allegations regarding the case of a convicted Malaysian drug trafficker. Nagaenthran Dharmalingam was executed on Wednesday.  On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal dismissed a last-minute plea by Nagaenthran and his mother Madam Panchalai Supermaniam. The criminal motion was filed by both parties on Monday, two days before his scheduled execution. Nagaenthran was sentenced to death in 2010 for importing 42.72g of heroin into Singapore in 2009 in a bundle strapped to his thigh. In a media statement on Wednesday morning, the AGC noted that various individuals and groups have “repeated the false allegations” asserted in Mdm Panchalai’s affidavit and “sought to cast aspersions on the involvement” of Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon in the proceedings. The prosecutors said these false allegations were made prior to and after the filing of Monday’s application, and were made both within and outside Singapore. In the motion, Nagaenthran and his mother sought a stay of execution and argued that it was unconstitutional to carry out the death sentence because Chief Justice Menon, who presided over Nagaenthran’s previous failed appeals, was also the Attorney-General during his conviction. “AGC takes a serious view of any act that may constitute contempt, and will not hesitate to take appropriate action to protect the administration of justice,” it said. The AGC noted that the application on Monday was the seventh such application, not including appeals, that was brought by Nagaenthran after his appeal against conviction was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in 2011. “It is the latest attempt to abuse the court’s processes and unjustifiably delay the carrying into effect of the lawful sentence imposed on Nagaenthran,” said the AGC. In a previous hearing in March, the Court of Appeal delivered a judgment after applications brought by Nagaenthran “pertaining to the claimed deterioration in his mental faculties”. The court ruled that those proceedings constituted a “blatant and egregious abuse” of the court’s processes, with the case mounted by Nagaenthran’s lawyers described as “baseless and without merit”. The court then warned it was improper for his counsel to abuse the process of court. The case has attracted international attention. The court's public gallery on Tuesday was full, and several members of the international media were present. A panel of three judges - Justices Andrew Phang, Judith Prakash and Belinda Ang - heard the criminal motion on Tuesday. The court noted that Chief Justice Menon was not involved in any decisions pertaining to Nagaenthran’s prosecution during his tenure as Attorney-General from Oct 1, 2010 to Jun 24, 2012. The AGC added that Nagaethran, under legal advice, had no objections in 2016 to Chief Justice Menon hearing his matters. This confirmation was made after it was brought to Nagaethran’s counsel’s attention that Chief Justice Menon’s tenure as Attorney-General overlapped with their client’s criminal proceedings. The Court of Appeal said it was “baseless” for Nagaethran to now assert that he had been denied a fair trial. “It was also telling that he never raised any concerns from December 2016 to just two days before his rescheduled execution, which suggests this allegation is an afterthought and not made in good faith,” said the AGC. In the latest application, Mdm Panchalia said her application and affidavit were prepared and filed with the help of “friends and social activists”, and added that lawyers had “declined to act”. The AGC said the legal papers accompanying the latest applications were “clearly prepared under legal advice”. It added that the email address provided by Mdm Panchalai “did not appear” to be hers, and that the legal papers had been signed for her by “someone else”. The prosecutors submitted that Nagaethran’s mother ought to be directed to state the identities of the people involved in preparing the legal papers. “The Court of Appeal observed that the legal papers were clearly drafted by a lawyer, and questioned Mdm Panchalai on who had helped her prepare and file the papers,” said the AGC. “Mdm Panchalai maintained, against the evidence, that she had not been assisted by any lawyers and that it had been her non-legally trained relatives and family friends who had assisted.” The court stated that this was a “clear continuation of the drip-feeding of applications in a bid to thwart the court’s efforts to discharge its responsibility”, added the AGC. Delivering the judgment on behalf of the panel on Tuesday, Justice Phang said the court found the application to be ""devoid of merit"". He added that it appeared to be a ""calculated attempt"" to diminish the finality of the court process. ""No court in the world would allow an applicant to prolong matters ad infinitum"" by filing such applications, said the judge. ""There must come a time when the last word of the court is the last word."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ex-grab-driver-acquit-attempted-rape-drunk-passenger-2649921,Ex-Grab driver acquitted of attempted rape of intoxicated 19-year-old passenger,"SINGAPORE: A High Court judge on Wednesday (Apr 27) acquitted a former Grab driver of the attempted rape of an intoxicated 19-year-old passenger in 2018.  Tan Yew Sin, 47, was cleared of a total of three charges of attempted rape, sexual assault and outrage of modesty after contesting the allegations at trial. He was accused of committing the offences in his car in the early hours of May 19, 2018, after accepting a booking to ferry the girl from Wildseed Bar at Seletar Aerospace Park to her home. Justice Pang Khang Chau found that the girl, though intoxicated, had the capacity for consent and demonstrated this in her behaviour throughout the night. The judge also found that even if the girl was not able to consent, Tan could reasonably have been mistaken that she was able to. The sexual acts occurred in the car after they had reached the passenger's home. At trial, Tan admitted to the sexual encounter, but argued that it was consensual. He testified that he thought the girl wanted sex and that he was trying to return her identity card to her handbag when he turned around and ""next thing I know, we end up kissing"". The prosecution's case was that the girl did not consent to the sexual acts, and was so intoxicated that she would not have been able to consent. Her identity is protected by a gag order. The prosecution has since filed an appeal against Tan's acquittal on May 10, according to an update from the Attorney-General's Chambers. Justice Pang said the girl had consumed five pints of beer that night and was intoxicated, but this fact alone was insufficient to establish her lack of capacity for consent. He said that a lack of capacity for consent would require her to be unable to understand the nature and consequence of what she was consenting to due to intoxication. Noting that the girl was emotional and crying, and showed motor impairment such as an unstable gait, the judge said that drinking a substantial amount of alcohol or behaving unusually did not indicate a lack of capacity for consent. He also noted that the girl could not remember the sexual encounter with Tan. However, he said that the inability to form memories due to alcohol intoxication did not mean she was unable to perform cognitive functions. Justice Pang said the question to be decided was not whether the girl was intoxicated, but whether she ""lost the capacity to understand and to decide"". He said that the girl demonstrated this ability at multiple points during the night and cited a number of instances. At the bar where she had been drinking, she repeatedly rejected a friend's offer to drive her home and said she was okay. The girl testified that she did this to avoid worrying her friend. Justice Pang said this demonstrated her ability to look beyond her immediate needs and consider her friend that night. Later, after the car reached her home, the girl told Tan she was not ready to leave. She was searching for her wallet to pay the driver then, and this showed her awareness of the circumstances under which she would be ready to leave the car, said the judge. After the girl failed to access her residence, Tan asked her if she was okay and she said that she was. She testified that she responded in this way because she did not know Tan and did not want to say much, which also demonstrated awareness of her surroundings and of the differences in sharing personal information with different people, said Justice Pang. In the car, the girl was emotional, thumping herself on the chest with her fist and banging her head on the window, but would stop each time Tan urged her to stop. This showed an awareness of what Tan was saying to her and her decision to accept his suggestion, said the judge. At the end of the sexual acts, the girl started saying ""no"" and pushing Tan's hands away. She later agreed that this demonstrated her ability to express that she did not want to be touched. This showed her awareness of what was happening and an ability to give or refuse consent, said Justice Pang. Tan's lawyer previously said that his client stopped what he was doing the moment the girl said no, and ""honoured"" her refusal. After the sexual acts, Tan asked the girl if she was okay, to which she replied yes and asked him to continue driving. This showed her ability to assess whether she wanted to leave or remain in the car with Tan even after the sexual encounter, said the judge. As for whether the girl had actually consented or not, the prosecution accepted that the lack of verbal consent was ""inconclusive, as consent may be manifested in other ways"", said Justice Pang. For reasons unknown, the victim did not go home and was found by another Grab driver at around 4.40am, lying in the middle of the road with her underwear and shorts missing. Justice Pang also agreed with the defence's secondary argument that even if the girl was indeed unable to consent, Tan could have been mistaken and held the reasonable belief that she was able to consent. The judge noted that the factors he gave for determining that the girl had the capacity to consent were external, physical manifestations of her behaviour. He said the girl was able to respond relevantly and appropriately to Tan's questions and suggestions during the night. As part of his analysis, Justice Pang noted that the girl was unable to recall the sexual encounter and could not give evidence as to whether she consented. The assessment of whether there was consent, therefore, depended largely on the credibility of Tan's testimony, and the prosecution had accepted this, said the judge. He said that Tan's version of events had been consistent since his first police statement after his arrest, and added that the man could not have known back then that the girl was unable to recall what happened. ""I generally accept the accused's account of events. I find that he was a credible witness,"" said Justice Pang. The judge also relied on in-car camera audio recordings of the exchange in Tan's car and CCTV footage of the girl from the bar and her residence to make his findings. Speaking to reporters after the verdict, defence lawyer Chenthil Kumarasingam said that Tan wanted to get back to his life and that his family had been through ""a lot"" in the past four years. ""Him going back to his life is really all that he wants at the moment,"" said the lawyer. Tan could have been jailed for up to 20 years, fined or caned for attempted rape or sexual assault by penetration. For outrage of modesty, he could have been jailed for up to two years, fined, caned, or given any combination of these punishments."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/malaysia-basikal-lajak-youth-superman-sam-ke-ting-accident-2647506,"‘No fear, no logic’: Youths riding illegally modified bicycles a threat to road safety in Malaysia","JOHOR BAHRU: Business owner Khairul Hakimin Muhammad was driving along a main highway in Bangi, Selangor last Thursday (Apr 21) when two cyclists sped past him, coming within inches of grazing both sides of his car. The riders blew past a red traffic light 300m in front of him. Mr Khairul immediately applied his emergency brakes and swerved to avoid six other cyclists, presumably from the same group, who cut into his lane from the left. He remembered seeing two of them riding in a prone position.  He told CNA that he missed the group narrowly, and attributed it to the fact that he was alert enough to react in time.  “That was the second time in four days that I saw this group tearing down a hill into the main road at Bangi’s Section 16,” Mr Khairul recounted.  “All of them seem like they are still in primary school. Their bicycles are clearly modified, no brakes and (a) set up to allow them to plank horizontally,” he added. “There was no sense of fear and certainly no logic in why they would ride that way,” said Mr Khairul, who later made a report to the police about this “basikal lajak” gang.  Basikal lajak (modified speed bicycles) is a form of drag-racing using illegally-modified bicycles on public roads. It is popular among youths in parts of Malaysia. These bicycles typically do not have brakes or reflective lights. The riders also do not wear helmets, padding or safety gear.  The races typically begin from atop a hill, and continue downslope into public roads, including highways filled with traffic.  While these modified bicycles have been popular among youths for years, they were thrust into the national spotlight earlier this month after a woman was sentenced to six years jail and RM6,000 fine (US$1,400) for reckless driving that led to the death of eight teenagers in Johor in 2017.  On Apr 19, the driver Sam Ke Ting was released on bail pending the hearing of her appeal at the Court of Appeal. The incident has triggered debate on where the blame should lie, given that the teenagers were cycling illegally on a public highway late at night.  The police has been active in enforcing the law, which bars the riding of illegally modified bicycles on public roads.  For instance, during an operation across two days in October 2021, Johor police apprehended eight youths who were engaging in basikal lajak races. Police said the youths, aged between 10 and 15, were riding in a dangerous manner and brought them to the police station for “further action”.   Over the past week, some netizens have posted on social media about their close shaves with basikal lajak gangs, including Mr Khairul. His post garnered more than 100 shares and 400 comments on Facebook, with many fellow netizens expressing concern on how to eradicate such groups. Another Facebook user Nurul Hidayah Sa’al recounted how she would see these basikal lajak groups around her estate in Selangor, usually at night.  She wrote that they would circle the neighbourhood, riding recklessly on the roads with little care for pedestrians or motorists.  “They do not stop at traffic lights, cars stop for them,” she wrote. “And we can’t even tell these kids off, they even throw rocks at my car.” Five years after the accident that killed eight teenagers, what remains concerning is that basikal lajak groups are still active in some parts of Malaysia, where they continue to pose a road hazard for themselves and other road users.  Bicycle shop owners and professional riders interviewed by CNA say that such modifications should not be encouraged. To eradicate such practices, public education is key, they said. What attracts youths to such modified bicycles? CNA spoke to an 11-year-old boy, who is a self-confessed bicycle lajak enthusiast. He was  buying parts for his modified bicycle at a repair shop near Taman Dahlia in Johor Bahru.  He told CNA that he has been racing for two years. The boy bought a bicycle frame from a used-bicycle shop near his village and assembled his ride after buying the other parts using his pocket money. His name has been withheld to protect his identity. “The thrill of going downhill is worth it,” he said. “Usually we play at night because there are less cars and less chances of the police being around,” the boy added. His bicycle, which has a gold frame, was fitted such that the saddle and handlebars were around the same height.  “This is to do (the) Superman (position) so we can go fast when we go downhill,” he explained. When asked how he would stop the bicycle as it did not have any brakes, he pointed to the worn-out plastic slippers on his feet with a sheepish grin, indicating that he would rely on them to come to a stop.  Mr Mohd Rizal Tisin, a professional track cycling coach who represented Malaysia in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, noted that the objective of these basikal lajak riders is to ride the Superman pose. This, he said, presents an enormous danger on busy roads.  “Yes, the Superman prone position is for them to be more aerodynamic as they ride downhill. But this is a stunt, it is planking not cycling,” said Mr Mohd Rizal.  “There is no proper way to brake or manoeuvre the handlebars and it endangers them and other motorcyclists and drivers,” he added. Mr Mohd Rizal, who was the first Malaysian to claim a medal at the track cycling World Championships, noted that cycling on public roads may be dangerous.  He recalled how he suffered an accident when a motorcycle crashed into a group of 10 riders near Putrajaya. “We were wearing safety gear and we cycled responsibly. What more these kids who are reckless?” said Mr Mohd Rizal.    Bicycle shop owners who spoke to CNA maintained that basikal lajak groups were still prevalent. They said they would see some members come to the stores to purchase spare parts.  However, the shop owners stressed that they would not entertain any requests to modify bicycles to make them suitable for bicycle lajak activities.  Mr Ooi Eng Huat, who has been operating his store Everyday Battery and Bicycle near Skudai for 24 years, told CNA that these basikal lajak enthusiasts would come to his shop from time to time to buy parts such as rims, spokes or frames.  “Within their groups, there is usually one or two members who are skilled at repairing or setting up bicycles. They would purchase parts here and bring them to their skilled friend to fix,” said Mr Ooi. “We have had requests to modify these bicycles, to remove the brakes or adjust the saddle height and handlebars to an unsafe height. I’ve told them no, we don’t do these services. We don’t want to encourage this illegal activity,” he added.  Mr Ooi added that the accident in 2017 involving eight deaths in Johor Bahru created some public awareness on the dangers of basikal lajak.  “The police, parents and the general public are aware of how dangerous these groups are to themselves, and everyone else. While we still see them around, there’s increasingly less of them around over the last couple of years,” he said.   Similarly, the owner of bicycle shop Sin Da Enterprise in Johor Bahru, who only wanted to be known only as Mr Wong, stated that he would not entertain any request to illegally modify bicycles.  However, Mr Wong does sell some factory-assembled basikal lajaks in his store.  “These bicycles are not the same as the ones used by gangs for racing. They have brakes, reflectors and lights and are safe to use,” Mr Wong explained.  “They are called basikal lajak because we want to encourage them to use these bicycles instead of the illegal ones that they fix (up) themselves,” he added.  Netizens are keen for authorities to crack down on these gangs and apprehend them if necessary. Some are even supportive of punishing their parents for letting their children engage in such a dangerous hobby.  Mr Khairul, who made a police report encounterting basikal lajak riders, told CNA that the whole society has to work together to eradicate these gangs.  “We have to take pictures, videos and send them to the police. And when they are apprehended, get parents to pick them up,” he said.  “We don’t want more of such fatal accidents to continue,” he added.  Indeed, there have been efforts by authorities to identify and stop such activities.  For instance, local media reported last week that police in the northern state of Perlis have identified some roads and areas that are popular among these enthusiasts.  Perlis police chief Surina Saad reportedly said that traffic police would conduct patrols to monitor these areas to ensure that basikal lajak gangs will not race there.  Despite enforcement efforts, leading Malaysian cycling enthusiasts and national athletes interviewed by CNA have called for authorities to focus on education and mentoring. Mr Mohd Rizal, the Olympian told CNA that a better option was to educate these gangs through cycling clinics and even persuading them to join cycling competitions where safe practices are upheld.  “The core issue is that these gangs are influenced by mat motors (motorcycle gangs) and they perhaps want to be Mat Rempits in the future when they can afford to buy motorbikes,” said Mohd Rizal.  Mat Rempit is a colloquial term for members of motorcycle gangs who partake in illegal street racing, bike stunts and even engage in petty crimes.  “I’ve asked some of these kids and they said that they would one day like to be a Mat Rempit. It is best to educate them from young that this is not the right ambition, and it is not even a sport,” he added.  Mr Taslem Raziff, a professional BMX flatland rider who won bronze for Malaysia in the 2019 SEA Games in Philippines, told CNA that he has reached out to these basikal lajak enthusiasts to persuade them to try out in his BMX team.  “For BMX, it's a bit similar because we encourage freestyle. But we use helmets, foam on obstacles and do them at skate parks instead of public roads,” said Mr Taslem.  He told CNA that one of his peers, who is a professional BMX rider, was previously part of a basikal lajak gang.  “It’s possible that these lajak enthusiasts have a bright future,” said Mr Taslem.  “What's important is to prepare for them a location, teach proper procedures with rules and regulations and control it from there,” he added.  “We can’t just decide to stop them from cycling. Because these guys are young, the more we try to stop them, the more likely they will persist with doing it,” said Mr Taslem.  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ocbc-bank-loan-officer-jailed-forged-documents-2648261,"Former OCBC bank officer jailed for certifying, submitting forged documents in customers' credit card, loan applications","SINGAPORE: A former OCBC bank loan officer was sentenced to eight months' jail on Tuesday (Apr 26) for certifying forged income documents, which he submitted along with customers’ applications for credit cards and loans.  Lau Wei Chong Nicholas, 26, faced three counts of using as genuine forged income documents, with another count of the same offence taken into consideration during sentencing. Police said in a news release that they received information in April 2020 that forged payslips and Central Provident Fund (CPF) employment contribution statements were submitted to OCBC as proof of income to support four separate applications for credit cards and loans.  Investigations showed the applicants had initially responded to loan advertisements that they came across on online platforms, which offered assistance in obtaining a loan or credit card from a bank within a short time and for a service fee.  They were subsequently contacted by unidentified third parties who directed them to apply for the credit cards or loans at certain OCBC branches in person.  The applicants went to OCBC branches on four separate occasions without bringing along any proof of income documents, and they were attended to by Lau. ""Applicants would normally submit originals of their payslips and/or retrieve their latest CPF employment contribution statement in the presence of the loan officer,"" said police. ""However, Nicholas did not ask the four applicants to show him the income documents in the abovementioned manner. ""Instead, he received their documents via email or WhatsApp and he later certified them to be genuine even though he had reason to believe they were not.""  Two such applications were approved, and OCBC incurred losses of nearly S$36,500. Anyone found guilty of using as genuine a forged document can be jailed for up to four years, fined, or both. ""Financial institutions in Singapore require credit card and loan applicants to submit proof of income. Members of the public are advised not to respond to third-party advertisements that offer to secure credit facilities from financial institutions, without requiring any proof of income,"" said police.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/niam-jinson-man-assault-pregnant-wife-jail-2648206,Man gets jail for assaulting wife who was 37 weeks pregnant,"SINGAPORE: A man was sentenced to eight weeks' jail on Tuesday (Apr 26) for assaulting his wife, who was 37 weeks pregnant at the time. Niam Jinson, 27, pleaded guilty to one count of voluntarily causing hurt, with another charge of criminal intimidation considered for sentencing. The court heard that Niam and his 31-year-old wife lived together in a flat in Tampines at the time of the incident. At about 2am on Feb 11 last year, Niam picked his wife up near her workplace and drove home. After arriving at the carpark, he told her to alight without him. Niam's wife refused to leave, and said he was having an affair. This angered Niam. While they were still in the car, he punched her on her face, head and back. The victim turned her back towards Niam to protect herself, and he responded by pulling her hair. Niam also grabbed his wife by her jaw to force her to face him, and threatened to kick her in the stomach. ""He did all this intending to cause hurt to the victim and thereby caused bodily pain to her,"" stated court documents. The couple eventually got out of the car and went to their flat, where Niam packed his bags to leave and meet his friend. The victim held onto the gate of the flat to prevent him from leaving. According to charge sheets, Niam took a chopper, pointed it towards his wife and said: ""I throw the knife, you want to die right?"" These actions formed the criminal intimidation charge that was taken into consideration. The victim let go of the gate and fled from the flat. She sought treatment at a hospital and was found to have tenderness over her head, temple and hand. ""The accused knew he was in an intimate relationship with the victim as they were
husband and wife,"" stated court documents. ""This relationship adversely affected the victim's ability to protect herself from the hurt caused by the accused, given that she lived with him in the same household and was pregnant with his child."" Deputy Public Prosecutor Gabriel Choong sought two to three months' jail, citing the victim's physical and emotional vulnerability as she was pregnant. ""Even if the accused's attacks were not directed at her abdomen, they still posed risks to the unborn child given the late stage of the pregnancy,"" said the prosecutor. He noted that Niam had specifically threatened to kick his wife in the stomach. He also argued that the attack was sustained and happened in the narrow confines of a car, where the victim was less able to evade blows. The maximum punishment for voluntarily causing hurt is up to three years' jail, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both. When the offence is committed against a victim who is in an intimate relationship with the offender, the offender is liable for enhanced penalties of up to twice the maximum punishment."

He previously failed in his appeals to the High Court in 2011, to the Court of Appeal in 2019 and in his petition to the president for clemency. At the end of March, the Court of Appeal upheld the dismissal of his application to commence judicial review proceedings on the basis that he purportedly possesses the mental age of someone below 18. Chief Justice Menon had described that appeal as ""a blatant and egregious abuse of the court's processes"", which seemed to have the aim of ""unjustifiably delaying"" the execution. Deputy Public Prosecutor Wong Woon Kwong argued that Mdm Panchalai had no standing to be a party to the application, and that it could only be brought by Nagaenthran himself. On the substance of the motion, Mr Wong called it ""baseless"" and said that Nagaenthran previously did not object to Chief Justice Menon's involvement despite knowing that his tenure as Attorney-General had overlapped with Nagaenthran's criminal proceedings. ""It is dishonest for Nagaenthran to now take issue with the Chief Justice's involvement in legal proceedings, yet conveniently omit the fact that he had confirmed, through his counsel and on legal advice, that he had no objections to Chief Justice Menon being on the coram,"" said Mr Wong. The prosecutor added: ""In any event, Chief Justice Menon was not involved in any of the decisions pertaining to Nagaenthran's prosecution."" Mr Wong also argued that the application, which he said had no merit, was the latest in a series of ""repeated drip-feeding to abuse the court's process"". He argued that Chief Justice Menon's involvement was not raised earlier by Nagaenthran's previous lawyers even though one of them, Mr M Ravi, had considered this issue. This appeared to show that the application was ""deliberately withheld"" for this stage of proceedings, said the prosecutor. To that end, Mr Wong asked the court to compel Mdm Panchalai to disclose the identities of those involved in drafting the motion paper and affidavit for the application. This would disallow those individuals from evading possible consequences, including costs and sanctions, he said. The prosecutor said it was ""obvious"" that the motion paper had been drafted on legal advice, with Justice Phang also noting that it was ""very much a legal document"". According to the prosecution, Mdm Panchalai had alluded to the documents being prepared with the help of ""friends and social activists"". ""By masking the identity of the 'friends and social activists' who purportedly assisted Mdm Panchalai with this application, the bringers of this application seek to shield the persons who are participating in this gross abuse of process,"" said Mr Wong. ""The lawyers and persons responsible for abetting this application should not be allowed to hide under a veil of anonymity to evade the consequences that ought to normally follow in such abuses of the court's processes."" Under questioning from the judges, Mdm Panchalai said that the legal documents were drafted by ""family"" and ""friends of our relatives"". She said these friends were ""educated"" but not legally trained, and that they were also the ones who helped her to physically file the application. Mr Wong additionally asked the court to order that no further applications shall be brought by or on behalf of Nagaenthran without the leave of the Court of Appeal. ""Nagaenthran has been afforded due process under law. Yet, whether through the influence of external parties or otherwise, Nagaenthran has continued to abuse the court's processes by yet again bringing another meritless application which takes up valuable court resources. ""This must be stopped to stem the continued attacks on the fundamental administration of justice,"" said the prosecutor. After the judgment was delivered, Nagaenthran requested to spend time with his family, specifically seeking permission to ""hold their hands"". Mdm Panchalai told the court that the family would have been given a three-hour meeting with Nagaenthran in prison ahead of his execution, if not for the hearing. The judges granted Nagaenthran's request for them to hold each other's hands in the courtroom, and gave the family another two hours to spend together in the Supreme Court building after that."

In the post on Feb 16, four months after the incident, the union said it had been helping the security officer who was allegedly pushed by a driver of a BMW car.  The suspect will be charged in court on Wednesday with voluntarily causing grievous hurt, said the police.  If found guilty, he faces up to 10 years in jail, a fine or caning. The police said it takes a serious view of the harassment and abuse of security officers.  “Offenders who harass and abuse security officers in the course of their work will be dealt with firmly, and in accordance with the law,” it added.  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/woman-died-hit-head-fight-two-sons-autistic-affair-coroner-inquiry-2647586,Woman who died of head injury collapsed during struggle with two sons at home,"SINGAPORE: A 52-year-old woman died of a head injury after collapsing during an altercation with her two sons at home, a coroner's court heard on Tuesday (Apr 26). On the first day of a coroner's inquiry into the woman's death, a police investigating officer testified that both sons pushed her during the struggle and caused her head to hit the wall. However, a forensic pathologist was unable to determine which blow caused the fatal injury. The woman lived in a three-room flat with her 55-year-old husband and two sons, aged 21 and 17 at the time of the incident. All of their identities are protected by gag order. The younger son is autistic and diagnosed to be minimally verbal and intellectually disabled, while the elder son was serving National Service at the time of the incident. The woman was her younger son's main caregiver, caring for him on weekdays and working as a part-time sales assistant during the weekends. Her husband worked as a bus driver. On the day of the incident, he had left the house for work at 4.30am. According to the elder son's police statement, he suspected that his mother was having an affair sometime in 2019. Early in the morning on Aug 16, 2019, he saw her lying down on the sofa in the living room, where she slept, and speaking softly into her phone. He eavesdropped on the call for a while, then confronted her and asked her who was on the phone. They got into a heated argument, during which he snatched the phone and threw it on the floor. When the woman picked the phone up, her son slapped her and demanded the phone back, but she refused. He then punched her in the face. They continued to struggle over the phone. The son pushed his mother on the shoulder, causing her to hit her head on the wall by the TV console. She then bit his arm and he punched her in the head again. The younger son entered the living room at this point and hit his elder brother on the shoulder. As the two brothers struggled, their mother came towards them. At this point, the younger son pushed his mother and she fell backwards, her head hitting the wall. She got up and took two steps, then fell to the floor, had a seizure and vomited. The elder son called the ambulance and a friend to take care of his younger brother, while trying to stop his mother's seizures. Paramedics arrived at the flat at about 6.25am and saw the woman lying on her back in the living room. They questioned the elder son, who admitted that they had a struggle during which he pushed her and her head hit the wall. After the paramedics noticed bruises on the woman's face, he also admitted to punching her. As the woman was not responsive, she was taken to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. Her elder son accompanied her, while her younger son stayed at home in the care of the brother's friend. The woman underwent brain surgery but her condition continued to deteriorate. She was eventually pronounced dead after midnight on Aug 24, 2019, eight days after the altercation. Police were alerted to the case after the woman was admitted to hospital. Later in the afternoon on Aug 16, 2019, they arrested her elder son for causing grievous hurt by a rash act. The woman's damaged phone was seized and forensic examinations performed on it to shed light on the incident, but no information could be obtained from it even after it was sent for repairs. Both sons were assessed by Institute of Mental Health (IMH) psychiatrists after the incident. The elder son admitted to growing increasingly upset with his mother over her alleged affair about two months before the incident. He was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, with the symptoms starting two months before his mother's death. The psychiatrist said that these depressive symptoms led to poor judgment, which likely served as a contributory factor to the alleged offence. The younger son was diagnosed with autism before he turned five. He was only able to give his name during the IMH examination, with no other meaningful communication possible. Officers who tried to interview him after the incident also found that he was not able to answer questions and released him. The psychiatrist found that the younger son was not of sound mind and unfit to plead in court. An autopsy report concluded that the cause of death was head injury. The examiner found that the woman's injuries were consistent with either a direct blow to her head with a blunt object, or a fall resulting in her head having impact with a hard surface. The police concluded that it was not possible to tell with any certainty which of the woman's two sons was directly responsible for her fatal injury, the investigating officer testified. In consultation with the Attorney-General's Chambers, the police issued the elder son a two-year conditional warning for voluntarily causing hurt. Given the younger son's mental state, no further action was taken against him, said the investigating officer. After turning 18, the teenager was no longer able to attend school programmes and was placed in a home in November 2019. He has remained there since, with visits by his father and his mother's brother every week. They have applied for him to be housed there permanently. The woman's next-of-kin did not attend the coroner's inquiry at the State Courts on Tuesday. State Coroner Adam Nakhoda said he would issue his findings on Jul 1."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/safe-distancing-nea-officer-boon-lay-food-village-man-fine-2645956,Man fined for swearing at NEA safe distancing officer at Boon Lay hawker centre,"SINGAPORE: A man was fined S$3,000 on Monday (Apr 25) for swearing at a safe distancing enforcement officer at a hawker centre in Boon Lay. Ng Chee Wei, 33, pleaded guilty to one count of using abusive words against a public servant. The court heard that Ng went to Boon Lay Place Food Village at about 1.30pm on Aug 29 last year, where he saw two of his friends seated at a table. At the time, only two groups of two were allowed to dine together in hawker centres. Excess seats at the table were clearly demarcated. Despite this, Ng sat at his friends' table to chat. The victim, a 50-year-old National Environment Agency officer, and two of his colleagues were performing safe distancing enforcement duties at the hawker centre at the time. The victim's colleague spotted Ng sitting with his friends and approached him. Ng told them that he knew what he was doing was an offence and stood up. However, Ng continued to stand close to his friends. The victim told Ng that he had to maintain a safe distance. Ng persisted in standing close to them despite this. He then got angry and asked the victim what he wanted. When the victim requested for Ng's identity card to take enforcement action, Ng claimed he did not have it and insisted on providing his particulars verbally. When the victim did not accept this, Ng challenged him to call for the police. While the victim was doing so, Ng swore at him in English and Hokkien. The victim did not respond and waited for the police to arrive. The penalty for using abusive words towards a public servant in relation to their duties is jail for up to a year, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ocbc-bank-teller-steal-gambling-2645886,"OCBC bank teller who stole S$10,000 to fund gambling habit gets jail","SINGAPORE: To fund his gambling habit, an OCBC bank teller took almost S$10,000 from his work cash bag over two months. Zechariah Wong An Yi, 26, was jailed for at least half a year on Monday (Apr 25) after pleading guilty to a charge of criminal breach of trust. Four more charges were considered for sentencing. The court heard that Wong was handed a cash bag at the start of each shift, with the money to be transferred to his teller drawer. Between Oct 1 and Nov 28, 2019, he took money from the cash bag on numerous occasions. He would use the money for gambling, often betting on football matches. Wong took a few hundred dollars each time. To avoid detection, he would replace the money whenever his cash bag was to be inspected. He got this replacement money by withdrawing cash from his father's and friend's bank accounts. This involved forging their signatures on cash withdrawal forms. To do this, Wong accessed OCBC's signature verification system on 15 occasions to view their specimen signatures. He submitted the cash withdrawal forms with their forged signatures on four occasions in November 2019, withdrawing a total of S$7,300 from his father's account and S$2,189 from his friend's. Wong also deposited S$500 in his friend's account using money taken from the cash bag. Wong's father and friend did not expect him to return the money withdrawn from their accounts, the court heard. The judge sentenced him to a total of 26 weeks' jail. Wong could have been jailed for up to 30 years and fined for committing the offence of criminal breach of trust by a servant."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/healthcare-worker-niece-tracetogether-nni-ttsh-covid-19-cluster-2645466,"Healthcare worker fined for using niece's TraceTogether to check into malls, library while on leave of absence","SINGAPORE: A patient service associate at the National Neuroscience Institute (NNI) used her niece's TraceTogether token to check into malls and a library while on a leave of absence. That was in April last year, when COVID-19 cases were reported in Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) where NNI is located. The cluster would eventually grow to 48 cases, with three deaths.  Priscilla Tan Siew Sin, 34, had been traced as a contact of a doctor who contracted COVID-19. She did not test positive for the coronavirus. Tan was fined S$10,000 on Monday (Apr 25) after pleading guilty to one count of fraud by making a false representation. Two more charges were considered for sentencing. On Apr 28, 2021, the Ministry of Health announced that a nurse working in Ward 9D of TTSH had tested positive for COVID-19. The next day, Tan's reporting officer was informed that a doctor in NNI had also tested positive. Internal contact tracing showed that Tan was one of the doctor's clinic assistants on Apr 23, 2021. She underwent a COVID-19 swab test, was placed on a leave of absence and advised to stay home. The court heard that a leave of absence meant that Tan was to remain in her home as much as possible and minimise social contact. She was still allowed to leave her home for daily necessities or to attend to important matters, but was to minimise the time she spent in public places. On Apr 30, 2021, Tan wanted to go outside to buy food. ""However, as her swab test results were not yet out, she was afraid that she would get into more trouble if she was found to have COVID-19 but had left her residence,"" stated court documents. She was also afraid that ""if there was someone with COVID-19 at the place that she was planning on going to, she would be contact-traced and get into trouble for leaving the house"". Tan therefore asked her 12-year-old niece if she could use her TraceTogether token, and the girl agreed. Tan left her house and walked to The Poiz Centre, checking in using her niece's TraceTogether token at around 7.50pm. She repeated this two more times on May 2 that year, visiting library@esplanade before going to Marina Square. On Sep 3, 2021, Tan's reporting officer filed a police report that she had checked into The Poiz Centre with another person's token. This was after an internal disciplinary board advised the matter be reported to the police. Deputy Public Prosecutor Wu Yu Jie sought a fine of at least S$10,000, calling Tan's actions irresponsible. He argued that she took the risk of exposing others to COVID-19 while knowing there was a possibility that she had contracted the illness. Tan's actions significantly undermined contact tracing efforts implemented to keep the population safe, added the prosecutor. ""The integrity of the data collected for the purposes of contact tracing must be maintained. False entries and assumed identities can hinder contact tracing efforts,"" said Mr Wu. Defence lawyer Joyce Khoo sought a fine of no more than S$5,000. She contented that the need to deter other potential offenders was lower given recent changes to step down the use of SafeEntry and TraceTogether from Tuesday. However, District Judge Ronald Gwee rejected this argument, saying: ""Tomorrow being the easing of measures does not necessarily mean the end of the situation as we know it. ""Authorities have warned that at any time should there be a variant that comes in, certain measures have to be reversed. I don't see that as a mitigating factor at all."" Ms Khoo pointed out that Tan would have been allowed to go out to buy food if she had used her own TraceTogether token, calling her decision to use her niece's token a ""foolish mistake"". The lawyer also argued that Tan did not spend more time than required to buy her food, spending only a few minutes in Marina Square. When Judge Gwee pointed out that Tan was not allowed to visit the library then, Ms Khoo said that she made the decision on the spot rather than leaving her house with the intention to do so, and spent less than 15 minutes there. In response, the prosecutor said that Tan was ""not entirely innocent"" as she still had the intention to circumvent contact tracing if she turned out to be a positive case or if she was traced to another positive case. Delivering his sentence, Judge Gwee said the court had to take the COVID-19 situation at the time of the offence as the background to Tan's actions. ""We should not be lulled into a situation where we forget that we have to be vigilant against this virus,"" he said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-insider/forensic-psychiatrist-criminal-minds-heavy-duty-podcast-2640606,This psychiatrist has looked into the minds of rapists and killers. Here’s what he’s seen,"SINGAPORE: Rapists, murderers and even serial killers — Jaydip Sarkar has seen them all. When he was working in Singapore at the Institute of Mental Health, he was involved in some of the highest-profile court cases in recent memory. They include a couple who abused their young child, who later died from scald injuries, and a Nigerian charged with drug trafficking who walked free after years of legal twists, to name just two. As a forensic psychiatrist, Sarkar assesses accused persons who have been referred by the court, prosecutors, lawyers or the police. In a career spanning four countries and nearly three decades, he has been called upon to de-escalate a hostage situation and has also come face to face with a killer who dismembered his victim. No matter how heinous the offence, however, Sarkar believes his job is to “humanise the monster”. He listens to their life stories and connects with them, he tells CNA Insider in the inaugural episode of Heavy Duty, a podcast series featuring people who deal with the dark side of human nature in their work. Sarkar, who worked in Singapore from 2012 to 2018, speaks calmly and matter-of-factly about the crimes and criminals he has come across. He does not dramatise or downplay. And that is how he sees his role in the criminal justice system, which is to put out the offender’s story for the judge to arrive at a decision. “As doctors, our job isn’t to be judgemental and condemnatory — as society and media tend to be — of such people,” says Sarkar, 53. He tries to shift the court’s perception “beyond the initial horror of reading what the person has done … to a position of empathy”. Many offenders have been dealt “terrible hands” at birth, says Sarkar, who is now a consultant forensic psychiatrist and personality disorder specialist at Forensicare (the Victorian Institute of Forensic Mental Health) in Melbourne, Australia. They may have parents who were violent, neglectful or took drugs. And many of them learnt from a young age that “this is how relationships happen — if you want to coexist, you abuse the other”. He stresses that empathy does not mean excusing their feelings and actions but simply understanding and acknowledging them. “What I’ve learnt about the human heart and condition is that we’re more alike than dissimilar to the offenders we condemn and lock away and want to forget about,” he says. Childhood experiences and an interest in the “whydunnit” helped to steer his career choice. While growing up in a town in India that was not very developed at the time, he witnessed things like mob violence and random attacks on the street. He found himself interested in crime scenes and fascinated by intentional injuries. Detective stories including Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot made him want to go beyond the whodunnit, to understanding why a crime was committed. “Once you know the ‘why’, you can ask, how do you manage the situation so that such violence doesn’t recur?” he says. A forensic psychiatrist also needs a degree of inner calm, Sarkar believes. “It’s not enough to have external calmness around you, so I do a lot of meditation, alone time, listening to music,” he shares. From heavy metal and rock and roll in his younger days, it is now classical and slow music that is easy on his ear. Also, it does not take much more than nature — greenery, lakes and birdsong — to de-stress him. “I don’t smoke. I rarely drink. I eat healthy foods, not that it’s helping with my weight,” he quips. His response to people who ask about his job has also changed, says the father of one. In the beginning, he would perhaps “gloat a bit”. “When I was a young trainee, it felt quite sexy … quite glamorous being a forensic psychiatrist. You were among the tough guys, and going into (the job), you form these images from watching movies,” he says. Over time, he has become more cautious because people tend to be curious about his patients once they hear what he does for a living. “I generally say I help people who are in distress in prison and the legal system, but I’m a psychiatrist. And that kind of shuts people up,” he adds. Less visible to the public than court-related work is the way forensic psychiatrists treat offenders after sentencing and provide inmates with mental healthcare. The treatment is for the long haul as the patients could live in forensic or secure hospitals for eight to 10 years or more, says Sarkar. The aim of treatment is to “give them another crack at life that they didn’t get the first time around”. It often requires intensive rehabilitation after patients have been treated with medication They get therapy to aid their psychological understanding and help them be more able to tolerate and interact with others safely. They may also receive skills training to enable them to make a living after release, he notes. Except for a “small handful” of cases comprising the “really untreatable psychopathic individuals”, Sarkar believes everybody is redeemable to different extents. Some may never leave the prison or hospital system, he says. But within these systems, they are “capable of forming compassionate relationships, helping those who are in need”. “That’s how I see my goal: How I can make a person more productive to society,” he adds. One of the most rewarding cases of his career was a man he treated in the United Kingdom. The man had schizophrenia and was “very unwell” when he ran into a church one morning with a sword and injured parishioners. He got well after years of treatment and received training in information technology at a secure hospital. The last Sarkar heard, the patient found work after his release, got married and was living in the community, with support from a team. Another uplifting case was that of the Nigerian accused of drug trafficking in Singapore. Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi was caught in 2011 with a suitcase found to contain drugs and was later convicted by the highest court in the land. He was facing the gallows or life in prison when Sarkar assessed him sometime between 2016 and 2017. Sarkar’s assessment was that Ilechukwu suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder after seeing a tribal massacre in Nigeria at the age of five. It made a pivotal difference to the case — there was possibly an innocent reason why he had lied and given inconsistent statements to the police. His lawyers fought to have the Court of Appeal review the conviction. He was acquitted in 2020, nine years after his arrest. Sarkar’s finding was “precisely the evidence we needed to take the case across the line”, said Johannes Hadi, one of the defence lawyers. “I think that was because he’d spent some time in London, where he had a lot of contact with refugees from the African continent who were fleeing precisely this kind of ethnic tribal conflict (that Ilechukwu had encountered),” says Hadi. “I felt he was attuned to some aspects of the human experience that not many people in Singapore are.” The lawyer, 31, met Sarkar when the latter flew to Singapore to give further evidence to the court in 2018. “I remember — after meeting him — thinking maybe psychiatry is something I want to do,” Hadi says with a laugh. To Sarkar, he is simply doing his part in the criminal justice process. “I’m not on the prosecution’s side or the defence’s side; I’m on the side of the evidence because that’s what matters,” he says. “That keeps my conscience clear.” To hear more about patients Dr Jaydip Sarkar has helped, tune in to Heavy Duty here.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/hospital-cleaner-molest-paralysed-patient-jail-2640711,Hospital cleaner jailed for molesting paralysed patient who could not speak,"SINGAPORE: A 56-year-old man was jailed two years and two months on Friday (Apr 22) for molesting a paralysed patient in the hospital where he worked as a cleaner. The victim, a 42-year-old woman, could not ask for help as she was completely paralysed and could not speak or move. The victim and hospital cannot be named due to a gag order. The offender's name is not being reported as it could lead to the identification of the hospital. District Judge Kessler Soh said the degree of sexual intrusion in the offence was high. The man had touched the victim's breast under her pyjamas for 15 seconds. The judge gave no weight to the offender's diagnosis of schizophrenia, as a psychiatric evaluation found no causal link with the offence committed. The total sentence included two months' jail in lieu of four strokes of the cane, as the offender is above 50 and cannot be caned. The man last month pleaded guilty to using criminal force on the victim to outrage her modesty. The court heard that the cleaner had been working at the hospital since 2020. At about 4.30pm on Apr 27 last year, he was mopping the floor when he saw the victim lying in bed with the first two buttons of her pyjama top undone. He put her hand under her top, molesting her. At this time, a nurse who was helping another patient saw the man touching the victim and shouted to ask him what he was doing. The man removed his hand without saying anything and left the ward to continue his work. The nurse then approached the victim and asked if she was okay. The victim reacted by looking at her. The nurse asked the victim if the man had touched her breast, and the victim blinked three times. The nurse understood this to mean ""yes"" as it was their method of communication. The offender later admitted to police that he had touched the victim's breast. He claimed to have molested her because he forgot to take his medication and ""heard voices"" telling him to touch her. However, he was found not to be suffering a relapse of schizophrenia and not to be of unsound mind during the offence. He was liable to receive an enhanced penalty of up to four years' jail for committing the offence against a vulnerable person, as well as a fine."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/kranji-woodland-trees-clearance-jtc-officers-charged-nparks-2640636,Kranji woodland clearance: 2 JTC officers among 3 people charged in court,"SINGAPORE: Two JTC Corporation officers are among three people who were on Friday (Apr 22) charged with causing the illegal clearance of trees at a woodland in Kranji. Chong Pui Chih, 46, and Neo Jek Lin, 44, were given seven charges under the Parks and Trees Act. Neo also received an eighth charge under the Wildlife Act. Chong was a deputy director in JTC while her subordinate Neo was a senior project manager at the time of the offences in 2020 and 2021. The third person charged was Tan See Chee, 63, a superintending officer of contracts at CPG Consultants at the time. A fourth individual, Jimmy Liu Wing Tim, 62, is expected to be charged at a later date as he was medically unfit to attend court on Friday. He was a superintending officer's representative at CPG Consultants. Chong, Neo and Tan are accused of conspiring with each other and Liu to cause Huationg Contractor to illegally cut down trees without the approval of the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation. To this end, sometime before Jan 13, 2021, Huationg Contractor allegedly cut down the trees at several plots in Kranji Agri-Food Innovation Park. The location of the incident was given as Mukim No 11 Kranji Close/Kranji Road. Two of Chong's charges were for making documents that contained falsehood to obtain approval from the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation. On Nov 19, 2020, she allegedly drafted and sent an email seeking approval from the National Parks Board (NParks) to start clearance works at plot 1 of Kranji Agri-Food Innovation Park. On Jan 12, 2021, she allegedly made a PowerPoint presentation seeking approval from NParks to start land clearance works at plots 2, 3 and road 1 of Kranji Agri-Food Innovation Park concurrently while a fauna baseline study was conducted. These were purportedly false as clearance works at the plots had already started prior to Nov 19, 2020 and Jan 12, 2021 respectively, according to the charge sheets. Neo faces similar charges, with an additional charge of hindering the Director-General of Wildlife Management from exercising powers to stop the clearance works at Kranji Agri-Food Innovation Park. He is accused of instructing Liu to send an email to NParks containing a schedule for the clearance works at the site on Sep 25, 2020, in reply to NParks' request for information. The email to NParks purportedly represented that clearance works had only started on plot 10-1 of the site. However, Neo allegedly knew that clearance works had started on other plots of the site ""without the implementation of any wildlife-related measures"", stated charge sheets. The illegal clearance of the woodland drew shock and disappointment from nature advocates. The incident came to public attention when Facebook user Brice Li posted aerial photos showing swathes of cleared land in the area on Feb 14 last year. Two days later, JTC said that land earmarked for the development of the Kranji Agri-Food Innovation Park had been ""erroneously"" cleared. It instructed the contractor to stop all clearing works immediately and issued the firm a stern warning. In March this year, Education Minister Chan Chun Sing, who was Minister for Trade and Industry (MTI) at the time of the incident, said two officers from JTC had given ""inaccurate information"" to their superiors about the cleared woodland. Mr Chan said at the time: ""There is a natural follow-up question: 'Why did the officers do this?'"" He added that had procedures been followed, approval would likely have been given to clear the land ""subject to necessary conditions being met"". Mr Chan also said then that the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau had concluded that no corruption was involved. The process to obtain approval from the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation for felling trees involves a qualified person submitting an application for development control or building plan approval to NParks. Apart from this, there may also be a need for further wildlife-related measures. The Director-General of Wildlife Management may direct such measures on development works at any time as necessary, which may include environmental studies or mitigation measures. Those who cut a tree with a girth of more than 1m growing on vacant land without the approval of the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation can be fined up to S$50,000. The punishment for producing a false document to obtain approval from the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation is a fine of up to S$30,000. The punishment for hindering the Director-General of Wildlife Management from exercising powers without reasonable excuse is up to a year's imprisonment, a fine of up to S$10,000 or both. JTC said on Friday that as the matter is before the courts, it is premature to conclude ""if and what disciplinary actions should be taken against those involved"", adding that it takes a serious view of this incident.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/lawyer-breach-gag-order-eugene-thuraisingam-dr-yeo-sow-nam-2640351,Lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam charged with breaching gag order in case of doctor acquitted of molestation,"SINGAPORE: Veteran lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam, 46, was on Friday (Apr 22) charged with two counts of breaching a gag order in the case of a doctor who was later acquitted of molestation. Thuraisingam, the managing partner of Eugene Thuraisingam LLP, led the team of lawyers for the defendant in that case, Dr Yeo Sow Nam. He was charged with two counts of publishing transcripts of the court proceedings that contained unredacted information likely to lead to the identification of the complainant, according to charge sheets. He allegedly did so by instructing his associate in the firm, Johannes Hadi, to distribute these transcripts to the press in March and August last year. Hadi, 31, is accused of distributing the transcripts on Mar 16 and Aug 11, 2021. He also faces two charges of breaching the gag order. The punishment for this offence is imprisonment for up to a year, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both. Both accused will return to court for a pre-trial conference on May 20. Dr Yeo, an anaesthetist and director of a clinic at Mount Elizabeth Hospital, was on Aug 16, 2021 acquitted of all counts of molesting a woman after she admitted at trial that she was lying. He had been charged with four counts of outraging the 32-year-old woman's modesty at the hospital on Oct 9, 2017. The prosecutors had said they decided to withdraw the charges after considering the evidence as well as the defence lawyers' representations. Dr Yeo's lawyers - Thuraisingam, Hadi and Mr Chooi Jing Yen - had originally wanted the woman to be named and the gag order on her identity to be lifted. They subsequently withdrew their application due to legal reasons, but stated that they would take up the case again if she is charged with giving false evidence. On Aug 31, 2021, the Attorney-General’s Chambers said it would not be taking action against the woman."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/terry-xu-toc-online-citizen-cabinet-corrupt-defamation-daniel-de-costa-2638181,The Online Citizen's Terry Xu and writer get jail for criminal defamation over article calling Cabinet corrupt,"SINGAPORE: The chief editor of the now-defunct website The Online Citizen (TOC) was on Thursday (Apr 21) jailed for three weeks for criminal defamation. Terry Xu Yuanchen, 39, was found guilty in November last year of defaming members of the Cabinet of Singapore by approving the publication of a letter on Sep 4, 2018 that alleged ""corruption at the highest echelons"". The writer of the letter, Daniel De Costa Augustin, 38, was sentenced to three months and three weeks' jail. He will start serving his sentence on May 4. De Costa was convicted of a similar charge of criminal defamation and a second charge of unauthorised access to an email account not belonging to him, which he used to submit the article. During the hearing, Xu's lawyer Remy Choo took issue with the prosecution's allegations that his client's actions were part of a ""broader insidious agenda"". The prosecution had argued: ""The evidence suggests that the uploading of the article by Xu was part of a broader insidious agenda of publishing articles that cast unwarranted aspersions against the Government and members of Cabinet. ""He farcically attempts to rationalise that the 'fundamental right to freedom of expression' allows anyone to 'express (a) belief' that 'have not been proven untrue' against 'politicians, government bodies and ministries'. ""Such an approach is self-evidently absurd and clearly fashioned to defend his penchant for publishing articles that cast aspersions on Government without basis."" Mr Choo argued that this should not be a consideration before the court, as the existence of a ""broader insidious agenda"" was not proven at trial. Deputy Public Prosecutor Mohamed Faizal responded that the lawyer was asking the court to ignore the context and motive behind the article's publication. He read out an extract from Xu's police statement and said it demonstrated Xu's philosophy that ""it is up to those who have been defamed to prove the negative"", and that unless they did so, ""he has a right to publish what he wants"". Mr Choo responded that Xu was talking about his ""editorial philosophy of erring to the side of permitting publication as far as possible"", and that this did not substantiate the existence of a ""broader insidious agenda"". District Judge Ng Peng Hong eventually imposed the sentences sought by the prosecution, saying that the prison terms were warranted by ""the nature of the allegation, the standing of the defamed parties as well as the wide extent of the publication"". Supporters of Xu and De Costa attended the hearing at the State Courts. On Sep 4, 2018, De Costa sent an email titled ""PAP MP apologises to SDP"" from an Internet cafe in Chinatown, intending for it to be published on the TOC website. That same day, Xu approved the publication of the email sent to it from a person named Willy Sum, titled ""The Take Away From Seah Kian Ping's Facebook Post"". Mr Seah Kian Peng’s name was misspelt. The defamatory article said: ""We have seen multiple policy and foreign screw-ups, tampering of the Constitution, corruption at the highest echelons and apparent lack of respect from foreign powers ever since the demise of founding father Lee Kuan Yew"". De Costa used an email account belonging to Mr Sim Wee Lee to submit the article to TOC under the name Willy Sum. Mr Sim previously testified that he met De Costa while walking his dogs in 2005 or 2006, and they became friends. He allowed De Costa to use his email account to help him settle his bankruptcy and housing matters. He later found out that De Costa had sent emails criticising government officers without his permission. Both Xu and De Costa went to trial last year to contest their charges, and were convicted in November 2021. Mr Faizal and fellow Deputy Public Prosecutors Mohamed Senthilkumaran Sabapathy and Sheryl Yeo argued that corruption was one of the most serious allegations that could be made against public office holders. They noted that TOC had more than a million views a month according to Xu, and cited his previous descriptions of the website as ""an independent media platform"" that strove to provide readers with ""honest, objective, independent and factual reporting"". ""There would have, as such, been a wide reach for the defamatory article through the Internet through a platform that, via its assurances of integrity and independence, sought to actively provide readers a false veneer of credibility and reliability in relation to its contents,"" said the prosecutors. According to both the prosecution and defence, there had been only two reported cases of criminal defamation in Singapore prior to this one. In the first case from the early 1970s, Harbans Singh Sidhu was sentenced to six months' jail for calling then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew a scoundrel, gangster, kidnapper, and ""no 1 public enemy"" during an election campaign speech. In the second case from 2003, a woman called another woman a prostitute whose children were all born of different men. She was fined S$2,000. The prosecution argued that the earlier case paralleled Xu and De Costa's case as the defamatory remark was also directed at a public office holder. They also contended that both men's culpability was high as they ""made no effort whatsoever to ascertain the truth of the facts"" before the article was published. In particular, Xu's editorial process at TOC was ""lackadaisical if not completely non-existent"", said the prosecution. For De Costa's Computer Misuse Act offence, the prosecution highlighted his premeditation, abuse of Mr Sim's trust and persistent offending. They also said that De Costa caused ""real and tangible harm"" to Mr Sim by implicating him such that he had to assist in investigations and the trial. This exposed him to public scrutiny and caused him ""substantial inconvenience and emotional pain"", they argued. ""De Costa and Xu must be held to full account for their use of online platforms as an insidious means to launch baseless and unsubstantiated attacks against public office holders,"" stressed the prosecutors. Xu's lawyer Mr Choo asked for a fine of S$4,000, while De Costa's lawyer Chung Ting Fai asked for a fine of S$10,000. In mitigation, Mr Choo argued that Xu complied with IMDA's direction to remove the article from TOC's website within a few hours of the request being made on Sep 18, 2018. Xu also cooperated with authorities by providing the identity and particulars of the article's writer and information on the editorial, publishing and fact-checking process at TOC, said the lawyer. Mr Choo argued that the publication of the article was ""short-lived"" at only two weeks, and was not published on any other social media platform. Google Analytics data showed that there were only 1,132 page views from the time the article was published to when it was taken down, demonstrating its ""limited public reach and impact"", said the lawyer. De Costa's lawyer Mr Chung contended that his client's culpability was low as the phrase ""highest echelons"" could have been ""an authorial misstep rather than a deliberate assault"". This was because the phrase did not expressly refer to the Cabinet or any of its individual members, said Mr Chung. For criminal defamation, Xu and De Costa could have been jailed up to two years and fined. For unauthorised computer access, De Costa could also have been jailed up to two years, fined up to S$5,000 or both. The TOC website, founded in 2006, was taken offline in September last year after the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) suspended its class licence for repeatedly failing to to comply with its legal obligation to declare all funding sources. The licence was later cancelled by authorities.
In December, the High Court dismissed a bid by the website to overturn orders by IMDA to close its Chinese-language website and social media accounts."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-stab-housemate-introduced-drugs-cannabis-2638151,Man jailed for stabbing housemate who introduced him to drugs,"SINGAPORE: A man was jailed a year and 10 months on Thursday (Apr 21) for stabbing his housemate with a kukri knife in their kitchen, causing a collapsed lung. Teo Kok Yung, 35, pleaded guilty to two charges of voluntarily causing hurt and taking methamphetamine. Another charge was considered for sentencing. The court heard that Teo, then a designer, was under the influence of cannabis or methamphetamine at the time of the offences. During investigations, he admitted that he had been angry at the victim, who introduced him to drugs sometime in April 2020. Teo said that he did not intend to kill the victim, and that he ""wanted to take revenge as he had become a drug abuser because of (the victim)"", said court documents. Teo, his sister and the then 39-year-old victim were living together when the incident took place on Nov 12, 2020. Sometime after midnight, while they were at home, the victim gave Teo some cannabis to smoke. Teo went to sleep after smoking it. At about 4am, Teo woke up feeling angry towards the victim and picked up a kukri knife with a 28cm-long blade. Leaving his room, Teo found the victim in the kitchen. He proceeded to use the knife to slash and stab the victim multiple times, directing his blows at the man's torso and back. The victim used his hands to block some of the blows, and also tried to disarm and subdue Teo. The commotion woke Teo's sister, who came out of her room and saw the two men scuffling. She tried to separate them but was unsuccessful, and called an ambulance. The victim eventually managed to pin Teo to the floor and snatch the knife from him. He also took the chance to leave the apartment. After paramedics arrived, they called the police and Teo was subsequently arrested. The victim was taken to the hospital and found to have stab wounds and lacerations over his chest, back, stomach, arms and face in addition to the collapsed lung. According to the prosecution, the victim had to receive invasive surgery for the insertion of a chest drain, and was put out of action for at least 20 days. An Institute of Mental Health psychiatrist who examined Teo found that he was ""labouring under the intoxicating effects of cannabis or methamphetamine at the material time, which contributed significantly to his persecutory ideas"" towards the victim, said court documents. However, Teo was still aware of his actions and his intention to hurt the victim. He retained the ability to ""moderate his intent to only 'cut' or 'injure' and not to kill"" and to distinguish the victim from his sister, said the psychiatrist. Toxicology tests conducted after Teo's arrest found methamphetamine in his system, which he last smoked one or two days before his arrest. Deputy Public Prosecutor Kenneth Kee sought a year and 13 to 15 months' jail for Teo, citing the victim's injuries and the fact that the knife was wielded in the confines of an apartment with limited avenues for escape. Kee also argued that the attack was ""unprovoked and one-sided"". Defence lawyer Derek Kang asked for 15 to 16 months' jail, arguing that the victim had forgiven Teo. He also cited Teo's mental state at the time and the victim's role in its deterioration. In response, the prosecution said Teo's decision to take up the victim's offer of drugs before the incident occurred was entirely voluntary. ""While moral blameworthiness can and should be ascribed to the victim for introducing the accused to drugs"", this did not lessen Teo's culpability, said Mr Kee. ""Furthermore, as an adult of considerable age, the accused had free will in deciding whether to accept the victim's initial offer of drugs,"" he added. For voluntarily causing hurt with dangerous means or weapons, Teo could have been jailed up to 10 years, fined, caned or any combination of these punishments. He could also have been jailed for one to 10 years and fined up to S$20,000 for consuming methamphetamine."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/seahill-condo-security-guard-police-threaten-extort-2637816,"Condominium security guard jailed for trying to extort S$10,000 from visitor, claiming he trespassed","SINGAPORE: A condominium security guard posed as a police officer and tried to extort S$10,000 from a visitor, claiming to have evidence that the man illegally entered the condominium and had sex inside a toilet. Ganesan Gunasagaran, 33, was on Thursday (Apr 21) jailed two years and three months and sentenced to three strokes of the cane. He pleaded guilty to one charge of putting a person in fear of harm in order to commit extortion. Two other charges were considered for sentencing. Ganesan was a senior security officer employed by Metropolis Security Systems. He was deployed to Seahill condominium at the time of the offence in October last year. The condominium's management required all visitors to report to the guard house and do SafeEntry check-in before entering the estate. Ganesan's responsibilities as a security guard were to ensure that visitors did this and to conduct patrols. On the night of Oct 19, 2021, the victim, a 29-year-old Japanese man, visited a 26-year-old Japanese woman who lived at Seahill. They were both teachers. The victim entered the condominium without first reporting to the guard house or checking in on SafeEntry. At about 11pm, he and the woman went into a handicap toilet in the condominium together. Ganesan was on the same floor at this time and saw the victim and witness after they had left the toilet and were talking nearby. He approached them and accused the victim of trespassing into Seahill. He also claimed to have photographed them leaving the toilet together. Ganesan insisted that the victim had committed ""serious offences"" for which he could be jailed, and said he wanted to ""help"" the victim, court documents stated. As the woman was frightened by Ganesan's behaviour, the security guard and the victim agreed to take the conversation elsewhere. They continued talking at a bench at West Coast Park, arriving at about 1am on Oct 20, 2021. Ganesan told the victim not to worry and said he could ""do something"" for the Japanese man. Ganesan and the victim both understood this to mean that the security guard wanted to extort money. The victim started using his phone to record his conversation with Ganesan, on the pretext that he was texting the woman. Ganesan then asked the victim, ""How you want to settle?"" When the victim asked if he wanted ""tips"", Ganesan asked for S$10,000. Ganesan claimed that the victim and woman's faces were clearly caught on camera and that he had to review 90 cameras' worth of footage to delete all the relevant parts. Ganesan also emphasised to the victim that he would be charged in court, sent to prison and ""sack out from the country"" for his actions. He claimed to be a ""highly officer"" with the ""police licensing sector"" working ""undercover"", stated court documents. Fearful, the victim agreed to pay Ganesan S$2,000 first and transfer the remainder within a week. He asked to return home to prepare the money and the security guard agreed. For the rest of that day, Ganesan continued to threaten the victim with calls and text messages. He sent the victim screenshots of CCTV footage of the handicap toilet. He also claimed to work at the Police Cantonment Complex and sent photos of the building to bolster this claim. In the evening, he claimed to have told police officers about the victim's ""illegal entry to estate"" and that he ""had sex inside the toilet with student"". He told the victim to ""standby (his) Japan embassy"" and be prepared to ""handover your S'pass/permit"". He also demanded that the victim call him back to answer questions about the witness' age. ""He told the victim this to instil a sense of urgency in paying him,"" stated court documents. Later, Ganesan claimed to have placed a ""hold"" on investigations, and said that he knew the owner of the apartment in which the woman lived. That same night, the victim made a police report and Ganesan was arrested the next morning. Deputy Public Prosecutor Gabriel Choong asked for two-and-a-half years' jail and three to six strokes of the cane, citing Ganesan's ""extended course of conduct, which instilled fear in the victim over 22 hours"". He argued that Ganesan exploited ""a vulnerable victim found in a compromising position"", highlighting that the victim and the woman were foreign nationals. ""They risk losing their jobs and residency in Singapore should the accused follow through with his threat to disseminate what they allegedly did at Seahill,"" said the prosecutor. Mr Choong also cited Ganesan's impersonation of a police officer and the relatively high sum of S$10,000 that he tried to extort as aggravating. He also argued that Ganesan betrayed the trust placed in him by Seahill, by seeking a bribe in exchange for not taking action against the victim for entering without SafeEntry. Ganesan, who was not represented, asked for leniency as he was the sole breadwinner supporting his parents, whom he said faced health and financial problems. He also said the COVID-19 pandemic had pushed him into a ""depression"", and at one point interrupted the proceedings as he was feeling dizzy. The punishment for putting a person in fear of harm in order to commit extortion is two to five years' jail and caning."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/nine-men-arrested-stealing-scrap-metal-barge-kusu-island-2636756,Nine men arrested for stealing scrap metal from moving barge off Kusu Island,"SINGAPORE: Nine men aged between 30 and 42 were arrested for their suspected involvement in stealing scrap metal from a moving barge at sea, said police on Wednesday (Apr 20). On Tuesday, the Police Coast Guard (PCG) detected a suspicious sampan alongside a moving barge at about 10.30pm. The barge was being towed by a foreign-registered tugboat off Kusu Island. ""PCG patrol resources immediately responded and intercepted the suspicious sampan,"" said the police.  Six men were found on board the barge, with another two found hiding on board. The eight of them purportedly did not have any valid travel documents with them. Preliminary investigations revealed that a crew member from the foreign-registered tugboat had allegedly conspired with them to trespass on board the barge to steal the scrap metals. He was arrested together with the eight men, who were believed to have entered Singapore unlawfully.  The sampan, some scrap metal and a knife were seized as case exhibits. The nine men will be charged on Thursday for theft in dwelling. If found guilty, they can be jailed for up to seven years and fined. If found guilty of unlawfully entering Singapore, an individual can be punished with up to six months' imprisonment and a minimum of three strokes of the cane. ""The PCG will continue to take firm action against offenders to safeguard our territorial waters and sea borders against crime and security threats,"" said police."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/father-spy-cam-film-13-year-old-daughter-change-clothes-bedroom-voyeur-2635996,"Man jailed, caned for filming 13-year-old daughter changing clothes with spy cam","SINGAPORE: A 43-year-old man was sentenced to 18 weeks' jail and one stroke of the cane on Wednesday (Apr 20) for secretly filming his 13-year-old daughter undressing in her bedroom. The man, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the victim, had earlier admitted to planting a spy camera in her room to record videos of her changing into her school uniform twice in 2020. He had pleaded guilty to two charges of voyeurism. Another similar charge was also considered for sentencing. Deputy Public Prosecutor Andre Ong sought 16 to 18 weeks' jail and one to two strokes of the cane, highlighting that the victim was the man's own young, biological daughter and that he made repeated attempts to record her. Mr Ong also pointed out that the two videos the man admitted to filming were of significant lengths, at more than 20 minutes each. Defence lawyer Ashvin Hariharan asked for 16 weeks' jail with no caning, saying that his client was genuinely remorseful. He also argued that the man's plea of guilt had saved judicial resources and spared the victim the ordeal of testifying and recounting the incidents. In response, the prosecution said that a sentence of caning was warranted in this case given the ""graver"" abuse of trust, as the offender is the victim's father. Mr Ong also said that little weight should be given to the man's plea of guilt in considering whether to lighten his sentence, as there was a ""mountain of evidence"" against him and he had ""no choice"". The offender's face was clearly identifiable in video footage captured when he went to adjust the spy camera. The court previously heard that the man bought a spy camera resembling a USB charger sometime before July 2019. The device was able to transmit real-time footage to linked mobile phones in the vicinity, and allow the footage to be recorded on the phones. Early in the morning of Jul 6, 2020, the offender decided to covertly record the victim in her bedroom. He knew that she would be in a state of undress as she needed to change into her school uniform. He planted the spy camera in a corner of the bedroom, ensuring that the transmitted video feed was stable and twice adjusting the direction of the spy camera. About 10 minutes after the offender left the room, the victim entered her bedroom, undressed and left to take a shower. After returning from her shower, she put on her school uniform then left the room again. The spy camera recorded footage of her without her knowledge throughout this process. The man retrieved the device from her bedroom shortly after, and transferred the footage to his laptop and mobile phone. He repeated this the next morning, taking care to switch off the lights in the bedroom after planting the camera to minimise the chances of it being discovered. The offences came to light when the man's wife discovered videos of her daughter in various states of undress while using her husband's laptop on Aug 2, 2020. She made a police report on Aug 21 that year, saying that she had found about 155 such videos on the laptop, with timestamps between July 2019 and Jul 8, 2020. These included footage of the victim recorded with a camera positioned below the sink in the household's bathroom. During investigations, the man denied the allegations and claimed the spy camera was to monitor the victim studying in her bedroom. However, no footage of her studying was discovered during investigations. For each charge of voyeurism, the man could have been jailed up to two years and fined or caned."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/beach-road-chopper-attack-woman-condition-injuries-donations-2635856,"Victim of Beach Road chopper attack in stable condition, funds raised to help her","SINGAPORE: The woman injured in a chopper attack on Beach Road is in a stable condition but needs surgery for her injuries. Staff and business owners in the area who spoke to CNA on Wednesday (Apr 20) said that they have not been able to visit Ms Han Hongli but understand that she is in a stable condition. Her boss, the owner of Chong Qing (Original) Steamboat at Beach Road, gave an update on the victim's condition in a Facebook livestream on Monday. ""My injured staff member, she's fine, just that her injuries are quite bad. I went to visit her ... she's very badly injured, but she's very stable now,"" said the man, who identified himself as Edmund on Facebook. He runs livestreams on the platform regularly to sell food stuff. CNA has contacted him for more information. Cheng Guoyuan, a Chinese national, was charged on Saturday with the attempted murder of the 42-year-old woman. The 46-year-old is accused of ""slashing and chopping"" her with a chopper repeatedly, according to a charge sheet. Ms Han is believed to be his wife, the police said previously. According to a report from 8World, a colleague of Ms Han said her family has been informed of the incident. Videos that have gone viral show several men throwing objects at Cheng during the attack to try and fend him off. Ten people received Public Spiritedness Awards from the police on Monday. Mr Leonard Shi, owner of Samurai BBQ, was one of the men who stepped in to help during the attack on Apr 14. He told CNA that about S$20,000 has been raised for Ms Han. He said that he wanted to raise funds to ""help her with future recovery ... and maintenance for her kids' education"". Other businesses in the area also contributed, he added.  Mr Zhuang Qin Hua, the owner of Chef China restaurant on Beach Road, told CNA that his staff raised more than S$5,000 for Ms Han, to which he contributed S$1,500. He also wants to give S$4,500, or about S$500 each, to nine people who were commended for fending off the attacker. A Chef China employee is among them.  Mr Zhuang said that he invited four of them to a late supper on the day of the attack and offered them the reward but only one person took it. If they refuse the money, he will give it to Ms Han, he said. He also donated to the fund started by Mr Shi, saying that in all, he will contribute S$10,000. ""She is a neighbour and she has two children ... she can't work for now. Her children will need to go to school and I sympathise with her,"" he said in Mandarin. “For those who helped her, I think it's a form of 'positive energy' which we should try to spread."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ocbc-phishing-scams-money-laundering-leong-jun-xian-court-2635506,"OCBC phishing scam: Youth admits to money laundering, first to be dealt with by court","SINGAPORE: A 20-year-old man linked to the OCBC phishing scams late last year on Wednesday (Apr 20) admitted to offences that include money laundering. Leong Jun Xian is the first to be dealt with among those accused of being involved in the scam. A total of S$13.7 million was lost in the spate of phishing scams that affected 790 customers, according to OCBC Bank in an update in January. Leong pleaded guilty to five charges. Two of them were for assisting another to retain benefits from criminal conduct, and one was for being a member of a locally linked organised crime group. Aside from his involvement in the scams, Leong also pleaded guilty to two charges of rioting. Ten other charges will be considered for sentencing. His seven co-accused for the money laundering and organised crime charges are Kong Jia Quan, 19; Lim Kai Ze, 21; Jovan Soh Jun Yan, 20; Muhammad Khairuddin Eskandariah, 20; Brayden Cheng Ming Yan, 19; Roy Peh Yong Rong, 19; and a 17-year-old girl identified as ""A2"" in court documents. District Judge Kessler Soh called for reformative training and probation suitability reports, and ordered that Leong be remanded for a week at a reformative training centre. He will return to court for sentencing next week. The court heard that between Dec 8, 2021, and Jan 19, police received 768 reports from OCBC bank account holders who fell prey to phishing scams. The victims had lost a total of about S$12.8 million. Victims received SMSes from the scammers, who were impersonating OCBC Bank, informing them of fake banking issues and containing a link to resolve the issues. When victims clicked on the link, they were taken to a fake OCBC login page where they entered their login details. This allowed the scammers to gain control of their bank accounts and make unauthorised transactions. Investigations revealed that two people, Peh and Tan Shu Kai, had received funds originating from the scam victims. The police conducted raids at two flats in Yishun Avenue 6 and Edgefield Plains on Feb 22. Sixteen people were arrested, including Leong and the co-accused.  Authorities also seized 112 ATM cards and debit cards from the Yishun flat. Investigations into these are ongoing. Leong and the co-accused worked together to provide money laundering services to various unknown individuals believed to be linked to overseas syndicates, said the prosecution. They did this by finding and providing control of bank accounts to the syndicates. They provided at least 16 bank accounts to the syndicates in Telegram chat groups between last December and this February, with Leong personally providing 12 of the accounts. The 16 accounts received almost S$600,000 from victims of various scams, including the OCBC phishing scams. Leong and the co-accused communicated with the syndicates in three Telegram chat groups known as ""K2 1.505"", ""G5 xiao ye che"" and one named with the emoji of a Singapore flag. They worked for an individual known as ""William"", who also used the name ""Huang Fei Hong"" in the K2 chat group, a ""Huang Da Ge"" in the G5 chat group and a ""Terry"" in the Singapore flag chat group, whom Leong and his co-accused believed to be based overseas. Leong and his co-accused also used another Telegram chat group named ""Mobile Legends"" for their internal communications. Leong was a member of all four chat groups. His role involved finding bank accounts from unknown individuals on Telegram and providing their bank account details to the syndicates in the chat groups. He also instructed agents working under him to find such bank accounts, and gave instructions to Peh and A2 to withdraw cash from the accounts as directed by the syndicates. On one occasion on Dec 28 last year, Leong and Kong instructed A2 to withdraw a total of S$81,800 from her bank account. The money was traceable to two victims of the OCBC phishing scams. A2 handed the money to Leong, who used a portion of it to pay bank account holders who had sold him their accounts. William promised Leong a salary of S$3,000 a month, with an additional S$600 to S$800 for each bank account he provided. Leong admitted to knowing that the money put into the accounts he provided was ""not clean"", and that he had reason to believe the individuals he communicated with in the chat groups were involved in criminal activity, said the prosecution. Deputy Public Prosecutor Lee Wei Liang said that while Leong himself did not run the phishing scams, he was a ""lynchpin"" akin to ""middle management"" in the money laundering organisation that provided services to the overseas scammers for profit. These money laundering arrangements were an integral part of the ""eco-system"" in which the scammers operated, said the prosecutor, adding: ""Without such tools, the syndicates are toothless."" Mr Lee cited the gravity of Leong's offences and his pattern of offending, which he said had escalated over time, to argue that probation was not a ""realistic"" sentence for Leong. He asked the court to call for a reformative training report. The scale of offending by the money laundering group was unprecedented, and the societal impact on the victims being scammed of their hard-earned savings ""cannot be overstated"", he said. He highlighted that group was organised, with each member holding defined roles and the entire organisation being ""geared for efficiency"". Calling Leong a ""serial and prolific"" offender, Mr Lee said the fact that the youth had no prior criminal record ""only means the law had not caught him with until this point"". Probation would send the wrong signal that a youthful offender could carry out such crimes with impunity, added the prosecutor. Defence lawyer Audrey Koo of Populus Law said Leong was committed to not reoffending. She said he had strictly abided by his curfew hours and his relationship with his parents had improved since his arrest. The lawyer said that her client's money laundering offences were motivated by greed, but argued that he had not considered the long-term consequences of his actions given his young age. ""At his age, he was easily baited by the promise of easy money dangled in front of him"" as he did not have the maturity, said Ms Koo, adding that a probation officer would be able to guide him to assess the risks when faced with such decisions. In calling for a probation report, she told the court that Leong needed education and the support of his family. She also argued that the syndicate made use of young offenders like Leong, saying: ""If it was not him, it would have been another 20-year-old lured by the easy money."" In response, the prosecution reiterated that Leong played a ""central role"" in the offences for which he was being sentenced. Judge Soh called for both the probation and reformative training reports, saying that the probation report would allow him to have a better understanding of Leong's background. The offence of facilitating the control of benefits from criminal conduct is punishable with up to 10 years' jail, a fine of up to S$500,000 or both. Those found guilty of being a member of a locally linked organised crime group can be jailed for up to five years, fined up to S$100,000 or both The punishment for rioting is up to seven years in jail and caning."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/johor-bahru-crime-police-singapore-motorists-2633956,Johor police reject social media post showing alleged muggings of Singapore motorists,"JOHOR BAHRU: The Johor police department has rejected a social media post that purportedly shared footage of Singapore motorists being robbed by motorcyclists in Johor Bahru, citing the state's falling crime rates in the first quarter of this year.   In a statement released on Tuesday, Johor’s criminal investigation department chief Shahurinain Jais said that the post had alleged that Singaporeans would get robbed if they visited Johor Bahru. He added that the post implied there had been a spike in crime activity in Johor after the reopening of land borders between Malaysia and Singapore. “Johor police stress that the allegation is false because the current crime rate index in Johor does not show any increase,” said Mr Shahurinain.  “Hence, the public is advised not to easily be fooled by what is circulating online, and to do checks to ensure that the information is true,” he added.  In response to queries from CNA, a Johor police spokesperson confirmed that the Facebook post in question was put up by a Les Lynn Lim. It read: “Footage of Motorists gang in JB robbin Sporean motorists & cars…Those driving in pls b v v safe.”  The post also contained photos and videos of motorists being robbed and hurt, purportedly by motorcycle gangs in Johor Bahru targeting Singaporean tourists.  However, the police spokesperson said that these were from 2014 and were recently recirculated on social media and WhatsApp.  In his statement, Mr Shahurinain noted that Johor's crime rate index for January to March had fallen, compared to the same period last year. There were 339 fewer cases, he said, representing a 22.16 per cent drop.   He added that property crime and assault cases fell by 22.55 per cent and 20.54 per cent respectively. “All in all, the crime rate in Johor is still manageable and in preparation for the upcoming festive season while the border is reopened, the criminal investigation department is active in launching various operations to aggressively deter criminal activity, including eliminating entertainment, gambling and violence activities in the state of Johor,” said Mr Shahurinain.  “This is to ensure that the state of Johor is free from crime, safe to live in and will be keenly visited by people from around the country and overseas.” "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mom-labour-trafficking-entertainment-outlet-operator-jailed-41-months-2633891,Nightspot operator withheld passports and salaries of 3 women; jailed 41 months for labour trafficking,"SINGAPORE: A 47-year old man has been sentenced to 3 years and 5 months in prison, and fined S$27,365 over three charges under the Prevention of Human Trafficking Act 2014, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Tuesday (Apr 19). Alagar Balasubramanian, a Singapore permanent resident, was also ordered by the court to pay S$2,722 in compensation. He was convicted on Feb 21 for labour trafficking offences relating to his work as the operating manager of Jaiho Club, an entertainment establishment formerly located at 46 Dunlop Street. If Balasubramanian fails to pay his fine, he will be jailed for an additional 20 weeks. If he fails to pay the compensation, he will face two more weeks in prison. MOM was first alerted to the case in June 2016. Investigations revealed that Balasubramanian had interviewed and hired female work permit holders for performing artiste jobs at Jaiho Club. The trial involved three of these work permit holders. “Prior to entering Singapore, the work permit holders were made to sign contracts that were not fully explained to them,” MOM said in a media release. “(Balasubramanian) then imposed onerous financial demands that the work permit holders would not be able to repay if they wished to leave their jobs. “They were not paid any salaries throughout their employment.” The women also endured physical and psychological abuse during this time. “(Balasubramanian) subjected the work permit holders to constant distress, including seizing their passports and mobile phones, and threatening to cause them physical harm if they returned to India without his approval,” MOM said. “Two work permit holders were even subjected to physical assaults.” MOM said it provided assistance to the three women and ensured that they received appropriate care. “MOM investigation officers visited them regularly to check on their physical and mental well-being, and we even engaged professional counselling services to look after their emotional needs,” the ministry said. “To help in their rehabilitation process, we also supported the work permit holders to gain temporary employment under the Temporary Job Scheme. “All three women have since safely returned to India.” Balasubramanian is the third person to be convicted under the Prevention of Human Trafficking Act 2014. Under the Act, those found guilty of trafficking in persons face a mandatory prison term of up to 10 years and a fine of up to S$100,000 for their first offence. They also face up to six strokes of the cane. For second and subsequent offences, offenders can be jailed for up to 15 years and fined up to S$150,000. They also face up to nine strokes of the cane."

Choo Lay Ping, 48, pleaded guilty to one charge of cheating, with another charge considered for sentencing. The court heard that Choo was employed by NTUC Health in 2019 and assigned five senior citizens to visit on a weekly basis. She was paid S$7 for each visit. The visits typically lasted half an hour and were for befrienders to assess and record the senior citizens' moods, living conditions and medications management. Befrienders were also to record signs of worsening conditions, such as falls, and other requests such as for meals or financial help. Sometime in mid-2020, Choo was assigned to be the befriender of the victim, an 84-year-old woman. She visited the elderly woman weekly. On Oct 9, 2020, the victim asked Choo to buy medicine from a pharmacy as she felt pain in her leg. She gave Choo her ATM card and personal identification number (PIN) to pay for the medicine. At the ATM machine, Choo realised the victim had about S$30,000 in the account. She withdrew S$1,000. Returning with the medicine, Choo lied to the victim that she had only withdrawn S$50 and handed the victim the change of about S$20. She pocketed the remaining S$950. During the befriender visits, Choo read the victim's letters to her. From these, she learnt that the victim was eligible for government payouts and conceived a plan to cheat her of the money. On each visit between March and September 2021, she would ask the victim for her ATM card and PIN by pretending that she was helping to check if the government payout had been credited. She would withdraw the money, and later lie to the victim that the government payout had not been credited. Using this method, she made unauthorised ATM withdrawals amounting to more than S$18,000 from the victim's bank account on 26 occasions. Choo used the money to pay for personal expenses such as utilities, bills, her online shopping and her children's pocket money. The offences came to light when the victim updated her bank book at the ATM and realised that there had been unauthorised withdrawals. She made a police report with her son's help. Choo has not made restitution to the victim to this date, according to the prosecution. Those found guilty of cheating can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/johnson-hong-rape-student-dating-app-2633511,"Youth jailed, caned for raping student he befriended online","SINGAPORE: Two weeks after meeting on a dating app, Johnson Hong Siang Yeu invited a 17-year-old girl to his place to learn how to play the guitar. The girl had come to see Hong as a trusted friend by that time, confiding in him about her past relationships, family troubles and personal struggles. Hong, then 20, in turn told her that she was ""just like a little sister"" to him and would often comfort her. However, on the night she was at his home in May 2020, he raped her on his bed while urging her to ""trust him"". Hong, now 22, was sentenced to seven years' jail and four strokes of the cane on Tuesday (Apr 19) after pleading guilty to one charge of rape. He was also fined S$2,000 after admitting to violating COVID-19 rules to meet the victim without a legitimate purpose. The identity of the victim, now 19, is protected by gag order. She was a student when the incident happened. The court heard that Hong and the victim met on a dating app towards the end of April 2020. However, the victim told Hong at the outset that she was not looking to date anyone she met on the platform. He acknowledged her wishes and they built a rapport, chatting on a daily basis. On May 9, 2020, Hong invited the victim to his place, offering to teach her how to play the guitar. She agreed to meet him at a staircase landing outside his flat rather than inside, as she wanted to keep things friendly between them, and arrived at around 1.20am. About an hour later, Hong suggested moving to his bedroom to use the air-conditioner. The victim agreed as she was feeling sweaty. In the room, she sat at a corner of Hong's mattress to use her phone, while he used his laptop. At some point, Hong offered to give the victim a back massage, which lasted for a few minutes. After the massage, the victim fell asleep on the mattress. ""The sight of the victim sound asleep aroused the accused, who proceeded to hug her from the back while she was asleep,"" stated court documents. He then pulled her shorts aside and molested her. The victim jolted awake and told Hong to stop while shoving his hand away. Hong did not stop and instead sexually assaulted her for 10 to 15 seconds while covering her mouth and telling her to ""trust him"". He then proceeded to rape her. Throughout this ordeal, the victim struggled to push Hong off as he was pressed against her, and cried and pleaded with him to stop. Hong stopped after a few minutes and apologised to the victim. She continued to cry while facing a wall, before leaving his bedroom to use the toilet. She eventually left Hong's flat at around 4.15am in a private-hire vehicle. Hong apologised to the victim in a text message at about 5am that morning. He told her: ""Hope we can keep this between ourselves and forget about this."" The victim told a friend that she had been raped by Hong but was hesitant about making a police report as she was afraid of how her parents would react. She eventually made a police report on May 11, 2020 at the insistence of her friend. Deputy Public Prosecutors Yeow Xuan and Nicholas Lim sought the sentence that was imposed for the rape offence, citing Hong's abuse of the trust placed in him by the victim. The victim had laid down clear boundaries between herself and Hong on multiple occasions, said the prosecutors. ""She placed significant trust in the accused's assurances that they were just friends and was willing to follow him to his home on the night of the offences despite her clear reservations,"" they said. ""In turn, he utterly betrayed the faith reposed in him by making advances on her while she was asleep."" They also sought a S$3,500 fine for his breach of COVID-19 rules in place at the time. Defence lawyer Joshua Tong asked for six years' jail and three strokes of the cane for the rape offence, and a S$1,000 fine for the COVID-19 rules violation. He argued that there was no abuse of trust as Hong and the victim had only known each other for two weeks at the time of the offence. He contended that it was an ""overstatement"" to say that they were friends, and that the victim had not laid clear boundaries with Hong. ""While the crime was serious, this was a momentary lapse and a moment of folly,"" said Mr Tong, asking the court to exercise mercy as his client was a young, first-time offender. In sentencing, District Judge Kok Shu En agreed with the prosecution that there was an abuse of trust. While the victim had not known Hong for long, she trusted him enough to go to his house to learn to play the guitar and even fall asleep there, said the judge. Those found guilty of rape can be jailed for up to 20 years and fined or caned. The penalty for violating COVID-19 control orders is up to six months' jail, a fine of up to S$10,000 or both."

According to Hong Kong police, the suspect had used a toy gun in the robbery, which took place at Nathan Road on Thursday.  News outlet The Standard identified the bank as a China Construction Bank branch. It quoted West Kowloon crime unit superintendent Alan Chung as saying that the man handed a note to a female bank teller that said he was carrying out a robbery, before threatening her with the gun. He then gave her a black bag and told her to put the money inside, said the report. Chung added that the bank employee tried to give chase after the suspect walked out but he ran across the street and boarded a bus. Superintendent Chung was reported as saying that the police set up roadblocks to look for the suspect in buses and at bus stations. Hong Kong police said no one was injured in the incident. The man was arrested in the Yuen Long district at about 11pm on Thursday on suspicion of robbery and overstaying, police said. Police added that the man was reported to be wearing a blue-black windbreaker, black trousers and dark-coloured shoes, as well as a pair of sunglasses and a black mask.  The police said they later found some of the cash and the clothes worn by the suspect at his home. The man has allegedly been overstaying in the city for about 10 years. Police said he is linked to another robbery at a pharmacy in Mong Kok in July 2020. A lighter was said to have been used in that incident. He is due to appear in court on Apr 21."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/babysitter-poison-babies-infants-saadiah-jamari-appeal-dismissed-2633291,Babysitter who got 7 years' jail for poisoning two infants has appeal dismissed,"SINGAPORE: A babysitter who was sentenced to seven years' jail for poisoning two infants with cocktails of drugs had her appeal dismissed by a High Court judge on Tuesday (Apr 19). Justice Aedit Abdullah rejected Sa'adiah Jamari's arguments that other people could have poisoned the victims and that she did not possess all the drugs found in the victims' bodies. These were similar to the arguments Sa'adiah had made in her trial in the lower court, which resulted in her conviction in October 2020. The two infants, who are unrelated, were five months and 11 months at the time of the offences in late 2016. They were each separately taken to the hospital after their mothers noticed they were drowsy and behaving unusually after picking them up from the babysitter. Both infants were hospitalised and drugs were found in their systems, making up the two charges of administering poison that Sa'adiah was found guilty of. The younger child was given 10 different drugs including medications for anxiety, a muscle relaxant and a sleeping aid, among others. Both children responded well to treatment and were discharged after several days. Justice Abdullah found that Sa'adiah had the opportunity to poison the infants while they were in her care as well as access to all of the drugs found in them, whereas no one else had such opportunity and access. He devoted a significant part of his judgment to discussing whether it was proper for the trial judge to rely on a toxicology report from September 2016, which Sa'adiah had argued against using. Sa'adiah argued that she had allowed the toxicology tests to be conducted in the context of investigations into another matter, as she had made a police report alleging to be the victim of a sexual assault. The toxicology report showed that all of the drugs found in one of the infants were also found in blood and urine samples taken from Sa'adiah. ""She argues that the admission of the report was tantamount to a violation of her right against self-incrimination,"" said Justice Abdullah. However, the High Court judge found that the report was admissible as evidence. He also found that evidence apart from the report amply supported the trial judge's finding that Sa'adiah had access to the drugs found in the infants. Sa'adiah will file an application to the Court of Appeal on a question of law of public interest arising from the appeal, her lawyers Chua Eng Hui, Luo Ling Ling, Sharifah Nabilah Binte Syed Omar and Noor Heeqmah Binte Wahianuar told the court. She was allowed to remain out of bail for this reason, but ordered to serve her sentence from May 17 if her application is not filed on time. For each charge of administering poison with the intent to cause hurt, Sa'adiah could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined. She cannot be caned as she is a woman."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/dentist-andy-joshua-warren-fraud-medisave-chas-claims-2633081,"Dentist fined for making fraudulent MediSave claims worth more than S$11,000","SINGAPORE: A dentist on Tuesday (Apr 19) admitted to making fraudulent MediSave claims worth S$11,250 while working at Phoenix Dental Surgery in Ang Mo Kio. Dr Andy Joshua Warren, 36, was fined S$45,000 after pleading guilty to nine charges of cheating while he was a trainee dentist in 2015. Another 15 charges were considered for sentencing, including charges for submitting six false Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) claims that amounted to about S$2,700. Dr Warren is the second dentist to be dealt with in the claims fraud involving Phoenix Dental Surgery, which also had a branch in Marine Parade. Each clinic operated under a limited exempt private company, and both companies were struck off in 2018, according to court documents. His supervisor, Teo Eu Gene, was sentenced to more than 10 months' jail in June 2020 and struck off the dental register in May 2021. Teo admitted to cheating polyclinics of more than S$18,000 in false CHAS claims. Dr Warren currently runs his own dental practice and has been barred from making MediSave claims during the court proceedings, said his defence lawyer Riko Isaac. The lawyer added that Dr Warren faces disciplinary action by the Singapore Dental Council. The court heard that Dr Warren received his Bachelor of Dental Science from the University of Melbourne in 2013. He practised as a trainee dentist in Australia and another dental clinic in Singapore before working at Phoenix Dental Surgery. At the clinic, Dr Warren was primarily responsible for treating patients. He also gave instructions to clinic staff for administrative work such as patient registration and claims submission. Central Provident Fund (CPF) members can use their MediSave funds to pay for day surgeries. Before Jan 1, 2014, the maximum claim amount for dental implant insertion was S$950, S$1,850 or S$2,600, depending on the complexity of the surgery. From Jan 1, 2014, the maximum claim amount was revised upwards to S$950 multiplied by the number of dental implants placed, up to a maximum of S$7,550 for each surgery. For each MediSave claim, the patient had to sign a MediSave authorisation form giving permission for the treatment expenses to be deducted, and the medical practitioner had to sign a letter of certification confirming that the procedure was performed. To circumvent the pre-2014 MediSave claims limit, Dr Warren adopted a practice of splitting up the claims for the day surgeries that he performed into multiple days. This resulted in dishonest declarations of day surgeries on days when no surgery was actually performed on the patient. Dr Warren continued to do this even after the higher MediSave claims limit came into effect in 2014, as he was not aware of the change. For example, for one patient, Dr Warren submitted six MediSave claims for day surgeries purportedly performed on Jun 16, Jun 17, Jun 18, Jun 22, Jun 23 and Jun 24 in 2015. In fact, he had only performed surgery on the patient on Jun 16 that year. The MediSave claims for the other five dates, amounting to S$6,250, were false. Between June and September 2015, Dr Warren submitted a total of nine false MediSave claims of S$1,250 each for three patients. He would first explain to the patient how much the procedure would cost and whether their MediSave account had sufficient balance to cover the entire cost. After agreeing to the surgery, the patient would be asked to sign a number of MediSave authorisation forms. These corresponded to the number of claims required to cover the entire cost of the procedure. Dr Warren would sign the corresponding number of letters of certification to confirm that the day surgeries were performed on the stated days. Both sets of documents would then be handed to the clinic staff to make claims according to the letters of confirmation. Dr Warren would also enter the details of the procedures into the patients' medical case notes, tailoring them to reflect the procedures and dates stated in the letters of certification. On Apr 22, 2016, the Ministry of Health made a police report alleging that Dr Warren had cheated polyclinics into disbursing CHAS subsidies. Evidence of the MediSave fraud was uncovered in the course of police investigations into the CHAS fraud. Deputy Public Prosecutors Sarah Thaker and Nicholas Lim asked for the fine that was eventually imposed, calling the offences ""a serious case of fraud against a vital public institution"". Dr Warren's actions targeted the CPF Board, which is ""the bedrock of Singapore's social security system"" and the trustee of the hard-earned savings of Singaporeans, they said. The fraud risked the erosion of public confidence in the CPF Board, so the offences needed to be dealt with strictly, said the prosecutors. Trust was placed in Dr Warren as a medical professional but ""he chose to abuse that trust and act in violation of his professional duties by participating in a fraudulent scheme to make dishonest claims"", added the prosecutors. They also argued that Dr Warren's actions were premeditated and that he had gone to lengths to cover up his actions by falsifying patients' case notes. Mr Isaac argued that his client had no knowledge of the MediSave claims procedure at the time and relied on the instructions of his supervisor, Teo Eu Gene. While Dr Warren was aware that he was deceiving the CPF Board about the dates on which the day surgeries were performed, he did so because this was what he was taught to do by his supervisor, said the defence lawyer. Dr Warren's ""moral culpability"" was lower than in other cases where the fraud was done for a person's own financial gain, said Mr Isaac, who asked for a lower fine of S$27,000. The lawyer also asked for leniency as his client was making significant financial losses due to not being able to make MediSave claims at his clinic, and also had to support his wife and young daughter, with another child on the way. District Judge Christopher Goh said the fine sought by the prosecution was fair in light of the circumstances and already took into account Dr Warren's relative culpability. Those found guilty of cheating can be jailed for up to three years, fined or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/father-son-beat-13-year-old-boy-playing-football-2631811,Man and his father jailed for beating up 13-year-old who was playing football in public area,"SINGAPORE: A man and his father were each jailed three weeks on Monday (Apr 18) for beating up a 13-year-old boy who was playing football in the multipurpose hall of a public housing block. Retiree Ong Eng Seng, 62, and his son Bernard Ong Wei Feng, 31, a project manager at the time of the offence, each pleaded guilty to a count of voluntarily causing hurt. Each man was also ordered to pay S$60 in compensation for the victim's medical bills. The court heard that on Dec 22, 2019 at about 5pm, the victim and three of his friends were playing football in the multipurpose hall at Block 6, Toa Payoh Lorong 7. During the game, the ball came close to the elder Ong, who was walking through the hall. He confronted the victim and his friends, shouting vulgarities at them, and the boys responded with more vulgarities. Ong told the victim that he would be back. He then went home and asked his son for help to confront the victim and his friends. His son agreed. Father and son then returned to the hall and approached the victim and his friends, who were seated, at about 5.30pm. The younger Ong pulled the victim to his feet and shouted: ""Eh you made fun of my dad uh. You think it's funny?"" He held the victim by his neck and slammed him to the floor, causing the boy's head to hit the floor. While the victim was lying on his back, the younger Ong also punched the boy on his right cheek and pressed him down against the floor before lifting him to his feet. The elder Ong then strangled the victim's neck and slapped him five to six times, before pushing him towards a stone bench nearby. Both men then left the scene. When the victim went to his grandmother's house, she saw that he was injured and took him to a police station to make a report. He was then taken to a children's emergency department and found to have redness at the back of his head, tenderness along his neck and spine, and bruises on his face, neck, shoulder, back and arm. The boy was discharged and advised to strictly avoid physical activity for two weeks. The prosecution sought three to four weeks' jail for the two offenders, citing the commission of group violence and their substantial age difference with the victim. Defence lawyer Mervyn Tan said the incident was an ""act of social consciousness"" that went awry, as the elder Ong was rebuking the boys for playing football in the area. Mr Tan also said that the elder Ong felt aggravated by the victim and his friends as the boys had mocked him and used vulgarities. The younger Ong in turn felt offended that young kids were taking advantage of his father and the situation ""snowballed"" after he went to confront them, said the lawyer. He asked for a community-based sentence or not more than one week's jail. District Judge Ng Peng Hong said the actions of both men were ""clearly antisocial"" as they had taken the law into their own hands and caused injuries to the victim. He noted the need to signal to the public that such behaviour will not be tolerated. Those guilty of voluntarily causing hurt can be jailed up to two years, fined up to S$5,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-sexual-assault-6-year-old-niece-sofa-living-room-2631576,Man jailed for sexually assaulting 6-year-old niece after showing her porn,"SINGAPORE: A man who had been watching porn sexually assaulted his niece in the living room of the home they shared in 2010. She was six to seven years old at the time, and he was 40 to 41. The offences were only reported to police eight years later, when the girl spoke to a hospital counsellor after revealing that she had tried to harm herself. The man, now 52, was jailed 14 years on Monday (Apr 18) after pleading guilty at the High Court to one charge of sexual penetration of a minor and one charge of taking methamphetamine. He was sentenced to seven years' jail for each offence. Justice See Kee Oon ordered the jail terms to run consecutively. Seven other charges were considered for sentencing. The accused and victim cannot be named as their identities are protected by gag order. The court heard that the girl and the accused had lived in the same flat since 2008, together with her mother, older brother and grandmother. Her parents were divorced. Sometime in 2010, the accused was sitting on a sofa in the living room watching pornography. When he became aroused, he called the victim over and showed her a pornographic video. The video showed two naked adults having sex. The young girl did not understand the sexual nature of the acts, but felt disgusted by the video. After this, the accused told the victim to lie down on the sofa with her head in his lap. She did so as the accused was her uncle, court documents stated. The accused then sexually assaulted her under her clothes without her consent, causing her to feel extreme pain. The victim quickly sat up on the sofa after this, but did not dare to shout or call for help as she felt afraid. She did not tell anyone what had happened that day. The next day, when the victim was sleeping on the sofa in the living room at night, her uncle climbed onto the sofa behind her. The victim was startled and turned to see who was lying behind her. When she saw that it was the accused, she quickly turned away from him.  However, the accused pulled her to face him and went on to molest her. The girl rolled off the sofa to get away from him, but he climbed off the sofa and followed her. He then pulled his pants down, but his mobile phone made a sound at this point. He hurriedly pulled his pants up and walked away. A few weeks later, the girl told someone that she had been touched inappropriately. The identity of this person was redacted from court documents. The court heard that the victim later moved out from the flat at an unspecified time. The offences were discovered when the victim went to KK Women's and Children's Hospital to seek treatment for abdominal pains in July 2018. She was told to fill up a form, in which she disclosed that she was having suicidal thoughts and had tried to self-harm before. As a result of this, the girl was interviewed by a counsellor at the hospital. The victim told the counsellor that her uncle had sexually assaulted her. She also told the counsellor that she would have flashbacks of the assault and feel scared whenever she visited the flat where it happened. The hospital subsequently reported a case of sexual assault to the police on Jul 13, 2018. The accused was arrested on Mar 5, 2019. Investigations subsequently revealed that he had also consumed methamphetamine the day before his arrest. He had a prior conviction in 2001 for consuming morphine, and was hence liable for enhanced punishment this time. Both the prosecution and defence asked for the mandatory minimum of seven years' jail for the drug offence. They differed on the sentence for the sexual assault offence. Deputy Public Prosecutors Jane Lim and Samyata Ravindran sought seven to eight years' jail, highlighting that the victim was especially young and vulnerable and did not consent to the acts. The accused also ""shattered"" the family's legitimate expectation that he would not harm his niece, and violated the sanctity of the home where she had a right to feel safe, said Ms Lim. ""He took advantage of his position as a trusted family member residing in the victim's home to gain easy access to her and exploited her to commit truly unthinkable and perverse acts,"" said the prosecutors. ""The victim has suffered immeasurable harm at the hands of the accused and will carry the horrible memories of the sexual abuse for the rest of her life."" They also urged the court to factor in that the accused showed the victim porn and molested her the night after the first assault, which were among the charges taken into consideration. Defence lawyer Sadhana Rai argued for a shorter jail term of five to six years. She said that the accused did not groom the victim or assault her over a protracted period, and that it was a ""singular"" incident over two days. Ms Rai also said that the accused did not reoffend again, even though he continued to have contact with the victim in the subsequent years whenever she visited the flat where he lived. In response, the prosecution said that the accused could not take all the credit for his lack of reoffending as the victim had moved out, removing his easy access to her. Delivering his sentence, Justice See said the offences were not one-off as the accused molested the victim again the very next day, and noted a clear abuse of trust. ""(The victim) was clearly young, immature and vulnerable. In addition, she would not have been in any position to give consent to the act and had plainly not agreed to being violated by the accused,"" said the judge. The punishment for sexual penetration of a minor is up to 20 years' jail, a fine or caning. The accused cannot be caned as he is above 50, and the prosecution did not seek additional jail time in lieu. For his drug consumption offence, the accused could have been jailed between seven and 13 years, and given between six and 12 strokes of the cane."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/bunker-clerks-jail-steal-marine-fuel-vessel-ship-2631496,"Two bunker clerks get jail for stealing marine fuel worth S$237,000","SINGAPORE: Two bunker clerks were each sentenced to a year and nine months' jail on Monday (Apr 18) for stealing about S$237,000 worth of marine fuel from the vessel on which they worked. Chan Thiam Wee, 41, and Melvin Low Boon Hwee, 42, were employed by Equatorial Marine Fuel Management Services (EMF) to work on MT Libra, a Singapore-registered vessel. They admitted to stealing about 313 tonnes of marine fuel from EMF in 2020 and selling it to a vessel that bought stolen fuel, the Mongolia-registered MT Zuiun, at below market prices. As bunker clerks, both men were responsible for overseeing the vessel's bunkering operations. They received instructions on loading and delivery schedules from their manager, co-accused Chia Eng Choon. The three men were the masterminds of the scheme, which also involved the crew of MT Libra and MT Zuiun, said the prosecution. Chia was earlier sentenced to a year, seven months and two weeks' jail. Chan and Low each pleaded guilty to three charges of conspiring to commit criminal breach of trust, with two more charges of the same considered for sentencing. MT Libra was chartered by EMF to collect, transport and deliver marine fuel to its customers. Its crew were not allowed to sell any fuel without the company's authorisation. The court heard that in August 2019, Low told Chan that they could reserve an amount of marine fuel from each delivery by using a special method that involved introducing air into the master pipeline. Using this method, the mass flow meter mandated by the Maritime Port Authority (MPA) would continue recording outflow even when no fuel was being delivered. The result was that the actual amount of marine fuel delivered would be less than the amount reflected on the mass flow meter. The reserved portion of fuel would remain in the vessel's tank. Chan and Low tried this method out a few times in actual operations and found that they could reserve about 2 to 3 tonnes of marine fuel in each delivery. In December 2019, Chan, Low and Chia discussed selling the reserved marine fuel at below market prices without EMF's knowledge. EMF would not know about any sale of stolen marine fuel as Chan and Low, MT Libra's only bunker clerks, would not report the reserved portion to the company. They agreed for Chan and Low to receive S$100 and Chia to receive S$50 per tonne of stolen marine fuel sold, with remaining profits to be split among the MT Libra crew. Around this time, Chan came to know of a shipping agent, Chong Wee Kong, who bought stolen marine fuel from vessels in Singapore. Chong and another person, William Soh Lian, were the shipping agents handling the entry and exit of MT Zuiun in Singapore. The vessel was owned by a Panama-incorporated company. Every member of MT Zuiun's crew knew that the main purpose of the vessel entering Singapore was to illegally collect stolen marine fuel from other vessels and leave with the stolen cargo, stated court documents. Chong agreed to Chan's offer to sell him marine fuel below market price, and provided a point of contact for the illegal transfers at sea. Chan then informed Low and Chia of the arrangement, and both agreed with it. Other crew members of MT Libra, including the captain and boatswain, were also informed of the plan. The crew of both vessels carried out these illegal fuel transfers at sea on at least five occasions in January, February and March 2020. Crew members would keep a lookout for authorities during the illegal transfers, which were conducted not through the usual pipe for legitimate transfers, but directly into MT Zuiun's cargo tank. During the last such transfer on Mar 8, 2020, the crew of MT Libra agreed to sell the stolen fuel to MT Zuiun at S$340 per tonne. The scheme was discovered during this transfer, when an MPA officer boarded MT Libra after spotting it alongside MT Zuiun while on patrol. The MPA officer had seen MT Libra's bunker delivery hose connected to the tank of MT Zuiun, with its cargo tank operational. The two vessels were next to each other in waters off Eastern Petroleum Bravo Anchorage at the time. Deputy Public Prosecutors Emily Koh and Nicholas Lim sought the sentence imposed, highlighting Chan and Low's abuse of the high degree of trust placed in them in their key roles as bunker clerks. The prosecutors said that there was an ongoing conspiracy to steal marine fuel, which took place over two months before the syndicate was caught red-handed. The losses suffered by EMF were significant, and the illegal scheme was syndicated and involved many levels of hierarchy from management to operations, which should be deterred, they said. The prosecutors also said that Chan, Low and Chia had the highest culpability of all co-accused in the syndicate, as they concocted the scheme and took the lion's share of profits. Additionally, Chan and Low's roles were more involved than Chia's as they were physically on board MT Libra to direct and coordinate the illegal operations, and had roped Chia in after coming up with the scheme, said the prosecutors. Three crew members of MT Libra were earlier sentenced to a year and five months' jail. The crew of MT Zuiun have also been dealt with, according to the prosecution."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/fire-safety-proof-doors-false-label-certificate-fine-scdf-2631386,Man fined for falsely obtaining fire safety labels for 50 doors installed in buildings,"SINGAPORE: An employee of a door manufacturing firm falsely obtained 50 fire labels to certify doors made by another company as fire-proof. The doors with invalid certificates, made by SIAC, were installed in newly constructed buildings before the offences came to light. Peh Eng Thong, 51, was fined S$20,000 on Monday (Apr 18) for forgery. He was an assistant general manager for KLW Joinery at the time of the offences. He pleaded guilty to one count of forging documents to obtain the fire safety labels from appointed certification body Setsco Services. The court heard that Setsco, appointed by the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), handles companies' applications for doors to be certified as fire-proof. The companies have to provide evidence that their doors come from a supplier with a certificate of compliance administered by Setsco. A certificate of compliance cannot be transferred between door suppliers, and must be renewed on an annual basis. If a company's application is successful, Setsco will issue fire labels to be pasted on its doors as proof of their fire-proof integrity. Around December 2018, door manufacturer and supplier SIAC received 50 orders from various projects to have fire-proof doors installed in newly constructed buildings. SIAC had applied for a certificate of compliance from Setsco at the time, but it was not yet approved. Peh's employer KLW Joinery had a valid and active certificate of compliance. A company applying for fire labels with evidence that its doors were procured from KLW Joinery was therefore likely to have its application accepted, stated court documents. As SIAC was unable to apply for fire labels for its own doors, the company's director Mike Chin Chee Huen asked Peh to ""lend"" him 50 fire labels, the court heard. ""The accused knew that SIAC was a major client and was keen to maintain KLW Joinery's business relationship with SIAC. He thus agreed to provide Mike with the fire labels,"" said the prosecution. On Dec 6, 2018, Peh made a forged requisition form claiming that SAIC had supplied 50 fire-rated doors purchased from KLW Joinery, when this was not the case. He then gave the form to a consultant, asking him to prepare a purchase order by SIAC from KLW Joinery and to apply for the fire labels using these documents. Setsco subsequently approved the application and delivered 50 fire labels to SIAC to be pasted on the doors. After Peh's forgery was discovered, SCDF and Setsco traced the 50 doors that were invalidly certified as fire-proof, and directed SIAC to replace them. Those found guilty of forgery can be jailed up to four years, fined or both."

Cheng Guoyuan, a Chinese national, is accused of ""slashing and chopping"" the 42-year-old woman with a chopper repeatedly, according to the charge sheet that was released on Monday. The victim is believed to be his wife, the police previously said. Police responded to a case of assault at 75 Beach Road at about 5.30pm on Thursday. Upon arrival, they found a woman with slash wounds and she was taken to hospital. Police officers located Cheng in the area and used a Taser to subdue him. Preliminary investigations showed the man had purportedly slit his own wrists with a chopper before officers arrived, the police said, adding that he was taken to hospital. Several members of the public intervened during the attack and were commended by the police for their efforts. A video circulating online showed staff members of nearby Zhong Hua Steamboat restaurant helping the victim by throwing chairs and other items at Cheng. Customers were dining in the eatery at the time. Footage of the incident showed a man clad in black apparently slashing the victim as she lay on the road behind a parked car. The man's hands were covered in blood and he briefly attempted to engage those who tried to intervene, before trying to flee. The woman, who later sat up, was seen with blood on her head, arms and legs. Police urged members of the public to avoid circulating the videos and speculating on the case. Those found guilty of attempted murder may be jailed for life. They may also be jailed for up to 20 years, and be liable to caning or a fine, or both."

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-insider/producers-inside-maximum-security-inmates-filming-2628021,Behind the scenes of Inside Maximum Security: Producers reveal what filming with inmates was like,"SINGAPORE: When current affairs producer Liu Ziqing first heard that he would be filming a Changi Prison inmate who initially faced the gallows, he was a little concerned. “What did he do?” wondered Liu, part of the team behind CNA’s groundbreaking documentary, Inside Maximum Security. “He must’ve been, like, a badass to be charged with the death penalty, right?” That inmate was 41-year-old Iskandar, who was ultimately sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane for drug trafficking, drug possession and consumption. He was held in maximum security before he was transferred to Prison School. After talking to him and filming him, however, Liu came away with the impression that Iskandar was “no different from us”. “I got to know him, and he’s very fun-loving,” said Liu. “He’s very likeable, he gels with his classmates, his teachers like him. “And he’s very considerate … Whenever we had to film him, he’d come to us and say, ‘Hey, can we try to reduce any inconvenience to my cellmates.’” The CNA crew tried to oblige by, for example, using only half of his shared cell to do interviews, instead of the full cell. Liu’s fellow producer, Anna Tolentino, was also “caught by surprise” by the inmates she filmed. She remembers, for example, the first interview she conducted with Khai, 31, who was serving a 29-month sentence — with two strokes of the cane — for extortion, blackmail and voluntarily causing hurt.  He said things like, “I’m a bad person”, “I failed my father” and “I’m failing my mother as well because I don’t know where she is — I don’t know how she’s doing”, she recalled. “So the first time you meet (the inmates), you feel like there’s a huge load on your shoulders,” she said. “It was so heavy; it was so emotional.” It has been three months since the documentary was first broadcast, with its four episodes notching more than 8.5 million views combined on YouTube. And looking back on the four months of filming, Tolentino thinks it is safe to say the producers “went through the same journey as the audiences who’ve watched this”. For the first time, the producers are sharing what went on behind the scenes, and the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) responds to some of the comments from viewers. There is also an update on the five inmates featured — the journey may not be over yet. WATCH: What we learnt filming maximum security inmates — Behind the scenes and updates (16:24) Iskandar, Khai and the three other inmates, Boon Keng, Graceson and Rusdi, were among a group of 22 who were selected by the SPS and had volunteered to share their stories. The CNA producers then did a “pre-interview” with all of them. The production team put the inmates in front of a video camera for about 30 minutes each to see how open and comfortable they were about sharing their past, and the reasons they committed their offences, with the camera rolling. “We also asked them, why do you want to be part of this documentary?” recounted Tolentino. “A lot of them thought that recording their time inside would be a good way to remind themselves not to come back again.” WATCH: How tough is Singapore prison life? | Inside Maximum Security — Part 1/4 (46:09) Among them, Boon Keng was “very sceptical” about his prospects for change, recalled Liu. The 34-year-old was in jail for the fourth time, serving a three-and-a-half-year sentence for theft, drug consumption, criminal breach of trust and breach of personal protection order. He almost did not make CNA’s final cut, but Liu is glad he did in the end. “He really shared how he felt about being in prison,” said the producer. “He was very blunt, as you’ve seen.” The producers did not film inside Changi Prison every day. When they did, however, there was no guarantee that the seven hours they had — after security checks and logistical set-up — would be fruitful. A lot depended on the inmates themselves. “If they wanted to skip filming … or if they didn’t want to share anything about that part in their lives, we didn’t force them to do it,” said Tolentino. “There was a day when Khai told me, ‘Can we not film today? Because I didn’t sleep last night.’” That was after his phone call to his mother ended in dispute when his stepbrother and his stepbrother’s wife “jumped in” on speakerphone, he eventually related. WATCH: Coping with family problems while in prison | Inside Maximum Security — Part 2/4 (46:08) The producers also found out when not to film certain inmates during the day. “For Graceson … you couldn’t bother him when it was yard time. You could film him, but you couldn’t do a lot of talking because you’d be disturbing his high-intensity interval training,” cited Tolentino. “For Khai … he was very protective of his TV time.” The inmates were also “anal about cleanliness”. The first day the crew filmed Khai, for example, he requested that they remove their footwear before entering his cell. It did not go unnoticed by Tolentino. “Every time I filmed, I made sure that I told the cameramen … ‘Please take off your shoes,’” she recounted. “Because it was very important to (the inmates).” The producers were expecting the documentary to be a talking point among viewers, but they did not expect people to be “so invested” in the inmates’ stories, said Tolentino. At the same time, she knew some people would think these are “scums pretending to be good people”. That was what made the storytelling process especially interesting for her. “We’re all human, right? We’re all flawed, we have our own histories, we have our own truths. Sometimes we think we’re always right,” she said. “And so, when you have … (people) who’ve committed mistakes in the past, how do you put them in a system and change them for the better?” WATCH: How do you break bad habits in prison? | Inside Maximum Security — Part 3/4 (46:31) The work being done in prison to achieve this change is what the SPS “wanted the public to understand” when it gave CNA unprecedented access to life behind bars, said SPS assistant director for media relations Ravin Singh. “We had two key objectives for this documentary series. The first one was to demystify what goes on behind prison walls … We also hoped to explain the rationale behind some of our prison processes,” he said. “Secondly, we hoped to humanise the prison staff as well as the inmates. Because we feel that the inmates, like all of us, have their own dreams … And it’s important to showcase the struggles they face in their journey towards achieving these goals.” He and his colleagues also expected the documentary to be “relatively popular” but did not anticipate the extent of the online reaction. “There’s this natural curiosity about what happens within the very unseen world of the prison system,” he noted. One thing that struck him, however, was that “there was a group of people who felt that our prison system wasn’t effective because all the profiles had multiple incarcerations prior to this”. Offering another perspective, he said: “Offenders actually undergo many cycles of successes and failures before they desist or lead a crime-free life. For some offenders, it may take only one incarceration event, but for others, it may take multiple attempts. “What we can be sure of is that each incarceration for these inmates brings them a step closer towards a crime-free life, as it helps them build their positive identity and pro-social thinking.” He also picked up on comments about the non-provision of beds in the cells. This “long-standing practice”, he said, is to “keep our prisons spartan and sufficiently deterrent so that inmates are no better off than people in the community”. “That said, inmates who require beds for medical reasons or for assisted living will be provided one either in our medical wards or in housing units which have facilities for assisted living.” The inmates featured in Inside Maximum Security have also seen the series, Singh disclosed. “They’re very glad that their stories have been shared with the general public, and they’re very happy that the response has been very positive,” he said. During filming, Graceson had about a year left before his release. He is serving a sentence of six years and five months, with 21 strokes of the cane, for drug consumption, criminal intimidation and carrying weapons on three occasions. The latest update on his situation is that he is waiting to be placed in a pre-release programme, after which he will serve the rest of his sentence in the community — subject to curfew and other supervision conditions — Singh shared. Boon Keng is also waiting to be transferred to the pre-release centre and to serve the remainder of his sentence in the community. “As for Khai, he’s still working as a peer supporter, and he’s still doing well,” said Singh. “Iskandar is currently pursuing his diploma (in logistics), and if he does well in that, he also has the option to extend it to the degree programme.” WATCH: Getting ready to be released | Inside Maximum Security — Part 4/4 (46:34) The fifth inmate, 33-year-old Rusdi, who had served time for drug consumption and obstructing a public servant, was released during filming in January. “We hope he’s doing well in the community and he’s still leading a crime-free life,” Singh said. The prison officer noted that over time, the successful re-integration of ex-offenders depends on “two key things”. One is their resolve to change — whether they are motivated enough, “else whatever programmes or interventions done for them will be ineffective”. “Secondly, we need the community to give them this second chance. So be it your neighbour, or if you’re an employer and you’re employing somebody, we’d like to urge you to give them that chance to prove themselves,” he said. Given the sentiments expressed online — for example, by viewers who felt for Graceson when he was on the phone to his daughter, and those who were happy to see Iskandar’s good results in Prison School — Liu the producer is hopeful. “(People) are looking at (the inmates’) struggles and not only why they make mistakes,” he observed. And given the public reaction, CNA and the SPS are in talks about a follow-up series involving the five profiles. “We (the producers) also want to document the lives of the inmates — what’s going to happen to them,” he said.

The police said in a news release on Friday that they received several reports from the alleged victims between March and April this year.  The victims had responded to listings on Facebook and Carousell purporting to offer a unit for rent at Hong San Walk.  After viewing the unit in person, victims were asked to pay a deposit to the man to secure the rental.  “The man purportedly became uncontactable after the deposits were paid. Some victims also discovered that the same unit had been allegedly promised to other persons for the same period,” said the police.  The police subsequently identified the man and arrested him. Preliminary investigations revealed that the man is believed to be involved in 20 similar cases of rental scams with losses amounting to more than S$21,000.  The man will be charged in court for cheating on Saturday. If found guilty, he faces up to 10 years’ jail and a fine.  The police reminded members of the public to take precautions to avoid falling prey to rental scams. They should ensure that they are dealing with the rightful owner of the unit or an accredited real estate agent. They should also ask to visit the unit and verify with the owner if the rental offer exists and is genuine.

Mr Wei was one of the several individuals at the scene on Thursday (Apr 14) evening when the 46-year-old man wielding a chopper allegedly attacked a woman in the Beach Road area. The police said they responded to the case at 75 Beach Road at about 5.30pm.  Footage of the incident circulating on social media showed a man dressed in black apparently slashing the woman several times, as she laid on the road behind a parked car.  Building signage identified the location as next to Zhong Hua Steamboat and Hotel Calmo Bugis. Another Zhong Hua Steamboat employee who only wanted to be known as Mr Lin, said he jumped in to help out of fear that the man would attack more people.  “He already looked like he was in a frenzy, so I was just scared that he would hurt more people,” said the 43-year-old in Mandarin. “We had customers eating here and I was afraid that if he rushed in and attacked the customers, it would be too late, so I knew I had to stop him right there and then.”  As his colleagues and members of the public threw things to block the attacker, Mr Lin rushed back and forth to supply them with chairs and other items.  On the opposite side of the road, staff members from another hotpot restaurant Chef China frantically called the police. “Everyone was calling the police, and we saw more than 10 people surrounding the attacker, just trying to stop him from escaping,” said Mr Jin Xiao, a staff member at Chef China who witnessed the incident. “It was really a display of bravery and heroism. The opposite restaurant’s dishwasher da ge (Chinese for big brother) was especially brave, he was throwing things and shouting at the attacker,” he said.  “Even when the guy was threatening him with the knife, he continued to fend him off.”  CNA was unable to interview the man Mr Jin mentioned, as he was speaking to the police.  When CNA spoke to Mr Wei and Mr Lin at 10.30pm, they said they had been waiting outside the restaurant for nearly four-and-a-half hours. The police had cordoned off the area and their belongings were still inside the eatery.  Tired, hungry and thirsty, they said they just wanted to go home and rest. Mr Wei’s phone had also run out of battery.  Since the incident made its rounds on social media, the public has praised them for being heroes. However, Mr Lin and Mr Wei shrugged it off, saying that anyone would have done it. “It’s not just me, anyone who saw such a thing would have done the same,” said Mr Wei.  “We are all neighbours and they were shouting for help. It wasn’t just me who went, there were more than ten of us helping,” said Mr Lin. CNA reporters at Liang Seah Street on Thursday night observed a small crowd of curious onlookers as the police investigated the area.  In a small dark alley behind Zhong Hua Steamboat restaurant and away from the public, officers from the Criminal Investigation Department sorted through the evidence gathered from the scene.
Under the warm yellow glow of the street lamp, officers knelt on the ground arranging various items, and packed them into transparent as well as yellow biohazard bags. Crime scene investigators were also seen at a restaurant along Beach Road adjacent to Zhong Hua Steamboat. Earlier, employees from Hotel Calmo were observed disinfecting the hotel's entrance. A front desk staff member who identified himself as Mr Nazri said bloodstains were found at the building's entrance where the victim is believed to have sought cover.  The man was arrested for attempted murder on Thursday evening after the attack which left the woman bleeding profusely from slash wounds.  The 41-year-old victim is believed to be his wife, the police said in a news release. The man is also believed to have slit his own wrists before authorities arrived at the scene. He will be charged in court on Saturday. If found guilty, the man faces life imprisonment, a jail term of up to 20 years and a fine, or both."

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/drone-fly-illegal-divert-rsaf-aircraft-fine-2625566,Judge fines man who flew drone illegally and caused diversion of RSAF aircraft,"SINGAPORE: A man was fined S$51,000 on Thursday (Apr 14) for illegally flying a drone into the flight path of a Tengah Air Base runway, causing two Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) aircraft to be diverted. Drone enthusiast Jason Ng Yok Sen, 43, was operating his DJI Mavic 2 Zoom from Taman Jurong Park on Sep 8, 2020 when the incident happened. The presence of the drone, which was detected by the aeroscope at Tengah Air Base, also led RSAF to close the affected runway for half an hour. District Judge Lorraine Ho said that the intentions of the drone operator were unknown at that point in time. This necessitated a swift response from RSAF to ensure defence capabilities were not compromised, taking up the military's time and resources, she said. The sentence imposed was a ""cautionary note"" to all drone operators in Singapore, including hobbyists, said the judge. Drone operators should ensure that they are aware of and comply with the rules and regulations for drone flying in Singapore or face dire consequences, she said. According to the prosecution, Ng's case appears to be the first case of illegal drone operation in Singapore where there was a closure of a runway and the diversion of aircraft intending to land there. During the incident, Ng flew his drone for 22 minutes covering a distance of about 930m around Corporation Road. The drone hit a maximum altitude of 134m above mean sea level during the flight, which put it directly within the flight path of a Tengah Air Base runway. The two diverted RSAF aircraft were scheduled to land at the runway within the next hour after the drone was detected. Ng pleaded guilty on Tuesday to three counts of air navigation offences, with another 14 charges considered for sentencing. Aside from the Sep 8, 2020 incident, he also flew the drone without a permit on 11 occasions between May and October 2020. The drone was detected around Chia Ping Road, Chin Bee Road, Joo Yee Road, Yang Ho Road and Corporation Road at an altitude exceeding 60m. It flew close to buildings and over people and vehicles, putting them at risk of being hit should the drone fall from height due to malfunction or pilot error, the prosecution earlier said. Calculations showed that if Ng had lost control of the drone, it would ""easily"" have caused death or serious injury, with little time for pedestrians or vehicles to get out of harm's way given the altitudes at which it was flying, according to the prosecution. For flying a drone in a manner likely to endanger the safety of any person, aircraft or property, Ng could have been jailed up to five years, fined up to S$100,000 or both.

The scheme ran for about 10 years and involved a group of Shell employees arranging illegal loadings of marine fuel for vessels at below market rates. The 12 men were employees of external surveying companies engaged by Shell to inspect the volume of fuel loaded onto vessels, according to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau. They are accused of accepting about S$300,000 in bribes as a reward for not accurately reporting the amount of fuel loaded on the vessels they inspected. The surveyors allegedly received the bribes from former Shell employees Juandi Pungot, Muzaffar Ali Khan Muhamad Akram and Richard Goh Chee Keong. Juandi, identified as a key mastermind of the heist, was jailed 29 years last month. Muzaffar and Goh's cases are pending. The High Court justice who heard Juandi's case described the heist as ""exceptionally serious"" and ""unprecedented in scale and complexity"", and said it affected Singapore's reputation as a commercial hub. The scheme came to light in August 2017, when Shell made a police report over an unidentified loss of fuel amounting to about S$3 million in April that year. Apart from paying off the surveyors, the syndicate employed sophisticated techniques such as configuring the flow of the stolen fuel and timing it against legitimate fuel transfers. The 12 surveyors who have been charged and the amount of bribes they are accused of accepting are as follows: Their employers are listed as Intertek Testing Services, Inspectorate Singapore, CCIC Singapore and SGS Testing & Control Services Singapore. Four of the accused have indicated that they will plead guilty, court records show. They are Anand Omprekas, Noruliman Bakti, Erwin Suhardi Jamaluddin and Muhammad Khairul Asri Mohamad Hanafiah. The penalty for corruption is jail for up to five years, a fine of up to S$100,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/police-station-inspector-push-nsf-heads-criminal-force-2623796,Police station inspector fined for pushing the heads of 2 NSFs towards his groin,"SINGAPORE: A police station inspector who pushed the heads of two full-time national servicemen towards his groin was fined S$3,000 on Wednesday (Apr 13). Yick Wai Hong, 47, pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal force. He was an assistant duty officer at the time of the offences in and around January 2020. Both victims were under his supervision. On Jan 23 that year, Yick and the first victim, then 21, were on shift during the wee hours of the morning. Yick asked the younger man if he wanted to take a short break. It was implied that he would cover the victim's duties during the break, stated court documents. The victim took up the offer. Yick then used his hand to push the victim's head, causing it to move towards Yick's groin. The push was not hard but it was unexpected, and Yick knew it was likely to cause annoyance, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Yen Seow. The victim's face was ""a finger's length away"" from Yick's groin, and he felt shocked, disgusted and humiliated by what had happened, said the prosecutor. The victim also thought that Yick's actions were ""an abuse of power and a form of sexual harassment"", said Mr Tan. The victim left the room and resumed his duty five to 10 minutes later. He had no further contact with Yick after that. The next day, the victim reported the matter in a feedback form he had received for his operationally ready date. He also made a police report after speaking to his superiors. After this, the victim's superiors asked other NSFs if they had similar encounters with Yick. This prompted the second victim, then 23, to reveal that Yick had behaved inappropriately towards him sometime in or before January 2020. On that occasion, Yick was leaning against the second victim's table and eating snacks. He did not say anything to the victim. When the victim leaned towards Yick to take some of the snacks, Yick pushed the back of the victim's head towards his groin. This push was hard and sudden, and the victim's forehead touched Yick's groin. The victim felt that Yick had been disrespectful and rude to him. He also felt scared of Yick as he believed that he had been molested, said the prosecutor. Yick walked away from the victim and they did not say anything to each other after that. The prosecution asked for a fine, with the amount set at the court's discretion. Mr Tan highlighted that Yick was at the time ""a relatively senior law enforcement officer, of whom higher standards may reasonably be expected"". ""Instead of setting a good example to his junior police officers, he abused his position of power and undermined the high standing of the police force by behaving inappropriately towards them,"" said Mr Tan. He added that the victims were vulnerable as they had little choice with regard to their workplace and superiors. Mr Tan also said it was important to deter such offences as they were difficult to detect, since NSFs may be wary of confronting their superiors about such conduct. In mitigation, Yick's defence lawyer said there was no sexual intent in his client's actions, and that he had wanted to remind younger officers of the need to perform their duties with diligence. Yick was ""overzealous"" about maintaining high work standards, and acted out when he perceived lapses in his subordinates' performance, said the lawyer. The lawyer also said that it was a ""painful fall from grace"" for his client, a highly commended officer who had served for more than 20 years at the time of the offences. The Singapore Police Force (SPF) told CNA that it had suspended Yick on Apr 8 last year. It has commenced internal action against him following his conviction. Officers are expected to uphold the law and maintain high standards of discipline and integrity, said SPF. ""We deal with officers who break the law severely, including charging them in court."" The offence of using criminal force without provocation is punishable with up to three months' jail, a fine of up to S$1,500 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-slingshot-hit-neighbour-window-hougang-hdb-block-2623136,Slingshot enthusiast gets jail for hitting windows in Hougang HDB block,"SINGAPORE: A slingshot enthusiast who conducted target practice at his estate in Hougang twice ended up striking the windows of flats in a neighbouring block when he missed. Chan Fan Kheow, 61, was sentenced to three weeks' jail on Wednesday (Apr 13) after pleading guilty to an amalgamated charge of committing a rash act that endangered the personal safety of others. Another charge of carrying an offensive weapon in a public place was considered for sentencing. District Judge Marvin Bay noted that Chan persisted with his target practice in the neighbourhood despite being aware of his poor accuracy, and that this was aggravating. He said that Chan, as a fellow resident in a public housing flat, would have been aware of the density of residents in the block and hence the possibility of injury to other people. The judge cited a forensic report by the Health Sciences Authority stating that people could have suffered eye injuries if hit directly by Chan's ball bearings. Judge Bay also said it was improbable that Chan was not aware the slingshots were prohibited weapons, as he claimed, given the intensity with which he pursued his hobby. The court previously heard that Chan became interested in slingshots after realising he could buy them cheaply online. By January 2020, he had acquired seven of the prohibited weapons as well as metal ball bearings, marbles and plastic pellets to shoot with. He also decided to attend coaching sessions after learning about slingshot competitions while on a business trip to Guangzhou in December 2019. Chan was practising at the rooftop of a multi-storey car park at Hougang Avenue 9 when the incidents happened in December 2019 and January 2020. He practised twice a day, in the mornings and evenings, by aiming at plastic bottles that he placed on the ground and ledge of the car park. He often stood facing a neighbouring block, Block 923, and projected the ball bearings in this direction during practice. As Chan ""was not very skilled with using slingshots, there were instances where he missed the plastic bottles altogether"", said the prosecutor. On Dec 25, 2019, one of Chan's ball bearings missed the bottles and hit the glass window in the living room of a flat in Block 923. It cracked the window and made a small hole. Later that day, a resident of the flat noticed a small glass shard on the living room floor and made a police report after realising it came from the window. On Jan 12, 2020, Chan again missed at target practice, and his ball bearing hit a glass window in a bedroom of a flat in Block 923. It made a hole about the size of a five-cent coin. The resident of the flat also made a police report after noticing the hole in the window and glass fragments on the floor next to the window. The total damage to both flats' windows amounted to about S$310. Chan was arrested on Jan 16, 2020, after police found his ball bearings scattered on the rooftop of the multi-storey car park and saw him take out a slingshot in police camera footage. The prosecution had sought four to five weeks' jail, arguing that Chan knew he was not very skilled at using the slingshot and was also aware of the damage it could inflict. The defence asked for one day's jail at most, if the judge found that imprisonment was warranted. The lawyer contended that Chan took precautions by placing the plastic bottles in front of a ledge or bushes in case he missed. However, the judge found that Chan's actions were ""extremely rash and antisocial criminal acts"" and that he ""could not possibly have been oblivious"" of the risk of hitting the neighbouring block.  At the end of the hearing, Chan's defence lawyer asked for a two-week deferment for Chan to consider whether to appeal the sentence. The punishment for endangering the personal safety of others through a rash act is up to six months' jail, a fine of up to S$5,000 or both. Chan could have received double this penalty for his charge amalgamating two such offences."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-rape-12-year-old-girl-sister-law-2621881,"Man jailed, caned for raping 12-year-old sister-in-law after sending her sexually explicit messages","SINGAPORE: A 26-year-old man sent his wife's 12-year-old half-sister sexually explicit text messages before inviting the girl over to his flat, where he raped her. The girl ""did everything in her power to say no"", including telling the offender that she was having a ""mental crisis"" after his repeated requests for sex, said the prosecution. The man was jailed 10 years and sentenced to six strokes of the cane on Tuesday (Apr 12) after pleading guilty at the High Court to one count of rape committed in February 2020. Another nine charges, including charges of sexual assault and sexual communication with a minor, were also considered for sentencing. The man was also sentenced to three weeks' jail for an unrelated charge of cheating a Carousell buyer of S$200 for Universal Studios Singapore tickets in 2016. The sentences are to run consecutively. He was previously given a four-month conditional warning for the cheating offence, but reoffended by committing the rape during that time. The offender cannot be named as it could lead to identification of the victim of the rape, whose identity is protected by gag order. The court heard that the victim got to know the offender in 2011, when he started dating her half-sister. The couple married in August 2019. The victim lived with her grandparents and aunts, as her father was in prison and her mother did not take care of her. The offender, a food delivery rider at the time, lived with his wife. The offender and victim had never met alone prior to the rape, and only made small talk at family gatherings. He started sending her text messages towards the end of 2019, such as to ask her about her exam results. He first invited the victim to visit his flat at the end of January 2020, but she declined. He invited her over again on Feb 19, 2020, and she accepted. The rape happened on this occasion. That afternoon, the offender sent the girl several sexualised messages. He made explicit overtures to her and she said no repeatedly, giving an ""adamant, explicit refusal"", said the prosecution. However, he persisted and continued to send her messages until she agreed to go to his house. After the girl reached the offender's flat, both sat on the sofa using their phones for a while. The man sent her a sexually explicit image and asked if she wanted to watch porn, which the girl refused. He went on to suggest kissing her neck while the lights were switched off, and she agreed. While doing this, he sexually assaulted her, then raped her on the sofa. The girl told him she was in pain, but he did not stop. This went on for a few minutes until his phone rang and he told the victim to wash up in the toilet while he took the call. The girl felt like crying in the toilet but did not do so as she did not want the offender to know she had cried, the court heard. When she came out of the toilet, the offender apologised and asked if she was okay. The girl replied that she was. He then booked her a ride home. While she was in the car, he sent her a message asking for what had happened to stay between them. In the following months, the offender continued to send the victim multiple messages requesting sex and sexual favours. The victim told a friend about these messages on Jun 3, 2020. The friend told her own mother, who in turn informed the victim's aunt as they were friends. The victim's aunt spoke to her that day and was shown the chat log with the offender and told about the rape. The girl was taken to make a police report on Jun 5, 2020. Deputy Public Prosecutor Suhas Malhotra called the incident an ""archetype"" of the conduct that the offence of statutory rape is supposed to deter. The offender could tell the girl was uncomfortable but changed tact and persisted until she eventually agreed to let him kiss her neck, with his conduct escalating from there, argued the prosecutor. There was also a power imbalance as the victim was barely out of primary school while the offender was an older member of her extended family, said Mr Malhotra. The prosecutor sought a total sentence of 10 years and four weeks' jail and six strokes of the cane. Defence lawyer Benedict Eoon argued that his client suffers from ""hypersexuality"" and risky sexual behaviour as a result of his schizophrenia. He asked for a lower sentence on the basis of a psychiatrist's finding that there was a contributory link between the offender's hypersexuality and the offences. The defence psychiatrist found that the offender exhibited risky sexual behaviour as he occasionally watched pornography and felt aroused when he sent sexual messages to women on dating platforms despite being married, said the lawyer. However, Justice Dedar Singh Gill agreed with the prosecution and the findings of an Institute of Mental Health psychiatrist that such behaviour was within the range of normal human sexuality. Justice Gill said the offender was able to exercise self-control at the time of the offence, pointing out that he ""worked on"" the victim to persuade her to have sex with him, and apologised after stopping the offending acts. He added that the rape was premeditated and that the offender applied some pressure on the victim through his persistence. Addressing the court before the sentence was delivered, the offender expressed hope for a shorter sentence so he could take care of his son. He also said that his family was ""supportive"" and that he hoped to rebuild his relationship with them. The man could have been jailed up to 20 years with a fine and caning for the offence of statutory rape. The punishment for cheating is jail for up to 10 years and a fine."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-fly-drone-rsaf-flight-re-route-tengah-air-base-runway-2621666,"Man flew drone illegally, endangering 2 RSAF aircraft that had to be diverted","SINGAPORE: Two Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) aircraft had to be diverted when a man illegally flew his drone into their flight path close to the time of their scheduled landing at Tengah Air Base in September 2020. The presence of the drone, which was detected by the air base's aeroscope, also led RSAF to close the affected runway for half an hour. Jason Ng Yok Sen, 43, pleaded guilty on Tuesday (Apr 12) to three counts of air navigation offences. Another 14 charges will be considered when he returns for sentencing later this week. During the incident on Sep 8, 2020, Ng was operating his DJI Mavic 2 Zoom, which weighs about 900g, from Taman Jurong Park. The drone enthusiast flew his unmanned aircraft for a total of 22 minutes, covering a distance of about 930m around Corporation Road. The drone hit a maximum altitude of 134m above mean sea level during the flight, which was detected by Tengah Air Base's aeroscope at about 7.45pm. This altitude and location meant that the drone was directly within the flight path of a Tengah Air Base runway, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Chong Ee Hsiun. Two RSAF aircraft with a total crew of four personnel were scheduled to use the runway for landing within the hour after the drone was detected. ""There was a risk of collision, which would have threatened both lives and property. The RSAF had to re-route the two affected aircraft away from the said runway, and impose a 30-minute runway closure,"" said the prosecutor. This was not the first time Ng had flown the drone dangerously. His drone was detected flying around Chia Ping Road, Chin Bee Road, Joo Yee Road, Yang Ho Road and Corporation Road at an altitude exceeding 60m on a total of 12 occasions between May 17 and Oct 3, 2020. On May 17 that year, Ng flew his drone for about half an hour, covering more than 5.6km around an area west of Taman Jurong Park, up to an altitude of 125m. Three days later, he flew the drone around the area for about 20 minutes to a distance of 1.8km and a maximum altitude of 136m. During this second flight, the drone also flew into airspace within 5km of Tengah Air Base's aerodrome, which is an area used for the arrival, departure and movement of aircraft. On the two occasions, Ng was operating his drone from a distance of about 724m and 820m respectively. This meant he was flying the drone close to buildings and over people and vehicles without keeping it in his line of sight at all times. This endangered people and vehicles, as they were at risk of being hit by the drone should it fall from height due to malfunction or pilot error, said Ms Chong. Calculations showed that if Ng had lost control of the drone, it would ""easily"" have caused death or serious injury, with little time for pedestrians or vehicles to get out of harm's way given the altitudes at which it was flying, she said. Ng was also required to obtain a permit to fly his drone at an altitude of more than 60m on these occasions, but did not do so. The prosecution sought a total fine of between S$53,000 and S$63,000, stressing the need to deter other potential offenders. Ms Chong told the court that this was the ""first case with a complaint involving the diversion of aircraft"". ""This is an egregious case where actual endangerment of aircraft in flight occurred, with actual disruption to the operations of Tengah Air Base ... This is serious,"" she said. Aside from the safety risk, Ms Chong said that unregulated drone flights could also affect Singapore's reputation as an aviation hub by crowding the country's limited airspace. Those who fly a drone without the required Class 2 activity permit can be jailed up to two years and fined up to S$50,000, with heavier penalties for repeat offenders. Those who fly a drone in a manner likely to endanger the safety of any person, aircraft or property can be jailed up to five years, fined up to S$100,000 or both."

The victims, 12 of whom were repatriated on Tuesday (Apr 12) morning, were also beaten and slapped, said their lawyer.  Heng Zhi Li, who represents the 15 men and one woman, said the victims had left for Cambodia in stages between September 2021 and February this year after they were allegedly promised a salary of RM7,000 (US$1,650). He added that the victims began contacting the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) in January. Information about their situation was then shared with the Council for Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants (MAPO) which subsequently sought assistance from ASEANAPOL and Interpol to rescue them. Foreign Ministry deputy secretary-general Amran Mohamed Zin said that the Cambodian authorities had received information on the involvement of 16 Malaysians in illegal activities in the country and arrested all of them on Apr 4. “Even though the Cambodian government found that they were carrying out illegal activities in Cambodia, legal action has been set aside for now so that we can bring home our people from being stranded there,” he told reporters at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2.  Amran said that the Malaysian embassy in Cambodia was monitoring the condition of the four other Malaysians, who were undergoing quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19.  Cambodian authorities will arrange for their return as soon as they have recovered, he added.  Bukit Aman Criminal Investigation Department director Abd Jalil Hassan previously said that the victims had been deceived through Facebook and forced to work as scammers by a syndicate in Preah Sihanouk which offered lucrative customer service officer jobs in Cambodia. The costs of their trips there were borne by a company in Cambodia. As soon as they arrived in the country, however, their travel documents were seized. Their movements were also controlled and they were kept under tight security, he said.   "

Liow, who is the alleged mastermind of the “Nicky Gang”, claimed trial to the charges framed under Section 4(1)(a) and 4(1)(b) of the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing And Proceeds Of Unlawful Activities Act at the Shah Alam Sessions Court on Tuesday (Apr 12). The 34-year-old businessman was arrested after he surrendered voluntarily to the police’s Commercial Crime Investigation Department in Bukit Aman, Kuala Lumpur, on Monday. Malaysian media reported that Liow had been on the run for more than a year.  Former police chief Abdul Hamid Bador was quoted by the media in March last year as saying that Liow was found to have alleged close connections with Macao-based crime boss Wan Kuok-Koi, nicknamed “Broken Tooth”.  During Liow’s court appearance on Tuesday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Rozaliana Zakaria asked the court to not allow bail as Liow was accused of committing non-bailable offences and there was a risk that he might abscond. “Various efforts have been made to track down the accused through media releases, Interpol Red Alert notices and arrest warrants to get the accused to appear in court,"" she was quoted as saying by the Star. In countering this, Liow’s defence lawyer Rajpal Singh said his client should be given bail of RM500,000 or a sum less than RM1 million with two sureties as his client had voluntarily surrendered himself to the police. He also said that in the cases of former prime minister Najib Razak and United Malays National Organisation president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, both individuals were given bail that amounted to around 1 per cent of the amount involved in their alleged crimes.  Judge Helina Sulaiman eventually decided to allow bail at RM1 million and ordered Liow to surrender his passport to the court, reported the Star. The judge also fixed May 26 for case management. On March 23, the Shah Alam Court issued a warrant of arrest against Liow to face charges under Section 4(1)(a) of the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act.  According to Malaysian media, police were tracking down Liow, who is the founder of Winner Dynasty Group, after members of his gang were arrested in “Ops Pelican 3.0” in March last year. In a series of more than 70 raids, police arrested 68 members of his group between Mar 20 and Mar 28, 2021. Police also confiscated 16 luxury vehicles, including a Rolls Royce, as well as more than RM7 million in foreign currency. On Apr 9 last year, Liow and his brother were charged in the Petaling Jaya Sessions Court, Selangor, for allegedly being members of an organised crime group. Liow was charged in absentia, as he was on the run. In the same month, Liow was stripped of the state honour given by the Pahang palace which carries the title of Datuk Seri, following reports of his alleged criminal activities."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-flee-batam-avoid-arrest-east-coast-lagoon-food-village-assault-2621426,Man fled to Batam for 9 months to avoid arrest for assault at East Coast Lagoon Food Village,"SINGAPORE: After assaulting a man and his son at East Coast Lagoon Food Village, a man decided to flee the country to avoid arrest, paying S$500 for someone to arrange his illegal departure. From Tuas, he took a boat to Batam and stayed there for nine months before Indonesian authorities deported him in March this year. Safuan Kamarodin, 39, pleaded guilty on Tuesday (Apr 12) to four charges of rioting, leaving Singapore from an unauthorised point of departure and irresponsible driving. The Singaporean will return to court for sentencing next month. The court heard that Safuan and eight of his friends got into a fight with a father and son at East Coast Lagoon Food Village after midnight on Apr 11 last year. The two sides did not know each other. The fight took place after Safuan's friend Nur Faisal Shah Hishamuddin Shah, known as Bhai, 34, bumped into a man at the entrance of the hawker centre's male toilet. Bhai confronted the 51-year-old man for bumping into him, and the exchange quickly escalated into a dispute with Bhai's friends backing him up. Safuan made the first move by getting into a tussle with the other man. When the victim fell onto the ground, the group punched and kicked him repeatedly for about 20 seconds until he managed to get up and run away. Later, as the victim, his 20-year-old son and the rest of his family were on their way out of the hawker centre, they saw the group loitering near where the earlier assault took place. The victim's son questioned the group about the attack. The confrontation grew heated until the group started punching and kicking the son. He ran away but they chased him through the hawker centre, at one point throwing a coconut at him. Safuan tried to throw a beer bottle at the son but missed. The group also chased the father through the hawker centre, and Safuan kicked him after he fell on the ground. The victims did not retaliate and only tried to defend themselves from the blows, said the prosecution. Police arrived after receiving several calls from members of the public. The victims were taken to the hospital and found to have abrasions on various parts of their bodies. Bhai is still on the run, according to the prosecution. About two months after the attack, Safuan decided to flee Singapore to evade detection and arrest. He was wanted for police investigations and had a warrant to arrest issued against him at the time, after failing to attend a hearing for earlier driving offences. He was deported back from Batam on Mar 29 this year. Safuan also admitted to drink-driving and careless driving after midnight on Oct 30, 2020. He had drunk a few glasses of whiskey earlier that night. While driving at the junction of Fullerton Road and Esplanade Drive, he fell asleep at the wheel and lost control of the rented van he was driving. The van crashed into guardrails and overturned. A police officer at the scene found Safuan reeking strongly of alcohol, and the man also failed a breathalyser test. Safuan and his passenger suffered minor abrasions. The damage to the guardrails was valued at S$13,800, and was paid for by the vehicle rental company. The prosecution is seeking between 22 months and six weeks' jail and 25 months and 10 weeks' jail, as well as a S$7,000 fine and four-year ban from driving. Deputy Public Prosecutor Melina Chew called the attack at the hawker centre a ""senseless assault"" that was unprovoked and unwarranted. She also noted that Safuan made the group's first move on the other man, and that the nine assailants outnumbered their two victims. She also highlighted Safuan's previous convictions for being a member of an unlawful society and rioting to ask for a longer jail sentence. The penalty for rioting is up to seven years' jail and caning. Illegal departure from Singapore can be punished with up to six months' jail, a fine of up to S$2,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/support-sexual-crime-victims-family-violence-new-police-command-centre-2621301,"Victims of sexual crime, family violence to get more support with new police command to be set up","SINGAPORE: Victims of sexual crimes and family violence will get more support with the formation of a new police command overseeing such cases.  The police command, staffed by officers who specialise in investigating cases of sexual crime and family violence, will be set up by next year, announced Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam on Tuesday (Apr 12). These officers will also be trained in victim management skills, Mr Shanmugam said, delivering the keynote address at the police’s inaugural Sexual Assault Awareness Seminar. Police will also strengthen training for all frontline officers who may be the first responders to such cases, he added. The new police command is among several initiatives aimed at improving the way sexual offences are dealt with, covering areas such as investigative processes, training, public awareness of sexual crime investigation and court processes. The Singapore Police Force (SPF) is also boosting community partnerships to strengthen support for victims. For instance, SPF is working on partnering a family violence specialist centre to provide victims with more avenues of help. They can be referred to the Care Corner Project StART (CCPS), which provides support to victims of any form of violence, for counselling and intervention, said Mr Shanmugam. Currently, victims may be given emotional support during investigations under the police’s Victim Care Cadre programme. However, the programme – manned by volunteers – usually only holds a single listening session for victims rather than the throughcare counselling regime provided by CCPS. Mr Shanmugam also announced that a new charity, SG Her Empowerment Limited (SHE), is being set up this month. SHE will deal with a range of issues affecting women, including setting up a victim support centre for online and sexual harm. This includes women who have had their compromising photos shared online without their consent. The victim support centre will feature a website that informs women of their rights, as well as a helpline for victims to call anonymously.  More specifically, SHE aims to work with tech platforms to simplify the reporting of harmful online content for removal, and with the Law Society to provide pro bono legal advice to victims. This will streamline the reporting process for victims who might be too ashamed or traumatised to reach out to multiple platforms and lawyers for help, and inform victims exactly what evidence each platform needs.
  Separately, the police will engage sexual assault victims on a voluntary basis this year, as part of a survey to get feedback on existing processes and victim care measures, as well as to identify areas for improvement. The police will also launch a revamped one-stop webpage on sexual assault. The webpage will provide comprehensive information on the definition of sexual assault, investigation processes, victim care measures and support services for victims. It will feature videos on the police’s investigation process. On the investigative processes, Mr Shanmugam stressed the “key area” of DNA in solving sex crimes. He pointed to how police in 2014 identified a man who raped a 12-year-old girl after matching his DNA with a sample taken from the victim’s body and crime scene 12 years earlier. The man raped the girl in 2002 but the case went cold as the police did not have further leads like CCTV footage and eyewitness accounts. He was arrested in 2014 for a separate case of alleged theft.  Without the police’s ability to collect and retain DNA, the rapist would not have been caught, Mr Shanmugam said. “So we are looking at these powers of collection and retention, and we will make announcements in due course,” he added. Moving on to community partnerships, Mr Shanmugam said CCPS will support victims both during and after investigations. Ms Kristine Lam, lead social worker at CCPS, said the partnership with the police will not change the services they provide to victims, but allow them to access more victims as many usually go to the police first. CCPS will “establish immediate safety” for victims and help them rebuild a routine so they can cope with daily life, Ms Lam said, adding that victims might experience trauma effects like nightmares, meltdowns and anxiety effects. “The key difference is that the service that we're providing is more immediate in terms of the timeframe, so they don't have to wait months before they get help – within one to three days,” she said. Ms Jenny Giam, a trained counsellor who volunteers as a victim care officer under the police’s victim care cadre programme, said the programme provides victims with a listening ear and information about other help resources. But this usually happens during a single session after referral by a police psychologist, and is only repeated – possibly with another victim care officer depending on availability – if the victim requests for another session.  “(This is) compared to CCPS, which is generally a social service agency where they specialise in this kind of area of work,” Ms Giam said. “And they do provide intervention for the victims in the long run. So that means I suppose they don't just see the victim one time, they have a series of sessions.” The charity SHE came from an alliance for action led by Senior Minister of State Sim Ann and Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu Mahzam. Ms Ann raised S$650,000 in pledges from community members who support the cause, SHE chairman and lawyer Stefanie Yuen Thio said in a statement, adding that this helped set up SHE. Ms Thio later told reporters it is important to continue the alliance’s work, calling online harms a “very new area” that is relatively underserved in the victim support space. “Right now if your younger sister had her photograph or a telephone number put on the Internet and she comes to you, what do I do,” she said. “You need to then go to each of the tech platforms, (read their) terms and conditions and their community standards and try to figure out what that tech platform needs. “Then you also need to call your friend if you have a friend who's a lawyer and say does she have a reportable case here? What should be done? “She doesn't need to go through that trauma. She doesn't need to talk to five different sets of people about the same facts. So I think that streamlining process is really important.” Ms Thio said the tech platforms have been “super supportive” when it comes to this issue, adding that SHE is a community-led effort and that the tech platforms are not “bowing to any Government strictures”. SHE will also work with other organisations and non-governmental organisations (NGO) to roll out programmes aimed at improving women’s development and building a more gender-equal society in Singapore. For instance, SHE will work with the Singapore Council of Women’s Organisations as it already has a victim support centre. Ms Thio said she has also started talking to Association of Women for Action and Research executive director Corinna Lim, whom she calls a good friend. Ms Thio said the idea is to conceptualise support programmes for women and work with other organisations in rolling them out. “I see SHE’s role as a feedback gathering unit, discussion, thought leadership, research and advocacy. I think that that's probably the area in which we can play the strongest part,” she added. Mr Shanmugam said he hopes to see SHE follow up on the work and ideas borne from the recent White Paper on Singapore Women’s Development. Parliament on Apr 5 endorsed the White Paper, which calls for protection against violence and harm among other support measures for women. “We hope to work with them closely, particularly to enhance support in the entire ecosystem, for those who have suffered harm, online or physical and emotional,” Mr Shanmugam said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/workplace-sexual-harassment-man-grope-colleague-harass-text-messages-2619801,"Jail for man who groped junior colleague, sent her sexualised messages","SINGAPORE: A 35-year-old man has been sentenced to six months' jail for groping a junior colleague at their workplace after months of sexually harassing her over text message. The man pleaded guilty on Monday (Apr 11) to two charges of outrage of modesty, with another charge considered for sentencing. The identities of the offender and victim, and the location of their workplace where the offences took place are protected by gag order. The victim left her job shortly after the incidents took place, while the offender has since taken up a new job. The court heard that the offender developed feelings for the victim and obtained her contact details after she joined his team at work. The offender was the colleague's senior at work, although he was not her supervisor. Between March and December 2020, he sent her sexualised messages over WhatsApp, persisting even though she ignored them. In March that year, he told the victim: ""Swear if I single ... we'll be flirting hard haha"". He also told her she had a ""nice bum"" and that ""bums are actually my weakness"". On one occasion, he asked her if she ever felt sexually aroused while at work. Another time, he sent a photo of her as a teenager that he had found on her Instagram profile. He asked her why she had not taken any photos recently as she was ""sexier"" and ""voluptuous"" now. The victim felt very uncomfortable receiving these messages. She would either not reply, or change the topic when she eventually responded. On the evening of Dec 30, 2020, the offender and victim were working together when he told her: ""Your butt is big now."" She ignored his remark and continued what she was doing. The man then moved closer to the victim and used his hand to caress her buttock over her clothing. The victim was uncomfortable and moved away. However, he followed her and groped her buttock. The woman quickly completed her task and left the office. She returned to her desk about an hour later and was sitting there when the offender approached to tell her he was leaving for home. The man said he wanted to give her a fist bump to say goodbye. After she gave him a fist bump, he groped her breast. Shocked, the victim moved backwards and bumped into the chair of another colleague, who was oblivious to what was happening. The offender hurriedly left the office. The victim told her boyfriend about what had happened later that day, and made a police report the next day. Deputy Public Prosecutor Thiagesh Sukumaran sought six months' jail for the offender, highlighting that his actions involved workplace sexual assault against a background of persistent sexual harassment. He noted the importance of deterring such offences by senior colleagues, saying: ""Colleagues who are junior in terms of seniority may still be wary about speaking out against their senior counterparts for fear that they would not be believed or supported."" The prosecutor also pointed out that the offender had groped the victim's breast in the presence of another colleague, which was a brazen act. The accused, who did not have a lawyer, conducted his own defence. He told the court that ""a lot of things have changed"" since the offences, in particular the birth of his child. He said he was facing financial problems as he took a while to find a new job after the offences, and had to accept a lower paying position. ""I understand the gravity of my situation, your honour,"" he told the judge, adding: ""It was a big mistake on my end. I know I shouldn't have done it."" District Judge Lim Wen Juin agreed with the sentence sought by the prosecution, describing the offences as a ""substantial intrusion"" into the victim's physical well-being. He also said that the pattern of sexual harassment meant her distress was not limited to the outrage of modesty offences. Judge Lim deferred the sentence by one week upon a request by the accused for time to sort out his finances. For outraging a person's modesty, the accused could have been jailed up to three years, fined, caned or given any combination of these punishments."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/aye-accident-collision-motorcyclist-die-man-admit-2619691,Lawyer admits causing motorcyclist's death in AYE accident involving multiple vehicles,"SINGAPORE: A man admitted on Monday (Apr 11) to causing a motorcyclist's death in an accident involving at least seven vehicles on the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE) in 2018. Laurence Goh Eng Yau side-swiped the motorcycle of Mr Wong Yew Wai, pushing him out into the path of an oncoming lorry in the next lane. Mr Wong, who was 33 at the time, was run over by the lorry and pronounced dead at the scene. Goh, now 57, pleaded guilty to one count of negligent driving. He will return to the State Courts for sentencing later this month. The prosecution is seeking at least three weeks' jail and a five-year driving ban for Goh. Goh is a lawyer and the sole proprietor of his eponymous legal practice, according to a search on the Ministry of Law's website. He was heading to Bukit Panjang from his office when the accident took place near exit 7A of the AYE at about 5.20pm on Sep 12, 2018. He was driving on the first, rightmost lane towards Tuas at about 75 to 80 kmh, which was below the speed limit. As there was traffic congestion at the time, the two cars in front of Goh's car braked and came to a standstill. However, Goh did not keep a proper lookout for traffic conditions ahead of him and failed to keep a safe following distance from the car in front of him, the court heard. As a result, he continued to move forward until he suddenly noticed that the car ahead of him had stopped. Goh braked, but as his car was too near to the back of the front vehicle, he abruptly swerved his car out to the left to avoid a collision. He did so without first ensuring that there was no oncoming traffic in the second lane, said the prosecution. As Goh swerved, he side-swiped Mr Wong's motorcycle, which had been travelling in the second lane and slightly behind Goh's car. Mr Wong was suddenly pushed out onto the third lane of the AYE right in front of a lorry, whose driver was unable to stop in time.  Goh also crashed into the rear of the car in front of him and continued swerving into the third lane, eventually stopping in between the second and third lanes. After Goh's abrupt swerve, another two cars behind him crashed into each other and hit the two cars in front. The passenger in one of the cars suffered a neck strain as a result of the collision. Mr Wong was pronounced dead at the scene after paramedics arrived. His cause of death was determined to be head and neck injuries consistent with those sustained in a vehicle collision. Brake systems in Goh's car and the lorry were found to be working with no mechanical faults, according to a vehicle inspection. Goh could be jailed up to two years, fined or receive both punishments for causing death by a negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/former-gang-member-trial-sexually-assault-teenage-boys-playground-2619566,Former gang member on trial for sexually assaulting 3 teens at playground slide,"SINGAPORE: A 46-year-old man befriended three teenage boys who lived in the same neighbourhood. They hung out often, with the older man sharing about his life and thoughts on religion. But when the friendship soured over rumours about him, the former gang member allegedly sexually assaulted the boys on one night in 2018. Mustapah Abdullah, now 50, went on trial at the High Court on Monday (Apr 11). He is conducting his own defence against three counts of sexual assault. The identities of the victims, who were aged 16 to 17 at the time of the alleged offences, are protected by gag order. They were identified as V1, V2 and V3 in court documents. The prosecution's case is that Mustapah preyed on the fears of the victims and forced them to perform a sexual act by threatening to hurt them and harass their families. He ""capitalised on the victims' fears of violent reprisals and presented each of them with a false 'choice'"" between sexual assault and physical injury, said Deputy Public Prosecutors Gail Wong, Tay Jia En and Gladys Lim. The prosecution is expected to lead evidence from 20 witnesses to prove the offences. The three victims will be testifying in camera. The prosecution is seeking a sentence of 26 years' jail and 24 strokes of the cane, with additional jail time in lieu of caning. The accused cannot be caned as he is now 50. An Institute of Mental Health psychiatrist found that Mustapah has no mental disorder or intellectual disability, and was not of unsound mind at the time of the alleged offences. According to the prosecution, Mustapah and the victims became acquainted sometime in the later half of 2017. They were introduced by a 16-year-old boy, identified as W1 in court documents. The group hung out at a hut in their neighbourhood that was near Mustapah's flat. Mustapah was friendly with the teens and would buy them drinks and cigarettes, said the prosecution. The boys learnt that he used to be involved in a gang. Another mutual friend of the boys, identified in court documents as W2, also started spending time with the group in late 2017. According to charge sheets, Mustapah is also accused of sexually assaulting W1 on five occasions in 2017 when he was 15, and W2 on two occasions in 2018 when he was 16. Those are the subject of seven charges that have been stood down while the trial is being heard before Justice See Kee Oon. In 2018, the victims heard a rumour that W2 had been made to perform a sexual act on Mustapah. They started to avoid Mustapah after that. Sometime after midnight on Oct 17, 2018, Mustapah confronted W1 about why the group was avoiding him. W1 told the accused about the rumour, which he said he had heard from V1. Mustapah demanded that V1 meet him near the hut, threatening to ""cut"" him if he did not show up, said the prosecution. The accused purportedly choked and slapped V1 during the confrontation. When Mustapah asked who else knew about the rumour, V1 mentioned V2 and V3's names. The accused allegedly sent offensive text messages to the two victims when he could not reach them with a call. He then let V1 return home. V3 eventually returned Mustapah's call and met the older man at the hut. When Mustapah asked him who told him the rumour, he said he had forgotten. Mustapah then allegedly threatened to harass V3 at his house and ""cut"" his family, and pulled V3's hair. The victim felt afraid, and was allowed to return home after being told not to spread the rumour. According to the prosecution, Mustapah then arranged to meet the victims at the hut at 10.30pm on Oct 17, 2018, where he questioned them about spreading the rumour. ""The accused became physically violent by pulling V3's hair, slapping him (causing his spectacles to drop) and trying to scratch his eye out, and also kicked V2 on his back,"" said the prosecution, adding that he was holding a bottle of beer at the time. Mustapah also allegedly threatened the victims by telling them that he used to be involved in gang fights. He said that he would go to the victims' houses and do ""something bad"" to them, so they should ""watch out"". He then allegedly told the victims to speak with him one at a time, at the top of a slide at the playground near the hut. There, he is accused of telling each victim to either perform a sexual act on him or to ""walk away"". If they chose the latter option, he would give them ""problems"" in public. ""From the accused's behaviour and the earlier assaults, the victims understood that the accused meant that he would physically injure them or create trouble at their houses,"" said the prosecution. Out of fear, each of the three victims purportedly gave in to Mustapah's threats. The alleged offences came to light after V1's class advisor noticed the boy was behaving unusually and arranged for him to see the school counsellor. On Oct 22, 2018, V1 told the counsellor that he and the other two victims were forced to perform a sexual act on the accused. The school made a police report two days later. The punishment for sexual assault by penetration is up to 20 years' jail, a fine and caning. The trial continues until Thursday."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/indian-police-hunt-gang-accused-stealing-bridge-2618651,Indian police hunt gang accused of stealing a bridge,"BHUBANESWAR: Police in India were seeking to arrest members of a gang who dismantled a 18m iron bridge and likely sold it off in parts as scrap metal, officials said on Sunday (Apr 10). The robbers, posing as government officials attached to the irrigation department in the eastern state of Bihar, used gas cutters and earthmoving machinery to break down an abandoned bridge in Amiyawar village, about 150 km south of Patna, the state capital. Selling metal scrap can be a lucrative business in India, where cases of theft of metal parts from public property to sell in large, unorganised scrapyards for quick cash are common. A police officer said Amiyawar residents assumed that the government officials had decided to dismantle the old bridge, built over a water canal some three decades ago, as it was not in use. Villagers had previously submitted an application to the irrigation department to dismantle the bridge, one resident said. ""People came with heavy machinery, gas cutters and worked for two days during the daytime to dismantle the bridge,"" said Gandhi Chaudhary, 29, a villager. Locals asked those working about their identity and were told they had been hired by the irrigation department to dismantle the bridge. Earlier in the week, the scrap metal was loaded into a vehicle and the site was vacated. ""We have identified some members of the gang and some are yet to be tracked down. They destroyed public property and stole a bridge,"" said Subash Kumar, a police official probing the case. "

All of them were rescued around noon on Apr 5, said Bukit Aman Criminal Investigations Department director Abd Jalil Hassan.  The 15 men and one woman were all deceived through Facebook and the costs of their trips were borne by a company in Cambodia, added Abd Jalil.  “As soon as the victims arrived in Cambodia, their travel documents were seized, their movements were controlled and they were kept under tight security."" Abd Jalil said the victims realised they were deceived only after arriving in Cambodia where they were forced to work as scammers.
“All the victims are safe and are currently in Phnom Penh, Cambodia while waiting for their flight home to Malaysia,” he added.  Members of the public were reminded to be cautious of job advertisements offering lucrative salaries in foreign countries as they could be exploited by irresponsible parties. “The police welcome cooperation from those who have information about syndicates trying to deceive Malaysians and forcing victims to conduct illegal activities abroad. “Those with information are asked to step forward to inform us at the nearest police station,” said Abd Jalil. "

The investigation officer said in the charge sheet that the wooden stick with a nail was “used as a weapon of offence” and was “likely to cause death”. The victim was hit on the head and suffered a cut. If convicted, Peck faces a jail term of up to seven years, a fine, or any combination of such punishments. Peck, who has been remanded at the Institute of Mental Health for psychiatric observation, cannot be caned as he is over 50 years old. He is set to return to court on Apr 22.

The pair told CNA that they had just reopened the stall on Monday after taking a few months off since Ms Wang had been in hospital. At about 7am, Mr Wee was seated outside the stall as he was cleaning and chopping vegetables while Ms Wang was inside the stall preparing fish.  Ms Wang recounted that she heard a commotion, and turned around to see the perpetrator allegedly hitting Mr Wee with a wooden stick.  She quickly rushed out of the stall and tried to grab the stick, with the man also allegedly hitting her several times on the head and arm.

Singaporean Teo Thiam Leng, 46, the driver of the Malaysia-registered car, was charged with dangerous driving in the incident that took place early on Friday morning. He is accused of reversing his vehicle at the motorcycle arrival zone of Tuas Checkpoint and hitting an Immigrations and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officer, causing hurt. He was also given a charge of abetting the importation of 33g of methamphetamine into Singapore in 2016. The court heard that Teo has a previous conviction for drug-related offences. In 2007, he was sentenced to five years' jail and five strokes of the cane for trafficking ketamine. The ICA said on Friday that Teo was wanted by the police and Central Narcotics Bureau. The two passengers, 35-year-old Chinese national Chen Songqing and 31-year-old Vietnamese national Ho Thi My Nhung, were each given one charge of criminal trespass. Teo and Ho have been remanded for investigations. Chen, who is in hospital, will also be remanded after his discharge. All three are set to return to court next week. The trio were arrested after trying to enter Singapore in the early hours of Friday morning. According to the ICA, they evaded departure clearance at Malaysia's Komplex Sultan Abu Bakar at about 2.15am. The car then sped towards Tuas Checkpoint while being pursued by Malaysia's Traffic Police.  An auxiliary police officer deployed at the entrance of Tuas Checkpoint towards Malaysia spotted the speeding vehicle and activated the alarm, locking down the checkpoint. To ""circumvent"" the lockdown, ICA said the driver attempted to ""force his way into Singapore"" through the automated motorcycle clearance lanes. ""However, the lanes were too narrow and the vehicle was incapacitated after crashing into the counters,"" said the authority, adding that an ICA officer suffered an abrasion on his right ankle in the process. Chen and Ho then tried to flee the scene on foot but were intercepted. Both were allegedly not in possession of valid travel documents. Teo was also detained. He was allegedly in possession of a tampered Singapore passport, and tested positive for drug consumption in a preliminary urine test. For dangerous driving causing hurt to another person, Teo could be jailed up to two years, fined up to S$10,000 or both. The penalties are increased if he is a repeat offender. He also faces 10 to 30 years' jail and 10 to 15 strokes of the cane if convicted of abetting the importation of drugs. He is liable for enhanced punishment given his previous conviction. The punishment for criminal trespass is jail for up to three months, a fine of up to S$1,500 or both."

They were flanked by plain clothes police officers, who asked them questions and also led them to a hair salon and two parks nearby. Videos of the aftermath of the attack seen by CNA showed the two men wielding their weapons in what appeared to be a car park. The men paced back and forth and were later seen running away, still holding the weapons. One of the victims appeared to have blood running down his face as he was attended to by another person.

Investigations are ongoing.  For voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapon, those found guilty may be jailed up to seven years, fined, caned, or a combination of these punishments.  The two victims, Ms Wang Wei, 54, and her boyfriend Mr Punnataro Wee, 51, run a fish soup stall at Tanglin Halt Food Centre.  The pair told CNA that they had just reopened the stall on Monday after taking a few months off since Ms Wang had been in hospital. At about 7am, Mr Wee was seated outside the stall as he was cleaning and chopping vegetables while Ms Wang was inside the stall preparing fish.  Ms Wang recounted that she heard a commotion, and turned around to see the perpetrator hitting Mr Wee with a wooden stick.  She then quickly rushed out of the stall and tried to grab the stick, with the man also hitting her several times on the head and arm. The man ran away once Ms Wang managed to wrench the stick from him. She then called the police and an ambulance with the help of other nearby stall owners. The attack left Mr Wee bleeding profusely and a photograph of his injuries showed streams of blood flowing from his head. Mr Wee had fainted after getting hit the first time, although he regained consciousness shortly after and helped to fend off the attacker, added Ms Wang.  “I took some photos of the blood, it was just flowing like water. It was very scary,” she told CNA in Mandarin.  When CNA visited Tanglin Halt Food Centre at about 4pm, bloodstains could be seen on the floor near Ms Wang and Mr Wee’s stall.  A hawker who wanted to be identified as Mr Tan said he did not know the nature of the relationship between the victims and the suspect.  The chicken rice hawker, who runs his business next to Ms Wang and Mr Wee’s fish soup stall, also said that the suspect operates a fish soup stall in another section of the hawker centre.  Mr Tan recounted witnessing the suspect creep up behind Mr Wee before suddenly attacking him with a stick.  “We didn’t even notice him coming over. He just suddenly attacked,” he added.  “After that he ran, we didn’t chase after him, because we know who he is. The whole thing was very strange.”  According to Ms Wang, this was not the first time the suspect had threatened herself and Mr Wee.  Police reports seen by CNA showed that Mr Wee made at least three police reports in 2020 after he was threatened with Hokkien vulgarities by a fellow stallholder. In response to a report made on Mar 11 that year, the perpetrator was given a 12-month conditional warning in July.  “I hope the police can investigate this carefully. I’m scared he will come and look for me again,” said Ms Wang. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/knife-sellers-regulations-safeguards-crimes-2616466,"Some knife sellers have safeguards in place, but most say there’s nothing much they can do to deter crime","SINGAPORE: Speciality sword shop Caesars Singapore screens customers and conducts verification checks before accepting any orders for its products, which include daggers and swords. Licensed to sell controlled items, the shop is required to take down buyers’ details and keep records of each sale. On a number of occasions, the retailer has had to reject customers due to their age or their delivery address being different from their registered one. “It’s suspicious and these are the cases that (usually) happen with underaged customers where perhaps, they buy the items for their friends who are also underaged and both sets of parents are unaware,” said the company’s operations manager Ng Hui Min. “So when we ask for their parents' permission, or their details for verification and they are unable to furnish us with that, that’s when we reject the order.” A similar approach is taken by sword shop KNX, which is also licensed to sell controlled items. Staff members are trained to screen customers and find out what they intend to do with their purchase. Details like the customer’s name, identity card (IC) number, address, and contact number are also taken down for record-keeping purposes. For purchases made on KNX's online store, customers are required to show their IC for verification when they go to the physical store to collect the items or upon delivery to their homes. These are in line with police guidelines on the sale of controlled items and can act as a line of defence against those who intend to use such items with ill intent, said knife retailers. In recent months, Singapore has seen a spate of violent incidents involving bladed weapons like swords, knives and razor blades. On Thursday, two men were arrested after a police manhunt operation for two suspects who allegedly attacked two other men with bread knives in an incident at Boon Lay Drive.  Footage circulating on social media showed the duo wielding the weapons at a carpark, with one of the victims appearing to have blood streaming down his face. In another incident, a man was caught on video retrieving a pointed silver-coloured object from a car during a fight that broke out near Katong Square shopping mall. Last month, there were at least three knife-related incidents, including one which a 37-year-old man was seen wielding a sword at Buangkok Crescent. In another case, a 64-year-old man armed with a knife died after he was shot in the chest by police. He had refused to drop his weapon despite multiple warnings and being tasered three times.  However, not all retailers who sell knives, especially those that are not considered controlled goods, conduct stringent checks on their customers. Neighbourhood hardware and homeware stores CNA spoke to said there is nothing much they can do to prevent people from misusing their knives. “Most of my customers live around here and so they just come as and when to buy a knife if they need it for cooking. I don’t ask to see their IC or question them about what they are going to do with that because what’s the point of doing so?” said one staff member from hardware store Poh Hua Industrial, who declined to be named. “I just wrap it up in newspaper and put it in a bag so the knife isn’t exposed when they walk around, for their safety and also others',” he said in mandarin. There are also limits to what licensed stores can do to prevent people from buying knives to harm others, said KNX's business manager Raymond Koh.  ""If a customer wanted to buy a knife for illegal use, it's not like they would tell us that if we asked,"" said Mr Koh.  ""And if they really wanted to do something bad or illegal, they don't have to come to us, they can just go to a supermarket or a (regular) shop to buy a knife and do all those illegal things,"" he said.  On Monday, Minister of State for Home Affairs Desmond Tan also cautioned against overregulating the sales of bladed tools as most of them are actually used for legitimate purposes. “Regulated items will be subject to greater control, including the regulation of sales on e-commerce platforms,” Mr Tan said. “We need to be calibrated on the regulatory measures to be imposed. Many items with common daily usage, like knives, can also be used as offensive weapons. We need to be practical and not overregulate such items.”  Currently, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) regulates six items under the Arms and Explosives Act – swords, spears, spearheads, daggers, bayonets and dangerous bows and arrows. However, when the Guns, Explosives and Weapons Control Act replaces the Arms and Explosives Act later this year, items like knuckledusters and flick knives will also be included in the list. Still, some retailers are erring on the side of caution when it comes to the sale of knives and bladed items. Carousell said such products that are not meant for culinary or domestic use are not allowed on its platform, adding that it has taken down such listings. “Carousell strictly prohibits any form of weaponry to be sold on its platform and will continue to further its efforts with both automated and manual moderation, to keep our marketplace safe,” said the company’s spokesperson. As for Mr Varun Singh, who owns a camping and outdoor equipment store, he makes it a point to ask customers about the purpose of their purchase of knives. That is despite him only selling fixed blade knives, axes, parangs and chopping tools – all of which are “permissible” items, according to classifications by the Singapore Police Force (SPF). This means they may be brought into Singapore without the need for a licence, permit, authorisation or approval from the police.  “We check to see if they are underaged and then ask them about their intent and if it’s something fishy or they can’t answer, then we won’t sell it to them,” he said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-molest-9-year-old-niece-pretend-sleep-probation-report-2616201,Probation report called for man who molested 9-year-old niece while she feigned sleep,"SINGAPORE: A 22-year-old man admitted on Friday (Apr 8) to molesting his underaged niece about 10 times a year while she pretended to be asleep. The offences happened from 2014 to 2017, when the victim was aged nine to 12 and the offender was about 15 to 18 years old. Their identities are protected by gag order. The judge ordered a probation suitability report after the man pleaded guilty to three counts of outraging the modesty of a minor. Three more charges will be taken into consideration when he returns to court for sentencing next month. The court heard that the victim and offender lived together with other family members from 2005 to 2020. In 2014, the offender, the victim and the victim's brother were sleeping in the same room at home. The offender slept on the lower deck of a bunk bed, and the victim on a pull-out bed next to him. One night, the victim woke up when she felt her uncle carrying her. He placed her face-down on his bed. He then removed her clothes and molested her. After he was done, he cleaned the victim's body with a towel, put her clothes back on and placed her back on her bed. The victim did not consent to the acts, said the prosecution. She pretended to be asleep the whole time as she was afraid of her uncle. He continued to outrage her modesty in a similar manner over the years, carrying her to his bed while she feigned sleep as she was afraid. On one occasion in 2017, he carried the victim to his room from the bed she was sharing with her grandmother. The victim woke up when he entered the room, but her grandmother was asleep and unaware. These acts only came to light in 2020, when the victim's stepfather confronted her about some messages she had sent to her ex-boyfriend. The victim then tearfully revealed what her uncle had done to her, and was brought to make a police report. The offender stopped the acts in 2017, when the victim started menstruating. The prosecution said the victim's relationship with her uncle improved in 2019, and she ""stopped resenting him as much"". The defence urged the court to call for a probation suitability report, arguing that the offender was very young when the offences started and ignorant of the law then. The defence also highlighted that the offender stopped the acts of his own accord, and not because he had been caught. He cooperated fully with investigations and volunteered details that were not part of the allegations initially made against him, added the lawyer. The prosecution did not object to the calling of a probation suitability report. For each count of outraging the modesty of a minor, the man could be jailed up to five years, fined, caned or sentenced to any combination of these punishments."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/boon-lay-drive-attack-suspects-car-park-crime-scene-police-2616101,Suspects in Boon Lay Drive slashing incident taken back to car park where attack happened,"SINGAPORE: Two men suspected of slashing two other men at Boon Lay Drive were escorted by police officers to the crime scene on Friday (Apr 8). Dressed in white tops and blue shorts, the men were taken separately to a car park that was cordoned off. They also walked to a hair salon at Block 175 Boon Lay Drive and to two nearby parks. Plain clothes police officers flanked the men, asking them questions as they walked about the area. At the car park, the suspects were stopped for some time at an area where there looked like blood stains on the ground.  Residents in the area gathered to watch and took photos as the officers led the men around the area. The duo, aged 19 and 20, were arrested on Thursday afternoon after a one-day manhunt. They had allegedly injured two other men, aged 22 and 23, at the Boon Lay Drive car park. The Singapore Police Force (SPF) had received a call for help at Block 175 Boon Lay Drive at about 5.02pm on Wednesday. SPF said that the two suspects were arrested on Thursday at about 4.05pm at Woodlands Street 12.  Preliminary investigations revealed that the two suspects were known to the victims. The two suspects will be charged in court on Saturday with two counts of voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons. Videos circulating on social media show two men wielding what appear to be long-bladed weapons at a car park. In the video, the men pace back and forth, and are later seen running away from the scene, still holding the weapons. The video also shows one of the victims with what looks like blood running down his face as he is attended to by another man. This is the latest in a spate of incidents where men wielding blades have posed a threat in public. On Mar 23, a 64-year-old man armed with a knife died after he was shot in the chest by the police. A week earlier, a 37-year-old man with a sword was captured on video at Buangkok Crescent, swinging it at a pedestrian and hitting passing cars. Also in March, a 27-year-old man was charged with throwing a ""watermelon knife"" at a police officer in Bukit Batok. There have been about 150 cases of knife-related crimes recorded annually over the past five years, and this number has remained ""relatively constant"", the Minister of State for Home Affairs Desmond Tan said in Parliament on Monday."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/andy-wong-ming-jun-obscene-photos-videos-telegram-chat-group-2615781,"Author of Nikkei Asia article about KTV COVID-19 cluster fined for having obscene videos, photos","SINGAPORE: A man was fined S$42,000 on Friday (Apr 8) for possessing more than 4,200 obscene videos and photos. Wong Ming Jun, also known as Andy Wong, 28, had pleaded guilty to three charges of possessing obscene materials, with another eight similar charges considered for sentencing. Wong was the author of an opinion piece in Nikkei Asia that criticised the Government's handling of KTV lounges amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The piece was published in July last year, at the height of the infections linked to KTV lounges around the country. It drew a point-by-point rebuttal from the Ministry of Home Affairs, which called it ""full of inaccuracies"". Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam questioned Wong's motive at the time, saying: ""We are left to wonder if the criminal investigation against him was the reason for his diatribe based on falsehoods; and the extent to which he was doing a political hack job."" The offences dealt with on Friday were related to Wong's membership in a Telegram chat group which he joined in November 2018. The chat group was linked to local forum Sammy Boy Forum, where users discuss pornography and other matters of a sexual nature, said the prosecution. Police were alerted to the chat group on Oct 24, 2019, when a woman informed them that members shared lewd and indecent photos of girls in it and that it had more than 24,000 members. Wong was arrested in his home on Nov 6, 2019, and his laptop and mobile phone were seized. Police found more than 4,200 obscene videos and photos spread across these devices and thumb drives. Among them were about 2,200 obscene videos in Wong's mobile phone, which he had downloaded from the Internet. There were also around 1,400 photos in his mobile phone, including photos that Wong took of himself, his friends and his partners. Wong kept all these materials for his personal consumption and did not display or transmit them to others, said the prosecution. The prosecutor sought a fine of S$42,000 to S$42,500, while the defence asked for a fine of not more than S$27,500. The defence contended that the criminal proceedings had caused Wong mental anguish and affected his career prospects. The court heard that Wong is now a container prime mover driver. He had identified himself as a political and business intelligence analyst in the Nikkei Asia piece. The judge rejected this argument, making reference to an opinion piece for TODAY in which Wong described his new career as a blue-collar worker as ""fulfilling and productive"". He added that any impact to Wong's career was a natural consequence of his own actions. He also disagreed that negative media coverage was a mitigating factor when deciding on sentence. The judge agreed that Wong's offences did not warrant a jail term as he had kept the obscene materials for his own consumption. Wong is the last of four men, all members of the Telegram chat group, to be dealt with. His three co-accused Tan Yeow Chong, Lincoln Anthony Fernandez and Yee Wing Kay were earlier jailed and fined."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-jailed-cheating-falsifying-trainer-wda-2615766,"Man jailed for falsifying course records to cheat more than S$72,000 in training grants","SINGAPORE: A trainer was sentenced to 20 weeks’ jail on Friday (Apr 8) for falsifying course records to cheat more than S$72,000 in training grants. Marsh Terranova Tiruchellam, 54, was convicted on Dec 17 last year of three charges of falsifying attendance records to cheat then Workforce Development Agency (WDA) into believing that he had conducted courses, SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) said in a press release. Three similar charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. Marsh was a trainer at Loyal Reliance, a training provider engaged to conduct courses for employees of Yoke Mah Plasterceil. Between July 2014 and November 2014, he falsified six attendance records, which showed that employees of Yoke Mah Plasterceil had attained full attendance for courses, although he did not conduct them. He is the last of five individuals sentenced for this case, said SSG. The four others were sentenced to jail terms ranging from 11 weeks to 29 months, said SSG. The agency added that it takes a “serious view of any individual or organisation that defrauds or abuses SSG funding”. “Their actions undermine the work of many others who dedicate their career and businesses to delivering proper, high quality adult education to Singaporeans,” said SSG, adding that it will not hesitate to take action against those found contravening its funding terms and conditions."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-throw-wine-bottle-kill-man-religious-hostility-condo-2615671,Jail for man who threw wine bottle that killed 73-year-old man in act of 'religious hostility',"SINGAPORE: A man who threw a wine bottle at a group of people from two floors above, striking and killing a 73-year-old man, was sentenced to five years and six months' jail on Friday (Apr 8). Andrew Gosling, 49, told police that he wanted to startle the group, who were from the Malay-Muslim community. He pleaded guilty in February to two charges of causing death by a rash act and causing grievous hurt by a rash act. Principal District Judge Victor Yeo said Gosling's actions could be viewed as demonstrating ""religious hostility"" towards the group and that he must be firmly dealt with. He was sentenced to four years' jail for causing death by a rash act, and one year and six months' jail for causing grievous hurt by a rash act. The sentences were ordered to run consecutively. On Aug 18, 2019, Gosling, an Australian national, drank beer with an acquaintance at lunch, before having two more bottles of beer at dinner. He drank another can of beer when he reached his apartment on the seventh floor of Spottiswoode 18 condominium in Tanjong Pagar. The group was having a barbecue by the swimming pool on the fifth floor of the condominium. Gosling identified them as being from the Malay-Muslim community, as there were women wearing headscarves, the court heard previously. The elderly victim was part of the group. Sometime after 8pm, he went to the rubbish chute at the lift lobby of the seventh floor, where he found an empty wine bottle about 30cm long. Gosling threw the bottle at the group from the seventh floor. He also shouted religiously charged vulgarities before running back to his apartment. The bottle struck the victim on his head, before ricocheting and hitting his wife on the shoulder. The elderly victim collapsed to the ground and was unconscious. He suffered multiple skull fractures and extensive bleeding in his brain and died the next morning. The cause of death was determined to be head injuries. Gosling admitted during police investigations that he had thought of using a weapon such as a gun to shoot the group, but dismissed this as a ""heinous act"". The court had also heard that he was ""angry and upset"" at attacks committed by fundamentalist groups in Bali and Melbourne that had killed Australian citizens. Gosling was assessed by a psychiatrist from the Institute of Mental Health and found to have been intoxicated around the time of the offence.  He has a past history of anxiety disorder, but no contributory link was found between his mental condition and the offence, the court heard previously. A second report issued jointly with the defence's psychiatrist stated that Gosling was inebriated, but that the amount of alcohol was within his usual limits and not enough to remove his culpability for the offence. The level of alcohol did contribute to the offence, the report stated, and Gosling experienced some impairment of judgment, but this did not affect his soundness of mind. According to the report, he was prone to having ""obsessive"" negative thoughts in relation to Muslims when he was intoxicated, but this did not reflect his true feelings. ""Preserving and building inter-religious harmony in Singapore is sacrosanct and this could have a wider impact of causing unease among the broader Muslim community,"" said the judge. It was necessary for the sentence imposed to dispel the unease and disquiet that could emanate from the offence, he said. The judge also gave weight to the emotional and economic impact of Gosling's actions on the victim's wife to assess the ancillary harm caused. The 69-year-old woman was also injured when the bottle hit her shoulder. She had been married to her husband for 45 years, and had four children with him, but was now living alone. Before his death, the victim worked as a van driver for a delivery company and would give his wife S$600 for monthly expenses. At an earlier hearing, the court heard that the widow felt a big loss, and even more so during the fasting month and family gatherings. She also suffered flashbacks of the incident, the judge said. The victim's family was present at the hearing in the State Courts on Friday. After the sentence, the victim's wife told reporters that she had no comment on the sentence and that ""it's fate"". Her son told reporters: ""It's hard to forgive, only time will heal this."" For causing death by a rash act, Gosling could have been jailed up to five years, fined or both. For causing grievous hurt by a rash act, he could have been jailed up to four years, fined up to S$10,000 or both. Court records show Gosling has filed an appeal against the sentence."

In the latest charge, Lulu Lim Beng Kim allegedly deceived a financial institution into believing that the consolidated financial statements for Agritrade International and its subsidiary companies for 2016 were audited. She knew this to be false, said the police in a news release.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/saf-yacht-club-receptionist-steal-money-jail-2613991,"Receptionist jailed for stealing S$6,800 from SAF Yacht Club","SINGAPORE: A woman was jailed 15 months on Thursday (Apr 7) for stealing about S$6,800 while working as a receptionist at the SAF Yacht Club, using the money for her household expenses and financial obligations. Jai Chithra Sunmugvale, 42, also signed an agreement and collected S$1,200 in rent on behalf of her sister-in-law when she was not authorised to do so. She pleaded guilty to two charges of criminal breach of trust and cheating, and was sentenced to an additional 50 days' jail as she committed one of the offences while under a remission order. Two more charges were considered for sentencing. These were for lying to the human resources manager of the SAF Yacht Club that she had no criminal record, and for stealing another S$350 from her sister-in-law. The court heard that Jai Chithra was hired to work at the SAF Yacht Club in October 2020. Her role involved manning the company's front desk, receiving cash payments and storing them in a safe at the end of the day. On Nov 29, 2020, she accepted about S$235 in cash from a customer as payment for a power boat licence course. However, she kept the money and did not update the participant list for this course to include the customer. After ending work that day, Jai Chithra also retrieved S$6,635 from the cash register and took it home. The theft was discovered the next day when her colleague found that cash was missing from the safe. The colleague asked Jai Chithra where the money was, and she admitted to taking it. The court also heard that in December 2020, Jai Chithra was helping her 39-year-old sister-in-law look for a new flat to buy. The sister-in-law believed Jai Chithra was more experienced with such matters, so they agreed that she would handle certain affairs related to the purchase. However, the sister-in-law never authorised Chithra to sign any agreement or collect any rent on her behalf, said the prosecutor. The sister-in-law found a flat and signed an option to purchase it in December 2020. In April 2021, the seller said that she would need more time to look for another flat to move into. Jai Chithra met with the property agent to discuss this, and told the agent that the seller could continue staying in the flat for S$1,200, but only if S$1,000 was first transferred to her. The seller did so. Jai Chithra also signed a document prepared by the agent, which purportedly agreed to an extension of the seller's stay in the flat. The parties named in the agreement were the seller and Jai Chithra's sister-in-law. During a scheduled inspection of the flat on May 29 last year, Jai Chithra met the seller and received the outstanding S$200 in rent. She took the cash and issued a handwritten receipt that she signed in her sister-in-law's name. The sister-in-law made a police report in August after being informed of these events by the property agent. Jai Chithra has since made restitution to her sister-in-law, while no recovery or restitution was made for the theft from SAF Yacht Club. The prosecution noted that Jai Chithra's theft was committed in an amateurish and opportunistic fashion, but said that she was unremorseful and gave ""spurious defences"" after her offences were discovered. He also argued for a longer sentence as Jai Chithra had prior convictions for similar offences. She was previously given nine months' jail for criminal breach of trust in 2018. Jai Chithra, who conducted her own defence, appeared to be crying and sniffling as she told the judge that she was sorry for her actions. She asked for a lighter sentence to be reunited sooner with her three-year-old toddler, who was in the care of her elderly mother. ""During this period in remand I realise that being away from my child is a more excruciating punishment,"" she said. District Judge Lee Lit Cheng said Jai Chithra was a recalcitrant offender whose string of previous convictions demonstrated her persistence in offending and disregard for the law. The prosecution applied for a compensation order for the money stolen from SAF Yacht Club, but the judge did not order this as Jai Chithra said she did not have the financial means to pay."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/shawn-tan-jia-jun-punch-kick-pregnant-girlfriend-jail-fine-2613586,"Man who assaulted pregnant girlfriend gets jail after appeal judge sets aside 'inadequate' S$3,500 fine","SINGAPORE: A man who assaulted his pregnant girlfriend was given a two-week jail term on Thursday (Apr 7) after the prosecution successfully appealed against his earlier S$3,500 fine. Shawn Tan Jia Jun, 24, punched and kicked his girlfriend in the abdomen and hit her in the face in July 2020, when she was nine weeks pregnant. The foetus was fine after the attack, and the victim later had an abortion. A High Court judge set aside the earlier fine given by a district court, saying that it was ""manifestly inadequate"" in the face of Tan's ""sustained and vicious act of violence"" against a vulnerable victim. Tan previously pleaded guilty to a single charge of voluntarily causing hurt and was fined in October last year. He had attacked his girlfriend during a dispute about the pregnancy. The High Court judge agreed with the prosecution that the district judge failed to consider Tan's multiple blows to the victim and the potential harm to the foetus, and erred in deciding that the victim's forgiveness justified a fine instead of imprisonment. The district judge had relied on the victim's forgiveness of Tan as seen in a letter she wrote to the court as well as her decision to marry him. The High Court heard on Thursday that the couple still intend to marry, but have been waiting for the appeal process to conclude. Delivering his judgment, Justice Vincent Hoong said that the forgiveness of a victim does not ordinarily affect the sentence imposed on an offender except in two exceptional situations. This is when the sentence would aggravate the victim's distress, and when the victim's forgiveness provides evidence that her suffering as a result of the offence ""must be very much less than would normally be the case"". Justice Hoong disagreed that Tan's case fell into these exceptions. He said there was insufficient evidence that the two-week jail term sought by the prosecution would aggravate the victim's distress. ""The main tenor of the victim's letter was to express her belief in (Tan's) capacity for change. It went no further than to demonstrate her forgiveness and concern for him,"" said the judge. He rejected an argument by Tan's lawyers that the victim's concern that the sentence imposed on Tan might ""significantly hurt"" the planning of their future together, which she expressed in her letter, meant she did not want him to be jailed. He also ruled that Tan's case did not fall into the second exception, which only applied to a limited range of offences. ""To err is human, to forgive divine. In the eyes of the law, however, forgiveness is often eclipsed by the strong societal interests in punishing offenders for the crimes they have committed,"" said Justice Hoong. In sentencing the fine, the district judge had also noted that the victim's injuries were minor, and the attack was an impulsive and singular event during a heated argument, rather than part of a pattern of violence. After the attack, the victim sought treatment on the same day for facial, chest and abdominal pain and bruises on her limbs. She was diagnosed with a facial contusion and redness over her face, and discharged with a day's medical leave. Justice Hoong agreed that Tan's violent outburst arose out of a heated argument and was ""unplanned and out of character"". He noted that the couple faced a stressful decision about whether to terminate the pregnancy, though this did not legitimise Tan's use of violence. However, he said the lower court failed to consider factors that enhanced Tan's culpability, namely the sustained nature of Tan's assault, the potential harm to the foetus and the victim's physical vulnerability. Tan's use of violence was a ""wholly disproportionate"" response, and the medical report made it clear that he had inflicted more extensive injuries to the victim's body, including her chest, spine and limbs, said the judge. Moreover, Tan ""did not merely deliver a one-off blow, but instead engaged in a continuous and persistent assault against the victim, with each strike delivered with the intention to cause hurt to her"", said Justice Hoong. The judge said it was crucial that Tan did not cease assaulting the victim of his own accord, but only stopped after his mother heard the commotion and intervened. It was ""unconscionable"" that he now sought to downplay the protracted nature and violence of his attack. ""This raises a doubt as to whether he is truly as remorseful as he claims in his letter tendered to the court,"" said Justice Hoong. The judge also found that the victim had an additional dimension of vulnerability unique to pregnant victims, namely ""the emotional distress arising out of the fear for the potential loss of their unborn child"". Justice Hoong concluded that a jail term was ""unquestionably warranted"" by Tan's offences, to send an unequivocal message to would-be offenders that such behaviour is unacceptable. Turning to address the offender, the judge added that Tan was still young and had a long road ahead of him. ""He has expressed a positive desire to change for the better, and I hope that he will learn from this unfortunate experience and become a better person, not only for himself but also for the victim whom he is to marry,"" said Justice Hoong. Tan will start serving his sentence later this month after a deferment was granted as he recently started a new job."

After receiving photos from a 13-year-old victim, he tried to blackmail her into having sex with him by threatening to post her nude photos online. The girl told her mother and made a police report. Adrian Tan Jun Jie, 25, was sentenced to 42 months' jail on Thursday (Apr 7). He pleaded guilty to 11 charges, with another 26 charges considered for sentencing. His victims cannot be named as they are protected by gag order. The court heard that Tan started browsing Instagram to look for attractive women in October 2017. His method involved getting a victim's email address from her Instagram profile and emailing her a job offer while posing as ""Audrey"", a fake female persona he created. The influencer job purportedly paid S$25 to S$50 a day and involved the girls taking photos in clothes that would be mailed to them. If anyone expressed interest, Tan would move the conversation to the Line app and continue posing as ""Audrey"" to obtain selfies from the girl. He would then ask for more revealing photos of the victims, such as in her underwear, to assess her suitability for the job. Tan made up different excuses for the revealing photos, telling one victim he had an app that could extract body measurements from pictures. He also told victims he needed nude photos to assess how confident they were, and that there was stiff competition for the job. When victims became uncomfortable with the requests and stopped contacting ""Audrey"", Tan would try to persuade them by telling them they were near the final stage of the competition. Tan coached the girls on how to take photos, directing one 12-year-old victim on how to take clearer nude photos of herself. He also asked a 16-year-old victim to take a video of herself ""brushing her teeth in the toilet in a seductive manner"". When the 16-year-old victim grew suspicious and stopped contacting ""Audrey"", Tan posed as the husband of ""Audrey"" and told the victim that his wife was stressed about losing her job as the victim had stopped contacting her. He added that ""Audrey"" was pregnant and the stress may affect her pregnancy. The victim then started messaging ""Audrey"" again as she did not want ""Audrey"" to lose her job.  Through this deception, in 2018, Tan obtained about 200 photos from 10 of his victims showing them nude or in their underwear. In May 2018, Tan took his ruse further after receiving photographs from a 13-year-old victim who exposed her breasts and underwear. He gave the victim his actual phone number, claiming that this belonged to a male assistant ""JJ"". This was another fake persona taken on by Tan. While posing as ""Audrey"", Tan told the victim that ""JJ"" would perform sexual acts on her and instructed the victim to contact him. The victim did as she was told. ""JJ"" started to demand that the victim meet him for sex. He also demanded that the victim secretly take a video of one of her female classmates changing in the toilet, but the victim declined to do so. After the victim refused the requests, Tan threatened to send her nude photos to her school and circulate them online. Out of fear, the victim then agreed to have sex with ""JJ"". When the victim told her mother about these threats, she was brought to make a police report. Tan knew he was wrong to pressure the victim for nude photos and sex, but did so despite knowing she was underage because ""he could not resist the temptation and wanted to feel the pleasure"", said the prosecution. Deputy Public Prosecutor Hidayat Amir sought a jail term of 40 to 49 months, citing Tan's significant level of premeditation through his ""complex scheme"" and strong public interest in deterring predatory conduct online. ""The accused hid behind the veil of anonymity through the Internet and pretended to be a female employer ... It is clear that the accused's offences could not have been carried out with the Internet,"" said the prosecutor. The defence lawyer asked for between 27 and 31 months' jail, saying that Tan was remorseful, had made an early plea of guilty and cooperated with investigations. In sentencing, the judge highlighted the high number of victims involved, Tan's elaborate scheme and his abuse of the victims' trust, as he had befriended them and won their confidence through his ruse."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ponzi-job-scam-movie-trailer-police-arrest-man-2612646,Man arrested for Ponzi-like job scam involving watching movie trailers for money,"SINGAPORE: A 29-year-old man has been arrested for his suspected involvement in Ponzi-like job scams that involved the earning of commission by viewing movie trailers, the police said on Wednesday (Apr 6). The police were informed on Mar 30 of an emerging job scam platform called “Moviitech”, where job seekers received unsolicited messages on Telegram, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube or came across online advertisements promoting lucrative and easy money-making opportunities, said the police in a news release. The job scam portal was purported to be an online platform where users would be paid to watch movie trailers, with job seekers able to increase their earnings by recruiting more people to participate on the platform. Job seekers would be required to register a free account and purchase a membership plan, ranging from S$65 to S$450, before they would start earning commissions by watching movie trailers. The transactions would be performed in the form of bank transfers, police said. Initially, the job seekers would be convinced that it was a legitimate job as they would receive commissions and profit during the early stages of their memberships. However, they would later realise they were scammed when they did not receive further commissions or were unable to make withdrawals from their member accounts. During an island-wide operation from Apr 1 to Apr 5, the Commercial Affairs Department arrested the suspect and identified three other men, aged between 18 and 41, who are currently assisting investigations for their suspected involvement in the scams. Preliminary investigations indicate that the bogus company was running Ponzi-like schemes using multi-level marketing strategies, police said. The four men are believed to have facilitated the schemes by advertising and recruiting potential job seekers as members, as well as providing bank accounts to facilitate the transfer of illicit funds. Further investigations are ongoing. Those found guilty of by false representation of position not connected with contracts for goods and services under Section 424A of the Penal Code 1871 may be jailed for up to 20 years, fined, or both. The offence of aiding the commission of fraud carries a jail term of up to 10 years and a fine. Police cautioned job seekers to be wary of online job advertisements that promise the convenience of working from home and being paid a high salary for relatively simple job responsibilities. “Legitimate businesses will not require job seekers to make upfront payments to secure job offers and earn commissions. These acts are common ruses used by scammers to lure individuals into participating in their schemes or scams,” police said. To avoid becoming involved in money laundering activities, members of the public should always reject requests to use their personal bank or cryptocurrency accounts to receive and transfer money for others, police added. Members of the public are also advised to adopt the following precautionary measures: Anyone with information on such scams may call the Police hotline at 1800-255-0000 or submit information online at www.police.gov.sg/iwitness. All information will be kept strictly confidential."

In response to a CNA query, the police said that they had received a call for assistance at Block 175 Boon Lay Drive at about 5.02pm on Wednesday. Two men had injured two other men, aged 22 and 23, with weapons. The victims were conscious when taken to hospital. In videos and images seen by CNA, the two men with weapons can be seen wielding what appear to be long-bladed weapons at a car park. A female voice is heard, shouting that she had called the police, while the men pace back and forth. The men are then seen running away from the scene, still holding the weapons. One of the victims appears to have blood running down his face as he is attended to by another man. ""Preliminary investigations revealed that the duo involved are known to the two victims. A manhunt operation is underway to track down the two men involved,"" said the police.  ""The police will not tolerate brazen acts of violence and blatant disregard of the law. We will spare no effort to apprehend offenders and deal with them in accordance with the law."" The police reminded the public that harbouring fugitives is a serious offence which is punishable with imprisonment and fine. Police investigations are ongoing. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-molest-women-feet-pretend-charity-tinder-date-outrage-modesty-2611186,"Serial offender made up charity ruse to molest women's feet, gets jail","SINGAPORE: A 28-year-old woman was left traumatised on her first Tinder date when the man made up an excuse to take photos of her feet and started molesting them at MacRitchie Reservoir. He later insisted she meet him again, turning aggressive and threatening her when she grew uncomfortable and asked for the photos that he took of her. The man, Tan Boon Hwee, 32, was jailed for two weeks and five days on Wednesday (Apr 6) after admitting to two counts of outrage of modesty. Another charge under the Protection from Harassment Act was considered for sentencing. The identities of Tan's two victims are protected by gag order. Aside from the woman he met on Tinder, Tan also molested the feet of an 18-year-old store assistant. The court heard that the first victim agreed to go out on a date with Tan, who went by another name on the Tinder dating app, on Jul 16, 2017. They were seated on a bench near the reservoir when Tan, who is unemployed, told her he was part of a charity known as the ""Barefoot Walking Society"". He asked if he could take photos of the victim's feet. When she pressed for more details about the society, he said it was a ""low key"" organisation and insisted it was genuine, showing her other photos he had taken of women's feet. ""In actuality, the accused was sexually aroused by feet and wanted an opportunity to sexually touch and photograph (the victim's) feet,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutor Chong Kee En. The victim believed Tan, and he began to pretend to adjust her feet to take the photo. He used the opportunity to ""slowly touch and caress the soles of her feet"" and rub the tips of her toes. He also commented on how ""cute"" the victim's toes were and asked if she worked out, stated court documents. This went on for five minutes. The victim started to feel uncomfortable and disgusted and asked Tan to stop. He did so, but then began to question the victim on her relationships with men. He also jabbed her in the waist and asked if she was afraid of being tickled. The victim moved away and told Tan to stop as she was feeling uncomfortable. She told him that she saw him as a friend and went home. After she had reached home, Tan began to message her repeatedly. She agreed to meet him again at his insistence, but Tan asked her: ""How many guys have you said the same thing to?"" He turned aggressive after she told him he was her first Tinder date, and lambasted and threatened her when she asked for the photos that he had taken. ""She tried to apologise to him even though she did nothing wrong and to cordially end her conversations with him, but he started to scold and threaten her on WhatsApp and via SMS,"" said the prosecutor. The victim called the police as she was afraid that Tan knew where she worked, but she was unable to provide sufficient details for a report. Nearly two years later, Tan was separately fined S$8,000 in January 2019 after committing five counts of outrage of modesty. After his case was reported in the papers, the victim made a police report as she realised that her modesty had also been outraged. Tan also lied to his second victim, a store assistant, that he was taking photographs of feet for charitable purposes. On Mar 27, 2019, Tan walked into the store where the victim worked and falsely introduced himself as being from the People's Association. He said he was carrying out an activity where people would write inspiring quotes on the soles of their feet and take photos of them to form a collage. Tan invited the victim to participate and she agreed, believing it to be a ""positive movement"", said the prosecutor. Tan then put a toe ring on the victim's toe, wrote ""may your feet take you where you (sic) heart wants to go"" and drew smiley faces on each of her toes. These were so he could pretend that the photo-taking was for charitable purposes, and have the opportunity to touch her feet even more, said the prosecutor. For 10 minutes, as Tan photographed the victim's feet, he ""slowly and constantly"" touched and pushed together her soles and toes. After taking the photos, Tan grabbed the victim's hand at least three times to shake it. Each time, he would slowly talk while caressing her hand, said the prosecutor. Tan then asked for the victim's email so that he could send her a photo of the so-called charitable activity. The victim felt very uncomfortable during the encounter and did an online search for Tan's name. She found out about his earlier 2019 conviction and made a police report. The prosecution sought a jail term for Tan on the basis of his premeditation and ""elaborate deception"", as well as his highly relevant previous offences. Apart from his 2019 conviction, Tan previously committed two counts of outrage of modesty against women, which were compounded in 2014. Tan repeated the same ploy of helping out a charity in the present offences, and even used photos of women's feet taken in the course of previous offences to convince the first victim, argued the prosecutor. Tan's charge under the Protection from Harassment Act also revealed his ""problematic attitude towards women"", said Mr Chong. ""Not only did he fail to respect their physical boundaries, he also displayed a rabid misogynistic streak towards (the victim) when she declined to reciprocate his advances,"" said the prosecutor. ""The accused's deception as 'charity' preys on his victims' kindness or generosity. It preys on women's fear of being seen as rude or abrasive, even to strangers. It makes a mockery of those involved in legitimate charitable activities."" In mitigation, Tan's defence lawyer asked the court to call for an assessment of his suitability for a mandatory treatment order, which directs an offender suffering from certain treatable psychiatric conditions to undergo psychiatric treatment. The prosecution replied that there were differing opinions from psychiatrists on whether Tan suffers from a fetishistic disorder and added that Tan appeared to comply poorly with follow-up treatment, which explained his repeated offending. For each count of outrage of modesty, Tan could have been jailed up to two years, fined, caned or any combination of these punishments."

""Members of the public and businesses are advised to take the prevailing safe management measures seriously,"" said police. ""The police have zero tolerance for irresponsible behavior relating to the flouting of these measures and offenders will be dealt with firmly in accordance with the law. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-stalk-wife-spy-surveillance-app-phone-hack-social-media-2608811,"Jail for man who installed spy app on wife's phone, hacked her social media accounts","SINGAPORE: After constant arguments with his wife, a man secretly installed a surveillance app on her phone to monitor her social media activity, calls and messages. Nicholas Wang Weichou, 30, used the app to hack into his wife's social media accounts and sent her threatening messages after doing so. The Singaporean was sentenced on Tuesday (Apr 5) to five months and two weeks' jail, the sentence sought by the prosecution. He pleaded guilty to one charge of unlawful stalking and two unrelated charges under the Moneylenders Act. Five other charges were considered for sentencing. The court heard that Wang and his 33-year-old wife found themselves on bad terms in August 2020, about two years after marrying each other. Around that time, Wang came across an app while researching hacking-related software. He bought it for a monthly fee of about S$108, paying to use it for two months. He installed the app on his wife's phone when she left it unattended during a nap and started using it to monitor her actions in August 2020. The app allowed Wang to access all of his wife's social media messages, voice recordings and call logs. He could listen to whatever she said ""live"", and could turn on the phone's camera without her knowledge to monitor her actions. On Sep 6, 2020, Wang and his wife quarrelled after she removed him from his company's Facebook page, which she said was an accident. Wang's wife posted about their quarrel on Facebook, which made him unhappy. He used the spy app to access her social media accounts and deleted the post. He also created a private Facebook post attaching screenshots of his conversations with his wife. After that, he sent her several messages to check her Facebook account, telling her ""good luck"" and threatening her to ""try me"". Wang's wife was alarmed and distressed to see a Facebook post that she had not created, and deleted it immediately. She also tried contacting friends for help. Wang then sent her another threatening message: ""Don't need tell ppl I hack your account. Nobody can help you. Till you admit what u done."" Immediately after that, he use the spy app to change her Facebook and Instagram account passwords. He also changed her email passwords to prevent her from performing password recovery. The victim was unable to access her social media and email accounts after that. She made a police report on Sep 8, 2020. After learning of the police report, Wang threw away the phone he had used to access the app on his wife's phone. He also returned her social media and email accounts to her. The prosecution highlighted the sophistication of Wang's offences, as he had used technology and software to spy on his wife without her knowledge. The level of intrusion was very high, with Wang using the app to ""surveil the victim's most intimate actions, conversations, and movements at all times"", said Deputy Public Prosecutor Dwayne Lum. Wang also destroyed evidence, which was an obstruction of justice, said the prosecutor. For unlawfully stalking another person, Wang could have been jailed up to 12 months, fined up to S$5,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-murder-9-month-old-baby-yishun-car-park-van-trial-2608451,Man on trial for murdering girlfriend's 9-month-old son claims baby fidgeted and fell from his arm,"SINGAPORE: A man accused of murdering his girlfriend's nine-month-old son by inflicting blunt force trauma to the baby's head went on trial at the High Court on Tuesday (Apr 5). Mohamed Aliff Mohamed Yusoff, 29, is contesting one charge of murder under Section 300(c) of the Penal Code. If convicted, he could be sentenced to death or to life imprisonment with caning. The victim, Izz Fayyaz Zayani Ahmad, was pronounced dead at the National University Hospital accident and emergency section in the early morning of Nov 8, 2019. The police were alerted to the case shortly after. The prosecution's case is that Aliff inflicted blunt force trauma to Izz's head at a car park in Yishun, intending to cause traumatic head injuries that led to the baby's death. Deputy Public Prosecutors Han Ming Kuang and Lim Shin Hui will lead evidence from 55 witnesses to prove the offence of murder. Several police witnesses took the stand on the opening day of trial. The victim's mother is set to testify that Aliff told her they should give the hospital a consistent version of events that Izz hurt himself when he fell from Aliff's arm. The accused is represented by defence lawyers Mr Kanagavijayan Nadarajan and Mr Stephen Wong. Izz's mother, Ms Nadiah Abdul Jalil, was Aliff's girlfriend. The couple got to know each other online in 2017 or 2018 and became romantically involved in September or October 2019. Izz was Ms Nadiah's son from her previous marriage. On Nov 7, 2019, Aliff, Ms Nadiah and her brother bought a van for their delivery business. That evening, Aliff used the van to drive Ms Nadiah and Izz to dinner at Wisteria Mall. At the restaurant, Izz accidentally spilt Ms Nadiah's drink and was taken away by Aliff to be cleaned up. According to the prosecution, Ms Nadiah and Aliff had a disagreement over how Izz should be disciplined for this. After dinner, they headed to Ms Nadiah's mother's flat. Along the way, Aliff volunteered to take care of Izz that night and bring the baby to his place in Yishun. Ms Nadiah agreed as her mother would not be able to look after Izz while she was at work the next day. She also planned to stay over at her brother's flat that night as it was nearer to her workplace. They arrived at their destination sometime after 9pm and Ms Nadiah went upstairs to get her belongings. She packed a baby bag for Izz, which she passed to Aliff, and hired a car to her brother's flat in Jurong East. The accused gave police his account of what happened next, up to the time he met Ms Nadiah again later that night. According to Aliff, he drove to a multi-storey car park at Yishun Street 81 and parked there at about 10.10pm. Izz was in the front passenger seat during the journey. At the car park, Aliff sent a text message to his father to say that he intended to bring Izz home, but was told it was not a convenient time. Aliff told police that he brought Izz to the rear cabin of the van, and that the baby was seated on the cabin floor near to the right sliding door. He left Izz in the van and locked it. He then went to a nearby supermarket and bought some items at about 11.05pm. Aliff told police that when he returned to the van, he opened the sliding door on the right side of the van. The prosecution's case is that Aliff caused the injuries that led to Izz's death sometime after returning to the van from the supermarket. After returning to the van, Aliff called Ms Nadiah several times but she did not pick up. When she returned his call close to midnight on Nov 8, 2019, Aliff asked to meet her as he had something to tell her. Aliff and Ms Nadiah eventually met up in Jurong East. As Aliff drove the van off with his girlfriend in the front passenger seat, he held her hand and kept repeating that he did not want her to leave him. Aliff eventually stopped driving and went to the rear cabin of the van with Ms Nadiah. Izz was lying on his back on the floorboard of the rear cabin. Ms Nadiah put on a baby carrier, carried Izz and went back to the front passenger seat. While driving off, Aliff told Ms Nadiah that he had been carrying baby items with one hand and Izz with his other arm while trying to close the door of the van. Izz ""suddenly fidgeted and fell headfirst onto the floorboard of the van"", where he bounced and hit his head again on the van's footstep, before finally falling onto the car park floor, according to Aliff. Aliff told Ms Nadiah that if anyone asked what happened to Izz, she should tell them that the baby fell. He eventually agreed to take the baby to the hospital, but told her that they should convey this sequence of events: Ms Nadiah agreed to relate this sequence of events and Aliff drove to the National University Hospital. After parking the van and on the way to the A&E department, Aliff said he wanted to throw away one of his phones. Ms Nadiah sat with the victim at a food court while Aliff looked for a place to discard his phone. When Ms Nadiah started walking towards the A&E department, Aliff told her they should make a detour to the bus stop outside. Near the bus stop, he threw one of his phones into the bushes outside the A&E. They then went to the A&E ward, where Ms Nadiah fainted. Izz was handed over to medical staff and pronounced dead 10 minutes later, at 4.30am. When police arrived at the hospital shortly after 5am, Aliff told them the sequence of events that involved Izz struggling and falling. He said that he met up with Izz's mother after the baby's fall, and that they decided to bring Izz to the hospital after he lost consciousness. He also said that he gave Izz cardio-pulmonary resuscitation before they reached the hospital. Later that day, Aliff was taken to Woodlands Police Division headquarters to assist with investigations. He was eventually escorted to the Police Cantonment Complex and arrested there. The prosecution argued that Aliff ""behaved strangely"" after meeting Ms Nadiah later that night, driving around aimlessly and saying that he wanted to avoid road blocks. At one point, Ms Nadiah turned back and saw Izz lying on the floor of the van's rear cabin. She was shocked as she thought Izz was at Aliff's parent's flat in Yishun all along, according to the prosecution. ""The accused said Izz had passed away. When Nadiah carried Izz, she found that his neck was not flexible and his body temperature was cooler than usual. Izz was also unresponsive,"" said the prosecution. Ms Nadiah wanted to bring Izz to the hospital, but Aliff was allegedly undecided about this and continued driving, according to the prosecution. Aliff also allegedly suggested they should pay someone to bury Izz and report him as missing a year later. Ms Nadiah refused and insisted that Izz should be given a proper burial. The forensic pathologist who performed the autopsy concluded that the victim's cause of death was traumatic intracranial haemorrhage. He is set to testify that Izz's injuries were consistent with blunt force trauma to the head and face. Aliff does not suffer from any mental disorder or intellectual disability, and was not of unsound mind at the time of the incident, according to an Institute of Mental Health consultant. The trial continues."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-abuse-bus-driver-xenophobic-comments-neck-gaiter-trial-covid-19-2606621,Trial opens for man accused of abusing bus captain with xenophobic comments,"SINGAPORE: A man accused of verbally abusing a bus captain with xenophobic comments went on trial at the State Courts on Monday (Apr 4). Nimal De Silva, 44, is contesting a single charge of using insulting words against a public service worker under the Protection from Harassment Act. It was previously reported that the Singaporean pleaded guilty in September last year, but a district judge rejected the plea at the sentencing stage after she found that the defence was disputing the essence of the charge. De Silva, who is self-employed, was trying to board SBS Transit bus 196 at the bus stop opposite Nicoll Highway MRT station on Aug 19, 2020 when he allegedly got into a row with the driver. At the time, De Silva was wearing a neck gaiter to cover his mouth, and not a face mask. The driver, a 44-year-old Chinese national, was uncertain about whether this was in line with his company's policy on masks when onboard buses, and refused entry to De Silva. The driver then contacted the SBS Transit operation centre to seek clarification about the policy and gestured at De Silva to wear a face mask properly. ""Dissatisfied, the accused used the door cock button outside the bus to open the bus doors himself, and made his way onto the bus,"" stated court documents. De Silva began livestreaming the incident on Facebook Live and said to the driver: ""This is the problem when you have China people working in Singapore,"" and ""Speak English. You're not in China right now."" The dispute to be resolved at trial is whether these two sentences were insulting words, according to the prosecution. De Silva also uttered two other sentences that he admitted were insulting words: ""You are going to go down,"" followed by an expletive, and ""These bastards are basically ah, playing punk. Let's play punk together."" Throughout the row, the driver, who was not conversant in English, continued to verify with the SBS Transit operation centre whether De Silva's neck gaiter complied with the company's mask policy. He tried to get the operation centre to speak to De Silva, but was told that the centre would be calling for police assistance. He communicated this to De Silva and also repeatedly tried to explain that he was following his company's policy. According to video footage of the incident, at one point, another passenger could be heard offering De Silva a mask to resolve the issue. De Silva refused the offer, saying that he did not want to ""give in"". As a result of the situation, the victim was unable to continue the bus service and the other passengers had to alight. The Facebook Live video had been viewed at least 847,000 times and shared 8,900 times as of Aug 6, 2021, according to the prosecution. The incident prompted then Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung to call on members of the public to respect bus captains. He added that there is no excuse for anyone to physically or verbally abuse bus drivers.  Senior Minister of State for Transport Chee Hong Tat also affirmed in Parliament ""zero tolerance"" for any abuse of public transport workers. The trial continues. De Silva is represented by defence lawyers Luke Netto and Aylwyn Seto. Those who harass a public service worker can be jailed for up to one year, fined up to S$5,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/public-defenders-office-provide-criminal-legal-aid-k-shanmugam-2606361,Public Defender’s Office may be set up this year to provide criminal legal aid,"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Law aims to establish a Public Defender’s Office (PDO) by the end of this year, announced Law Minister K Shanmugam on Monday (Apr 4). This proposal comes after Mr Shanmugam said in 2020, while addressing the Parti Liyani case, that the Government would study the details and feasibility of a public defender scheme. Former domestic worker Ms Parti was found guilty of stealing from her employer, former Changi Airport Group chairman Liew Mun Leong. She was eventually acquitted after the High Court found several issues with the conviction and how the case was handled “We want to enhance access to justice for vulnerable individuals in Singapore,” said Mr Shanmugam, who is also the Home Affairs Minister. The PDO will be fully funded by the Government, he said, adding that the office will be established after a Bill on the matter has been passed in Parliament. “This will also help preserve the pro bono spirit of the legal fraternity, which has been a key pillar of legal aid,” said Mr Shanmugam. The Bill also proposes to expand criminal legal aid coverage in terms of income percentile and the types of offences covered. The income coverage of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme will be increased from the 25th to the 35th percentile of resident households, said Mr Shanmugam, raising the per capita household income cut-off from S$950 to S$1,500. “This means more needy Singaporeans who require the services of a criminal defence lawyer will be covered,” he said. Under the Law Ministry’s proposed changes, the type of offences under the criminal legal aid system will be expanded. But it will not cover regulatory offences like traffic summons and minor departmental charges. Offences under nine Acts that have the primary purpose of deterring specific behaviours will also not be covered. These include gambling and betting, organised and syndicated crime as well as terrorism. “Offences under these Acts bring about significant negative externalities to society. Public funding, I think it'll be difficult to justify being used towards such cases,” said Mr Shanmugam. With these proposed changes, the caseload for criminal legal aid could increase by 50 per cent or ""a little bit more"", said Mr Shanmugam, noting that the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme covered about 712 cases in 2020. This number could increase further if the take-up rate for legal aid increases, he added.  The PDO will be set up as a department under the Ministry of Law and will be headed by a Chief Public Defender. Singapore will adopt a “hybrid model” of criminal legal aid, which means that the PDO will have full-time lawyers as employees, who will take on cases as public defenders. The PDO will scale up over time, said Mr Shanmugam. While public defenders will take on all of the cases “in its early years”, the PDO will later start outsourcing some cases to a panel of qualified lawyers, he added. The Government will continue to work with and provide some co-funding to the existing Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, established in 1985, to deal with some criminal cases. Details of the funding have to be assessed and discussed, said Mr Shanmugam. “Other details will also have to be worked out, including cases which PDO will handle and cases which CLAS (Criminal Legal Aid Scheme) will handle.” The PDO will have the discretion to exclude cases if the Chief Public Defender thinks that representation “may not make a material difference” to the case’s outcome, said the minister. “They will have to apply a strong means test approach. This includes cases involving offences with established sentencing frameworks,” he added. In establishing a PDO in Singapore, the Government will need to minimise abuse of the system and manage costs to ensure fiscal sustainability, he added. The Government has studied criminal legal aid models in 11 jurisdictions, Mr Shanmugam noted. In systems where criminal legal aid is fully funded by the state, escalating costs are a major concern, and there are various reasons for the increase in costs, he added.  “They include the lack of a robust means and merits assessment framework and safeguards as the coverage expands invariably and inevitably. And second, overbilling by private lawyers to whom criminal cases have been outsourced to.” Some aid lawyers in other countries overbill and flout the rules for their own benefit, said Mr Shanmugam. There are also “unmeritorious applicants” who take advantage of legal aid, including people who are asset-rich or wealthy but find ways to meet the eligibility criteria, he added. In some cases, the applicants fulfil the means and merits tests, but are perceived to be morally undeserving of aid. “The first two categories of abuse, we can try and have systems and frameworks to try and detect and deter such practices. The last category is trickier,” said Mr Shanmugam. ""Legal aid cannot depend on public outrage, because once we categorise, and the means and merits tests are satisfied, and we are going to exclude certain types of cases. ""But as long as it falls within the categories of cases which will be covered by legal aid, and public outrage on a case by case basis cannot be the basis on which legal aid is given or not given. We will need to think through and explain our position carefully to the public.""  The Law Society Council and Criminal Bar were also concerned that the expansion of legal aid would affect the livelihood of lawyers who were providing paid legal services, he noted. “Of the newly eligible people who will benefit from expanded coverage, 60 per cent would likely be litigants-in-persons, meaning the impact on paid work for lawyers should not be substantial,” he added.  “We have to do the right thing here. Our assessment is that in the main, lawyers’ income should not substantially be affected and their income will not in the main depend on people at the 35th percentile and below."" "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/knife-related-crimes-relatively-constant-five-years-2606181,"Number of knife-related crimes over last 5 years remained 'relatively constant', a third occurred in residential areas: Desmond Tan","SINGAPORE: The number of knife-related crimes involving murder, robbery, rioting and serious hurt has remained ""relatively constant"" over the past five years, averaging about 150 cases annually, said Minister of State for Home Affairs Desmond Tan on Monday (Apr 4).  About 36 per cent of these crimes occurred in residential areas, and 3 per cent took place in educational institutions' premises. The remaining cases occurred in other public and commercial places, said Mr Tan in Parliament.  He was responding to parliamentary questions in light of recent sword and knife-related crimes.  In March, a 64-year-old man armed with a knife died after he was shot in the chest by the police. He had refused to drop his weapon despite multiple warnings and was tasered three times.  Last month, a 37-year-old man was charged after he was seen wielding a sword at Buangkok Crescent, swinging it at a pedestrian and hitting passing cars. In the same month, a 27-year-old man was charged with throwing a ""watermelon knife"" at a police officer in Bukit Batok. For urgent incidents, including those involving dangerous weapons, the police are generally able to respond within 15 minutes of the call, said Mr Tan. “The officers will use force, wherever necessary. This includes situations which require them to protect and save lives, including their own lives, and prevent the commission of an offence, and arrest subjects,” he added. “Where a person refuses to comply with police’s instructions and poses a threat to the lives of those around him, including the police officers, the officers may use lethal force to neutralise the threat.”  Where firearms have been used, the police psychological services department works with the unit’s leadership and para-counsellors to provide “stress management interventions” to support the officers involved.  MHA currently regulates six items under the Arms and Explosives Act – swords, spears, spearheads, daggers, bayonets and dangerous bows and arrows, said Mr Tan.  Items like knuckledusters and flick knives will be included in the list when the Guns, Explosives and Weapons Control Act replaces the Arms and Explosives Act later this year, he noted.  “Regulated items will be subject to greater control, including the regulation of sales on e-commerce platforms,” Mr Tan said. “We need to be calibrated on the regulatory measures to be imposed. Many items with common daily usage, like knives, can also be used as offensive weapons. We need to be practical and not overregulate such items.”  There are also legislative measures to deal with people with a higher propensity of committing crimes, including knife-related crimes, due to “certain psychiatric conditions”, Mr Tan noted.  For example, a person who suffers from a mental disorder can be detained under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act. Where a person has already been convicted of an offence, the court may impose a Mandatory Treatment Order if their psychiatric condition contributed to the offence, he added.  The order will compel the person to undergo psychiatric treatment for up to 36 months in lieu of imprisonment.  “For those who are incarcerated, the Singapore Prison Service provides intervention for inmates who are at risk of violent reoffending. For example, they are taught how to regulate their emotions and acquire skills to resolve conflicts without resorting to violence,” said Mr Tan.  MHA and its partner agencies have engaged the public through the SGSecure movement, he added. This includes emergency preparedness programmes such first aid and the use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and automated external defibrillators. “These skills are also applicable in non-terrorism related emergencies, such as the recent knife incidents, and will help members of the public avoid or reduce harm to oneself and others,"" said Mr Tan. In response to a supplementary question about police presence in areas, Mr Tan said mobile self-help stations have been deployed to ""more secluded"" areas. People can activate the police at these locations using the stations."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/former-saf-regular-rape-sexual-abuse-daughter-jail-court-2605861,"Former SAF regular jailed for raping daughter, claimed he did not want her to seek out 'other boys'","SINGAPORE: A man started sexually touching his daughter when she was 10 years old, escalating the abuse until he raped her at least once a month from 2017 to June 2018. The abuse the girl endured between the ages of 10 and 14 only ended when her mother walked in on one of the assaults in June 2018. The man, now 41, was sentenced on Monday (Apr 4) to 24 years' jail and the maximum 24 strokes of the cane, which was the sentence sought by the prosecution. He was a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular at the time of the offences. His name was redacted in court documents, and there is a gag order protecting the identity of the victim. The man pleaded guilty to three counts of rape and aggravated rape. Another five charges of sexual offences against his daughter were considered for sentencing. During the investigations, the offender said that he did not want his daughter to seek sexual intimacy with ""other boys"" who might ""trash her"", and claimed it would be ""safer"" to be intimate with him as he knew ""how to use protection"", the court heard. The offender lived together with his wife, the victim and the victim's younger sister. The abuse took place in the offender's in-laws' home, his parents' home and the family home. He started touching the victim sexually in 2014 or 2015, when she was in Primary 4 or Primary 5, the court heard. This happened when he went into her room to pat her to sleep. The sexual assaults escalated to rape in December 2016. The court heard that the victim was scared of her father, and did not struggle or resist. During one such assault between January 2017 and March 2017, when the victim was 12 to 13, the offender was worried that the condom he was wearing had broken during the rape.  The next day, after picking up his daughter from school, he gave her a ""morning after"" pill - a birth control pill - which she took. The abuse came to light on Jun 24, 2018, when the girl's mother walked into a room in the family home and saw the abuse. The woman shouted at her husband, demanding to know what he was doing to their daughter. She forced her husband out of the room and asked her daughter what had happened, but the girl was crying and was unable to answer. Although the victim's mother intended to report the offences, her daughter told her not to do so as she did not want anything to happen to her father. The victim's mother eventually found out that her husband had previously had sex with their daughter. She did not report the offences as she was concerned about the victim and her younger sister, the court heard. The offender had also begged his wife for forgiveness. The victim eventually reported the offences on Jul 31, 2019. After reporting the abuse, the victim received social service intervention from the Ministry of Social and Family Development. She was brought to stay at a home for girls, and eventually reintegrated with her mother and younger sister. During her stay at the girls' home, she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. A psychologist found that the victim's exposure to sexual grooming and abuse by her father had likely led to confusion about healthy sexual boundaries. In October 2019, the victim said she felt sad and fearful as a result of her father's actions, and suffered from insomnia, panic attacks, nightmares and recurrent thoughts of the abuse. A psychiatrist noted that the victim was reminded of the assaults when she went to places she had visited with her father, and when she saw people who resembled him, things he bought for her and the same model of car that he drove. The girl also had difficulty concentrating in class, had suicidal thoughts and harmed herself. She continued to experience flashbacks of the offences when she is alone at home, according to a victim impact statement taken in January. She is afraid to hear keys jingling or the main door opening and closing, as these used to signal her father's return home.  Deputy Public Prosecutor Christopher Ong said that the offender had ""robbed his own daughter of her innocence"". ""There can really be no more abhorrent betrayal of blood and parental duty than what the accused has done to his own flesh and blood,"" said Mr Ong. ""In the home, where the victim should have been safe, her protector turned out to be her predator."" The prosecution highlighted the offender's egregious abuse of trust, his rape of a young and vulnerable victim, his premeditation and the psychological harm to the victim. The offender was represented by Mr Josephus Tan and Mr Cory Wong of Invictus Law, who argued for not more than 18 to 20 years' jail and 24 strokes of the cane. They highlighted that the offender decided to plead guilty early, before the charges against him were finalised. He also cooperated with the authorities as soon as investigations started. The offender was ""truthful and measured"" in the way he had instructed his lawyers to mitigate, said the defence. ""Just because (he) has been charged with sexual offending, it does not necessarily mean that he is also an individual devoid of integrity or is beyond redemption,"" they said. In sentencing, Justice Ang Cheng Hock said the offender's acts were ""utterly abhorrent"" and a ""perverse breach"" of the trust that should exist between father and daughter. He said the court had to send a strong message that the man's actions cannot be condoned and that he should be punished severely. The penalty for aggravated rape is between eight years and 20 years' jail and at least 12 strokes of the cane. The punishment for rape is a jail term of up to 20 years' jail and a fine or caning."

Multiple reports were made this week by victims who were purportedly cheated by the man, leading to the arrest of a 22-year-old suspect on Thursday, said the police in a press release on Friday. The victims claimed that the man had collected payments from them for the installation of digital gates, fire-rated doors and the purchase of mattresses. However, he did not arrange for installation after receiving the money.  “The victims were allegedly deceived by the man into making payments amounting to about S$94,000 through PayNow transfers,"" said the Police.  “After receiving the payment, the man purportedly did not arrange for the installation.” Preliminary investigations show that the man is also allegedly involved in other similar cases, said the police.  He will be charged in court on Saturday with cheating. If found guilty, he faces up to 10 years in jail and a fine. On Mar 29, a local digital lock company, My Digital Lock, put up a video on Facebook alleging that a former employee had cheated the company and its customers of about S$100,000. It urged customers who had purchased items from the man to contact the firm to verify their orders and check their invoices.  The company also offered a S$5,000 reward for information on his whereabouts. In response to CNA’s queries, Mr Ronn Teo, founder of My Digital Lock said: “In the past three months, roughly 30 to 40 customers have been cheated by our former employee. ""He had changed his personal bank account name linked to his personal mobile number to My Digital Lock and produced fake quotation and invoice slips with the company’s letterhead."" Mr Teo also said that witnesses who claimed they provided leads to the police should approach the company in person to verify their identity and information.  He added that the company's primary aim now is to compensate his customers by fulfilling their orders.   "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-spy-camera-daughter-change-clothes-bedroom-voyeurism-2601581,Man admits using spy camera to record daughter changing clothes in her bedroom,"SINGAPORE: A 43-year-old man planted a spy camera in his daughter's bedroom to record her getting undressed and changing into her school uniform. During investigations, he denied the allegations and claimed the spy camera was to monitor the victim, then 13, studying in her bedroom. The man pleaded guilty on Friday (Apr 1) to two charges of voyeurism. Another charge will be taken into consideration when he returns for sentencing next week. The identities of the offender and the victim are protected by gag orders. The court heard that the man bought a spy camera resembling a USB charger sometime before July 2019. The device was able to transmit real-time footage to linked mobile phones in the vicinity, and allow the footage to be recorded on the phones. Early in the morning on Jul 6, 2020, he decided to covertly record the victim in her bedroom. He knew that she would be in a state of undress as she needed to change into her school uniform to go to school. The man planted the spy camera in a corner of the victim's bedroom. He ensured the transmitted video feed was stable and twice adjusted the direction of the spy camera, then left the room. During these instances, the device recorded footage of the offender in which his face was clearly identifiable. About 10 minutes after the offender left the room, the victim entered her bedroom, undressed and left to take a shower. She returned from her shower and put on her school uniform, then left the room again. The spy camera recorded footage of her without her knowledge throughout this process. The man retrieved the spy camera from her bedroom shortly after, and transferred the footage to his laptop and mobile phone. He repeated this the next morning, taking care to switch off the lights in the bedroom after planting the camera to minimise the chances of it being discovered. The offences came to light when the man's 36-year-old wife made a police report on Aug 21, 2020. She informed police that she had discovered videos of her daughter in various states of undress while using her husband's laptop on Aug 2 that year. She reported finding about 155 such videos on the laptop, containing timestamps between July 2019 and Jul 8, 2020. These included footage of the victim recorded with a camera positioned below the sink in the household's bathroom. Despite the man claiming the videos were to record the victim studying in her room, no footage of her studying was discovered during investigations. He could be jailed up to two years and fined or caned for each count of voyeurism."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/bidadari-bto-corruption-bribes-construction-firm-project-manager-2601386,"Jail for Bidadari BTO project manager who took S$44,000 in bribes from construction firms","SINGAPORE: The former project manager for a Build-to-Order (BTO) estate in Bidadari was sentenced on Friday (Apr 1) to 22 weeks' jail for taking bribes from subcontractors who were afraid to ""sour"" the working relationship. Wong Wei Chern, 39, accepted a total of S$44,000 in bribes from representatives of three construction firms between November 2016 and August 2019. He pleaded guilty on Friday to four counts of corruption. Another nine charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. At the time, Wong was employed by Rich Construction Company, which had been awarded contracts to build 1,789 flats in the Bidadari estate by the Housing and Development Board (HDB). As a project manager, Wong's endorsement was required for all progress claims submitted by subcontractors, which were used to process payments. Rich Construction Company awarded subcontracts for the Bidadari development to Nanjing Minglu Construction Engineering (NJML), Heng Sheng Construction and Engineering (HSCE) and Heng Dong Construction (HDC) in August 2016. Wong's co-accused are three representatives from these subcontractors who gave him bribes. They are Lu Zhibo from NJML, Hua Li from HSCE and Xu Jie from HDC. Wong admitted to approaching these men for money as he knew they would not want to ""sour"" their working relationship. This was especially since they knew the construction industry was ""small"" and Wong could ""make things difficult"" and ""might create trouble"" for the subcontractors, according to court documents. The court heard that in April 2018, Wong approached Lu for S$10,000 as he needed money to pay off personal debts. Wong lied to Lu that the HDB-appointed architect intended to penalise NJML for mistakes caused by its workers. He claimed to have paid the architect's consultant project manager S$10,000 on NJML's behalf to resolve the issue. Lu transferred S$5,000 to Wong's bank account later that month. Wong again lied to Lu in August 2018 that NJML's workers had incorrectly cut a piece of metal, and claimed to have paid off the architect's project manager with S$10,000. In December 2018, Wong sent Lu a text message saying that his superiors had instructed him to deduct S$50,000 from NJML's payment claims. This was untrue. He claimed that NJML's mistakes had caused Rich Construction Company to receive demerit points from HDB, and showed Lu a copy of a letter from the architect showing that HDB had approved the imposition of demerit points. In the months that followed, Wong continued to press for payments from Lu, who transferred a total of S$24,000 to him by August 2019. Wong similarly approached HSCE's Hua and HDC's Xu for money between 2017 and 2019, receiving S$7,000 and S$13,000 from them respectively. He has since made full restitution for the payments to the three co-accused and the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau. Deputy Public Prosecutor Kang Jia Hui sought at least six months' jail for Wong, arguing that he was the initiator of the entire scheme and resorted to ""highly insidious means"" to obtain the bribes. She said that Wong's offences contributed to a risk of loss of confidence in Singapore's public administration given his role in managing a large-scale public housing project. Wong's defence lawyer Eric Tin asked for not more than 12 weeks' jail for his client, arguing that the prosecution had ""overstated"" the risk to confidence in Singapore's public administration. He also said that the Bidadari BTO estate achieved a ""high quality score"" under Wong's project management, and that Wong had fully cooperated with investigations. District Judge Kamala Ponnampalam said Wong's offences contained ""veiled threats"", pressure, untruths and coercion. She noted that the offences involved a public sector project and potentially compromised the work ethic and integrity of the subcontractors. After delivering the sentence, she granted a two-month deferment to the start of Wong's jail term. This stemmed from a request from Wong's current employer as the construction sector ""badly needs people"", according to Mr Tin. Lu and Hua were previously fined S$50,000 and S$18,000 respectively, while Xu's case is pending."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/pulau-bukom-stolen-fuel-gas-oil-mastermind-jailed-2599081,Jail for former Shell employee who masterminded S$128m marine fuel heist at Pulau Bukom,"SINGAPORE: A former Shell employee was jailed on Thursday (Mar 31) for 29 years for his role in a S$128 million marine fuel heist at the company's refinery in Singapore. Juandi Pungot, 45, pleaded guilty last month to 36 charges of criminal breach of trust, laundering his proceeds from criminal conduct and giving bribes. Another 49 charges were considered for sentencing. He was one of three masterminds in the long-running heist that involved illegally loading bunkers with stolen marine fuel from Pulau Bukom refinery, Shell's largest petrochemical production and export centre in Asia Pacific. Juandi reaped at least S$5.6 million in criminal proceeds, the bulk of which he spent on designer watches, vehicles, local and overseas properties and investments, foreign exchange trading and gambling. These included an investment in The 3 Amigoes restaurant, the purchase of a condominium unit in Bangkok and more than S$500,000 worth of casino chips at the Marina Bay Sands Casino. The prosecution had sought a jail term of 29 years and 11 months, while the defence argued for 15 years imprisonment. Delivering the verdict in the High Court, Justice Hoo Sheau Peng said the crimes were ""exceptionally serious"" and ""unprecedented in scale and complexity"". The syndicate's activities affected Singapore's reputation as a commercial hub and ""hit at the heart of the bunkering and petrochemical industry, a key component of Singapore's economy"", added the judge. In sentencing, Justice Hoo also considered the premeditated and sophisticated nature of the offences, the spectre of organised crime that they raised and the transnational element through the involvement of foreign vessels. Juandi joined Shell in 2004 as a process technician. By the time his employment was terminated in December 2017, he was a shore loading officer earning about S$6,000 a month. The court previously heard that his job scope was primarily to facilitate the transfer of Shell's petroleum products at Pulau Bukom to client vessels. Juandi and his colleague Abdul Latif Ibrahim first came up with the idea of stealing marine fuel in 2007, when they were deployed to work in the same team, Team D. They recruited a third ""key mastermind"", Muzaffar Ali Khan, sometime after. From 2008 to 2013, they expanded their criminal enterprise to include two other members of Team D, and increased the number of illegal loadings to about twice monthly. Juandi and his associates would receive between S$10,000 and S$15,000 for each illegal loading. Sometime in 2013, after a dispute about how Latif had been distributing the criminal proceeds, he requested a transfer to another team. The illegal loadings stopped for a period of time after Latif's departure from Team D, as he had been the primary point of contact with the vessels that bought stolen fuel. Once Juandi and his associates were able to establish their own contacts, they resumed their illegal loadings. In 2014, they recruited three more members into the syndicate. They also started targeting vessels with Vietnamese and Greek captains. This was because it was ""well-known in the industry that such individuals would readily conduct illegal oil trading"", according to Juandi, as stated in court documents. In December 2015, they entered an agreement to perform illegal loadings for vessels belonging to Vietnam-based Prime Shipping Corporation. The syndicate's activities continued to grow as they struck deals to perform illegal loadings for Sentek vessels and vessels from Sirius Marine in 2017. The heist came to light on Aug 1, 2017, when a Shell representative made a police report that the company had suffered an unidentified loss of fuel amounting to about S$3 million in April that year. To broker deals for illegal loadings, a shore loading officer in the syndicate would engage the captain of a vessel to make an offer for the sale of stolen marine fuel. The stolen fuel was sold at a price lower than the prevailing estimated market value at the time, which could be derived from the S&P Global Platts index. The price varied, but the stolen fuel was often sold at about S$285 per tonne when transferred to bunkers, and US$220 to US$250 when transferred to tankers. The syndicate adopted various methods to escape detection, according to the prosecution. They configured the flow of the stolen fuel through carefully planned routes that avoided custody transfer meters. They also ensured that multiple pumps and tanks were moving at the same time, including unnecessary tank-to-tank transfers, to mask what was going on. The syndicate would try to hide the theft of fuel by shifting the production of gas oil to the same tank, so that the level in the tank appeared balanced or even increasing. They also carefully timed their activities against legitimate transfers of purchased fuel, for instance, pausing the legitimate loadings to carry out their illegal loadings. The syndicate was also able to avoid detection by other colleagues and supervisors due to their ""combined in-depth knowledge of Shell's internal systems and deliberate evasive steps"", said the prosecution. One of the syndicate members would manipulate the oil control panel to help mask the movement of the stolen fuel. They would distract a supervisor if necessary, such as by giving excuses about the delays caused by illegal loadings. They would also tamper with the bunker meter as well as the orientation of the CCTV cameras to ensure their criminal activities were not recorded. Their activities were coordinated in group chats on their mobile phones, which they would subsequently delete. They also paid off individuals who caught on to the offences to maintain their silence. This included nearly S$275,000 in bribes to six independent surveyors who signed off on the volumes of fuel transfers to vessels. Following the discovery of the large-scale misappropriation, Shell invested about S$6 million to improve systems and processes at Pulau Bukom. These include new and additional custody transfer meters and anti-theft CCTV cameras, development of monitoring software to detect potential theft of gas oil and creation of new permanent positions to strengthen supervision."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/turkish-prosecutor-seeks-halt-trial-saudi-suspects-khashoggi-killing-2598781,Turkish prosecutor seeks to halt trial of Saudi suspects in Khashoggi killing,"ISTANBUL: A Turkish prosecutor asked a court on Thursday (Mar 31)  to halt the trial in absentia of 26 Saudi suspects over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and transfer the case to Saudi authorities. The court said it would ask for the Justice Ministry's opinion on the request and set the next hearing for Apr 7. Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct 2, 2018. Turkish officials believe his body was dismembered and removed. His remains have not been found. In September 2020, a Saudi court jailed eight people for between seven and 20 years over the killing in a trial critics said lacked transparency. None of the defendants was named. Following the Saudi trial, the Turkish court asked the Justice Ministry in November to send a letter to Riyadh asking about those who had been sentenced in the kingdom, to avoid the risk of them being punished twice. The Turkish prosecutor said Saudi authorities responded by asking for the case be transferred to them and for the so-called red notices against the defendants to be lifted. Riyadh also pledged to evaluate the accusations against the 26 defendants if the case was transferred, the prosecutor said. The prosecutor said the request should be accepted because the defendants were foreign citizens, the arrest warrants and red notices could not be executed and their statements could not be taken, leaving the case in abeyance or suspension. A US intelligence report released a year ago said Prince Mohammed had approved the operation to kill or capture Khashoggi. The Saudi government has denied any involvement by the crown prince and rejected the report's findings. The crown prince told The Atlantic monthly in an article published this month that he felt his own rights had been violated by the accusations against him as any person should be considered innocent until proven guilty."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/daryati-maid-murder-stab-employer-death-life-imprisonment-appeal-2598756,Maid who stabbed employer almost 100 times loses appeal against murder conviction,"SINGAPORE: A domestic helper who stabbed her employer nearly 100 times had her appeal against her murder conviction dismissed by the Court of Appeal on Thursday (Mar 31). Indonesian national Daryati, 29, was sentenced to life imprisonment in April 2021. She had claimed trial, and was convicted of one charge of slashing 59-year-old Seow Kim Choo multiple times with the intention of injuring her in a manner sufficient to cause death. A second charge of attempting to murder Mdm Seow's husband when he tried to help his wife was considered in sentencing. The murder took place in June 2016, two months after Daryati started working for Mdm Seow and her family. On Thursday, pro bono defence lawyer Leon Koh pursued a defence of diminished responsibility and argued for Daryati to be convicted of a lesser charge of culpable homicide. Delivering the judgment on behalf of a three-judge panel, Justice Andrew Phang said the appeal depended in particular on whether Daryati suffered from persistent depressive disorder with intermittent depressive disorder at the time of the offence. However, based on evidence from a psychiatrist, he found that Daryati did not meet the diagnostic criteria for these disorders, mainly as she did not suffer from the clinical symptom of functional impairment. He cited Daryati's own evidence during the trial that she was able to handle her job scope and complete assigned chores every day without error. He also noted a ""substantial degree of plotting"" by Daryati before carrying out the attack on her employer, which displayed her ability to think ahead and reason clearly. This included drawing a map of the house, enlisting the help of the family's other helper and choosing the ""most opportune"" moment to strike. There was also no evidence of functional impairment before Daryati's arrival from Indonesia, where she was able to finish high school, hold down a factory job and form relationships with others, said Justice Phang. For a defence of diminished responsibility to stand, the accused must be suffering from a specific abnormality of mind that substantially impaired their mental responsibility for causing the death. Mr Koh contended that Daryati's anger, seen in the 94 stab wounds she inflicted on Mdm Seow, demonstrated such an abnormality of mind. He said this was supported by a ""confluence of factors"": Daryati's ""frenzied attack"", her decision to also attack Mdm Seow's husband instead of fleeing the scene, and the rape and sexual abuse she suffered when she was a teenager in Indonesia. At her trial, Daryati had said she did not intend to kill Mdm Seow and wanted only to threaten her, slashing her face to get the keys to a safe where Daryati's passport was kept. She had also told the lower court she was in a ""very angry state"" and could not control her hands. During the appeal hearing, Mr Koh was questioned several times by the judges, who expressed doubts about whether anger and rage were necessarily connected to an abnormality of mind. ""Perfectly rational people"" can display sudden bursts of rage, said Justice Phang. ""In that sense it's emotion, in that sense it's raw. But it's not necessarily something that stems from an abnormality."" Deputy Public Prosecutor Wong Kok Weng said that the trial judge in the lower court had already noted the high number of stab wounds on the victim and asked for a further report from the prosecution's expert, psychiatrist Dr Jaydip Sarkar, taking this into account. Dr Sarkar gave a ""cogent"" explanation for the multiple stab wounds, reasoning that it was due to Daryati's anger that her plan to return to Indonesia had been thwarted, said Mr Wong. The appellant argued that the trial judge should have relied on the evidence of another psychiatrist, Dr Tommy Tan, who diagnosed Daryati with persistent depressive order before and after her arrival in Singapore, as well as a relapse of major depressive disorder after starting work in Singapore. However, Justice Phang said that Dr Tan did not account for the lack of functional impairment. Daryati's self-reported symptoms, including a depressed mood, loss of appetite and weight as well as suicidal thoughts, were also not supported by the facts of the case, said the judge. ""The most that can be said is that the appellant had two relatively short periods when she was feeling distressed in Singapore,"" said Justice Phang. This was when Daryati first arrived, and an occasion near the end of May 2016 when she called her mother and received no response. She then sought permission from her employer to go home but her request was denied. Even then, Dr Sarkar's assessment was that her feelings of longing and homesickness were not beyond the realm of what was ordinarily experienced by migrant workers, said Justice Phang. After the judgment was delivered, Daryati requested for an overseas phone call to inform her family of the verdict. Daryati had worked for Mdm Seow and her family at her Telok Kurau home for only two months when she became homesick and longed for her lover, who was in Hong Kong. She also wanted to return to Indonesia and start a business as she had financial problems back home. All accounts showed that the victim and her family had treated Daryati well and given her adequate rest and food. She wrote in her diary on May 12, 2016: ""I must carry out this plan quickly. I have to be brave even though life is at stake. I am ready to face all risks/consequences, whatever the risk, I must be ready to accept it. I hope that this plan succeed and run smoothly. My employer's family is my target. DEATH!!!"" Daryati roped the family's other 27-year-old helper into the scheme to retrieve passports from a locked safe, but did not tell her about the murder she planned. She hid weapons around the house before carrying out her plan on Jun 7, 2016. She uttered a code word to the other helper before confronting Mdm Seow in her bedroom while brandishing a knife and asking for her passport. When the older woman screamed, Daryati dragged her into a toilet and closed the door before slashing and stabbing her neck, head and face repeatedly. Mdm Seow's husband, Mr Ong Thiam Soon, called for his wife but did not receive a response. He peered into the toilet through a gap at the bottom of the door and saw blood on the floor. When he used a screwdriver to open the toilet door, Daryati attacked him while armed with two knives. Despite being stabbed in the neck, Mr Ong managed to overpower her and dragged her out of the toilet. He bound her hands with cable ties and took her to the main gate, while a family member called for an ambulance. Daryati was arrested and taken to the hospital, along with Mr Ong. An autopsy report found Mdm Seow's cause of death to be multiple incised and stab wounds to the head and neck, which resulted in massive bleeding. A further report stated that considerable amounts of force were used in inflicting at least three of the stab wounds to Mdm Seow's face. A psychiatric report from the Institute of Mental Health found that Daryati had been suffering from adjustment disorder in the two weeks leading up to the murder. She was convicted of murder under Section 300c of the Penal Code, which carries the sentence of death or life imprisonment. The prosecution did not seek the death sentence."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/wildlife-reserves-manager-bribe-corruption-jail-price-fixing-2596091,Jail for Wildlife Reserves Singapore ex-manager who was bribed to 'close one eye' in price-fixing scheme,"SINGAPORE: A former manager of Wildlife Reserves Singapore (WRS) who received more than S$51,000 in bribes was jailed for nine months on Wednesday (Mar 30). Chin Fong Yi, 44, accepted the bribes in exchange for her silence on a price-fixing scheme that had allegedly been running since 2005. The cases of the other individuals involved in the price-fixing, including a former director at the Singapore Zoo, which is a subsidiary of WRS, are still pending. Chin used a portion of the bribes she received to buy luxury bags, jewellery and shoes. These were seized during investigations and sold for proceeds amounting to S$9,275, which were paid to the Accountant-General. The judge also ordered Chin to pay a penalty of S$42,475, which was the balance left over after subtracting the proceeds of the sale from the total amount of bribes that she received. The Singaporean had earlier pleaded guilty to 12 charges of corruptly obtaining bribes and using criminal proceeds to buy items, with another 67 charges taken into consideration. District Judge Melissa Tan handed down the sentence sought by the prosecution, after considering the significant amount of bribes involved and Chin's repeated offending over a five-year period from 2010 to 2015. Defence lawyer Chung Ting Fai had concurred with the prosecution on the jail sentence, but asked for a slightly lower penalty order. He said his client had provided her full cooperation to the authorities, surrendering all the luxury items she had that were related to the crimes, and pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. The court previously heard that Chin was a WRS employee from May 2008 to February 2017. She started in the maintenance department, progressed to estate management in 2010 and became a facilities manager in 2015. Her duties across the roles included project coordination, upgrading works, drafting job specifications and sourcing quotes from contractors. The company linked to Chin's case is Shin Yong Construction, a construction firm overseeing civil engineering projects and a long-time contractor of WRS. Since 2005, Barry Chong Peng Wee, then a director of facilities management at the Singapore Zoo, had maintained an arrangement with key staff members of Shin Yong Construction. Shin Yong Construction and linked contractors would collude to bid for WRS projects and pay ""commissions"" to Chong, 54, when they were awarded the projects, according to the prosecution. As part of this arrangement, Chong would send job specifications to Shin Yong Construction foreman Too Say Kiong, 56. Too would get his group of contractors to put in quotes and present the collated quotes to Chong and his managers. The project would usually be awarded to the vendor with the lowest quote. Sometime in 2010 or 2011, Chin noticed that the prices on the quotations submitted by Shin Yong Construction and its group of contractors were very close to one another. She suspected that the contractors were engaging in price-fixing with Chong in exchange for some form of financial benefit. She met Too and asked him if there was such an arrangement. Too told her to ""keep quiet and close one eye"" and offered her a stack of S$50 notes, which Chin understood to be a reward for her silence on the arrangement. Initially, Chin rejected the money and left. But Too met her on another occasion and offered her another stack of S$50 notes. Chin asked Too what the money was for, and Too told her that her boss Chong was taking money. He asked her why she did not wish to take money as well. Chin then asked Too if the contractors had fixed the prices of the quotations among themselves, and he confirmed this. After hearing that Chong was receiving money from Too, Chin accepted the bribe. She was aware that it was a reward for her silence on the fact that Shin Yong Construction was giving corrupt bribes to Chong. Too then settled into an arrangement with Chin to give her monthly bribes for her silence. He typically passed her the money in an envelope at the water treatment plant at the zoo. Chin received S$500 in bribes every month from April 2010 to April 2015. In May 2015, she was given S$20,000. She also received a black Chanel wallet worth S$1,250 after telling Too's relative that she liked the wallet very much. On 16 occasions, she used the bribes she received to buy other luxury items."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/company-director-launder-criminal-proceeds-email-fraud-scam-2595901,"Jail for company director who laundered S$500,000 from email scam","SINGAPORE: A man was sentenced to 27 months' jail on Wednesday (Mar 30) for helping scammers to launder more than half a million dollars' worth of criminal proceeds through email fraud. As police investigators from the Commercial Affairs Department closed in on him, Singaporean Mohd Jamail Khan Banakhani Shafi Khan sent them forged agreements to justify his receipt of the funds in 2016 and 2017. Jamail, 56, was the director of Jars Technology and Jars Investments and Holdings at the time of the offences. Out of the criminal proceeds he received, Jamail used about S$59,000 for his own benefit. The court heard that Jars Technology received two payments of about S$141,000 and S$325,000 in its Standard Chartered Bank account on May 23 and Jun 10, 2016 respectively. The transfers were made by Vietnamese company Trading Scientific Technological Materials (Tramat). They were meant as payments to another company, Shimadzu (Asia Pacific), for laboratory equipment. Tramat had earlier received spoofed emails sent using an email address with the domain name ""@sg-shimadzu.com"", which resembled the email address of an actual Shimadzu employee. The spoofed emails contained instructions for Tramat to make the payments to Jar Technology's Standard Chartered Bank account instead of Shimadzu's bank account. Jamail was the ""controlling mind"" of Jars Technology, the sole authorised signatory of the bank account where the payments were sent, and had consented to his company receiving the money, said the prosecution. He claimed to have received the payments in connection with a US$3.5 million investment by a man named Chinazaepere Raphael Okoli to buy a freehold property in Singapore. This was despite Jamail having no experience or qualifications with property investments and the fact that he himself ""found it strange that someone he had never met would trust him with such a huge investment"", said the prosecution. Of the payments received from Tramat, Jamail transferred S$17,000 to his own loan account, S$4,000 to his personal bank account and withdrew S$10,000 for his personal expenses. He also made out two cheques totalling more than S$28,000 to an auto company. When Tramat's director discovered that Shimadzu had not received the payments and that the spoofed emails did not come from a Shimadzu employee, he lodged a police report in Singapore on Jun 20, 2016. After the police report was made, Jamail forged an investment agreement between Tramat and Jars Investments using Okoli's electronic signature. He sent this document to a commercial affairs investigator to deceive her into believing there was a genuine investment arrangement between the two companies, which was an obstruction of the course of justice, said the prosecution. In May 2017, Jamail again received another S$67,000 in criminal proceeds from email fraud. This happened after the Singapore branch of Bank Mandiri received spoofed emails purporting to be from an employee of Madhucon Granites, the parent company of Nama Holdings. The spoofed emails deceived Bank Mandiri into approving transfers from Nama Holdings' corporate bank account to Jamail's personal bank account with Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC). Police reports were made by representatives from Bank Mandiri and Madhucon Granites later that month. During investigations, Jamail claimed to have received the money in connection with a US$2 million investment by a man known as ""Mr Namakrishnan"" and again provided investigators with a forged investment agreement to justify the transfers. Investigations showed that Jamail remitted about S$13,600 of the funds to a man named Chibueze Clement Egbukichi in the United Arab Emirates despite the purported agreement not giving him the authority to do so. Deputy Public Prosecutor Lee Wei Liang had earlier sought 30 months' jail, citing the large amounts of money involved and the prolonged period of offending. He noted that Jamail continued to transact with suspicious characters even though he was put on notice about them. Investigations revealed that earlier in 2015, Jamail was probed for money laundering offences in connection with an individual named ""John Mark"". He agreed to receive the payments from Tramat despite having reason to believe the same individual was involved. The prosecutor also pointed out that Jamail produced two forged agreements to frustrate investigations into him, giving the court reason to infer that he knew he was wrong. Defence lawyer Sofia Bakhash had asked for not more than 20 months' jail. She said Jamail was a chauffeur with little background in wealth management and that his offences lacked ""sophistication"". She also argued that while the total sum of money involved was large, only about S$59,000 was used by Jamail for his own benefit, mainly to pay off debts. This showed a ""certain altruistic intention"" as Jamail was using the money to rectify his financial situation, she said. District Judge Christopher Goh disagreed with the defence that the harm caused by Jamail's actions was low. He granted a deferment for the jail sentence to start after Hari Raya Puasa."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-spy-camera-toilet-film-close-friends-co-workers-2593591,"Man jailed for filming close female friends, co-workers in toilet with spy cameras","SINGAPORE: A 40-year-old man used spy cameras to film videos of female friends and co-workers using the toilet in several locations, including his home, his friends' homes and his workplace. Among his victims was a close friend of 30 years, whom he had known since childhood. They were part of a group that regularly met up and travelled together. Before a mahjong gathering at his place in February 2020, the man placed a spy camera in his toilet to capture the woman using it. The offender was jailed for nine months on Tuesday (Mar 29) after pleading guilty to eight charges of insulting a woman's modesty, voyeurism and possessing obscene films. Another 17 charges were considered for sentencing. The identity and occupation of the offender, the identities of his victims as well as the locations where the offences were committed are protected by gag order. The court heard that the man bought his first spy camera online in 2016 and decided to use it to record obscene videos as it was small and unlikely to be detected. After buying another camera for that specific purpose, he hid it in the toilet in his apartment to film female friends who occasionally visited. He noted that ""the quality of the footage was good"" and decided to buy a few more cameras to hide in various locations, stated court documents. From 2017, the man would place the cameras in his apartment's toilet and the toilets of his friend's houses whenever there were gatherings. He captured obscene videos of at least five female friends, all in their 40s, using this method. One of them was a woman he met through work and had known since 2006. She occasionally went to his place to use the swimming pool in his apartment complex. Knowing that the victim would shower at his apartment after swimming, he hid some cameras there beforehand and filmed her without her knowledge on three occasions between December 2018 and July 2019. He also targeted another friend he met in 2006 through work as well as two women he met through her. He had known the two other women since 2013 or 2014. He placed the spy cameras in his home and his friend's home and filmed all three women using the toilet on seven occasions between November 2018 and January 2020. In 2019, the man also started hiding cameras in the seventh floor handicap toilet at his workplace. He secured one to the toilet roller with black Velcro tape and hid another under the sink, after learning online where it was ""best"" to place the cameras. He would usually place the cameras there at noon and retrieve it a few hours later. Between January 2019 and March 2020, he captured videos of 10 unknown women using the toilet with this method. The offences were discovered on Mar 19, 2020, when a person identified as Mr Johnson in court documents reported that he had found a hidden camera in the handicap toilet. That day, the offender had gone to the toilet to retrieve his spy cameras when he found that they were missing. He went back home, packed his electronic devices into three bags and threw them at a rubbish bin in the area. He also deleted some folders containing videos he had previously taken. The man then returned to his workplace, where he saw police officers. ""Knowing that his identity would soon be found out, he admitted to his superior that he was the person who placed the camera in the handicap toilet,"" stated court documents. The man was arrested that day. The police managed to retrieve the disposed bags of electronic devices, on which they found 591 videos and 18 photographs containing obscene material. The man was eventually convicted of possessing 355 obscene videos found on his USB thumb drive."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/jean-luc-kha-vu-han-prive-group-ex-ceo-mandatory-treatment-punch-boy-2593341,Ex-Prive Group CEO who punched 13-year-old boy gets mandatory treatment,"SINGAPORE: The former CEO of food and beverage group The Prive Group was on Tuesday (Mar 29) ordered to undergo 12 months of mandatory treatment. French national Jean-Luc Kha Vu Han, 44, punched a 13-year-old boy on his temple and asked him lewd questions in a lift in 2019. He was intoxicated at the time. A mandatory treatment order (MTO) directs an offender suffering from certain treatable psychiatric conditions to undergo psychiatric treatment. The court had ordered an MTO suitability report for Vu Han at the previous hearing. Defence lawyer Teh Ee-von said the report by Dr Pamela Ng, a psychiatrist with the Institute of Mental Health, found that Vu Han was suffering from bipolar disorder, which is a treatable mental illness. Dr Ng said it was likely that during the incident, Vu Han had a manic episode with a possibility of psychosis, which caused him to be impulsive, according to the lawyer. Dr Ng found a ""contributory link"" between Vu Han's mental condition and the offending behaviour, said Ms Teh. The doctor also reported that his condition had shown improvement with treatment. This led Dr Ng to recommend that Vu Han was a suitable candidate for MTO, which she thought should extend for a period of 12 months. Ms Teh said her client showed ""high rehabilitative potential"" as she called for the judge to sentence him to an MTO. ""He is extremely remorseful for what he has done and he has learnt his lesson. He is seeking treatment and he is continuously following up on his end to make sure that his mood is stable and that he doesn't let his mental illness get the better of him,"" she said. The incident on Nov 22, 2019 took place when Vu Han, his friend, the victim and the victim's 12-year-old brother were in a lift in Parklane Shopping Mall. Vu Han asked the victim a question about his private parts and asked the victim if he wanted to see his private parts, to which the victim replied no. Vu Han then said that he could arrange a sex act for the victim. The boy was alarmed and said no. Vu Han suddenly punched the boy on his temple and said, ""You want to challenge me?"" He later also slapped the victim's cheek. The prosecution maintained its objection to an MTO, asking for at least eight weeks' jail and a fine instead. After the sentence was delivered, the prosecution said it would be considering whether to mount an appeal. Deputy Public Prosecutor Goh Yong Ngee said that while Dr Ng's report found Vu Han suitable for an MTO, the mitigatory weight of his bipolar disorder had to be considered against a backdrop of alcohol consumption. Mr Goh pointed out that only a contributory link, as opposed to causal link, was found between Vu Han's mental condition and the offences. He contended that Vu Han retained significant control over his actions and that his alcohol consumption, which was voluntary, may have contributed to the offences. Mr Goh also argued that Vu Han committed the offence against a vulnerable victim, hurting the boy by delivering a punch to his head in a confined space. While the victim's physical injuries - bruising and redness to his skin - were not serious, the incident has left an ""indelible scar"" on the boy, who is still afraid of entering lifts, said the prosecutor. He has also suffered flashbacks of the incident. Ms Teh responded that Vu Han's mental condition impaired his judgment, citing Dr Ng's observation in a previous report that he was more easily irritated and had trouble controlling his actions during manic episodes. She also said that Vu Han did not single out the victim because he was a minor, but it was just ""extremely unfortunate"" that the victim was a child. District Judge Lim Tse Haw said Vu Han's offences were ""deplorable"" as he had attacked a young and vulnerable victim both physically and verbally, while ""totally unprovoked"". However, he said the offences were not so heinous as to rule out considerations for rehabilitation completely. The judge also said it was clear from legal precedent that a contributory rather than causal link between the mental condition and the offending behaviour was sufficient for an MTO to be granted. He also noted that Vu Han, a first-time offender, had given a ""sincere and heartfelt"" letter of apology to the victim and offered to compensate for the injuries, even though the victim's parents declined his offer."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-jailed-molesting-11-year-old-swimming-pool-shower-filming-boys-public-toilets-2593231,"Man jailed for molesting 11-year-old in swimming pool shower, filming boys in public toilets","SINGAPORE: A man was sentenced on Tuesday (Mar 29) to 23 months and four weeks' jail and three strokes of the cane for molesting an 11-year-old boy in a shower stall and taking videos of boys in toilets at various locations. Neo Cheok Leong, 47, pleaded guilty to one count of outrage of modesty and nine counts of making obscene films. Forty-two more charges, mostly for making obscene films, were considered for sentencing. The identity of the 11-year-old victim is protected by a gag order. The court heard that Neo, an engineer, met the boy over YouTube in 2017. They bonded over a shared liking for music. On Sep 13, 2017, Neo invited the victim and another person, whose name was redacted from court documents, for a swim at Toa Payoh Swimming Complex. They finished their swim in the evening and went to shower in the male toilet. Neo offered to shower in the same cubicle as the victim, who agreed because the shower rooms were crowded. Once they were in the cubicle, Neo closed the door. The victim said he could shower on his own, but Neo replied: ""It's okay one lah. Just shower with me. I won't do anything to you lah."" The victim removed his swimming trunks and started to shower. Neo also undressed. While showering, Neo suddenly hugged the victim from the back, kissed him and molested him. Between 2017 and 2018, Neo also took a total of 49 videos of boys in male toilets. These were recorded at various locations, including HomeTeamNS facilities in Bukit Batok and Sembawang, Siloso Beach and other swimming complexes. One of the videos was taken in Japan. Neo did not know the boys in the videos, which captured them with their private parts and buttocks exposed. Some of the videos also captured Neo naked. Police were alerted to the offences on the evening of Aug 18, 2018, when they received a call about a man trying to take a photo of someone else in the shower at HomeTeamNS Sembawang. When police arrived and interviewed Neo, he admitted to recording a video of someone showering in a cubicle. The phone was seized and forensic examinations revealed nine videos of boys showering. These were taken in the male toilets at Siloso Beach between January 2017 and February 2018. The prosecution sought a sentence of 25 months' jail and three to four strokes of the cane, highlighting that the victim was especially vulnerable given his young age. The degree of sexual exploitation was also ""egregious and reprehensible"", said the prosecution, as there was skin-on-skin contact with the victim's private part. Neo's ""overall brazen and serial nature of offending"" was also demonstrated by the numerous charges taken into consideration, all of which were committed in public places, said the prosecution."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/nagaenthran-dharmalingam-drug-trafficker-death-sentence-appeal-dismissed-2592561,"Court of Appeal dismisses Malaysian drug trafficker's bid against death sentence, rebukes 'abuse of process'","SINGAPORE: The Court of Appeal on Tuesday (Mar 29) dismissed a bid for leniency by a convicted Malaysian drug trafficker who was sentenced to death in 2010. Nagaenthran Dharmalingam, 34, was appealing against a High Court decision that dismissed his application to commence judicial review proceedings on the basis that he purportedly possesses the mental age of someone below 18. The Malaysian national had also mounted a criminal motion to be assessed by an independent panel of psychiatrists, with a stay of execution in the meantime. Delivering the verdict on behalf of a five-judge panel, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon dismissed the appellant's case as ""baseless and without merit, both as a matter of fact and of law"". ""In our judgment, these proceedings constitute a blatant and egregious abuse of the court's processes,"" said the Court of Appeal. ""They have been conducted with the seeming aim of unjustifiably delaying the carrying into effect of the sentence imposed on the appellant."" Nagaenthran was sentenced to death in 2010 for importing 42.72g of heroin into Singapore in 2009 in a bundle strapped to his thigh. He previously failed in his appeals to the High Court in 2011, to the Apex Court in 2019 and in his petition to the president for clemency. Nagaenthran was represented by Ms Violet Netto. His former lawyer Ravi Madasamy, better known as M Ravi, was also in attendance. Earlier this month, Ms Netto had argued for him to receive an ""independent"" psychiatric assessment and ""up-to-date full neurocognitive test"" to evaluate his competence to be executed and prescribe the necessary treatment. The prosecution had responded that there was no reliable evidence that Nagaenthran's mental condition had deteriorated and that he was not competent for execution, and no basis to grant the application for him to be assessed by a panel of psychiatrists. The Court of Appeal said the appellant's central argument was that ""because of an alleged deterioration in the appellant's mental faculties since the time of his offence, the sentence of death cannot be allowed to be carried out"". However, there was no admissible evidence to show such a decline in Nagenthran's mental condition. The only evidence provided for the application was an affidavit of Mr Ravi in which he made a ""bare assertion"" about the appellant's mental age. But Mr Ravi acknowledged that he did not have the necessary medical expertise and was ""speculating"" on Nagaenthran's mental age, said the court. Furthermore, as Nagaenthran's counsel, Mr Ravi was not a disinterested party and should not have put himself forward as the appellant's witness, said the court. In the course of proceedings, the Attorney-General's Chambers were prepared to tender reports of medical and psychiatric assessments conducted in 2021, but the appellant had objected to the admission of these reports as evidence. ""With respect, having called his medical condition into question, we cannot see how the appellant can at the same time, in good faith, prevent access to evidence that pertains to the very condition in question,"" said Chief Justice Menon. These reports should have been regarded as ""presumptively objective"" as they were from scheduled check-ups rather than part of a litigation response, he added. ""The objection mounted on the appellant's behalf supports the inference that he is aware of the evidential difficulties with his case, and is seeking to prevent the court from accessing that evidence because he knows or believes it would undermine his case,"" said the Chief Justice. As for the criminal motion for an independent psychiatric review, Chief Justice Menon said this was ""at best"" an attempt to adduce additional evidence to support the appeal, and this was ""procedurally improper"". The motion was premised on evidence from Nagaenthran's brother, Mr Navinkumar, an interested and unqualified witness whose evidence was unreliable, said the court. Mr Navinkumar's evidence was also contradicted by the evidence of the prison officer in charge of observing Nagaenthran, said the Court of Appeal. No reliance could be placed on the expert reports of Dr Danny Sullivan and Mr P B J Schaapveld filed by the appellant, as they ""have not examined or even spoken to the appellant and have not seen his present medical records"", said the court. The Court of Appeal also devoted a significant portion of its findings to trace the ""tortuous path"" taken by the proceedings. It noted that Nagaenthran's application for leave to commence judicial review was heard on Nov 8, 2021, when it was dismissed on the same day. The criminal motion was filed at the ""eleventh hour"" when the hearing for the earlier application was already under way, the court said. It took issue with the fact that the appellant did not file Mr Navinkumar's affidavit under the earlier application, even though the evidence was available then, but did so under the criminal motion instead. Mr Navinkumar's evidence might have been ""deliberately withheld"" to support a further application in anticipation of the earlier one being dismissed, said the court. ""The appellant has been afforded due process under law, and it is not open to him to challenge the outcome of that process when he has put nothing forward to suggest that he does have a case to be considered,"" said the court. It said the criminal motion was filed ""not with a genuine intention to seek relief, but rather as a 'stopgap' measure devised by the appellant and his counsel to try to delay the carrying out of the sentence imposed on the appellant"". ""The fact that these matters have been conducted by the appellant and his counsel in a manner that constitutes an abuse of process is a further ground for denying relief,"" said the court. Concluding its judgment, the Court of Appeal said the imposition and carrying out of the death penalty are always ""difficult matters"". ""Counsel may well have passionate views that run counter to imposition of the death penalty. At a societal level, the proper recourse for them and indeed for anyone similarly situated is to seek legislative change if they are minded to do so. ""But as long as the law validly provides for the imposition of capital punishment in the specified circumstances, it is improper for counsel to abuse the process of the court and thereby bring the administration of criminal justice into disrepute by filing one hopeless application after another and by drip-feeding the supposed evidence."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/bidadari-hdb-estate-bto-subcontractor-corrupt-bribe-2591291,Bidadari BTO subcontractor fined for bribing construction firm for fear of 'trouble',"SINGAPORE: A director of a construction firm that was subcontracted to work on Build-to-Order (BTO) flats in Bidadari was on Friday (Mar 28) fined S$18,000 for graft. Hua Li, 45, worked for Heng Sheng Construction and Engineering (HSCE), a firm specialising in structural works and sewage piping at the time of the offence. His co-accused, Wong Wei Chern, 39, was employed by Rich Construction Company, which primarily built Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats. Hua admitted in court to corruptly giving Wong a total of S$7,000. He pleaded guilty to one charge of corruption, with one more charge considered for sentencing. The court heard that in 2016, HDB appointed Rich Construction Company as the main contractor for 1,789 flats in the Bidadari housing estate. Wong was the project manager for two of the three contracts awarded to the firm for these works. In August that year, Rich Construction Company awarded HSCE a subcontract valued at more than S$2.2 million to perform reinforced concrete structural works at the Bidadari worksite. In June 2017, Wong approached Hua for a loan of S$5,000 as he was facing financial difficulties. He promised to pay Hua back in one to two months' time. ""Hua admitted to believing that Wong 'might create trouble' for HSCE, as he knew that the latter's oversight responsibilities extended to areas of safety, work quality, and the approval of progress claims,"" stated court documents. ""Hua further admitted to hoping that Wong could 'help' him in future at the worksite."" He therefore agreed to give Wong a loan ""to refrain from causing difficulties for HSCE"" in relation to its works at the Bidadari estate, and transferred S$5,000 to Wong's bank account. Investigations also showed that Hua had subcontracted a portion of HSCE's works to Hua Chen Construction. Sometime in 2018, Hua Chen stopped performing these works as it was facing cashflow issues. As a result of this, in July 2018, Rich Construction Company terminated HSCE's subcontract for this portion of works and appointed a new subcontractor. HSCE was contractually obligated to pay the new subcontractor. Hua had tried to find other construction companies to replace Hua Chen, but was unsuccessful. In June 2018, he sent Wong a WhatsApp message asking him to ""press"" the new subcontractor ""a bit on price"" to minimise HSCE's financial losses. Wong was arrested by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) in November 2019. He did not repay Hua's loans before that. ""Hua admitted that he did not ask Wong for repayments as he did not wish to 'spoil' the relationship he had with Wong, who was the site's project manager,"" stated court documents. Deputy Public Prosecutor Bryan Wong asked for a fine of at least S$28,000 to reflect the loss of confidence in Singapore's public administration caused by Hua's actions. He argued that Hua further sought to leverage on the corrupt relationship by sending Wong the June 2018 WhatsApp message to exercise influence over him. He also argued that Hua was not pressured into giving the corrupt loans. Hua's lawyer Vijay Kumar told the court that his client was put in a ""difficult position"" when Hua Chen only completed 70 per cent of the works it was subcontracted to do. He said that Hua's message to Wong to ""press"" on the price was a ""colloquial term"" that was not meant to ""squeeze"" Wong. He also said that the end result was ""nothing"" as Wong was unable to influence the price. In sentencing, Judge Victor Yeo said a high fine was appropriate to send a strong message to deter like-minded offenders. Mr Kumar informed the court that his client had made voluntary restitution of S$7,000 to CPIB, and asked that the fine be offset by this amount. The judge granted this request, and ordered Hua to pay the balance of S$11,000."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singliworld-forex-trading-pyramid-scheme-investment-fraud-2591016,"Two company directors on trial for cheating 2,000 investors in forex trading pyramid scheme","SINGAPORE: Two company directors accused of cheating more than 2,000 investors in a fraudulent foreign exchange trading pyramid scheme from 2014 to 2015 went on trial at the State Courts on Monday (Mar 28). Malaysians Leong Koon Wah and Ng Kuan Chuan face a total of eight charges under the Companies Act, Securities and Futures Act and Multi-Level Marketing and Pyramid Selling (Prohibition) Act. Leong, 49, was the managing director of local company Singliworld from December 2012. He was also a director of overseas-incorporated Triumph Global and Union Markets, which purported to be forex trading brokerages. Ng, 35, was a director of Triumph Global and involved in the management of Union Markets. Singliworld started soliciting customers to invest in a ""Singliforex"" scheme sometime in early 2014, said Deputy Public Prosecutors Nicholas Tan and Michelle Tay. Singliforex claimed to generate trading returns as high as 13 per cent a month and conservative returns as low as 2 per cent a month, allowing it to appear ""both attractive and realistic at the same time"", said the prosecution. Prospective customers were required to open an account with a forex brokerage specified by Singliworld. The designated company was Triumph Global from March 2014 to April 2015, and Union Markets from May 2015 onwards. Investors were required to fund their account but not allowed to conduct any of their own trades. Instead, they were told that professional traders would conduct forex trading on their behalf. By May 2015, Singliworld's liabilities had exceeded US$17 million (S$23 million). ""In reality, there were no such genuine traders, no such genuine trading, and no such genuine trading returns,"" said the prosecution. ""Investors were sent daily statements falsely purporting to show that the trades therein had genuinely taken place."" Investors were purportedly entitled to 70 per cent of the net profit made from their forex trading account, with the other 30 per cent supposedly going to the professional traders. They were told that they would be charged a commission of US$40 per ""standard lot"" of foreign currency traded, with 0.24 standard lots being the typical daily trade volume for an investor who had put in US$1,000. In fact, Triumph Global and Union Markets were not connected to a single liquidity provider to trade foreign currency, and did not hold any capital markets licence to carry out leveraged foreign exchange trading, argued the prosecution. Singliforex allegedly also operated as a pyramid scheme, with investors being told they could make money by getting others to invest in the scheme. The scheme purportedly offered ""rebates"" to investors for trading activities of people they recruited into the scheme. Investors became ""sponsors"" or ""uplines"" for those they recruited, who were known as their ""downlines"". Sponsors could earn ""network rebates"" of up to US$3 per standard lot traded in a downline's account, up to five levels of downlines. They could also earn ""leadership rebates"" of up to US$4 per standard lot traded in their own account and the accounts of all their downlines. This allowed the scheme to grow exponentially from an initial handful of investors, with Leong and Ng together responsible for its ""success"", said the prosecution. Leong allegedly ran Singliworld's marketing operations and solicited investors to join the scheme. Ng was allegedly responsible for managing the staff of Triumph Global and operating the software purportedly used to trade in the investors' accounts. The trial continues. The prosecution is expected to lead evidence from Singliworld's office and Leong's electronic sources, among others."

Police arrested the men, aged 66 and 39, at the DBS Bank at Plaza Singapura on Tuesday. The 66-year-old man had allegedly presented three S$10,000 notes and one S$1,000 note to be deposited into his corporate bank account. But the bank teller suspected that the S$10,000 notes were fake, and credited only the S$1,000 note into the account, the police said. Police were alerted, and the men were arrested after preliminary investigations. Five counterfeit S$10,000 notes were seized, including two additional counterfeit notes that the older man surrendered to the police. Officers also raided the older man’s residence and the 39-year-old’s hotel room and recovered some documents believed to be forged. “The police take a serious view of any person found criminally involved in counterfeit currency,” the police said in a news release. Those found guilty of forging or counterfeiting currency or bank notes, or of using counterfeit notes as genuine, face a jail term of up to 20 years and a fine. The same maximum penalty applies for those who make or possess instruments or materials for forging currency or bank notes. For possessing them, offenders can be jailed up to 15 years and fined. The police also reminded the public to be wary of counterfeit notes. If they do receive one, they should call 999 immediately. They should note how the person looks, as well as the description of the vehicle used if any. “Limit the handling of the suspected counterfeit note and place it in a protective covering, such as an envelope, to prevent further tampering. Hand it over to the police immediately,” the news release said. Information on the security features of genuine Singapore currency can be found on the Monetary Authority of Singapore website."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/drunk-taxi-driver-fall-asleep-wheel-hit-run-sle-2585511,"Jail for drunk taxi driver who fell asleep at wheel, fled after collision on SLE","SINGAPORE: A taxi driver was drink-driving along Seletar Expressway (SLE) in 2020 when he fell asleep at the wheel, suddenly swerved and collided with a car. He eventually fled the scene after insisting he had not hit any car, despite another driver pointing out the damage to his own taxi. Lim Chee Yong, 45, was on Friday (Mar 25) jailed 12 weeks, disqualified from driving for four years and fined S$800. He had earlier pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing hurt and failing to render help to the victim. District Judge Carol Ling said it was fortuitous that the harm caused to the other driver was low. The victim suffered strains along his neck, upper back, left shoulder and wrists as well as a knee contusion, and was placed on five days of medical leave. However, the damage to the victim's vehicle was high, with repairs costing more than S$17,000. The accident took place while Lim was driving his taxi home on the SLE towards the Central Expressway at about 11.40pm on Apr 6, 2020. At the time, he had not switched on the headlights and taillights of his taxi and was driving above the speed limit, at 94kmh, according to court documents. While driving, Lim fell asleep at the wheel and suddenly swerved left into the path of the victim's car. The taxi collided forcefully with the rear right end of the car. The victim's car spun and hit the centre divider of the expressway before skidding back across all three lanes. It came to a stop at the left road shoulder, facing against the flow of traffic. Instead of stopping, Lim continued to drive away from the accident location. A witness who was driving behind both vehicles saw this and pursued Lim in his car. The witness managed to force Lim to a stop by cutting into his lane. He told Lim that he had hit a car and asked him if he was trying to run away. Lim, who seemed to be in a daze, claimed that he had not hit any car. He appeared to be drunk and reeked of alcohol. The witness asked Lim to switch off the engine and exit his taxi, and showed him the damage to the taxi's front bumper. The two then walked along the expressway shoulder to the victim's car. The witness pointed out the car to Lim and asked him to help the victim. But Lim continued insisting he had not hit any car. They eventually walked back to their own vehicles and the witness started to call the police. While he was doing so, Lim got into his car and quickly drove away, with his headlights and taillights still switched off. The witness was unable to stop him. Video footage of the accident was captured on the witness' in-vehicle camera. Another witness also called the police after seeing Lim drive his damaged taxi into a car park. In sentencing, Judge Ling noted that Lim's sentence was liable for enhancement due to his earlier driving offences. He has five previous convictions for speeding and driving while under a disqualification, with the most recent offence in 2013."

The men, aged between 32 and 49, were arrested by the Police Coast Guard (PCG) on Mar 23 in a joint operation with the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) for illegally transacting three metric tons of marine fuel at sea, off Sembawang Shipyard.

The foreign-registered tugboat and cash amounting to S$31,000 were seized. The three crew members of the Singapore-registered tugboat will be charged in court on Friday with criminal breach of trust as servant, and the seven crew members of the foreign registered tugboat will be charged in court with dishonestly receiving stolen property. If found guilty of criminal breach of trust as servant, an individual can be jailed for up to 15 years and fined. Those found guilty of receiving stolen property can be jailed for up to five years, fined, or both.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-pose-ica-officer-sexual-favours-bribe-special-pass-masseuse-2583756,"Man who posed as former ICA officer jailed for getting sexual favours, bribes","SINGAPORE: A man pretended to be a former immigration officer in order to obtain sexual favours and bribes from a masseuse who wanted help securing a Special Pass. Singaporean Kelvin Lim Chee Wee, 44, was on Thursday (Mar 24) sentenced to 23 weeks in prison after pleading guilty to five counts of corruption. He was also fined S$6,500 for operating an unlicensed massage establishment. Lim became a regular customer of the masseuse, Chinese national Cheng Wenjuan, in March 2019. It was reported that Ms Cheng died in August last year while facing corruption charges and charges under the Women's Charter, which have since been abated. She was linked to another case of corruption involving an actual Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officer, Teo Hwee Peng, who is claiming trial. The court heard that on May 11, 2019, Ms Cheng told Lim that she had been arrested for vice-related offences and believed she would soon be repatriated. Lim told her that he used to work for ICA, had friends who were still working there and would be able to help her obtain a Special Pass. According to court documents, none of this was true. After this, Lim and Ms Cheng had sex for the first time. Unlike previous occasions, when he had paid her for massages and sexual favours, he did not offer to pay her. Ms Cheng also did not ask for payment because she believed Lim would help her with her immigration status. Later, Lim told Ms Cheng that it would cost S$5,000 to pay an ICA officer to secure her Special Pass. When Ms Cheng said she only wanted to give the money after the pass was issued, he told her the officer wanted it before assisting her. He collected S$3,000 from her later that month. On May 28, 2019, Lim went to Ms Cheng's home and had sex with her there. Again, no payment was offered or asked for. At this meeting, Ms Cheng told Lim that ""she wanted to be arrested in mid-July"" as part of the plan to secure her Special Pass. Lim said he could arrange this, but the cost would increase to S$15,000. He also told her he needed even more money to arrange suitable accommodation for her arrest. The growing costs angered Ms Cheng, who told Lim to pay her for the sexual services he had previously not paid for. Lim then threatened to stop helping her with her Special Pass, and she relented. Lim ultimately told Ms Cheng she could pay him S$8,000 and she agreed. On Jun 10, 2019, he went to her home and collected S$2,000. ""In truth, he had provided her with no assistance at all,"" stated court documents. Lim did not use the money he received from Ms Cheng to pay any ICA officer, instead spending it on his personal expenses and debts. His offences continued when, on Jul 14, 2019, Ms Cheng asked him if he could help after her friend was arrested for vice-related offences. Lim said he would need S$2,000 for his friend in ICA to help secure another Special Pass. Ms Cheng gave him the money. When Ms Cheng later learned that her friend had been released on the same night of her arrest without Lim's intervention, she grew angry and asked him to return the money. Lim lied that the money had been paid to his friend, who would not make a refund. On Thursday, Lim also admitted to operating Marrie Bella Massage, an unlicensed massage establishment that was raided in November 2020. A customer informed the police that he had visited the shop twice prior and was provided sexual services on both occasions. Deputy Public Prosecutor David Menon said Lim's actions brought the ICA into disrepute and could have led to a loss of confidence in Singapore's public administration by suggesting that the authority was susceptible to corruption. He added that Lim's conduct ensnared him in a broader web of corruption resulting in media coverage that tarnished ICA's reputation. Mr Menon also argued that Lim's threat to Ms Cheng on May 28, 2019, which was in order to secure personal benefit, warranted a longer jail term. In mitigation, defence lawyer Paul Loy said that Lim had voluntarily made full restitution of the money to Ms Cheng months before any criminal charges were filed against him. He argued that the public interest was not a consideration, as Lim did not know any ICA officers and never had any actual intention of bribing an ICA officer. He also said that media publicity was not unexpected for criminal cases, and that the publicity in this case was focused on the related case involving a real ICA officer. Mr Loy also disagreed on the weight that should be placed on Lim's threat to Ms Cheng, arguing that it was not egregious to threaten to refuse to do something wrongful. The prosecution responded that Lim's restitution of the money should not be taken as an expression of remorse as it was made after investigations had started, when Lim was ""worn down"" by Ms Cheng's efforts to demand repayment."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-pretend-woman-online-social-media-solicit-sex-2583546,"Man gets jail for pretending to be ex-schoolmate, soliciting sex online","SINGAPORE: Over a period of five years, a man pretended to be his ex-schoolmate online, making social media posts that led to the woman being contacted by strangers asking to meet up for sex. Pay Wee Meng, 27, was on Thursday (Mar 24) sentenced to 12 weeks' jail after pleading guilty to two counts of stalking under the Protection from Harassment Act. Two more charges were considered for sentencing. The victim's identity is protected by a gag order. The offender and victim were former secondary schoolmates. The court heard that after graduating from secondary school, Pay created social media accounts using the victim's name and photographs from her own accounts. ""Using the accounts which he created, he posted captions with sexual connotations as he wanted other guys to talk to him about sex,"" stated court documents. From 2016 to 2021, Pay impersonated the victim on Tumblr, posting photos of her and communicating with other people to suggest that she was open to having sex with strangers. He also did this on another website from 2016 to 2018. Similar actions on two other social media platforms formed the charges taken into consideration. The victim found out when she was informed by friends and strangers that there was someone pretending to be her online. She checked and saw her photographs and the posts soliciting sex. As a result of the posts, she was contacted by strangers asking her to meet up for sex. Her friends also received text messages from strangers asking if they knew the victim. The prosecutor said Pay's actions had caused harm to the victim's reputation as well as her mental health. Her stress was aggravated when she was contacted by strangers for sex, he said, as people were able to trace the photographs used by Pay to the victim's real social media accounts. Pay, who was unrepresented, asked for a lenient sentence as he did not earn much money and needed to support his family. He also said he had learnt from his mistakes."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-jailed-medical-leave-flu-symptoms-covid-19-2583021,"Jail for man who refused MC, went to work, food centres with flu-like symptoms","SINGAPORE: A man who had flu-like symptoms in March 2020 refused a medical certificate, instead continuing to go to work and visiting food centres and a shopping mall during the COVID-19 pandemic. Zac Leow Zhi Xiang, 35, told the doctor that he could not afford to be on medical leave as he had just started a new job and was on work probation. He was sentenced on Thursday (Mar 24) to seven weeks' jail after pleading guilty to a single charge under the Infectious Diseases Act. Leow went to see a doctor in the afternoon of Mar 27, 2020 with a cough, according to court documents. He was diagnosed with a fever and symptoms related to an upper respiratory tract infection. He was not tested for COVID-19. The doctor told Leow he would issue him with a five-day medical certificate (MC) requiring Leow not to leave his residence during that period. Leow left the clinic before the MC was issued to him, even though he had reason to suspect he may have been infected with COVID-19, the court heard. He spent nine hours in public that day, visiting ABC Brickworks Market, Block 216 Bedok North Street 1, Jem and Block 692A Jurong West Central 1. Leow left his house again every day from Mar 28 to Mar 31, 2020, part of the period during which he was required to stay home under the MC. Over the weekend on Mar 28  and Mar 29, 2020, he went to Boon Lay Place Market and Food Village and Yuhua Place, and visited the Jurong West Central 1 location again. He went to work at Alexandra Technopark on Mar 30 and Mar 31, 2020, remaining there for more than 11 hours each day. Deputy Public Prosecutor Timotheus Koh said Leow's actions posed a risk to the public and that he had acted with ""reckless disregard"" even though he knew of his symptoms. Leow visited locations that would have seen high human traffic, and the total amount of time he spent out of his house was substantial, said the prosecutor. Mr Koh also pointed out that despite Leow's reason for refusing the MC, he went out on days when he was not working and did not take steps to explain the situation to his employer. ""There was no urgency or necessity for the accused to move about in public during this period,"" said Mr Koh. Defence lawyer Wee Pan Lee asked the court to consider his client's reason for refusing the medical leave as he was on work probation at the time. After the sentence was delivered, Mr Wee asked for a deferment of the jail term so that Leow could give notice to his employer. The deferment was granted."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/golfer-drunk-driving-hit-bus-lifetime-ban-2581331,"Drunk golfer backed car into bus, jailed and banned from driving for life","SINGAPORE: After playing golf at Orchid Country Club, a man drank alcohol with friends for more than two hours at a nearby eatery. Quah Soon Hoe decided to drive home after drinking, but along the way, backed his car into a bus along Sembawang Road. The results of his breath analyser test that night exceeded the limit of 35 microgrammes of alcohol in 100ml of breath by more than three times. Quah, 61, was on Wednesday (Mar 23) handed a lifetime driving ban and jailed five months and one week over the 2021 incident. He was also fined S$25,000. He pleaded guilty to one count each of driving under the influence of alcohol, driving without care and using insulting words on a police officer. Two other charges were considered for sentencing. On Apr 20 last year, Quah and his friends went drinking at an eatery close to the Orchid Country Club golf range near Lower Seletar Reservoir from about 7.30pm. Quah left the eatery in his car around 9.45pm. The court heard that he planned to drive about 6km to his home at Jalan Kemuning in Sembawang. Around 10.50pm, police received a report that Quah's red car had stopped at the bus stop opposite Chong Pang Camp along Sembawang Road and was not moving. When police officers arrived around 11pm, they found the rear bumper of the car had collided into the front of the bus. They also saw Quah inside the car with his head down and eyes closed. Investigations showed that at about 10.50pm, Quah was driving along the bus stop. The bus had stopped behind his car to let passengers alight, when Quah reversed his car into the other vehicle. The bus sustained scratches and dents. There were no injuries, but the collision resulted in more than S$5,200 worth of costs incurred by the Land Transport Authority, which have since been paid by Quah. Quah reeked of alcohol and was in a daze with incoherent speech when asked to step out of the car. When a police sergeant asked for his particulars, he used a vulgarity towards the officer. When another officer later approached to interview Quah about a suspected drunk-driving offence, he swore again and was uncooperative, denying that he had had any drinks. As Quah reeked of alcohol, he was taken to a police station where he failed the breath analyser test at about 1.40am. Deputy Public Prosecutor Gladys Lim sought a lifetime driving ban as well as at least six months' jail and a S$25,000 fine. She noted that Quah had a ""vast array"" of previous driving offences, indicating a disregard for the safety of others. His last drunk-driving related offence was in 2002, when he refused to take a breath analyser test. She also pointed out that Quah had intended to travel a distance of about 6km while drunk, and had actually travelled almost 5km until the point of the bus collision. She said there were no extenuating reasons for him to be driving while intoxicated, as he was merely returning home.  Defence lawyer Kalaithasan Karuppaya told the court that his client had written a letter of apology to the police officers he insulted, and made full restitution for the damage to the bus. In sentencing, District Judge Kok Shu En said that while Quah's last drunk-driving related offence was in 2002, she could not ignore that this was his fourth time appearing in court for such offences."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/jail-fine-former-secondary-school-teacher-voyeur-video-film-investigation-officer-2581131,"Jail, fine for former school teacher who took videos of students, colleagues and police officer in toilets","SINGAPORE: A former secondary school teacher was jailed 10 weeks and fined S$2,000 on Wednesday (Mar 23) for taking illicit videos of male students and colleagues in the school's toilets. The 49-year-old offender was nabbed after filming a police officer naked in a condominium's clubhouse toilet. He pleaded guilty last month to four charges of committing public nuisance by filming the victims and making obscene films. Another six charges were considered in sentencing. Gag orders imposed by the court prohibit the publication of the victims' identities, as well as the offender's name and school. District Judge Melissa Tan said that while a contributory link was found between the offender's persistent depression and his voyeurism, this was not significant. She considered aggravating factors such as the fact that the offender's actions showed premeditation, his victims were unaware they were being filmed, and the risk of dissemination from videos being taken on a mobile phone. There was also an element of abuse of trust where the victims were students of the school, the judge said. A court previously heard that the offender entered a secondary school toilet where a male student was urinating on Oct 30, 2017. He moved close to the student and filmed him urinating, without the student's knowledge. The 35-second video captured the victim's face and private parts. The offender filmed another student who was changing out of his shorts in a school toilet later that year. On Apr 15, 2018, he also filmed a fellow male teacher who was urinating in a school toilet. Later that same evening, the offender was in a condominium's clubhouse toilet when a 31-year-old police investigation officer, who had just finished swimming at the pool, entered for a shower. While the officer was naked and drying himself, the accused pretended to look for his condominium access card. He walked around the officer and filmed him, telling him he was trying to see if he had left his card on the shower ledge. The video captured the officer's private parts as well as his face.  The officer felt that the offender's behaviour was suspicious. After putting on his clothes, he went out of the toilet to look for the man. He approached the offender, identifying himself as a police officer. He told the offender he suspected the man had taken a video of him. They walked towards the condominium's guard house, where the officer briefed the security guards about what had happened and asked the offender to unlock his phone in their presence. The first thing that appeared when the offender did so was the video of the officer. Looking through the phone, the officer also saw numerous video recordings of naked men. One of the security guards made a police report. Police found a total of 128 obscene films made by the offender between February 2017 and April 2018 in a phone and laptop that were seized. They included videos the offender recorded while standing next to unsuspecting victims at the urinal. At least three of the videos were of teachers using a school toilet, and at least two were of students using a school toilet. At least 46 were recorded in the condominium's clubhouse toilet."

He reached under her clothes and touched her breast but the patient, a 42-year-old woman, could not ask for help as she was completely paralysed and could not speak or move. The offender was caught after a nurse tending to another patient saw what he was doing. The Singaporean man pleaded guilty on Wednesday (Mar 23) to using criminal force on the woman to outrage her modesty. He will return to court for sentencing next month. The victim's identity and the hospital are protected by a gag order. The offender's name is not being reported as it could lead to the identification of the hospital. The court heard that the cleaner had been working at the hospital since 2020. At about 4.30pm on Apr 27 last year, he was mopping some water on the floor when he saw the victim lying in bed with the first two buttons of her pyjama top undone. He put his hand under the victim's top and touched her breast for 15 seconds. At this time, a nurse was helping another patient change diapers behind cubicle curtains. When she was done and drew the curtains back, she saw the man touching the victim. Shocked, the nurse shouted: ""What are you doing!"" The man removed his hand without saying anything, then left the ward to continue his work. The nurse approached the victim and asked if she was okay. The victim reacted by looking at her. The nurse then asked the victim if the man had touched her breast, and the victim blinked three times. She understood this to mean ""yes"" as it was their method of communication. The nurse told her supervisor what she had seen and a police report was made. The cleaner admitted in a police statement to touching the victim's breast. He claimed that he molested her because he had forgotten to take his medication and ""heard voices"" telling him to touch her. A psychiatric evaluation by an Institute of Mental Health doctor found that the man suffered from schizophrenia, but that his condition had not relapsed at the time of the offence. The doctor also found that he was not of unsound mind when he molested the patient. The victim was ""completely unable to protect herself"" due to her ""complete paralysis"", according to court documents. ""The accused knew that the victim was paralysed, that she was unable to speak and move, and that she was a vulnerable person,"" court documents stated. The offender is liable to receive an enhanced penalty of up to four years' jail for committing the offence against a vulnerable person, as well as a fine. He cannot be caned as he is above the age of 50. Deputy Public Prosecutor Ng Jun Chong asked for between 24 and 28 months' jail, with an additional two months in lieu of any caning. He highlighted that the victim was ""defenceless"" and unable to move the offender's hand away or to ask for help. ""But for the (nurse) catching him in the act, the accused might well have gotten away scot-free and no one would have known because of the victim's inability to express herself,"" said Mr Ng. While it was not possible to obtain a victim impact statement, Mr Ng argued that the victim must have experienced distress as she was molested in the hospital where she lived and had a right to feel safe and secure. There was also an abuse of trust by the cleaner as he was only able to gain access to the victim due to his employment in the hospital, said Mr Ng. In mitigation, defence lawyer Choo Si Sen said his client admitted his actions ""right at the beginning"", and had only touched the patient's breast for ""a very short time"". Mr Choo asked the court to assess his client's suitability for a mandatory treatment order - which directs an offender suffering from certain treatable psychiatric conditions to undergo psychiatric treatment - or probation. However, District Judge Kessler Soh questioned whether the offender could be given a community-based sentence in this case. He adjourned sentencing to give the defence more time to consider the sentencing submissions."

The suspects, comprising 30 men and two women, were identified during a two-week joint crime suppression operation between Feb 25 and Mar 11. The operation was led by the Secret Societies Branch of Criminal Investigation Department and supported by the seven police land divisions and the Singapore Food Agency, the police said in a news release. A total of 364 people and 100 public entertainment and nightlife establishments that had pivoted to food and beverage operations were checked for unlawful activities and adherence to safe management measures during the island-wide operation. The police said that 26 men, aged between 16 and 41, were arrested for being suspected members of unlawful societies, said the police. Separately, a 30-year-old man was arrested after allegedly causing a public disturbance when the police arrested his brother for being a suspected member of an unlawful society at the junction of Lorong Telok and Circular Road. A 29-year-old woman who allegedly tried to pull police officers away during the arrest of the 30-year-old man was arrested for obstructing a public servant in duty. During the incident, another 28-year-old woman allegedly shouted vulgarities at the officers and was arrested for using abusive language against a public servant, the police said. In another incident, a 24-year-old man was allegedly found in possession of a pair of ice tongs along Circular Road, and purportedly attempted to discard the item when approached by police officers. He was arrested for carrying an offensive weapon, the police said. Two men, aged 29 and 32, were “wanted for failing to attend in obedience to order from public servant”, said the police. Investigations against all 32 people are ongoing. “The police have zero tolerance towards secret society and unlawful activities that threaten the public safety, peace, and good order,” they said. They added that the police will continue to conduct regular enforcement operations at the various public entertainment and nightlife establishments and popular hotspots. Firm action will be taken against those who are associated with secret societies and blatantly disregard the law, the police said.   “Members of the public are also advised to steer clear of secret society activities and to report those engaging in such unlawful activities to the police immediately.” The offence of being a member of an unlawful society carries an imprisonment term of up to three years, a fine of up to S$5,000, or both.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/clarke-quay-new-years-eve-gathering-charges-2579031,Four more men charged with breaching COVID-19 rules at New Year's Eve gathering in Clarke Quay,"SINGAPORE: Four more men were on Tuesday (Mar 22) charged with breaching COVID-19 safe management measures at a New Year's Eve gathering in the Clarke Quay area. They are Assiddiq Surani, 22; Lee Hern Sing, 20; Varghese Divin, 30; and Adam Abdullah, 19. Their nationalities were not specified in charge sheets. This brings to 14 the total number of people who have been charged in relation to the New Year's Eve gathering. Videos circulated on social media in January showed crowds gathered outside Riverside Point in Clarke Quay to usher in the new year. The COVID-19 multi-ministry task force had called it ""a potential superspreading event"". Assiddiq is accused of not wearing a mask over his nose and mouth and not keeping a distance of at least 1m from other people near Read Bridge at Clarke Quay at about 12.15am on Jan 1. He told the court that he was claiming trial. When asked by the judge if he was not admitting to the charges, he replied no because ""it was not intended"". Lee is accused of attending a gathering of more than five people near Read Bridge ""for a common purpose, namely to record footage of street interviews"" around midnight on Jan 1. He also allegedly failed to keep a 1m distance from others. Lee was the only one of the four with a lawyer, who asked for time to make representations. His case will be heard again on Apr 19. Divin was charged with not wearing a mask and not keeping a 1m distance from others at the walkway between the Singapore River and Clarke Quay Central at about 11pm on Dec 31, 2021. Adam was charged with the same two breaches of COVID-19 rules, allegedly committed near Read Bridge at about 12.05am on Jan 1. Both Divin and Adam said they intend to plead guilty and asked the prosecution for an indication of the likely sentences. Their cases will return to court next month. Kotra Venkata Sai Rohankrishna, who was earlier handed three charges over the gathering, also had his case heard again on Tuesday. He is accused of failing to wear a mask near Read Bridge. Court documents state that Kotra was dressed in a Spider-Man costume at the time and allegedly interacted with about 20 people. This included the recording of videos and photos, according to the charge sheet. He is also accused of failing to keep a 1m distance from several other people there. Kotra's defence lawyer Lim Shu Yi said that she had made representations for her client earlier on Tuesday. This came after she received the prosecution's sentencing position and took further instructions from her client. Ms Lim confirmed that her client would still be pleading guilty, pending the prosecution's response to her representations. Kotra's case will return to court on Apr 12. The Urban Redevelopment Authority said on Monday that another three people were served notices of composition (NOCs) of S$1,000 each for breaching safe management measures. A total of 19 people have been served NOCs over the gathering."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ntu-research-fellow-upskirt-photos-voyeur-arrest-jail-2577071,"NTU research fellow who took upskirt photos around university, shopping malls gets jail","SINGAPORE: A 30-year-old man took upskirt photos of women from 2015 until his arrest in 2021, including at numerous locations around Nanyang Technological University (NTU), shopping malls and MRT stations. Guo Zhihong was sentenced on Monday (Mar 21) to 10 months and five weeks' jail. He pleaded guilty to two charges of voyeurism and one charge of insulting a woman's modesty. Another seven charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. Taking all the charges into consideration, Guo recorded more than 2,200 upskirt photos over the six-year period. The court heard that Guo was a research staff member at NTU's School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the time of the offences. Responding to CNA's queries, an NTU spokesperson said that Guo's employment was terminated with effect from Apr 22, 2021.  ""NTU has a zero tolerance stance towards all forms of harassment, including voyeurism and sexual misconduct,"" said the spokesperson. Guo had taken upskirt photos at several locations in NTU, including the overhead bridge near the Lee Wee Nam Library, around Hall 11 and its bus stop, and around Quad Cafe and Canteen B in the South Spine area. He also committed the offences at staircases outside the Lee Wee Nam Library and Nanyang Auditorium, a staircase leading to NTU North Hill and a staircase within the South Spine area. Guo found other victims in various shopping malls in Orchard Road and Somerset and The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. He also took upskirt photos around MRT stations including at Orchard, Jurong East, Pioneer, Boon Lay, Dhoby Ghaut and Bukit Batok. ""Whenever the accused saw women wearing skirts, shorts or yoga pants whom he found attractive, he would take full body back view photos and upskirt photos of them,"" said the prosecution. He stored the photos on a hard disk and later, when the hard disk stopped working, on a laptop. The photos were kept in folders labelled in chronological order, based on when they were recorded. Guo's offences were discovered when he was caught in the act on Apr 11 last year. He had made plans to have dinner by himself and take upskirt photos at Orchard MRT station. At about 8.15pm, Mr Seah Choon Kong, was walking from ION Orchard to Orchard MRT station when he noticed Guo walking closely behind the victim and her female companion. Mr Seah saw that Guo was holding his mobile phone below the victim's skort - a pair of shorts with an overlapping fabric give the appearance of a skirt. On an escalator that was travelling upwards at Wheelock Place, Mr Seah saw Guo take upskirt photos of the victim from where he was standing a step below her. After confirming with the victim and her female companion that Guo was not their friend, Mr Seah told the women that Guo had been following them for some time and had behaved ""suspiciously, by standing close to them and filming them from a low angle"". Mr Seah then confronted Guo and asked to see the photo gallery on his phone. Guo at first refused and was seen fiddling with his phone, as if trying to reset it. He was stopped from doing so. When Guo finally relented, he showed them a random album in his gallery with no photos in it. He also reduced the brightness of his screen, making excuses that his battery was running low and that he had personal contents on the phone he did not want them to see. He also tried to leave, but was detained by Mr Seah and two other male passers-by while the mall's security was alerted. When the police arrived, Guo initially refused to unlock his phone and tried to do something with his photo gallery. His phone was then seized by the police, who examined the gallery and found multiple photos of women's buttocks. Guo admitted to the police that he had taken those photos without the women's consent in the past few weeks. After forensic examination, a total of 19 photos were also found in the phone. Police raided Guo's apartment a day after he was caught, seizing six more electronic devices. The collection of upskirt images on Guo's laptop and phone included 622 photos belonging to 100 unknown victims. He admitted to recording these in 2020 at different locations around Singapore without the women's consent. Police also found another 315 photos of 72 unknown women recorded in Singapore in 2016 on his laptop. Deputy Public Prosecutor Lee Wen Kym asked for 11 to 14 months' jail. She said Guo was a prolific serial upskirter with no fewer than 400 victims, who committed his offences with premeditation. He had admitted to planning outings to record upskirt photos. She also highlighted that some of Guo's photos were taken on a university campus, ""where students should be able to feel safe and not worry about the risk of voyeuristic images of them being captured""."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/jail-man-cheat-purtier-placenta-riway-iphones-carousell-2576981,"Jail for man who cheated victims of more than S$70,000 by claiming to sell health supplements, iPhones","SINGAPORE: A man who claimed to be selling health supplements and iPhones to Carousell buyers cheated his victims out of more than S$70,000. Sylvester See Sheng Sen, 29, was jailed 14 months on Monday (Mar 21) after pleading guilty to nine charges of cheating. Another 17 counts of cheating and two counts of unlawful remote gambling were taken into consideration. The court heard that See lied to four of his victims that he was selling Purtier Placenta health supplements, carried by local company Riway International. The products could be bought using cash or points issued as part of Riway's membership plan. The points were valued at S$1 each and a 10 per cent administrative fee was deducted for conversion into cash, according to court documents. Sometime in September 2020, See contacted the first victim and offered to sell Purtier products to him. Court documents did not specify how they knew each other. See told the victim that he knew a senior member of Riway's programme who could provide 40 sets of Purtier products at a discounted price of S$30,000. The victim was interested, and asked to pay half of the price in S$15,000 cash and the other half in 15,000 Riway points. See made an arrangement with a third person who agreed to receive 15,000 Riway points in exchange for S$13,500, which was the amount in cash after the deduction of the administrative fee. On Sep 21, 2020, the victim paid for the 40 sets of Purtier products by transferring S$15,000 to See's bank account and 15,000 points to the third person's Riway account. He was told the products would arrive in four days at the latest, but he never received them. ""In truth, the accused did not intend to sell any Purtier sets to (the victim) and his representations to (the victim) were false,"" stated court documents. See instead used the S$15,000 from the victim and S$13,500 he received from the third person for his personal expenses, debts and gambling. He repeated this with three more victims, contacting them and offering to sell each of them five sets of Purtier products for S$3,500 in December 2020 and May 2021. See also lied to five other victims that he was selling iPhones. In most of these cases, he browsed through Carousell and found victims who had indicated on the e-commerce platform that they wanted to buy iPhones. One such offence took place when See was short of money in September 2021. He contacted a victim he found on Carousell and offered to sell the victim an iPhone 13 Pro Max phone for S$1,700. The victim agreed to the purchase and transferred the amount to See's bank account. See again used the money for his personal expenses, debt and gambling. The prosecution sought 13 to 16 months' jail for See. While the offender's method of cheating was ""straightforward"", he offended repeatedly, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Sunil Nair. See was unrepresented. During mitigation, a written plea from his mother was read out in court by a Mandarin interpreter. See's mother asked for leniency, saying that her son ""did not grow up in a very good environment, that is, he grew up in a family where parents often argued due to the lack of finances"". She said that her son was troubled by his parents' divorce in 2019, and that ""lack of supervision of his actions"" led him to make mistakes. In sentencing, District Judge Lee Lit Cheng told See: ""You are not a young person who is not able to think for yourself. You are 29 years old. You need to decide for yourself what you want to do with your life."" She noted that See had a previous conviction. He was fined S$8,000 for stealing S$12,000 worth of valuables from his then father-in-law in 2019. ""I do not know whether you took the fine lightly,"" said Judge Lee, ""but the offences you have committed this time round are serious, and they are many""."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/men-charged-singpass-login-details-bank-accounts-crime-syndicate-2573711,2 men to be charged for allegedly giving Singpass login and bank account details for 'easy money',"SINGAPORE: Two men will be charged on Monday (Mar 21) with allegedly giving their Singpass login details and relinquishing their bank accounts to ""unknown people for easy money"", the police said on Friday. The men, aged 19 and 25, had seen advertisements on Telegram and Instagram offering them cash in exchange for their Singpass details. ""Their Singpass details were then purportedly used by scam syndicates to open bank accounts,"" said the police.  ""Their relinquished bank accounts, as well as the bank accounts opened by the syndicate, were all allegedly used to launder proceeds of cheating offences."" Investigations revealed that in early 2021, the 19-year-old man was alleged to have disclosed his Singpass login details after he responded to an Instagram story asking if anyone was interested in earning fast cash. His details were used to access his Singpass account and open three bank accounts with Citibank and CIMB Bank, said the police.  These bank accounts were then used to launder proceeds of crime, amounting to more than S$77,000.  ""In addition, he was allegedly approached by a member of a scam syndicate on Telegram to sell his bank account,"" said the police. He created a Standard Chartered Bank account and allegedly relinquished control of the account to the syndicate. He will also be charged for allegedly relinquishing his personal United Overseas Bank account to an online gambling syndicate in exchange for cash. Investigations showed that in August last year, the 25-year-old man saw an advertisement on Telegram offering him cash in exchange for his Singpass details. After he handed over his Singpass login details, a syndicate was able to register a Standard Chartered Bank account in his name. The bank account was used to launder proceeds of crime amounting to more than S$850,000, including the proceeds of a job scam. The man also allegedly sold his OCBC Bank account for ""fast cash"" to a member of another syndicate who he met on Telegram in September last year.  This bank account was used to launder proceeds of crime amounting to S$55,000.  ""Disclosing Singpass login details and relinquishing bank accounts to other persons can constitute offences under the Computer Misuse Act,"" said the police.  ""Crime syndicates may make use of the disclosed Singpass login details to access the Singpass accounts and open bank accounts, which are then used to launder the proceeds of crime. ""To avoid becoming involved in money laundering activities, members of the public should always reject requests to disclose their Singpass login details, or allow their personal bank accounts to be used to receive and transfer money for others.""  If found guilty of disclosing their Singpass login details, the men could be jailed for up to three years, fined up to S$10,000, or both, for first-time offenders. For allegedly relinquishing control of their bank accounts, the men could be jailed for up to two years and/or fined up to S$5,000. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-stab-attack-nparks-officer-park-connector-sever-thumb-2572881,"Man jailed more than 13 years for stabbing, slashing NParks safe distancing officer in 'merciless' attack","SINGAPORE: A 62-year-old man who stabbed and slashed a safe distancing enforcement officer during an outing to pick pandan leaves was on Friday (Mar 18) sentenced to 13 years and four months' imprisonment. Ahirrudin Al-Had Haji Arrifin attacked the National Parks Board (NParks) officer at Sungei Serangoon Park on May 4, 2020 after he was asked to put on a mask and told that he could not harvest pandan leaves there. The 38-year-old victim's left thumb was almost severed in the attack. He suffered serious injuries to both hands as well as his chest, arm and scalp, undergoing surgery and receiving 89 days of medical leave. Ahirrudin, who was a rag-and-bone man, last week pleaded guilty to one count each of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, unlawfully possessing a scheduled weapon and violating COVID-19 control orders by not wearing a mask. He attacked the victim with a nearly 1m-long walking stick that contained a 20.8cm-long blade at its lower end, concealed by a wooden sheath. The judge said this length of a blade ""essentially transformed the walking stick into a spear"". He also used a karambit knife with a 10cm curved blade, which was hidden in his shoe. He had brought along two such knives to cut the pandan leaves. ""The accused's attack was simply senseless, abhorrent and callous,"" said Justice Tan Siong Thye in delivering his judgment. The assault was ""brutal and unprovoked"", and a ""wholly unjustifiable response"" to the victim's performance of his official duties, he said. The judge also pointed out the public interest considerations around the case. The attack took place during Singapore's ""circuit breaker"", when the work of safe distancing enforcement officers was especially crucial to stem the spread of COVID-19, he said. ""Such frontline enforcement officers were and still remain exceptionally susceptible to abuse and violence, yet they continue to place their health and personal safety at risk to enforce social distancing measures that protect the society,"" said Justice Tan. He said the sentence imposed was necessary to assure public servants of adequate protection and vindication by the law when performing their duties. Details of the attack were heard in court last week. The victim was driving through the park connector in a buggy with another NParks safe distancing enforcement officer when he spotted Ahirrudin unmasked, with pandan leaves in his bicycle basket. The two officers approached the man, telling him that he was not allowed to cut the pandan leaves at the park connector and asking him to wear a mask. Ahiruddin was uncooperative and grew increasingly agitated. After the victim called the police and took a video of him, Ahiruddin unsheathed the blade of his walking stick and stabbed the left side of the victim's chest. He later entered the buggy and forcefully pushed the blade further in at least two more times. Both men fell out of the buggy onto the grass. During the struggle, Ahiruddin retrieved a karambit knife from his shoe and slashed the victim with it, almost severing the man's left thumb. Throughout this ""merciless"" onslaught, the victim did not retaliate and only tried to fend off his attacker, who took advantage of his vulnerability, said Justice Tan. They continued struggling until a passer-by intervened. The victim, his fellow officer and the passer-by ran to Tampines Expressway to wait for an ambulance and the police. After the attack, Ahirrudin cycled home and hid the walking stick in a compartment at the washing area of the void deck. He was arrested later that afternoon outside a convenience store. Justice Tan questioned why Ahirrudin had so many weapons on him, saying: ""I wonder why the accused was heavily armed that day. If he wanted only to cut pandan leaves, he would just need a knife ... Why is there a need to bring along so many dangerous weapons for his protection, when his sole purpose was to cut pandan leaves?"" The judge cited a medical report stating that the stabs to the victim's chest could have been fatal if the blade had entered his heart. The victim's hand injuries could also have been life-threatening and caused a massive haemorrhage if not for the prompt medical attention he received. It was ""incredibly fortunate"" that this did not happen. He also noted comments by Dr Kang Yong Chiang of Singapore General Hospital that the depths of the victim's wounds in his left hand were typically caused by ""industrial tools like electric chain saws"", and a ""large degree of violence"" was involved in their creation. The injuries have caused lifelong effects to the victim, the judge noted. Despite months of rehabilitation, the victim still suffers diminished strength in his left hand and fingers, causing permanent inconvenience in daily life. He continues to experience psychological trauma and feels anxious whenever he sees knives, even in his own home. In imposing the sentence, Justice Tan noted that the offender was over the age of 50 and could not be caned. The total sentence included three months' jail given in lieu of the 18 strokes he would have received. The prosecution had sought 12 to 15 years' jail, arguing that public interest was one of the main considerations for sentencing, as Ahirrudin's actions ""undermined"" the safety and confidence of safe distancing officers. In mitigation, Ahiruddin's defence lawyer had said the man was deeply remorseful and that his attack on the victim was impulsive, without premeditation. The lawyer had asked for eight to 10 years' jail."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-rape-sexual-assault-4-daughters-sentence-jail-caning-2572536,Man jailed more than 33 years for sexually abusing 4 daughters over 14 years,"SINGAPORE: A man who sexually abused four of his daughters over 14 years was on Friday (Mar 18) sentenced to 33 years and two months' jail, and given the maximum 24 strokes of the cane. Delivering his judgment, Justice Tan Siong Thye called the man's abuse ""horrific"" and ""one of the worst cases of rape and sexual assault"" he had seen. The Singaporean offender, now 45, last week admitted to raping or sexually assaulting four of his daughters between 2004 and 2018. Over five days in September 2018, he also starved them when he was angry with them. He pleaded guilty last week to seven charges of aggravated rape, aggravated sexual assault, aggravated outrage of modesty and ill-treatment of a child. The victim in the charges was his daughter, now aged 16. She was aged 12 to 13 at the time of the offences. The offender and victim, identified as V1 in court documents, cannot be named due to gag orders on their identities. Twenty-six more charges, mostly for rape, sexual assault and outrage of modesty of the man's other daughters, were taken into consideration for sentencing. These included charges of hurting his wife by punching, caning and slapping her. The offender was a freelance camp instructor for kids' adventure camps prior to his arrest. He and his wife, now 41, have four other children together - three girls now aged 12, 18 and 19 and a boy now aged 15. He also has a 24-year-old daughter and a 23-year-old son from a previous marriage. Justice Tan noted that the man's sexual exploitation of his children started when his oldest daughter was only six to seven years old. Only his youngest daughter was spared. The man abused his position and the trust of his children as their biological father, said the judge. There was clear premeditation as the offender took deliberate steps to separate V1 from the family in order to assault her, said Justice Tan. An example of this was when he took her to the family's new flat that was still under construction and raped her there. The man also sexually groomed his daughter and tried to normalise his abuse by showing her a pornographic video of a man supposedly having sex with his daughter when the victim was in Primary 5. Justice Tan said the ""sheer number"" of charges taken into consideration ""speaks volumes about the accused's perverse exploitation of his own biological and vulnerable daughters"". These aggravating factors outweighed any mitigating weight of the offender's plea of guilt, which was done for self-serving reasons in hopes of a lenient sentence, rather than remorse, said the judge. ""To the children, the home is the haven where there is parental love, warmth, security, protection, solace, peace, harmony and equanimity,"" said Justice Tan. ""The accused destroyed the cherished values of the victims' sanctuary and turned their home into a living hell. He had caused unimaginable misery and untold torment to them for several years,"" he continued. As the number of strokes of the cane the offender was sentenced to exceeded the statutory maximum of 24 when added up, the man's sentence included an additional seven months' jail in lieu of the balance of 36 strokes. ""Offenders must not think that they can get away with the statutory maximum of 24 strokes of the cane by committing numerous rapes and sexual assaults,"" said Justice Tan. Deputy Public Prosecutors Muhamad Imaduddien, Sarah Siaw and Angela Ang had sought 32 years' jail and the maximum number of strokes of the cane. The man's pro bono defence lawyers, Ms Ng Pei Qi and Ms Sadhana Rai, had asked for 26 to 28 years' jail and the maximum caning sentence. Last week, the court heard details of the offender's sexual abuse of V1. This started in 2016, when she was in Primary 5, and usually happened at night while her mother was out working. In 2018, he told the victim that she needed to have sex with him monthly or he would stop her from going to school. She was afraid of having to remain home all day if she did not attend school, which would mean spending more time with her father and being abused by him. She did not dare to physically resist her father as she was afraid he would turn aggressive and withdraw her from school. She did not tell anyone because he made her promise not to, and she did not want him to hate her. She also feared no one would believe her, and that she would be sent away from her family to stay in a girls' home. As part of the abuse, the man also conducted ""body checks"" on the victim and two of her sisters, who were aged 14 or 15 and 15 or 16 at the time. In the evening of Sep 1, 2018, the man got angry that V1 and two of her sisters had brought their younger siblings to the playground before finishing their household chores to his satisfaction. He punished the girls by not allowing them and their younger brother, then about 12, to eat for the next four days. He threw away all the food in the house. He did not cook, and also forbade his wife from cooking, instead dining out if they wanted to eat. There were large bottles of water in the refrigerator, but he bound them together with rubber bands so he would know if the children had tampered with them. He also cut off the electricity supply to the family's lights, refrigerator and air-conditioner. When it was warm, the children fanned themselves with pieces of paper. Over the next four days, the children subsisted on tap water and food that was smuggled to them by other members of the family without their father's knowledge. The man only allowed his children to eat plain rice on the night of Sep 6, 2018. They resumed eating and drinking as usual the next day. Justice Tan said the offender's conduct pointed to the ""systematic isolation and starvation of the children far exceeding the threshold of mere discipline"". These offences painted a ""disturbing and tragic picture of the physical domination"" the man enjoyed over his family. The offender's abuse was discovered after the last time he raped V1, on Nov 16, 2018. Two of her sisters noticed the girl leaving the master bedroom that night and found it strange. When they asked her about it, she broke down and said that their father had just had sex with her. She also said this had been happening since she was in Primary 5. One of her sisters persuaded her to file a police report, and they decided to go to a police station far away from their house so their father could not find them. They left the flat after midnight under the pretence of going to throw rubbish and took a Grab car to a police station. There, V1 lodged a police report to say her father had been sexually assaulting her. After his daughters left the flat, the man searched for them at three police stations but to no avail. That morning, he spent more than an hour visiting websites on how to pass a lie detector test. He was arrested in the afternoon of Nov 17, 2018. After lodging the police report, the victim was taken to KK Women's and Children's Hospital, where she was warded for a week. She then stayed at a children's home for about two weeks before returning home. Justice Tan noted that victim impact statements by the man's daughters made clear the ""lasting trauma and painful wounds"" they lived with. V1 said there were times she blamed herself that her siblings no longer had a father, as it was the offender's final assault of her that led to the police report. ""Despite her family's support, she could not help but feel that she was fighting this emotional battle alone,"" said the judge.  ""She also stated that she would still have nightmares about the incidents at least once a month and has since lost trust in men."" Her older sister spoke about how painful it was to remain silent about the abuse, as she was afraid to break up her family. Another sister feared ""ever having a father figure in their home again, as it would serve as a reminder of the accused's deeds"", said the judge. ""Nothing can restore the victims' innocence or compensate for their suffering,"" said Justice Tan, but the sentence reflected the ""atrocities"" committed against them and would deter potential offenders."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/isd-suspect-radicalised-person-interviews-psychological-assessments-buangkok-sword-2570761,What ISD does when it suspects a person might have been radicalised,"SINGAPORE: In situations when a person is suspected to be radicalised, the Internal Security Department (ISD) said on Thursday (Mar 17) that it will conduct multiple interviews and run psychological assessments to evaluate if the individual is a security threat.  This is part of ISD's investigations into possible cases of radicalisation and takes into account any suspected signs of radicalisation displayed by a person. In the case of 37-year-old Fadhil Yusop, the man who was charged with voluntarily causing hurt after he was seen wielding a sword and hitting a man at Buangkok, ISD said that ""preliminary investigations thus far do not suggest that it is an act of terror"".  The agency added that it will continue to work with the police on the investigations and provide an update in due course. Following news that ISD had investigated Fadhil twice - once in 2016 and again in 2020 - and assessed that he was not radicalised, some people queried on social media how the authorities go about reaching that conclusion in such situations.  Responding to CNA's queries, ISD said in situations where indications of radicalisation are detected, it will conduct interviews with the suspect and those around him or her to gather further information. Psychological assessments may also be done where relevant to evaluate the person's ""propensity for violence"" and vulnerability to radical influences.  ""Based on the information obtained through various channels, an assessment will then be made on the security threat the person poses,"" said ISD.  The agency added that it is unable to provide specifics due to operation sensitivities and the unique circumstances of each case.  In 2016, Fadhil was investigated for sharing images online of militant groups such as HAMAS' Izz ad-Din Al-Qassam Brigades. He was given a written warning for his social media posts as ""there was no indication that he was radicalised or intended to engage in armed violence,"" said ISD in a statement on Tuesday. Four years later, he was arrested by the police after approaching the Imam at Masjid Al-Mawaddah with a knife.  “ISD’s joint investigations with police at the time did not suggest that Fadhil’s attack was terrorism-related,” the agency said, adding that Fadhil was referred for religious counselling after this incident ""as a matter of precaution"". As part of ISD's investigations into possible cases of radicalisation, the agency will establish if there is a basis to suspect that a person may be radicalised.  This takes into account any suspected signs of radicalisation displayed by the person, such as:  ""We will not hesitate to take firm action against any person who is radicalised and/or have engaged in terrorist conduct,"" said ISD.  This includes anyone who supports, promotes, undertakes or makes preparations to undertake armed violence, regardless of how they rationalise such violence, the agency added.  ISD also works in close partnership with other public agencies and community partners in countering security threats, including suspected radicalisation cases, it said.  For example, the agency may refer cases to other public agencies for parallel investigations and follow-ups, if there are indications that the individual may have committed other offences.  ISD may also work with other public agencies and community partners to tailor suitable interventions for the individual, such as counselling. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/bribe-reserve-limited-edition-sneakers-foot-locker-aw-lab-2570651,Former sportswear salesman fined for taking bribes to reserve limited edition sneakers,"SINGAPORE: A former sales associate of sportswear store AW LAB admitted on Thursday (Mar 17) to accepting bribes in exchange for reserving limited edition sneakers. Muhammad Faiz Amy Jasman, 30, obtained S$3,795 in ""reservation fees"" from a man named Bryan Fong, who would then resell the shoes for profit. Faiz was one of three men charged in the case. He was fined S$10,000 and given a penalty of S$$5,295 after pleading guilty. He has yet to disgorge the reservation fees he made from the offences. Another man, Xavier Goh Yixuan, who was an assistant store manager at Foot Locker, is accused of receiving more than S$12,000 in bribes. His case has yet to be concluded. The last man was Meng Fanxuan, a reseller who gave bribes for information on when the limited edition shoes would be launched. He was fined S$20,000 last December after pleading guilty. The court heard that in 2020, Faiz worked at the Wisma Atria outlet of AW LAB, which has since ceased operations in Singapore. He listed a pair of sneakers on Carousell and was contacted by Fong in response to the listing between July and August 2020. Faiz told Fong that he worked at AW LAB. Fong then asked if Faiz could help to reserve the listed sneakers on his behalf, and offered money for every reserved pair. ""The accused knew that he was not permitted to reserve the sneakers and that it was wrong to do so. Despite this, he accepted Bryan's offer,"" said the prosecution. AW LAB did not carry out official releases of limited edition sneakers, unlike other stores. It received deliveries of the sneakers much later, with employees informed of the arrival of the stock the day before. The two men worked out an arrangement where Faiz would reserve a pair of sneakers based on information from Fong. Faiz would then get Fong to transfer the purchase price of the sneakers and the reservation fees to his wife's bank account. Faiz's wife would then buy the reserved sneakers from the Wisma Atria store a few days later, and Fong would collect them from her. Faiz sought his wife's help as he was unable to buy the sneakers as a store employee. He also enlisted friends to help circumvent a store policy that limited each customer to five pairs of sneakers. They carried out this scheme on four occasions between Sep 11 and Oct 8, 2020. Fong bought a total of 49 pairs of sneakers using this method, transferring nearly S$10,000 to Faiz through his wife. The scheme allowed Fong to secure the limited edition sneakers ahead of the general public and without having to queue at the store. He resold them, earning a total estimated profit of S$800 to S$2,000, or between S$20 and S$50 per pair. District Judge Wong Li Tein told the court that Faiz's ""dishonest profiteering conduct"" meant members of the public would have to pay resellers more for the shoes, instead of getting them from the store. She also dismissed the notion that the customers could have just bought the shoes from other stores, pointing out that the ""intrinsic value"" of the sneakers was that they were rare."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/police-warn-phishing-scams-bank-impersonation-emails-video-calls-2570656,Police warn against phishing scams impersonating as banks,"SINGAPORE: The Singapore Police Force (SPF) warned members of the public on Thursday (Mar 17) against phishing scams involving the impersonation of banks, such as POSB, HSBC and UOB. According to the police, the scammers would impersonate banks using three scam variants. In the first variant, scammers would claim to be conducting surveys via spoofed emails. Victims would receive an email claiming to be from a bank. The email would indicate that the victim had been selected to participate in a survey and would receive a cash reward upon completion of the survey. After clicking on the URL embedded within the email, the victims would be redirected to a phishing website to complete the survey. Upon completion of the survey, the victims would be instructed to provide their credit/debit card details and the one-time password (OTP).  Believing that the information was required to process the cash reward, the victims would provide the details requested by the website.  Victims would only realise that they have been scammed when they discovered unauthorised transactions made using their credit/debit card. The second variant would see spoofed SMSes promoting a banking product sent to victims. The SMSes would include embedded spoofed links or numbers that the victims could contact to find out more about an ongoing banking promotion, such as fixed deposits or high interest rate savings promotions.  After clicking on the spoofed links, victims would be redirected to a phishing website where they would be instructed to provide their credit/debit card details and OTP.  In some cases where victims called the indicated number, the scammer would impersonate as a bank staff member and ask victims to transfer funds to a specific account number, claiming that this was the new account that they had opened for the victim as part of the promotion. In the third variant, scammers would video call victims with a bank logo as a backdrop via messaging applications such as WhatsApp. In the unsolicited call, scammers would claim to be from a bank, informing victims that unauthorised access to their bank account was detected.  Under the pretext of assisting to resolve the issue, the caller would request for the victims’ personal particulars and bank login details.  Victims would only realise that they have been scammed when they discovered unauthorised transactions in their bank account. The police advised members of the public to observe these crime prevention measures: Those with any information relating to such crimes can call the police hotline at 1800-255-0000 or submit it online.  For more information on scams, members of the public can visit the scam alert website or call the Anti-Scam Hotline at 1800-722-6688. A recent spate of SMS phishing scams targeting bank customers resulted in hundreds of OCBC Bank customers falling prey to online phishing scams in December 2021, with a total of S$13.7 million lost.  In February this year, the police said they had observed at least 900 cases of phishing scams since January, and also warned of the re-emergence of phishing scams involving the impersonation of police officers."

Ahmed Rayhan, 30, and Alam Foysal, 36, allegedly raped the woman near Tuas West Road MRT station from about 12.30am to 2.20am on Mar 8. District Judge Terence Tay ordered both men to be remanded at Changi Prison Complex's medical centre for three weeks. They will return to court next month. Foysal was represented by defence lawyer A Revi Shanker, while Rayhan remained unrepresented. They appeared in court via video-link from remand and followed proceedings through a Bengali interpreter. The Bangladesh nationals were previously remanded for one week to aid with investigations. The police said last week that they received a call for assistance at about 7.25am on Mar 8, after a woman was found injured but unconscious along Pioneer Road. She had multiple injuries on her head and body and was taken to the hospital. A medical examination found that her injuries suggested sexual assault. The two accused were arrested later that day. According to preliminary investigations, both men were not known to the woman whom they allegedly brought to Pioneer Road to assault. If convicted of rape, they could be jailed for up to 20 years and fined or caned."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/habitual-swindler-cheat-scam-rich-korean-heir-cheques-2568776,"‘Habitual swindler’ posed as rich Korean heir to buy properties, made boyfriend lie to the police","SINGAPORE: A Singaporean man posed as a wealthy Korean heir to view and buy properties, writing cheques for more than S$2 million even though he knew they would bounce. Jerald Low Jing Yong, 27, wanted to use the options to purchase to boast to his friends that he could afford expensive property. As part of the act, he dyed his hair and took on the name “Park Joon Hyung”. It was just one in a long series of ruses by Low to project an image of wealth in order to take advantage of multiple victims around him. He pleaded guilty on Wednesday (Mar 16) to 16 charges, mostly of cheating, with another 35 taken into consideration for sentencing. Low’s victims included romantic partners he met online, friends and employees. His “web of lies” caused his victims to lose more than S$150,000, and resulted in one of them suffering a relapse of bipolar disorder, said the prosecution. As police investigations closed in around him, Low devised a way to evade responsibility, convincing his boyfriend to take the blame for his crimes. As part of this, he falsely alleged rape and sexual assault by his boyfriend, causing the police to waste significant resources investigating his claims. District Judge Soh Tze Bian called Low “a habitual swindler with no remorse” who had planned each of his offences. He was sentenced to 67 months’ jail, fined S$1,800 and banned from driving until a year after his release from prison. Low devised a plan to buy properties sometime in May 2019, when he was introduced to a property agent.  He pretended to be a rich Korean man called Park Joon Hyung, and the agent took Low to view various properties over three days. Low issued 13 cheques for at least seven properties, with developers like Keppel Bay and Angullia Development among the payees. However, the property sellers informed Low and his agent that the cheques could not be cleared, and eventually released the properties for other potential buyers. The bulk of Low’s proceeded charges involved telco scams, where he persuaded victims to sign up for phone lines by lying to them that he would pay the fees. He often claimed he needed the numbers for work purposes. In reality, Low wanted his victims to hand over the mobile phones from the contract plans so he could sell them for quick cash. He also wanted the mobile lines to buy game credits on iTunes. Low cheated four men he met on a gay dating application and an online forum with this method. In one instance, he connected with a 24-year-old man on the forum. When they met on New Year’s Eve in 2018, Low told the man he “wished to start the new year with a new boyfriend”. The next day, Low rented a car which he used to ferry the other man around. He also claimed that his father worked in the oil and gas industry in South Korea and that he had millions of dollars in his bank account. This gave the man the impression that Low was wealthy and sincere about starting a relationship with him, said the prosecution. Later that day, Low persuaded the man to sign seven phone line contracts. The man received six mobile phones from the contracts, which he handed to Low.  Low sold off the handsets on Jan 4, 2019. But when the man asked Low to pay him back for the fees he had incurred on the contracts, which amounted to more than S$5,000, Low refused and blocked his number. Low also set up a shell company called Fitness Tea. Sometime in October 2018, a woman responded to a job posting for the company which involved posting job openings online and interviewing applicants. Low interviewed and hired her on Oct 26, 2018.  He then persuaded the woman to sign up for five phone contracts, claiming that they were needed for the business. On Oct 27, 2018, Low also agreed to register a marriage with the woman and filed an online notice of marriage. At this point, the woman’s sister-in-law told her that Low might be a scammer. Shortly afterwards, the woman suffered a relapse of her bipolar disorder and was admitted to the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) from Oct 30 to Dec 24, 2018. Some of the woman’s symptoms included “delusions of love”, according to an IMH report on February 2019. In early 2018, Low came up with the idea to issue cheques to his own bank account even though he knew they would bounce. He thought this would temporarily increase his account balance, which he could show to other people. Around Apr 5, 2018, Low took his mother’s chequebook and issued himself a cheque for S$1 trillion. He forged her signature on the cheque and deposited it with OCBC Bank. Due to the abnormally large value of the cheque, OCBC made queries on the status of his mother’s bank account and found that it was closed. The cheque was not processed any further, and a bank representative lodged a police report. Low also issued cheques made payable to himself on at least four other occasions, as well as cheques to entities like the Central Provident Fund Board, the Housing Development Board, Bishan-Toa Payoh Town Council and insurance companies. None of these cheques cleared. He also ran scams involving the rental of cars using the particulars of other people. One of his victims was a man whose NRIC and driving licence Low obtained pictures of when they exchanged particulars after a traffic accident in May 2018. Low used the man’s particulars to register for an account with Tribecar, renting vehicles a total of 18 times between Dec 14, 2018 and Jan 25, 2019. On two occasions, while driving the rental car, Low beat a red light and hit another vehicle in a basement carpark. The man whom Low had impersonated received summons and letters from a lawyer and NTUC Income for these traffic incidents, after which he filed police reports that he had never driven the car. In early 2020, Low met his co-accused Desmond Poon Jun Yee, 22. Low lied that he was the director and owner of a well-known bubble tea franchise and the men entered into a relationship. Aware that he was being investigated by the police, Low devised a plan to convince Poon to take the blame for all his offences. He managed to convince Poon to agree to this plan. On Sep 9, 2020, Low made a false police report that he had committed his offences at Poon’s instructions since 2018. He claimed that Poon had threatened to harm him and his family and physically abused him. On Nov 23, 2020, with investigations against him still ongoing, Low made a second false police report alleging that Poon “mentally and physically tortured” him. In March 2021, he managed to convince Poon to include an element of sexual assault into their lies to the police to make his earlier reports “more believable”. Low alleged in a police interview on Apr 9, 2021 that Poon had raped him on more than 15 occasions. He made a third false police report later that day accusing Poon of sexual assault between 2018 and 2020. He maintained these assertions in subsequent statements to the police and was sent for a sexual assault medical examination. From October 2020 to April 2021, Poon also repeatedly lied to police to support Low’s false police reports. He only came clean in his final video-recorded interview where he said he had not raped or threatened Low. The prosecution sought a sentence for Low of 68 months’ jail as well as the fine and driving ban given. “The accused’s conduct was sustained, pre-meditated and well-planned. He preyed on victims who were looking for companionship on social media and dating applications, and then systematically abused their trust,” said the prosecution. “The accused has demonstrated that he is a recalcitrant offender who has no qualms breaking the law to suit his needs.” Low's pro bono defence lawyer asked for consideration that his client was pleading guilty instead of claiming trial."

Leonard Goh Yew Cheng allegedly threw a ""watermelon knife"" measuring about 47cm at a 42-year-old station inspector. The incident took place at about 9.10pm on Monday at the 13th floor corridor of a block in Bukit Batok West Avenue 8. The handle of the knife purportedly landed on the officer's right cheek and caused a reddish bruise. Police later raided Goh's home and found five long knives. Goh was given one count each of voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty, carrying an offensive weapon in a public place, and abetting the offence of possession of offensive weapons. He has been remanded at the Institute of Mental Health for psychiatric observation, and will return to court later this month. The police earlier said that at about 9.10pm on Monday, they received a call about a man who was allegedly armed with a knife. The man was ""shouting and looking for someone at Bukit Batok West Avenue 8"". The police responded to the call and arrested the man. During the engagement with the police, the man allegedly pulled out a knife from under his T-shirt and threw it towards one of the officers, purportedly hit the officer's right cheek. ""Preliminary investigations do not suggest the incident to be an act of terror,"" the police said on Tuesday. If found guilty of voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty, Goh could be jailed for up to seven years, fined or caned.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/buangkok-sword-fadhil-yusop-man-charged-2567401,Buangkok sword incident: Man charged with voluntarily causing hurt,"SINGAPORE: A man who was seen wielding a sword at Buangkok Crescent, swinging it at a pedestrian and hitting passing cars, was charged on Wednesday (Mar 16). Singaporean Fadhil Yusop, 37, was given one charge of voluntarily causing hurt by means of a ""samurai sword"" at about 1.58pm on Monday at Buangkok Square mall. He is accused of cutting Mr Kumarapeli Arachchige Amila Chinthana three times, causing the victim to suffer one cut on his left arm and two cuts on the left shoulder. Fadhil appeared in court via video-link from remand, with his left arm in a cast. He was wheeled in on a wheelchair, but stood up when the charge was read to him by a court interpreter. He later limped in when his case was mentioned before the judge. The judge ordered him to be remanded in Changi Prison Complex's medical centre for three weeks for psychiatric observation. He will return to court on Apr 6. If convicted, he could be jailed for up to seven years, fined, caned or any combination of these punishments. The incident on Monday afternoon went viral after a video of the incident was widely circulated on social media. The police said on Monday that they received multiple calls at about 2pm that a man was swinging a sword in the middle of Buangkok Crescent and stopping oncoming traffic. After a ""brief altercation"" with members of the public at the lift lobby of his housing block, Fadhil jaywalked across the road and allegedly used the sword to hit five passing cars. At the traffic junction in front of Buangkok Square Mall, he allegedly swung the sword against another man. Members of the public came forward and helped to restrain the accused until the police arrived and arrested him. One man was taken to the hospital with two superficial slash wounds on his left arm, while another suffered abrasions on his left knee. The police subsequently raided Fadhil's home and seized two packets of ""yellow pills"". ""Preliminary investigations revealed that the man had allegedly consumed some unknown pills prior to leaving his home with the sword,"" said the police. On Tuesday night, the Internal Security Department (ISD) said that Fadhil allegedly shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" during the incident, and that it was working with the police to investigate the incident. ""Fadhil is believed to have acted alone, and preliminary investigations thus far do not suggest that the incident is an act of terror,"" said the department. ISD said it previously investigated Fadhil in 2016 for sharing images of militant groups online, but ""there was no indication that he was radicalised or intended to engage in armed violence"". He was given a written warning for his social media posts. In January 2020, Fadhil was arrested after approaching the imam at Masjid Al-Mawaddah with a knife. ISD said its joint investigations with police at the time did not suggest that the attack was terrorism-related. He was found to have consumed a large number of pills containing dextromethorphan, which contributed to his behaviour, said ISD. He was sentenced to nine months and two weeks' jail and released from prison in July 2020 after his sentence was backdated. ""Although Fadhil was assessed not to be radicalised, he was referred for religious counselling after this second incident as a matter of precaution,"" said ISD. The police also said that Fadhil was previously remanded at the Institute of Mental Health and diagnosed with substance abuse disorder. On Tuesday, six members of the public who helped to restrain the accused were given Public Spiritedness Awards. They included the man at whom Fadhil allegedly swung his sword and a Temasek Polytechnic student who walked past during the incident."

Between January and March, the police received reports from several victims of rental scams who responded to online advertisements offering rental of residential units.  “After the victims paid the deposit via bank transfer, the man purportedly became uncontactable,” said the police.  The police established the identity of the man and he was arrested on Monday.  “Preliminary investigations revealed that he is believed to be involved in 24 similar cases of rental scams with losses amounting to more than S$54,700,” the police added. The man will be charged in court on Wednesday with cheating. If found guilty, he could be jailed for up to 10 years and fined. The police advised people to deal with an accredited real estate agent or the rightful owner of a unit to avoid falling prey to rental scams. They should verify the agents' details and contact numbers with the agency. Those who are looking to rent should also ask to visit the unit and verify with the owner if the rental offer exists and is genuine. Local property agencies have also warned about rental scams, where scammers impersonate property agents and ask for deposits to secure viewings. Huttons Group said on Monday that these scammers would use fake identity cards from the Council of Estate Agencies (CEA), and then upload fake listings on “alternative platforms”. When contacted, the scammer would ask for a deposit to secure a property viewing. But after receiving the deposit, the scammer would become uncontactable, said Huttons."

The six people - Mr Kumarapeli Arachchige Amila Chinthana, Mr Lim Jun Yi, Mr Muhammad Nur Rabbani Mohammad Zaini, Mr Lim Jiajing, Mr Muhammad Naufal Ahmadsubronto and Ms Kervyn Koh - were each awarded a plaque at Ang Mo Kio Police Division’s headquarters on Tuesday afternoon. The suspect, 37-year-old Singaporean Fadhil Yusop, was arrested on Monday after the police received multiple calls at about 1.56pm about a man swinging a sword in the middle of Buangkok Crescent and stopping oncoming traffic. He will be charged on Wednesday with voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means, said the police in a news release on Monday night. In a video sent to CNA on Monday, the man was seen walking in the middle of the road and hitting cars with a sword as they go past him. He crossed over to the pavement and swung his sword at Mr Chinthana, before he slipped and fell. Four people quickly pinned him on the ground and a fifth person was seen kicking the sword away.  Mr Chinthana, 35, said his first thought was of his wife, who is seven months pregnant. He thought about how the man might harm other vulnerable people in the area, he told journalists on Tuesday. “If let’s say another old person is standing there, or if it’s children, or a pregnant woman, I thought about ... if it happens to my family. When it comes to my mind I won’t think twice, because I’m thinking about other people’s safety,” said Mr Chinthana, who also has a three-year-old son. “I never thought he will come and attack me,” he said, adding that everything happened very quickly and that he did not feel scared. Mr Chinthana tried to hold on to Fadhil's body and legs as they struggled on the floor. Others soon joined him in pinning the suspect on the ground. Mr Lim Jun Yi, a 20-year-old Temasek Polytechnic student, was waiting by the traffic light when he saw the man swinging a sword at Mr Chinthana. He jumped in to help restrain the man. “The only thing that came to mind is that I want to help, I want to make sure that he (Mr Chinthana) doesn't get injured any further,” he said. “As much as there was a risk involved, I didn’t really care about it, I didn’t really give much thought about it. The only thing I knew is that I wanted to make sure that he (Mr Chinthana) is safe and make sure that the guy doesn’t hurt anyone else.” He added that such incidents are “very rare” in Singapore. Singapore Civil Defence Force officer Mr Naufal, 29, rushed forward and joined Mr Lim Jun Yi and Mr Chinthana in pinning Fadhil. Three other people - Ms Koh, Mr Rabbani and Mr Lim Jiajing - who work at the nearby Angsana Home @ Pelangi Village were on their way to lunch. They saw the incident and ran to help. The man was “very aggressive” and struggled for a “very long time”, and it took the group a few minutes to find a position to hold him down, said Mr Rabbani. ""His behaviour was definitely something that, if he was not stopped, he would’ve caused more injuries or more damage,” he said. When asked why they decided to rush forward to help, Mr Rabbani added: “It’s my own personal belief that everyone deserves to live in a safe environment. For example, these two gentlemen, they are someone’s son, someone’s husband, someone’s brother.” Preliminary investigations revealed that Fadhil had allegedly eaten “some unknown pills” before leaving his home with the sword, the police said on Monday night. The man had a “brief altercation” with members of the public at the lift lobby of the HDB block where he lived, and then jaywalked across the road and allegedly used the sword to hit five passing cars and Mr Chinthana. Mr Chinthana said he suffered two slash wounds on his shoulder and another on his left forearm, while Mr Lim Jun Yi had abrasions on his knee. Mr Chinthana added that he has received hundreds of calls and messages since the incident, and he thanked those who contacted him.  Commander of Ang Mo Kio Police Division, Assistant Commissioner of Police Zed Teo, said the six people's actions prevented the suspect from ""causing more harm to the public"". ""The police would like to commend them for their courage and public spiritedness. We have presented them with the Public Spiritedness Award in recognition of their brave actions,"" he added. The police raided Fadhil's residence and two packets of yellow pills were seized. The Internal Security Department (ISD) said on Tuesday that preliminary investigations so far ""do not suggest that the incident was an act of terror"". Fadhil was previously investigated by the ISD in 2016 for sharing images of militant groups online.  ""However, there was no indication that he was radicalised or intended to engage in armed violence. Fadhil was administered with a written warning for his social media posts,"" said ISD. In January 2020, he was arrested after approaching a religious leader at Masjid Al-Mawaddah with a knife. ISD's joint investigations with the police at the time ""did not suggest that Fadhil's attack was terrorism-related"", said ISD. ""Fadhil was found to have consumed a large number of pills containing dextromethorphan, which contributed to his behaviour,"" it added. He was sentenced to nine months and two weeks’ imprisonment and was released in July 2020, after his sentence was backdated. ""Although Fadhil was assessed not to be radicalised, he was referred for religious counselling after this second incident as a matter of precaution,"" said ISD. It added that it would work with the police to investigate the latest incident and provide an update ""in due course""."

ISD identified the suspect as 37-year-old Singaporean Fadhil Yusop, adding that he allegedly shouted “Allahu Akbar” during the Buangkok incident. The police had received multiple calls on Monday afternoon after a man was seen swinging a sword in the middle of Buangkok Crescent and stopping oncoming traffic. The suspect allegedly swung his weapon at a man at the traffic junction in front of Buangkok Square Mall, before other members of the public came forward to restrain him. ""Fadhil is believed to have acted alone, and preliminary investigations thus far do not suggest that the incident is an act of terror. He had allegedly consumed some unknown pills prior to leaving his home with the sword,"" said ISD, adding that it is working with the police to investigate the incident. After being investigated in 2016 for sharing images of militant groups online, Fadhil was given with a written warning for his social media posts, said ISD. ""There was no indication that he was radicalised or intended to engage in armed violence,"" it added.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-attempt-sexual-exploitation-girl-11-supermarket-employee-2565571,"Man propositioned 11-year-old girl for sex, was stopped by supermarket employee","SINGAPORE: The actions of a supermarket employee helped to foil a man who was propositioning an 11-year-old girl for sex in January 2020. The man, now 53, pleaded guilty in the State Courts on Tuesday (Mar 15) to a charge of attempted sexual exploitation of a child. Another charge of use of criminal force will be taken into consideration for sentencing on Wednesday. The victim and offender knew each other as they lived in the same housing block. They would make small talk when they occasionally saw each other around the area. Prior to the incident, the girl regarded the man as a ""friendly and caring"" person, the court heard. The offender's name was redacted from court documents, and the victim's identity is protected by a gag order. At about 6pm on Jan 10, 2020, the victim left her house to attend a tuition lesson. She took the same lift as the offender. The two made small talk and walked together towards a nearby supermarket. Outside the supermarket, the offender asked the victim if she needed money. When the girl said no, he persisted and asked a few more times. She felt that the man was behaving strangely, but eventually relented and said okay. The man asked her to follow him to another block, where he held her wrist and brought her near a bicycle bay. He cupped her face with his hands softly, without her consent, and asked her a question that alluded to a sex act a few times. The girl grew fearful as a result of his actions, and felt annoyed and offended at being touched. She did not understand the offender's question, so she replied ""What?"" and walked off, saying she was late for tuition. However, the offender persisted and followed the victim back to the supermarket, where he bought her a bottled drink. He then asked her to follow him to a public area outside a nearby clinic. There, the offender asked the victim the same question alluding to a sex act, and then told the victim to perform a sex act. This made her feel disgusted, scared, annoyed and offended, the court heard. When the girl replied ""What?"" again, the offender asked her: ""How much do you want?"" The victim became very fearful as she understood that the offender wanted her to perform a sex act on him. She quickly walked off, but the man called after her and followed her. Outside the supermarket, the victim approached an employee for help, saying that the offender was disturbing her. The employee asked her if the man was her father, and the victim said he was not. The offender told the employee he was just helping the girl to buy a drink. He extended his hand towards the victim, but was blocked from touching her. The employee told the man to leave the victim alone, and he left. She then told her supervisor about the incident. The supervisor asked the victim what had happened, and she told him the offender had asked her to perform a sex act. The supervisor then accompanied the victim to an LRT station, telling her to scream if the offender approached her again. Both supermarket workers observed that the victim appeared very nervous and afraid, with the supervisor noting that she was trembling. The victim lodged a police report later that night after her tuition lesson. The offender was arrested five days later. Under the Children and Young Persons Act, the punishment for attempted sexual exploitation of a child is a jail term of up to five years, a fine of up to S$10,000 or both. The punishment for use of criminal force is a jail term of up to three months, a fine of up to S$1,500 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/drunk-man-abused-harassed-taxi-driver-2565296,Man fined for abusing taxi driver while unmasked and drunk,"SINGAPORE: A 51-year-old man was fined S$2,000 on Tuesday (Mar 15) for pushing and hurling vulgarities at a taxi driver while unmasked and appearing drunk. Francis Dion James, an engineer, pleaded guilty to one charge of using insulting words towards a public service worker. Two more charges of failing to wear a mask and causing annoyance while drunk in a public place were taken into consideration. His lawyer, Ms Cheryl Sim, told the court that her client had gone for counselling and reflected on his behaviour in the incident. The Australian citizen has decided to give up alcohol forever and remain sober, she said. On Jun 4 last year at about 8.55pm, the victim was at Asia Square Tower 1 waiting for a passenger who had booked his taxi. James boarded the vehicle, but the driver realised that he was not the passenger who had made the booking. The driver asked James to alight but he refused. At that point, the actual passenger cancelled his taxi booking. The driver called the police as he was unable to manage the situation, stated court documents. He told them: ""I got a drunkard in my taxi. He is not supposed to be inside as he did not book the taxi."" While the driver waited for the police, James kept pushing him and repeatedly hurled vulgarities at him. When police officers arrived and spoke to James, he was not compliant. He was observed to have an unstable gait and flushed face, and reek strongly of alcohol. Subsequent investigations showed that he was captured on CCTV footage not wearing a mask over his nose and mouth at the location of the incident. In mitigation, Ms Sim said her client was deeply remorseful for the incident. The court proceedings had been a ""trying time"" for him, as he had to forgo employment opportunities and also missed family events like the birth of his granddaughter, she said. James has since made compensation to the victim. He also met the victim in person and handed him a handwritten apology, she said.  Deputy Public Prosecutor Chee Ee Ling confirmed that the victim has accepted James' apology and forgiven him. For using insulting words towards a public service worker, James could have been jailed up to 12 months, fined up to S$5,000 or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-sexual-assault-9-year-old-girl-daughter-friend-high-court-trial-2565131,Man on trial for sexually assaulting daughter's 9-year-old friend,"SINGAPORE: A 60-year-old man went on trial in the High Court on Tuesday (Mar 15) for sexually assaulting his daughter’s friend, who was nine years old when the offences allegedly started. The assaults allegedly happened when the man went to visit his daughter, who lived with the victim’s family from early 2015. His daughter moved out by early 2016. The incidents were only discovered about three years later, when the topic of sexual abuse was being taught in class and the victim was seen crying. The accused faces two charges of aggravated sexual assault and five charges of aggravated outrage of modesty. He and the victim cannot be named due to a gag order on their identities. Deputy Public Prosecutors Jane Lim and Lim Ying Min will lead evidence from 14 witnesses for their case. The accused is represented by defence lawyers Joel Wang and Haneef Abdul Malik. The court heard that the victim stayed with her father and grandmother in a three-room flat at the time. Her parents were separated. The accused’s girlfriend at the time was a friend of the victim’s grandmother. Sometime in 2015, the girlfriend asked the victim’s grandmother to help take care of the accused’s daughter. The grandmother agreed, and the accused’s daughter moved in with the victim’s family sometime in early 2015. She and the victim were the same age. The accused visited his daughter at the victim’s house on a weekly basis. During these visits, he would usually sit on the sofa in the living room. According to the prosecution’s case, the man is accused of committing a series of sexual assaults against the victim while his daughter lived in the flat. Most of these alleged assaults happened when he and the victim were alone on the living room sofa. During one of the assaults, he allegedly pressured the victim to touch his private parts even though she kept saying no. He told her it was alright and not to tell anyone, and she complied. On another occasion, the victim was in the kitchen when the accused allegedly moved her hand to his private parts. She broke free and hid in the toilet, before coming out to hide in her bedroom. The accused then knocked on her bedroom door. Thinking it was her grandmother, the victim opened it. The accused allegedly assaulted her again before she pulled away and slammed the door shut. The victim eventually complained to her grandmother to get the accused out of their house. This resulted in the accused’s daughter moving out by early 2016, and the alleged assaults stopping. During a class that covered sexual abuse in April 2018, a student noticed the victim crying and informed the form teacher. The form teacher asked the victim what happened. She replied that she was reminded of something that had happened to her, but kept saying she did not want to talk about it. The teacher brought the victim out of class. After much probing, she said that she was sexually assaulted by a friend’s father when she was in Primary 4. She also told this to a school counsellor whom she was referred to. The school met the victim’s father and told him what happened, after which he brought his daughter to make a police report. Dr Bernardine Woo, a psychiatrist at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), examined the victim in September 2018. According to her report, the victim suffered a panic attack after the sex education class in school. She was tearful and appeared distressed when describing the alleged assaults during the examination.  She was found to be sad, irritable, fearful and angry after the incidents. She experienced recurring thoughts of the alleged abuse, and difficulty concentrating in class. The victim was also fearful of men, frightened when people touched her and frightened of sexual words, according to Dr Woo. The trial continues on Wednesday. For each count of aggravated sexual assault, the accused could be jailed between eight and 20 years and caned not less than 12 strokes. For each count of aggravated outrage of modesty, he could be jailed up to five years, fined, caned or any combination of these punishments."

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/voyeur-man-record-videos-women-upskirt-toilet-sammyboy-2562461,"Man used spy pen to film sisters-in-law in bathroom, took upskirt videos of women in office toilet","SINGAPORE: During three visits to his in-laws' house in 2018, a man brought a pen with a pinhole camera that he placed in a basket of brushes and scrubs in the bathroom. The camera captured two of his sisters-in-law, who are in their 30s, using the toilet and showering. The man, 31, pleaded guilty on Monday (Mar 14) to three charges of insulting a woman's modesty. Six more charges will be taken into consideration for sentencing. He and his victims cannot be named due to a gag order on their identities. The judge called for a mandatory treatment order suitability report, as the man suffers from adjustment order with depressed mood. A mandatory treatment order directs an offender suffering from certain treatable psychiatric conditions to undergo psychiatric treatment. The prosecution is seeking between 16 and 20 weeks' jail; the accused will return for sentencing next month. The court heard that on one visit to his in-laws' house, the man quickly activated and placed the spy pen in the bathroom when he realised his sister-in-law was about to shower, as she was holding on to a towel. A few days after the third and last such incident in 2018, the pinhole camera stopped working, and the man smashed it with a hammer before throwing it away. He also took videos of three women using the female toilet of his office on three occasions between Nov 5 and Dec 3, 2019. He would follow the women into the female toilet, wait until they had entered a cubicle, then enter the cubicle next to it. He would then extend his phone through the gap under the partition separating the cubicles and record videos of the women. During the last such incident in the office on Dec 3, 2019, the victim noticed that a mobile phone had been extended into the cubicle. She managed to take a photograph of the phone. The accused could see on the screen of his phone that the victim was looking at it while he recorded her, so he decided to stop and wait for her to leave the toilet before he did. After the victim left the toilet, she waited outside for the suspect to exit. She eventually walked away, and the man left about 20 seconds later after ascertaining no one else was inside the toilet. The accused saw the victim walk into a conference room where other colleagues were, and assumed she was going to report the matter. He hurriedly deleted two videos of her, and other pornographic and obscene videos on the phone. Meanwhile, the victim told an assistant general manager that there was a peeping tom in the female toilet. The assistant general manager reviewed the relevant CCTV footage, which captured the accused entering and leaving the toilet. She lodged a police report. When police officers arrived at the office and spoke to the accused, he initially lied that he had stomach issues and needed to use the female toilet urgently. He eventually admitted to following the victim into the toilet and taking videos of her, and was arrested. Investigations revealed the two other occasions when he took videos of women in the office toilet. The accused admitted that he started taking upskirt videos around December 2017. He said that in September 2018, a woman spotted him trying to take an upskirt video of her and confronted him, but did not report the matter to the police. He deleted all the videos from the phone he was using at the time, and transferred them to his laptop. In October 2018, he started using another phone to take upskirt videos. In March 2019, he also started downloading at least 110 upskirt videos from the Sammyboy online forum. After these admissions, the accused was escorted back to his flat by police. His laptop, another phone, a hard drive and an SD card were seized. Forensic examination of the man's two phones revealed he had taken 16 upskirt videos of various female victims. The man admitted that he had recorded these between November 2018 and October 2019 at various locations, including a bakery, Sheng Siong supermarket, his office, an MRT station and on public buses. Sometime in early 2019, he uploaded three of the videos to the Sammyboy forum. His victims included a friend from university and one of the colleagues whom he had recorded in the toilet. A woman who lived in the same block as him was also among the victims. On one occasion, they were in the lift together and he followed her to a bakery after exiting. While she was choosing which bread to buy, he pretended to drop his wallet, placed his phone under her skirt and recorded an upskirt video of her. He struck again at the same bakery on another occasion by pretending to tie his shoelaces, while recording under another victim's skirt. According to an Institute of Mental Health (IMH) report, the accused developed a habit of recording upskirt videos at the end of 2017, after he realised that it helped him to alleviate stress. The man would try to take upskirt videos ""almost every day whenever I go for my breaks, my commutes"", the report citing him saying. He described a sense of ""anticipation"" towards the act. An IMH psychiatrist diagnosed the accused with adjustment disorder with depressed mood, which ""predisposed him to his voyeuristic behaviour, as a maladaptive, dysfunctional coping mechanism"". However, the psychiatrist found that he was still aware of the nature and wrongfulness of his actions. Editor's note: This article has been amended to correct the charges faced by the accused. He was charged with insulting a woman's modesty, not outrage of modesty."

Police said the two employees were stabbed multiple times and both were in stable condition at Bellevue Hospital later Saturday. People posting accounts to social media said museumgoers ran for the exits in confusion and chaos after the stabbing. NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence & Counterterrorism John Miller said the man's membership was revoked for two separate incidents of disorderly behavior at the museum in recent days. He was being sought. “He became upset about not being allowed entrance, and then jumped over the reception desk and proceeded to attack and stab two employees of the museum multiple times,” Miller said. Miller said the employees were stabbed in the back, in the collar bone, in the back of neck and were rushed within minutes to Bellevue. Miller said police trying to locate the man had access to video of him leaving the museum and were aware of the direction in which he left. He did not identify the man by name but described him as a white male wearing a black jacket, blue surgical mask, a colorfully patterned shirt and hood. Miller said the man was a “regular” at the museum, and that the museum had adequate security. Social media posts on Twitter showed that the midtown Manhattan museum had evacuated its patrons Saturday afternoon. One of the videos posted online showed police vehicles, their emergency lights flashing, thronging the outside of the museum as dozens of patrons hurried away amid a light snowfall. Law enforcement officials are investigating the attack, and the names of the employees were not immediately released. Mayor Eric Adams tweeted Saturday evening that he had been briefed on the attack and said the injuries to the two victims were not life-threatening. “We're grateful for the quick work of our first responders,"" he added. MoMA, founded in 1929, is one of New York City's top tourist attractions, and drew more than 700,000 visitors in 2020. Its collection of modern art includes The Starry Night by Vincent Van Gogh and works by Henri Matisse and Paul Gaugin."

He then carried her up to his flat, where he raped her multiple times while she was unconscious. He also told a friend about his actions. The offender, now 24, was on Friday (Mar 11) sentenced to 15 years' jail and 20 strokes of the cane. The court heard that the man also took videos and photographs of his housemate in the bathroom after discovering a hole at the bottom of the toilet door. He sent the videos to the same friend. He recorded 18 videos and nine photographs of his housemate over a period of about a year from November 2018 to December 2019, and also took photographs of her while she was sleeping. The man pleaded guilty on Friday to one count each of rape, sexual assault and distributing a voyeuristic image, and two counts of outrage of modesty. Twenty other charges were taken into consideration. He and the victims cannot be named as there is a gag order on their identities. The man first became acquainted with his colleague in November 2019 and they subsequently exchanged numbers and occasionally chatted about work. They had known each other for about eight months when they agreed to hang out after the woman's shift on Jun 21, 2020. The pair arrived at the void deck of the man's housing block at about 10.30pm. While at the void deck, the victim drank alcohol and eventually lost consciousness. The man recorded six video clips of her in this state. In a video clip played in court, the woman was seen laying her head on the table as the offender said he was going to carry her home. Although the offender had been drinking with the victim, ""he was lucid, he was able to talk, conversational and clearly not extremely intoxicated"", said Deputy Public Prosecutor Yang Ziliang. At about 1am, the man carried the victim to his flat and placed her on the sofa. He partially undressed her and took a photo of her, which he sent to his friend. He then moved the victim to his bed, raping her twice and sexually assaulting her. After he woke up later in the night, he raped her again. After this, he sent a message to his friend, saying that he ""did it"" with the victim three times. The victim regained consciousness sometime before 9.40am and was shocked to find herself lying naked next to the offender in his bed. She also felt pain in her private parts. She asked the offender if he had done anything that he should not have done to her, and he replied that he had. He also showed her the videos he had taken of her in an intoxicated state at the void deck. While looking at the videos on his phone, the victim saw the messages and the photo of her that he sent to his friend. She immediately deleted the videos, photos and messages from his phone. She also deleted her number. The offender accompanied the victim as she left his flat and booked a private-hire car for her. The victim did not initially lodge a police report as she felt scared and insecure, and was unfamiliar with the investigative procedures, according to the prosecution. After the incident, the offender sent the victim messages that month and the following month, asking about her whereabouts. She told him not to harass her again, and he stopped trying to contact her. However, she remained very troubled by his actions and asked a friend how the police handled rape cases. She told her friend what had happened. On the same day, her friend called the police and the offender was arrested that night. This was about a month after she was raped. The victim suffered ""immense trauma"" from what happened to her and continues to feel that ""it is very hopeless to be alive"", said the prosecution. She experienced thoughts of suicide after the incident, and was warded at the Institute of Mental Health for almost three months. She was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and given therapy and medication to help her sleep. Her ability to work and socialise has been substantially impaired, added the prosecution. In a victim impact statement taken in December 2021, she reported having difficulties at work as her colleagues were asking about the incident. She was also fearful of men and felt she would not be able to find someone who would love her and ""accept"" her past. The prosecution sought 15 years to 18 years' jail and 20 strokes of the cane, citing the victim's vulnerability given her severely intoxicated state and the psychological harm she suffered. Pro bono defence lawyer Gregory Fong said the offender had a ""crush"" on the victim and was remorseful for his actions. He asked for 12 years to 14 years' jail. The lawyer said the man's judgment was clouded as he had also been drinking, and asked for consideration that his client was a young offender who could be rehabilitated."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/former-certis-cisco-officer-fire-gun-public-toilet-harbourfront-centre-2557076,Former Certis CISCO officer jailed for firing gun at floor of shopping centre toilet,"SINGAPORE: A former Certis CISCO auxiliary police officer was on Friday (Mar 11) jailed nine weeks for firing one round from his duty revolver without reason. Goh Ze Lin, 37, was in a toilet cubicle in HarbourFront Centre at the time. No one was injured in the incident. He pleaded guilty to one charge of committing a rash act that endangered human life. Goh, then a corporal, was deployed alone at the OCBC Bank branch in the shopping centre on the morning of Jan 8, 2021. He was issued with a Taurus 85 revolver loaded with five 0.38-inch live rounds for his duties, and another five spare rounds in a speed loader. The effective range for this type of ammunition from the revolver is 46m, with the weapon expected to be accurate and potentially lethal within this range, according to court documents. At about 11.45am, Goh went to a male toilet on the second floor, entered one of the cubicles and closed the door. He removed his utility belt containing the loaded revolver and placed it on the floor in front of the toilet bowl. While seated on the toilet bowl, he removed the gun from his holster and fiddled with it. As Goh thought about his financial matters, he ""rashly squeezed"" the trigger of the gun, according to court documents. A single round was discharged from the gun, which was pointed downwards. The bullet hit the floor and caused a small indentation to a tile. After the round was discharged, Goh finished relieving himself and re-holstered the gun. At about 11.50am, he contacted the Certis Command Centre and informed an operations manager that he had discharged the gun inside a toilet. He was advised to stay where he was. The police arrived at about 12.15pm and found the accused still inside the toilet. Forensic examination of the revolver and metal fragments found on the floor of the cubicle determined that two of the fragments were from a bullet fired from the revolver. The police's Force Armament Branch also examined the gun and found that Goh had deliberately pulled the revolver with sufficient pressure or cocked the hammer to discharge the live round. The court heard that the distance between the point of firing and point of contact of the round was well within the potentially lethal range of 46m. ""The accused did not pay attention to whether there were persons in the toilet at the time and could not see if there were persons outside while inside the enclosed toilet cubicle,"" stated court documents. ""The accused was trained and certified to handle and use the revolver and knew that officers were not to draw or use their revolvers without threat. ""There was no threat of any kind at the material time and the accused knew that he had no reason to draw or use the loaded revolver."" An Institute of Mental Health doctor found that the Goh had a ""transient situational reaction"", and did not diagnose him with any mental disorder. His employment with Certis CISCO has since been terminated. The prosecution said that Goh's actions posed a high risk of harm and pointed out that there was some human traffic in the toilet. Two people entered and left the toilet between the time that Goh went into the toilet and the time he informed his management about the incident, according to the prosecution. They also said significant mitigating weight could be given for his cooperation in alerting Certis CISCO almost immediately, and remaining at the scene. Editor’s note: An earlier version of this article stated that the offender was jailed for nine months. This is incorrect. He was jailed for nine weeks. We apologise for the error."

Loh and Neo each face 11 charges of cheating and engaging in a conspiracy to conceal and convert their benefits from criminal conduct. They are accused of laundering about S$2.5 million in benefits, allegedly keeping about S$2.3 million in bank accounts belonging to Neo, Teo and a private entity. Another S$156,000 was allegedly used to pay off debts and for capital injection. Chan faces six charges of cheating and laundering his benefits from criminal conduct, worth about S$1.6 million. He is accused of concealing about S$1.3 million in another person's bank account, and using S$281,000 to pay insurance premiums. Teo faces three charges of cheating and providing Neo access to her bank account, while having reasonable grounds to believe that this would facilitate Neo's control of her benefits from criminal conduct. The four accused will return to court next month. Cheating can be punished with up to 10 years' jail and a fine. The penalty for money laundering is up to 10 years' jail and a fine of up to S$500,000 or both."

The police said they take all reports of sexual assault seriously and will ""spare no effort to bring the perpetrators to justice"". Members of the public were also advised to report cases of sexual assault to the police so that offenders can be dealt ""firmly and in accordance with the law"" to prevent them from causing further harm to other people. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/maid-kick-hit-toddler-child-abuse-jail-2551546,"Maid jailed for kicking toddler, hitting him repeatedly with diaper and clothes hanger","SINGAPORE: A domestic worker was on Wednesday (Mar 9) jailed for slapping, hitting and kicking a two-year-old boy until there were bruises on his back. May Than Oo, 30, pleaded guilty to one charge of ill-treatment under the Children and Young Persons Act. She was jailed for nine months, the sentence sought by the prosecution. The court heard that the domestic worker, who is from Myanmar, was employed to do household chores and care for the victim and his two siblings. Around 8.15pm on Jun 15 last year, she was folding clothes in the victim's bedroom when she noticed a foul smell. She saw that the toddler had soiled his diaper, and that faeces were smeared on his hands and toys. Angered, the accused scolded him ""naughty boy"" and slapped his face several times, causing him to fall to the ground. The boy was in tears. She continued to hit him multiple times as he lay on the ground, first with a fresh diaper then with a towel. The woman then told the boy to go to the bathroom. He stood up, but when he started to walk in the wrong direction, she was further angered. She used the towel to hit his face once, then hit him with her right hand, whereupon he fell to the ground. While he was on the ground, she kicked him once with her right foot. The woman then took the toddler to the bathroom, pushing him in and then using a clothes hanger to hit him twice on his back. The child's parents were not at home during the incident. Court documents did not specify how the case came to light, but said that the boy's parents brought him to the hospital on Jun 18, and that the police were alerted to a case of child abuse later that day. A medical report by the hospital noted two bruises measuring about 1cm by 3cm and 1cm by 7cm over the victim's back. The accused's ill-treatment of the boy was partially captured by cameras in the home. She could have been jailed eight years, fined up to S$8,000 or both."

The man was on Wednesday (Mar 9) jailed for 10 months and 14 weeks after pleading guilty to three charges of voyeurism and house-breaking. Another four charges were taken into consideration. He cannot be named due to a gag order on the identity of the victims and addresses where the offences took place.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/us-charges-2-siblings-crypto-fraud-ormeus-coin-2550111,US charges two siblings in US$124 million cryptocurrency fraud,"NEW YORK: US authorities on Tuesday (Mar 8) filed criminal charges against a cryptocurrency executive and civil charges against him and his sister, accusing them of defrauding retail investors out of millions of dollars with a digital token known as Ormeus Coin. In papers filed in Manhattan federal court, the Justice Department said John Barksdale lied about the value and profitability of Ormeus Coin's mining assets, including that the coin was backed by a US$250 million mining operation generating more than US$5 million of monthly revenue. Barksdale and his sister JonAtina Barksdale were separately charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission with conducting fraudulent unregistered offerings of Ormeus Coin. The SEC said the Barksdales since 2017 raised US$124 million from more than 20,000 investors through their multi-level marketing company Ormeus Global SA, and spent millions of dollars on travel, real estate and other personal expenses. Authorities said the siblings promoted Ormeus Coin through roadshows and social media, as well as a Times Square jumbotron in Manhattan proclaiming: ""US$250 Million Cryptocurrency Mining Farm Revealed in Legal Audit by Ormeus Coin."" The Barksdales ""acted as modern-day snake-oil salesmen"" in misleading investors, Melissa Hodgman, associate director of the SEC enforcement division, said in a statement. Lawyers for the Barksdales could not immediately be identified. John Barksdale has been arrested, and faces up to 65 years in prison on securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy charges, according to the Justice Department. Both defendants are US citizens, with John Barksdale, 41, having lived in Thailand and JonAtina Barksdale, 45, in Hong Kong, the SEC said. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has called the cryptocurrency industry the ""Wild West"" of finance and wants cryptocurrency exchanges to register with the SEC. The White House has been considering broad oversight over the cryptocurrency market, in part to address ransomware and other cyber crime. President Joe Biden is expected this week to direct the Justice Department and other federal agencies to study possible ramifications from creating a US central bank digital currency, a person familiar with the matter said."

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/traffic-police-check-officer-dragged-cte-2548301,"Man jailed for driving off during police check, dragging officer into middle of CTE","SINGAPORE: A man drove off in the middle of a Traffic Police check while an officer held onto his steering wheel during the morning rush hour last year. The officer was dragged for a distance of 75m by the moving car. He was eventually hurled into the middle of the Central Expressway (CTE), where he rolled to a stop in front of three lanes of traffic. Heng Yong Qin, 32, was sentenced on Tuesday (Mar 8) to a total of six years and 36 days' jail and three strokes of the cane after pleading guilty to voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty. He was given an additional 44 days' jail as he committed offences while under a remission order. Heng also pleaded guilty to two other charges of breaching his curfew under his remission order in September and October 2020, and consuming methamphetamine sometime around March 2021. The victim was a senior staff sergeant with the Singapore Police Force. On the morning of the incident on on Mar 27, 2021, he was driving along the CTE towards Ayer Rajah Expressway at around 7.30am when he saw Heng driving his car without a seatbelt. He signalled to Heng to pull over at the road shoulder, which Heng did. The officer then parked his motorcycle behind the car. The officer signalled to Heng to exit his car, but Heng ignored him and stayed in the vehicle. Sensing that something was amiss, the officer walked over to the window on the driver's side and asked Heng why he was not wearing a seatbelt. Heng did not answer the question and handed over his driver's licence. The officer screened the licence and found that Heng was wanted by the Central Narcotics Bureau for failing to report for his urine test. The officer asked Heng to exit his vehicle, open his car boot and lean against the boot to remain within sight. Heng did as he was told. But when he spotted another police vehicle approaching, he came nervous that he would be arrested. Heng decided to flee the scene and immediately dashed towards the driver's seat, according to court documents. The officer tried to grab his arm but he managed to break free, enter the car and start the ignition. Knowing that Heng was intending to flee the scene, the officer held onto the victim's arm with his left hand and the car's steering wheel with his right hand. Heng hit the officer's left arm to break free. He then stepped on the accelerator pedal and drove off, despite knowing that the officer was still holding onto his steering wheel. The officer was dragged along with the car until he lost his balance and fell onto the road, where he remained lying on the ground, unable to get up. In court, the prosecution played video footage of the incident that showed the officer being flung into the middle of the CTE, which was then busy with many vehicles including lorries. The officer's colleague later rode his motorcycle and parked it between the victim and oncoming traffic. There was a build-up of traffic as vehicles tried to avoid the victim. The victim lay on the ground for about 18 minutes before he was taken to the hospital. He sustained injuries to his neck and back, and received 10 days of hospitalisation leave. According to court documents, after Heng saw the officer fall onto the road, he stepped harder on his accelerator and sped off. To escape detection, he parked outside a primary school and walked towards Whampoa, where he flagged a taxi to his cousin's house. He was arrested later that day. Deputy Public Prosecutor Phoebe Tan sought a jail term of between six years and 36 days, and six years, nine months and 74 days, with three strokes of the cane. She said it was ""purely fortuitous"" that no vehicles collided into the victim when he was lying on the road. She also argued that Heng's plea of guilt should not be given significant weight for mitigation as there was  ""overwhelming"" evidence against him in the form of the video footage. Defence lawyer Wee Hong Shern asked for not more than five years and 10 months' jail. He said that Heng's offence did not involve a great degree of sophistication or planning, but was ""reactionary"". Heng's knowledge that he faced a jail sentence for breaching his remission order ""launched him into a state of panic and desperation"", said Mr Wee."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-lock-tenant-flat-demand-money-wrongful-confinement-2547791,"Man jailed for locking mother's tenant in flat, demanding money","SINGAPORE: A 60-year-old man padlocked his mother's tenant in a flat for two-and-a-half hours, only unlocking the gate when the tenant gave him S$100. The man, Lim Kok Inn, was jailed four weeks on Tuesday (Mar 8) after pleading guilty to one count of wrongful confinement. The court heard that Lim's mother used to live in the flat as the landlord of the 56-year-old victim. Lim, who was unemployed, did not live with his mother. However, he used to go to the flat to ask her for money, shouting and demanding if she did not give him any. At some point, Lim's mother moved out to stay with her daughter. Lim was not aware of this. Around Aug 20, 2021, he went to his mother's flat and rang the doorbell, but no one responded. On Aug 29 that year, at around 7.40am, he used a padlock to lock the flat's front metal gate and knocked on the door repeatedly. According to court documents, Lim knew that his mother's tenant was in the flat and padlocked the gate to get the tenant's attention. He left after no one came to the door. Lim returned at around 9am and pressed the doorbell repeatedly. When the victim answered the door, Lim demanded that he call Lim's sister. Lim then left the unit. Over a separate phone call with his sister, Lim told her that he needed money and would release the padlock when he received S$200. Lim's sister told the victim to pay him the money. When Lim returned to the flat at around 10am, the victim told him he only had S$100. Lim asked him for the money, unlocked the padlock and said he would return the next day for the remaining S$100. Lim's sister has since returned S$100 to the victim. The prosecution sought four to six weeks' jail, saying that Lim wrongfully confined the victim to extort money from him. Lim could have been jailed up to three years, fined or both."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/it-engineer-steal-ntu-wifi-device-hand-sanitiser-2547111,"IT engineer admits stealing Wi-Fi devices, hand sanitiser from NTU","SINGAPORE: An IT engineer admitted on Tuesday (Mar 8) to stealing more than S$2,000 worth of computer equipment and cleaning products from Nanyang Technological University (NTU). Tung Chi Kit, 31, an NTU alumnus, pleaded guilty to one charge of theft committed in March 2021. Another two charges of theft will be taken into consideration for sentencing. A district judge ordered a mandatory treatment order suitability report for Tung, who told the court he has been attending a clinic at the Institute of Mental Health for psychiatric help. He is set to return to court for sentencing in April. A mandatory treatment order directs an offender suffering from certain treatable psychiatric conditions to undergo psychiatric treatment. On Mar 29 last year, Tung drove to a building at the university's North Spine and went up to a classroom on the fifth floor. At about 11.30pm, he stood on a table, unscrewed an Internet wireless access point worth about S$1,000 from its mount on the ceiling of the classroom, and put it in his bag. Tung also took an open packet of wet wipes, worth S$10, from the classroom. On his way out of the building, he saw four bottles of hand sanitiser placed along a corridor. He also took these, valued at about S$8 each. He then drove to NTU's South Spine building, where he entered another classroom and stole another wireless access point. He forcefully removed the device, causing damage to the metal bars and false ceiling it was fixed to, which required repair. He also stole another open bag of wet wipes. The stolen items have since been recovered from Tung except for the bottles of hand sanitiser, for which he made restitution. Tung also stole three computer monitors, worth a total of S$900, and another two wireless access points from NTU in December 2019 and February 2021 respectively. The equipment was recovered from him, the prosecution said. The prosecution sought between two and four weeks' jail, saying that Tung was ""recalcitrant"" and that the theft was premeditated. The prosecution also highlighted that the wet wipes and hand sanitiser he stole were provided by the school for disinfection during the COVID-19 pandemic. The defence asked for a mandatory treatment order report, saying that Tung was remorseful and a young, first-time offender. For committing theft, Tung could be jailed for up to seven years and fined."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/female-police-officer-singapore-golden-dragon-hotel-geylang-murder-2545636,What does it take to be a female investigation officer in Singapore?,"Deputy Superintendent of Police Teo Ko Sing was 24 when she joined the Singapore Police Force (SPF) in 2012, moving from an office job in another government agency. She didn’t want to be “confined to an office job”, the environmental engineering graduate said. And she was also inspired by a female friend who joined the force before her.  She started as an investigation officer dealing with cases from missing persons to theft, then became the team leader of a patrolling team before moving on to handle policy work. She eventually found her calling in investigation work, so it’s no surprise that her current posting, since October 2018, is with the Special Investigation Section (SIS) in the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). At first meeting, the 34-year-old seems serious – as you’d almost expect her to be, given the nature of her job.  But she displays a lighthearted side,too, sharing that she’s “very different” in her work and personal life. “In my personal life, I’m very lazy – because I just don’t want to think and make decisions,” she laughed.  You could say her sentiments are perfectly understandable – when dealing with serious crimes such as murder, making swift decisions in every step of the investigation is expected. The fate of the accused, which for murder, is punishable by death.  CNA Women finds out what makes her tick, and how she came to solve the Geylang hotel murder case involving a Bangladeshi worker and his Indonesian maid girlfriend.  HAS DEALING WITH SERIOUS CRIMES LIKE MURDER CHANGED YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON LIFE? When a serious crime, like murder, is committed, it’s not about who’s right, but who’s left behind. The perpetrator will have to face the consequences, and the deceased’s next of kin has to handle the grief of the passing.  As an investigation officer, I uncover the whole process, including the thought processes and decisions made by the perpetrators, which led to multiple tragedies and loss of lives. This makes me reflect more on my small and big decisions in life. Do I need to be angry over this matter? Can I do things in another way? Should I give up? I’ve learnt to be more calm and collected in handling my emotions. I’ve also learnt to treasure my family and friends as life events can be unpredictable. We never know how much time we have left to spend with them. THE GEYLANG HOTEL MURDER WAS YOUR FIRST MURDER CASE –  TELL US MORE ABOUT THAT.  This was in December 2018 and it was two months after I joined SIS. I was very new and inexperienced compared to the other officers.  The case involved a female foreigner who was found dead at a hotel room in Geylang. She was found on the bed with strangulation around her neck. Through ground inquiries and CCTV footage, we quickly established that a male foreigner was suspected to have caused her death. But he had left the scene and couldn’t be found.  WALK US THROUGH WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE MURDER SCENE. If you ask me whether I was ready to investigate the case then, I would say I wasn’t. But regardless, I was there at the scene and I had to take charge of the situation.  You can imagine that everyone wants an answer – on why, what, how, where and when it happened. Information would flow in from multiple sources at the same time.  WHAT WAS THE MOST STRESSFUL PART AT THAT TIME? I had a missing perpetrator who had fled the scene. For the public's safety, we had to find him very fast.  Of course, I also felt the weight of responsibility on my shoulders, as I would be the one making the important decisions to move the investigation forward, and apprehend the perpetrator quickly to stop him from causing further harm. HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO ARREST HIM? We arrested him through an ambush at his workplace the next morning, when he attempted to get his passport from his employer. His arrest was made no more than 14 hours after the case was reported.  But you can imagine how much probing and ground inquiries we had to make. We had to knock on doors, get people to come down and show us CCTV footage. It was a lot of effort – I definitely couldn’t do it alone.  WHAT HAPPENS AFTER AN ARREST HAS BEEN MADE? Although we apprehended the suspect, the story doesn’t end there. In fact, for murder cases such as this, it’s a two-year journey, minimally, so the investigation had just begun.  Now the issue is about prosecution. We need closure for the victim. In other words, we have to build a case against the accused person for murder beyond reasonable doubt (which means that there must be sufficient evidence presented to the court to deem a person guilty of the crime). The offence of murder is punishable by death, so you must appreciate that a life could be taken based on our investigation findings. There’s a saying in SIS: We leave no stone unturned – so it takes a lot of effort to prove a case of murder. I had to go to the postmortem to listen to what pathologists say, the circumstances of the injuries, medical findings, forensic examinations, interviews, and psychiatric evaluation. DID YOU ACHIEVE WHAT YOU WANTED WHEN THE CASE WAS CONCLUDED? At the end of the day, I’m no judge. But I will present all evidence accurately and without bias. And I do so with a clear conscience that I’ve handled the case objectively and not allowed personal emotions to cloud my judgement or prejudice the investigation. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS THE MOST REWARDING PART OF BEING AN INVESTIGATION OFFICER? For me, it is rewarding when the investigation outcome has an impact on the victims – I get to provide closure to victims when the crime is solved. Being in the police force, I meet a lot of people from different walks of life. I find inspiration in everyone I meet.  Everyone’s experiences are unique – for example, I’m inspired by my colleague’s pursuit of justice or passion for their projects. Members of the public also inspire me in their little ways – such as their courage to come forward to report their cases. WHAT IS IT LIKE TO BE A FEMALE OFFICER IN A MALE-DOMINATED WORK ENVIRONMENT?  I’m proud to say that I’m able to contribute by challenging gender stereotype, and to prove that a female investigation officer is equally professional and capable in their investigation work.  WHAT IS THE HARDEST PART OF THE JOB? Managing the loved ones and next-of-kin of both the deceased and the accused. When a person may have made a mistake, their loved ones are very supportive of him or her although they acknowledge that there are consequences that he or she has to face. HOW DO YOU COPE WITH THE LONG WORKING HOURS?   Taking the Geylang murder case as an example, it was a 14-hour day from the time I arrived at the scene. Sometimes, the initial investigation can drag on for days. It can be very intense.  We try our best to go home and have a shower, have a nap before coming back to the office to continue. The longest that I didn’t go home was a good five days – we have safari beds in the office.  Personally, I don’t have personal time (laughs). But I also don’t think the long working hours are causing me to not have personal time – it’s about the quality of the personal time you spend with your loved ones. I have very supportive parents (I still live with them) who don’t feel that I don’t spend enough time with them. WHAT DO YOU DO TO DECOMPRESS? I usually don’t talk about my cases at home. I try to watch happy shows, such as variety shows and short clips. I don’t enjoy dramas with a lot of crying (laughs) – as that would be more emotional. There are a lot of ways to protect my mental health, and I also run to keep myself fit.  GIVEN THE EMOTIONAL CHALLENGES OF THE JOB, DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE BECOME MORE OR LESS EMPATHETIC SINCE YOU STARTED?   I think it’s even easier to be empathetic. It’s unlike a drama when you see someone cry. Here, you are seeing this person crying in front of you. Anyone who faces it will have a soft heart for the deceased’s next of kin or loved ones. As for the accused, sometimes they are the loved ones of the deceased. When presenting their side of the story, whatever the reasons they have in doing such a thing, they too will have to pour out their emotions to the court during statement taking. To put it simply, both sides are human. It’s more about helping them to have their account, said in the way they want to say it, and present it to the court. This is to be fair to them. WHAT KEEPS YOU GOING THROUGH THE CHALLENGES? My former supervisor once told me what he observed throughout his decades-long career, that people mainly stay in the job for two reasons: They either like the work environment and the people, or they find meaning in their work. I can safely say that I’ve found both where I am, and that’s what sustains me. This story is part of CNA Women's series marking International Women's Day on Mar 8.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/flight-attendant-molest-stewardess-jail-sentence-2545251,Flight attendant gets jail for molesting air stewardess on the plane,"SINGAPORE: A flight attendant was sentenced on Monday (Mar 7) to five weeks' jail for molesting a female colleague during a flight from Singapore to the Philippines in 2019. The 50-year-old man was convicted in January of outraging the modesty of a flight stewardess. He slapped her buttock on May 3, 2019, when walking past her on the plane and when she was attending to a passenger. Details of the airline and names of involved parties were redacted from court documents, and a gag order is in place to protect the identity of the victim. During the trial, the accused denied touching or slapping the victim's buttock, claiming to have only ""tapped"" the victim's ""right side of the pelvic"" when he saw that she was leaning against the seat, and that her buttocks were ""protruding"" into the aisle. He also described her posture as ""provocative"" and claimed that he touched her to correct her posture. The accused's lawyer told the court that he intends to appeal against the conviction and sentence. Deputy Public Prosecutor Lee Wei Liang asked for six to eight weeks' jail, and said that the offence took place on an aircraft where the victim would have difficulty obtaining the assistance of law enforcement. As an air transportation worker, the incident could have compromised her ability to carry out her duties in the event of an emergency during the flight, he said. Mr Lee also pointed out the ""serious abuse of trust"" as the accused was the inflight manager and the highest-ranking crew member on the flight. He was also the victim's direct supervisor. The victim had been working as a flight stewardess for about three years and was deployed in the business class cabin on the day of the incident. About 30 minutes before the plane was due to land in the Philippines, the victim attended to a passenger. The passenger wanted to show her an item he wanted to buy from a magazine, and the stewardess was standing next to him. She testified that she was standing with her knees slightly bent, her upper body leaning slightly forward and tilted a bit towards the chair. Suddenly, she felt a ""smack"" on her right buttock and jolted up in response to the contact, she recounted at trial. She saw the accused walking past her, and there was no one else behind her. The accused stopped, looked at her and told her: ""Don't lah, stand like this"" in a ""cheeky or a playful manner"". The victim did not confront the accused immediately, but later told the leading steward what had happened. After the flight landed and the crew were preparing for the turnaround flight, the accused approached her and apologised, the victim said. According to her, he said he had ""no intention to do it"". On the turnaround flight, the victim was deployed to work in the economy class cabin. In the presence of other colleagues, the accused apologised to the victim, who asked him to state what he was apologising for. During the confrontation, he admitted to hitting the victim's buttock, she said. The victim lodged a police report after she landed in Singapore. For outraging a person's modesty, the accused could have been jailed for up to two years and fined. He cannot be caned as he is 50. The man faces another charge of outrage of modesty for allegedly slapping the buttocks of a woman on a flight to the Netherlands on Nov 26, 2018."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/matthew-ho-jun-jia-crypto-amazon-google-riot-games-2544876,"Singaporean deceived Amazon, Google for cloud services to mine cryptocurrency","SINGAPORE: A 32-year-old man who faces criminal charges in the United States on Monday (Mar 7) admitted in a Singapore court to impersonating two men to deceive Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google for cloud computing services that he used to mine cryptocurrency. Singaporean Ho Jun Jia, also known as Matthew Ho, was charged with identity theft and wire fraud in the US in October 2019. He was unemployed when he committed the offences. One of his victims was Marc Merrill, the co-founder of video game developer Riot Games. Ho used personal and credit card information obtained from a Dark Web forum to cheat AWS and Google into providing cloud computing services worth about US$5.2 million (S$7.1 million) and US$250,000 respectively. Between Nov 21, 2017, and Mar 1, 2018, he used this computing power to mine about 1,468 units of the cryptocurrency Ether. He sold about 203 units of the illegally acquired Ether, making more than S$347,000, which he spent on personal expenses. Ho pleaded guilty on Monday to 11 charges, including offences under the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act and cheating by personation. He is set to return to court next month for mitigation and sentencing. The court heard that in 2017, Ho forged US driving licences for others on a Darkweb forum that styled itself as ""#1 Fraud Community"". In return for his services, Ho was given access to a ""VIP"" section of the forum that contained individuals' names, addresses and credit card details. Around Oct 19, 2017, he obtained the information of 70 individuals including Mr Merrill and another man named Harold Borland. Using Mr Merrill's personal information, Ho gained access to the developer's AMEX bank account and changed the email address associated with the account to a new email address with a similar name. On Nov 3, 2017, Ho registered a new user account with AWS using Merrill's name, address, AMEX credit card number and the email address he created. On at least 40 occasions between Nov 4, 2017, and Jan 28, 2018, while in Singapore, Ho deceived AWS into believing that he was Mr Merrill and delivering cloud computing services. The AWS account linked to Mr Merrill was suspended on Jan 27, 2018, after several failed attempts by the company to contact Ho by email to pay the outstanding bill. Around Nov 3, 2017, Ho used Mr Merrill's details to register a new account on the Google Cloud Platform. On at least 38 occasions between Nov 4, 2017, and Feb 23, 2018, he deceived Google into providing cloud services while in Singapore. As part of his deceptions of the two companies, Ho also used Photoshop to forge a driving licence and AMEX credit card for Mr Merrill. Google suspended the account on Feb 23, 2018, after informing Ho that they were unable to process payment. Both AWS and Google refunded payments to AMEX after receiving chargeback requests from the bank and conducting internal investigations. Ho also used Mr Merrill's details to register an account with Namecheap, which provided domain-hosting and other services, ringing up a bill of about US$900 between October 2017 and August 2018. He went on to run the same scheme with AWS using the details of another man, Harold Borland. Between Nov 19, 2017, and Apr 18, 2018, he deceived AWS into providing US$21 worth of cloud computing services. On Sep 24, 2019, officers from the Technology Crime Investigation Branch raided Ho's home and arrested him. He has not made any restitution or compensation to date."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-stabs-safe-distancing-officer-serangoon-park-connector-2544711,"Man admits stabbing safe distancing enforcement officer, almost severing his thumb","SINGAPORE: A 62-year-old man admitted on Monday (Mar 7) to stabbing and slashing a safe distancing enforcement officer at Sungei Serangoon Park Connector in 2020, almost severing the victim's thumb. Ahirrudin Al-Had Haji Arrifin pleaded guilty to one count each of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, unlawfully possessing a scheduled weapon and violating COVID-19 control orders by not wearing a mask. The man was emotional in court, interrupting the reading of the charges to tell the judge that he was crying because he was ""sad"". He is set to be sentenced next week. The victim, a 38-year-old employee of the National Parks Board (NParks), suffered serious injuries to both hands as well as his chest, arm and scalp. He underwent general and hand surgery and received 89 days of medical leave. The court heard that on the morning of May 4, 2020, Ahirrudin cycled to the park connector intending to pick pandan leaves for cooking. He was not wearing a mask. Singapore's ""circuit breaker"" to prevent the spread of COVID-19 was in effect at the time. Ahirrudin brought with him two karambit knives with blades about 10cm long, hiding them under the insoles of his shoes. He intended to use these to cut the pandan. He also had with him a nearly 1m-long walking stick that contained a 20.8cm-long blade at its lower end, concealed by a wooden sheath with a rubber stopper. The walking stick was previously taped to his bicycle. The victim was driving through the park connector in a buggy with another safe distancing enforcement officer when he spotted the accused, who was not wearing a mask, and the pandan leaves in his bicycle basket. The two officers approached the man, telling him that he was not allowed to cut the pandan leaves at the park connector and asked him to wear a mask. As Ahirrudin remained uncooperative, the victim took a photograph of him violating COVID-19 rules and asked for his particulars, which the man refused to give. The victim then called the police and took a video of the man, who had started hurling Hokkien vulgarities. This angered Ahiruddin further. He unsheathed the blade of his walking stick and stabbed the left side of the victim's chest. He later entered the buggy and forcefully pushed the blade at least two more times. Both men fell out of the buggy onto a grass patch and Ahiruddin dropped the walking stick. He retrieved one of the karambit knives from his shoe and slashed the victim with it, almost severing the victim's left thumb. The men continued struggling until a passer-by intervened. Ahiruddin, who had been biting the victim's right hand, eventually let go and dropped the karambit knife. The victim, his colleague and the passer-by ran away from the accused and stopped at Tampines Expressway to wait for an ambulance and the police. After the assault, Ahiruddin cycled home with the walking stick. He hid the weapon in a compartment at the washing area of the void deck. He was arrested later that afternoon outside a convenience store. Police recovered the karambit knives and walking stick. The prosecution sought 12 to 15 years' jail, arguing that public interest was one of the main considerations for sentencing as the actions of the accused ""undermined"" the safety and confidence of safe distancing officers. The prosecution also cited the high level of harm caused by the accused. According to a doctor, the stabs to the victim's chest could have been fatal if the blade had entered his heart. The victim has since regained the ability to perform his occupation and lead an active lifestyle, but the strength of his left hand and fingers are diminished compared to his right side, causing permanent inconveniences to daily life, said the prosecutors. In mitigation, Ahiruddin's defence lawyer said the man was deeply remorseful and had attacked the victim impulsively, without premeditation. He asked for eight to 10 years' jail."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-rape-sexual-abuse-daughters-camp-instructor-2544441,"Children's camp instructor sexually abused 4 underaged daughters over 14 years, denied them food","SINGAPORE: A 45-year-old Singaporean man admitted on Monday (Mar 7) to raping his daughter when she was 12 to 13 years old, and denying her food for four days. The charges formed part of a 14-year period over which the man sexually abused four of his daughters between 2004 and 2018. Prosecutors said the harm inflicted upon the victims by their father was ""something that no sentence can fully capture, and no punishment can erase"". The man, who cannot be named due to gag orders on his and the victim's identity, was convicted after pleading guilty to seven charges of aggravated rape, aggravated sexual assault involving penetration, aggravated outrage of modesty and ill-treatment of a child. Twenty-six more charges, mostly for rape, sexual assault and outrage of modesty of his other daughters, will be taken into consideration for sentencing. They also included charges of voluntarily causing hurt to his wife by punching, caning and slapping her. The man will be sentenced by Justice Tan Siong Thye next week. The court heard that the man was a freelance camp instructor for kids' adventure camps prior to his arrest. He was married to a 41-year-old woman.  The victim, identified as V1 in court documents, is one of their children. She is now 16 and a student. The couple had four other children together – three girls now aged 12, 18 and 19 and a boy now aged 15. The accused also has two children from a previous marriage – his daughter is now 24 and his son is now 23. The abuse started when V1 was in Primary 5. In 2016, her father called her into his room and showed her a pornographic video of a man and a girl engaged in sexual acts. He told her that the girl in the video was in Primary 5 and the man was her father. He then made her ""pinky-promise"" not to tell anyone about this. That year, the man started to sexually abuse his daughter. This happened on several occasions from 2016 to 2018, usually at night while her mother was out working, in the accused's bedroom. In 2018, the man told the victim that she needed to have sex with him every month or he would stop her from going to school. This frightened the victim, as she was afraid of having to remain home all day if she did not attend school, which would mean spending more time with her father and being sexually abused by him. The court heard that the victim did not dare to physically resist her father as she was afraid he would turn aggressive and withdraw her from school. Whenever she verbally protested to the sexual acts, her father ignored her. She did not tell anyone about the abuse because her father made her promise not to, and she did not want him to hate her. She also feared no one would believe her, and that she would be sent away from her family to stay in a girls' home. Sometime in September or October 2017, the accused brought V1 with him to visit the family's new flat, which was still under construction. She was 12 years old at the time. At the flat, he asked her to take a shower with him, after which he raped her. He made her promise not to tell anyone what happened. The family moved into the new flat in November 2017. Sometime between January and November 2018, on a weekend afternoon when the victim's mother was not at home, the man called the victim into the master bedroom, where he raped her. The girl felt pain and told him so, but he did not stop. He again made her promise not to tell anyone what happened. At least twice in 2018, the accused conducted ""body checks"" on V1, then aged 12 to 13, and two of her sisters who were aged 14 or 15 and 15 or 16 at the time. The two other sisters were identified as V2 and V4 in court documents. One such ""body check"" took place at night between January and Nov 16, 2018, when the man called his daughters into the master bedroom one by one. When it was V1's turn to go in, he told her to remove her underwear and lie down on a settee. He performed a sex act on her under the pretext of cleaning her private parts. The victim felt uncomfortable and in slight pain. The man then took a photograph of her private parts with his phone before asking her to put her clothes back on. Shortly after, the man called his three daughters back into the bedroom together. He called each girl to him while the other two stood at a distance. He showed each girl a photograph of her vagina on his phone and then deleted the photograph. Another similar ""body check"" took place between Sep 20 and Nov 16, 2018 at night involving the same three girls. In the evening of Sep 1, 2018, the accused got angry that V1, V2 and V4 had brought their younger siblings to the playground before finishing their household chores to his satisfaction. He punished the girls by not allowing them and their younger brother, then about 12, to eat for the next four days. The man threw away all the food in the house, including all raw and frozen food in their refrigerator. He did not cook, and also forbade his wife from cooking, instead dining out if they wanted to eat. There were large bottles of water in the refrigerator, but the accused bound them together with rubber bands so he would know if the children had tampered with them. He also cut off the electricity supply to the family's lights, refrigerator and air-conditioner. When it was warm, the children fanned themselves with pieces of paper. Over the next four days, the children subsisted on tap water and food that was smuggled to them by other members of the family without their father's knowledge. For example, the children's mother brought them packets of chicken rice and hid biscuits and potato chips in the letterbox, which were retrieved for them by the boyfriend of their eldest sister. On the night of Sep 6, 2018, the man allowed his children to eat plain rice. They resumed eating and drinking as usual the next day. The last rape occurred on the night of Nov 16, 2018, after the children's mother left to work an overnight shift as a sales assistant. The accused told V1 to come into the master bedroom with a towel, as if she intended to bathe there. Sometime after 10pm, the girl went to the master bedroom and locked the door after herself, as she was told. The man asked his daughter to wash her private parts in the toilet. She did so and put her clothes back on, but as she made to leave the toilet, he asked her to go back in. After it was over, they washed up in the toilet and the man told his daughter not to tell anyone what had happened. Later that night, the girl's sisters V2 and V4 noticed her leaving the master bedroom and found it strange that she had showered there. When they asked her what had happened, the girl broke down and said that their father had just had sex with her. She also said this had been happening since she was in Primary 5. V2 persuaded her sister to file a police report, and they decided to go to a police station far away from their house so their father could not find them. The two girls left the flat at about 12.20am that night under the pretence of going to dispose of rubbish. They took a Grab car which V2's boyfriend had booked, to a police station in Bedok. There, V1 lodged a police report to say her father had been sexually assaulting her. After his daughters left the flat, the man searched for them at three police stations but to no avail. That morning, he visited 10 different websites on how to pass a lie detector test. He was arrested on the afternoon of Nov 17, 2018. After lodging the police report, V1 was taken to KK Women's and Children's Hospital, where she was warded for a week. She then stayed at a children's home for about two weeks before returning home. In a victim impact statement taken from V1 in February, the girl said she still had nightmares about the assaults at least once a month. The prosecution sought a sentence of 32 years in jail and 24 strokes of the cane – the maximum number allowed in Singapore. Deputy Public Prosecutors Muhamad Imaduddien, Sarah Siaw and Angela Ang highlighted five aggravating factors. These were: The accused's forcible sexual penetration of a victim below 14 years old, his serious abuse of trust as the father of the victim, his sexual grooming and threats against the victim, premeditation to create ""windows of opportunity"" where he was alone with the victim and his decision not to use protection during some of the rapes. They also argued that the man's plea of guilt should be given minimal weight as the plea was entered late, after the case had already gone to trial. The man's pro bono defence lawyer, Ms Ng Pei Qi of Rajah & Tann, asked for a sentence of 26 to 28 years in jail and 24 strokes of the cane. For each charge of aggravated rape, the man could be jailed between eight and 20 years and caned at least 12 strokes."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/vtl-bus-ticket-ecommerce-scam-man-arrested-spf-2539566,Man arrested for alleged involvement in VTL bus ticket e-commerce scam,"SINGAPORE: A man has been arrested for his suspected involvement in a series of e-commerce scams involving the sale of vaccinated travel lane (VTL) bus tickets, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) said on Friday (Mar 4). On Feb 19, police received a report from a victim who had allegedly been cheated by an online seller who had advertised the sale of VTL bus tickets. “After the victim had made the payment amounting to S$195, the seller purportedly failed to deliver the VTL bus tickets and became uncontactable,” SPF said in a news release. “Through follow-up investigations, officers from the Commercial Affairs Department established the identity of the man and arrested him on Mar 3, 2022.” Preliminary investigations revealed that the 26-year-old man may have been involved in several other cheating cases, SPF added. He will be charged in court on Mar 7 for cheating, an offence which carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a fine. “The police would like to remind members of the public that VTL bus tickets can only be purchased from the appointed VTL bus ticket providers,” SPF said. “VTL bus tickets are non-transferable.” Both VTL bus operators earlier this week warned customers about ticket scams.  Transtar Travel said its tickets are sold only through three platforms - its website, Shopee and Raffles Connect (Raffles Medical Group). ""The ticket price is S$15 adult and S$8 child for Singapore to Malaysia, RM20 adult and RM10 child for Malaysia to Singapore,"" it said.  Causeway Link said it was aware that various VTL tickets were being sold on social media and other online platforms.  ""Please be informed that we strongly don't support these online sellers selling VTL tickets,"" said Causeway Link, adding that tickets are available on its website and mobile app. Both operators said all tickets sold are non-transferable. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/company-director-misappropriate-gold-bar-funds-5-million-2539546,Company director jailed 11 years for misappropriating more than S$5 million from sale of gold bars,"SINGAPORE: A company director was on Friday (Mar 4) jailed 11 years for misappropriating more than S$5 million and cheating more than S$666,000 from multiple victims who ordered gold bars. Nguyen Thi Thu Lan, 51, was the director of Hans Global and the “directing mind and will” of the company’s gold business, which involved supplying 1kg gold bars, stated court documents. She was sentenced after pleading guilty to four counts of criminal breach of trust and one count of cheating and dishonestly inducing a delivery of property. Nine other charges were taken into consideration. The Vietnamese national was uncooperative with police, and has not divulged the whereabouts of the gold bars and misappropriated money, according to the prosecution. The court heard that Nguyen’s offences started in August 2018. YNK, a company dealing in gold, agreed to purchase 50 gold bars from her and transferred about S$2.5 million to Hans Global’s bank account for the purchase on Aug 30. That same day, Nguyen dishonestly converted about S$960,000 of YNK’s payment to her own use. She drew on this sum to issue a cheque for S$980,000 to a man named Visvanathan Govindasamy. Between September and December that year, she also used money paid by YNK for later and separate orders to fulfil the shortfall in gold bars that arose out of her misappropriation of the first payment. In this way, she prevented YNK from discovering its payment had been misappropriated. The company received a refund of only S$7,000 in January 2019. She committed similar offences against Singapore Island Resources. Around Sep 5, 2018, the company agreed to buy 53 gold bars from Nguyen and transferred more than S$2.6 million over the following days. She used this money to purchase 50 gold bars, but these were never delivered to Singapore Island Resources. When the company questioned her, Nguyen gave excuses, claiming that there was a delay as she needed to check each gold bar individually to ensure they were in good condition or that her supplier refused to release the gold bars as a minimum order quantity had not been met. Singapore Island Resources was refunded only S$10,000 in January 2019. In August 2018, Nguyen ceased the gold business due to the disapproval of her husband, who is co-director of Hans Global. She incorporated a new company, SJC Joint Venture, to carry out gold trading instead. Nguyen’s 26-year-old stepson served as the sole director of SJC Joint Venture, but he took instructions from her and she ran the day-to-day operations of the company. She ran a similar ruse in this new company, misappropriating more than S$1.2 million from four victims who bought gold bars from her. Among them was Singapore Island Resources, which in December 2018 again paid almost S$320,000 for six gold bars that it never received. Nguyen used S$220,000 from the payment to buy three gold bars, but they were never delivered to Singapore Island Resources. When chased by them, she gave more excuses, such as being busy and the supplier’s vault only opening on certain days. The company did not receive any refunds for this purchase. Another victim was ORO Trading, which paid more than S$530,000 for 10 gold bars in December 2018. Nguyen bought nine gold bars with this money, but they were never delivered to ORO Trading. The company received only S$10,000 in refunds in January 2019. When asked about the delay, she again gave excuses, claiming that she was wrongly supplied with many “small 1gr bars” of gold. Nguyen also cheated the director of JAJ, a company dealing with gold, and the director’s husband of more than S$666,000. In January 2019, Nguyen’s acquaintance conveyed to her a request from a manager of JAJ indicating that the company wanted to buy gold bars from SJC but wanted assurance they would be able to deliver the gold. Over WhatsApp, she replied with images that purported to be a “World Renowned Mints and Refineries Certificate for Agent Distributor” and an “ABC Refinery Certificate of Ownership” for ownership of 20,000 gold bars. These certificates were forgeries created by Nguyen. Relying on the certificate of ownership, JAJ paid S$666,000 for 12 gold bars in January 2019. At Nguyen’s instruction, the money was deposited into a bank account belonging to another gold supplier. The deposit was reflected in Nguyen’s personal account with the supplier. By then, Nguyen already owed more than S$4.8 million worth of gold bars to various customers and was being hounded by them. She used the money deposited by JAJ to buy 11 gold bars from the gold supplier, which she distributed to Singapore Island Resources, YNK and ORO Trading. She also attempted to mask her misappropriation of JAJ’s payment by writing the company cheques for the sum, which were dishonoured for lack of funds, and saying her company could not obtain registration for the gold bars. Nguyen was arrested on May 22, 2019. She blamed her stepson for the misappropriations, making false claims such as that he threatened to kill Nguyen and her family in order to coerce her into handing over JAJ’s gold bars to other parties. In sentencing, Deputy Public Prosecutor Gerald Tan noted that Nguyen was a “persistent and sustained offender” who claimed eight victims in 17 months and took a “startlingly large” sum of money from them. The offences were premeditated, as demonstrated by the forgery of certificates required to cheat the director of JAJ, he said. Nguyen also took several steps to evade detection, such as using payments for later orders to fulfil earlier shortfalls, and fabricating falsehoods, said Mr Tan. In mitigation, defence lawyer David Marc Lee said Nguyen never intended to misappropriate the money but tried to fulfil every order possible until her arrest, and that it was “a case of terrible mismanagement” on her part. The prosecution responded by saying that the victims suffered “staggering losses”, and questioned the extent to which Nguyen did try to fulfil the gold bar orders. In sentencing, District Judge Ong Hian Sun said a deterrent sentence was necessary to send a message to the accused and other like-minded offenders."
