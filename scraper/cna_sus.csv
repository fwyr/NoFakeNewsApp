While Pakistan is no stranger to deadly floods, this event is especially shocking with more than 1,100 people dead so far and many millions more affected. Pakistan’s climate chief has said one-third of the country is underwater - an area larger than the state of Victoria state in Australia. This Northern Hemisphere summer has seen extreme weather event after extreme weather event, from record-breaking drought in Western Europe, the United States and China, to flooding in Japan and South Korea. This raises the question of the extent climate change is to blame. And, if so, is this what we should expect from now on? The flooding in Pakistan is the latest in a sequence of exceptional disasters in the Northern Hemisphere. Western Europe and central and eastern China have experienced record-breaking heatwaves and droughts leading to water restrictions. These heatwaves and droughts have also caused crop shortages, which are adding to the rising costs of food around the world. China was plunged into an energy security crisis. And Italy’s longest river is flowing at one-tenth of its usual rate. These droughts and their significant impacts are forecast to continue for the foreseeable future. Severe downpours have caused floods in places ranging from Dallas in the United States to Seoul in South Korea, which experienced its heaviest torrential rain in a century. Record-breaking heat extremes have also been recorded in Japan, the central US and in the United Kingdom, where temperatures exceeded 40 degrees Celsius for the first time. It has also only been a few months since we saw temperatures reach 50 degrees Celsius ahead of the monsoon rains in northern India and Pakistan. While it’s true that several of this summer’s extreme events have been exceptional, we normally see more high-impact extreme weather events in Northern Hemisphere summer than any other time. This is because extreme heat, very heavy downpours, and drought are more likely at the warmest time of year. Two-thirds of the planet’s land and more than 85 per cent of the world’s population are in the Northern Hemisphere. This means there are more people to be affected by extreme weather than in the Southern Hemisphere, making the Northern Hemisphere summer the prime time for disasters to have severe impacts. Additionally, extreme weather events can occur at the same time over different places, because of large-scale atmospheric waves called “Rossby waves”, which are a naturally occurring phenomenon, like La Nina and El Nino. Back in 2010, western Russia experienced severe heat and wildfires while Pakistan had some of their worst floods to date. These events were connected by a Rossby wave causing a high pressure pattern to get stuck over western Russia and low pressure to persist over Pakistan. Rossby waves can also result in heatwaves occurring at the same time, thousands of kilometres apart. Earlier this Northern Hemisphere summer, we saw simultaneous heatwaves strike the western US, western Europe and China. Rossby waves may well have contributed to simultaneous disasters this summer, but it’s too soon to say for sure. With so many extreme weather events causing mass deaths and large economic and environmental problems, it’s worth considering whether climate change may be making these events worse. Human-caused climate change has warmed the planet by about 1.2 degrees Celsius to date and this has caused some types of extreme weather to become more frequent and more intense, particularly extreme heatwaves and record-high temperatures. Every heatwave in today’s climate has the fingerprint of climate change resulting from our greenhouse gas emissions. Indeed, rapid analyses have already demonstrated that the human effect on the climate greatly increased the likelihood of the extreme heat in India and Pakistan in May, and the record high UK temperatures in July. Research also shows climate change is increasing the occurrence of simultaneous heatwaves in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly due to long-term warming. It’s less clear whether the Rossby wave pattern that causes simultaneous heatwaves in different places is becoming more frequent. Climate change is also shifting rainfall patterns resulting in worsening drought in some areas, such as in much of western Europe. And severe downpours and extreme short-duration heavy rain, such as that seen in Seoul and Dallas in recent weeks, are being intensified by climate change. This is because global warming results in the air being able to hold more moisture – for every 1 degree Celsius of warming, the atmosphere can hold 7 per cent more moisture. Indeed, the heavy rains in Pakistan follow an observed trend towards increasing extreme daily rainfall totals. This area of the world is projected to see a continued intensification of daily and multi-day extreme rain events over summer, as the planet warms. We can expect more extreme weather events in the coming years as global greenhouse gas emissions continue at near-record rates. Scientists have been predicting worsening extreme weather events - particularly heatwaves - for decades. Now, we are seeing this happen before our eyes. Some heat extremes in recent years have been far beyond what we thought would happen after just over 1 degree Celsius of global warming, such as western North America’s record heat of last summer. But it’s hard to tell if our projections are under-forecasting extreme heat. In any case, the world must prepare for further possible record-shattering high temperatures in the months, years and decades to come. We need to rapidly decarbonise to limit the damage caused by future extreme events. Andrew King is a senior lecturer in Climate Science at The University of Melbourne.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/travel/changi-village-bus-resort-upcycled-public-buses-sustainable-2906371,"At this upcoming resort at Changi Village, you can spend the night in upcycled public buses","You’ve likely fallen asleep in buses many times in your life because of early morning starts or long days at work. In the future, you can choose to do so in comfort – on a bed and not with your head resting on the shoulder of your seatmate – when the tentatively named The Bus Resort opens at Changi Village in the second quarter of next year.  Located next to Changi Village’s hawker centre, the new sustainability-focused resort will be made up of upcycled public buses. The project from Singapore travel agency WTS Travel and its partners, had its groundbreaking ceremony on Sunday (Aug 28). According to a media release, this is the first resort in Southeast Asia that will use reconstructed buses as guest rooms, providing the buses with a new lease of life. There will also be an events and experiences centre within the resort, for activities such as Pilates, yoga and other mindfulness-focused experiences. Each bus will offer about 28 sqm of space, making up a guest room that will be big enough to accommodate families. There’ll also be an outdoor area for each bus that can be used for barbecues. A night’s stay is expected to cost between S$300 and S$400. The resort is planned for launch in the second quarter of 2023, occupying more than 8,600 sqm of land. The Bus Resort – with its 20 guest rooms – will plug into the vibrant Changi Village ecosystem of F&B, retail stores and attractions, such as the newly renovated Changi Village Hawker Centre, Changi East Boardwalk, Changi Chapel & Museum and Smith Marine floating kelong. Minister Dr Maliki Osman, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office, Second Minister for Education and Foreign Affairs and Grassroots Adviser for East Coast GRC GROs (Siglap) officiated the groundbreaking ceremony.  He said: “Changi Point, with its rustic charm and lush greenery, is an enduring icon to many Singaporeans. This project will add a new attraction to an already vibrant area. It also demonstrates an innovative way to create exciting experiences while also upcycling. We hope to see more such developments which bring value to the community while also serving our longer term goals of a green and vibrant East Coast.” Micker Sia, WTS Travel’s managing director, said: “This is an incredible opportunity for Singapore, WTS Travel and partners to showcase how tourism, nature and environmentalism can come together for the benefit of our community. Through the execution of creative ideas, we can upcycle existing resources and create unique and exciting new experiences for both locals and tourists.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/style-beauty/eclarity-singapore-sustainable-jewellery-2838391,Want to save money on fine jewellery? This Singapore company rents them out or upcycles your heirlooms,"Fast fashion is notorious for its negative impact on the environment, but when it comes to fine jewellery, not many people are as aware or concerned about how its production can also be environmentally unsustainable.  After all, the average person is unlikely to buy as many, say, diamond rings as the number of garments one acquires in a year. Precious jewellery is also bought to be worn forever or passed down to future generations, instead of being tossed out with every fashion trend cycle. Even so, jewellery production does involve practices that also have a huge impact on the environment. For those who want to enjoy fine jewellery with a clear conscience, there are now multiple ways that allow one to do so – and even save you money at that.  CNA Lifestyle talks to homegrown jeweller Amanda Koo to find out more about the sustainable options she’s pushing with her jewellery business, eClarity. The idea isn’t exactly new – there are a number of fashion rental services here, making an extensive range of outfits and designer bags available to those who need them just for a special occasion or two, or those who simply want to enjoy being able to constantly change their wardrobe without buying more bags and clothes. But a rental service for fine jewellery? It’s not something we’ve heard of yet in Singapore. Even if it exists, it’s likely on a very limited scale. This is why eClarity’s jewellery rental subscription, The Sample Line, which makes more than 1,000 pieces of jewellery available for selection, piqued our interest.  For S$199 a month, the membership entitles a customer to rent one diamond jewellery piece every month. A gala plan is also available at S$690, with which elaborate pieces worth up to hundreds of thousands of dollars can be rented – the perfect solution for a formal do. The process seems fuss-free, too: The Sample Line is on an app, where designs can be browsed and selected for doorstep delivery. Anyone who wants to select a piece in person can also visit its gallery. In case you’re wondering, all rented-out pieces are cleaned, disinfected and checked carefully for any damage. While fashion rental platforms have been quite successful here, we wondered about the reception towards a similar service for fine jewellery, which many are accustomed to thinking of as a more personal possession – something one buys or is gifted, instead of renting to wear.  “People are warming up to the idea, especially the younger customers, who are shifting towards on-demand experiences. There is still a traditional mindset towards the ownership of luxury goods, especially in Asian countries like ours, where bridal and gifting purchases are important, and each piece of jewellery has both emotional and long-term value,” said Koo. She pointed out the benefits of going the rental route for fine jewellery – besides cost savings, it offers customers a chance to experience the jewellery and understand their personal preferences in terms of style and design better before making a purchase. “Aside from being a way to ‘test drive’ a piece before purchase, jewellery rental is also one of the easiest ways to work towards a circular economy, especially in our industry, which has seen its fair share of environmental impacts,” she added.  Koo has also observed how younger consumers, particularly, are gradually bypassing the need for the ownership of luxury goods and are preferring easier access to experience them. “Plus, they are also much more environmentally conscious and discerning than consumers before. Rental thus becomes a viable framework, as it not only encourages a shared economy but reduces wastage in the long run,” she said. Understandably, the idea of taking apart a sentimental piece of jewellery a family member has passed down can be difficult for some. There definitely are those who prefer to keep such heirlooms in their existing condition until they’re to be passed on to the next generation, but there are also others who see nothing wrong in resetting these pieces, so that they can be frequently worn and equally loved as they were by their former owners. Koo agreed that repurposing heirloom jewellery, a service that is available at eClarity, can be a good way to “upcycle"" jewellery that one already has on hand and create new ways to cherish meaningful pieces. This, to a certain extent, cuts down the need to buy new jewellery. How a piece is repurposed depends on her customer’s wishes. “There are mainly two types of mentalities – because it is sentimental to me, I want to be able to hold it close by wearing the jewellery every day, or because it is sentimental to me, I want to conserve the original look of the piece,” she shared. Repurposing can involve fixing, resetting, re-conditioning or re-colouring, which still retains the integrity of the original piece. “We may retain parts of the jewellery but reconstruct other parts that have experienced wear and tear. Often, customers are open to redesigning it, so that they get to wear the treasured piece every day or add a personal touch to it,” Koo said. Don’t forget that repurposing can be done on pieces other than heirlooms – like jewellery that you might have bought or been gifted previously and no longer fit your style. It also offers a way to creatively bring together gems from several jewellery pieces into a single new piece. Koo recalled a particularly sentimental project she had worked on. “A customer came to me with a collection of her late husband’s diamond gifts, which were originally mounted into rings, pendants, and earrings. Though in odd sizes with varied colours and shapes – some in a broken condition – all the pieces were still very precious to her,"" she said. “We decided to unmount the diamonds and use them to craft an eternity bracelet. The re-designed piece featured 11 gorgeously arranged diamonds, starting from the first small diamond he got for her when they were in school, to the heirloom piece from her mother-in-law, to the final piece, which was a memorial diamond made with her husband’s ashes. When she collected the eternity bracelet, she was in tears.” It’s no secret that lab-grown diamonds are currently a big business and steadily gaining popularity, especially with younger consumers who actively try to be more environmentally conscious with their purchase decisions. According to Koo, mining natural diamonds has adverse effects on the environment, such as deforestation, soil erosion and groundwater contamination, just to name a few.  “But besides becoming more sensitive to environmentalism and the origin of diamond sources, Singaporeans are also practical spenders. I think the cost savings that come from lab-grown diamonds is undeniably one of the push factors for its growing popularity,” commented Koo. At present, half of Koo’s business comes from lab-grown diamonds, a sign that there is a good level of interest and confidence on the part of consumers in them.  “In terms of quality, lab-grown diamonds definitely measure up against natural diamonds. They are optically and chemically the same as natural diamonds… in fact, every lab-grown diamond from us has a recognised certification from GIA and IGI, just like natural diamonds. That being said, you can be more adventurous with lab-grown diamonds as well, as they now come in various shapes and colours, so it's not just a matter of carat sizes,” she further explained. Add to that the fact that they can go for as low as half the price of natural mined diamonds, and there’s honestly not much else that needs to be said to convince customers to consider them as a more sustainable option – for both the environment and their wallets.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/advertorial/designed-cause-copenhagen-utopia-green-adventures-2881441,Designed for a cause: Copenhagen is a utopia of green adventures,"Frequently dubbed as one of the world’s most livable cities, Copenhagen has been carving out a quiet niche in experiential travel. The capital of Denmark has done what many others can only dream of, delivering urban projects that are as human-centric as they are sustainable. The innovative Danes approach these ambitions with trademark creativity, and from there, some of the best travel experiences are also born. Today, cyclists glide down elegant bike lanes that sidle up to the harbourfront and run across a bridge that resembles ripples on the water. Elsewhere, an ultra-modern community park dressed in vivid hues and adorned with striking lines makes for photogenic hotspots and invites interactions. And when restaurant Noma started foraging locally for choice ingredients, it became the world’s best. PEDAL YOUR WAY TO FORGOTTEN GIANTS As one of the leading green capitals of the world, Copenhagen’s vision is to be energy-independent by 2050. Many locals don’t see the need for cars, preferring instead the power of the pedal. In 2019, the number of commuters who chose to cycle to work or school (44 per cent) was double that of those driving (22 per cent). A big part of this has to do with the city’s dedication to designing bike lanes that make commuting not just safe, but enjoyable. There are over 400km worth of bike lanes in Copenhagen, taking one straight up to doorsteps of homes, cafes, grocers and attractions alike. Running along waterfronts, parks, railways and highways, the lanes are supported by conveniences such as bike lights and tilted bike lane trash bins. Is it any wonder then that the best way to explore the city is via two wheels? In fact, you may even encounter a mythical giant or two this way. Melding the city’s repute as a city of fairy tales with its environmental mission, artist Thomas Dambo has forged a number of gigantic sculptures from repurposed wood. These works are scattered along a scenic 31km route in Copenhagen’s suburbia – you can even find one hiding under a bridge. A meeting with these whimsical creatures is bound to be both enchanting and Insta-worthy. For more urban pursuits, Nordhavn and Norrebro are choice destinations that serve up inspiring contemporary architecture. Find a converted silo with a sky restaurant as well as a luxury hotel experience in a crane within the harbourfront area of Nordhavn, and discover where the world meets at Norrebro, with its melting pot of cuisine and community, along with the photogenic Superkilen Park. 2022 marks the year that Copenhagen played host to the Tour de France Grand Depart, and cycling enthusiasts can attempt the same – at their own pace, of course – by attempting the same route. Otherwise, for a more leisurely time out in nature, head out to the seaside with a ride to Amager. Unwind at Amager Beach or soak up ocean vibes at the legendary Kastrup Sea Bath. There’s also CopenHill – an architectural marvel unveiled in 2019. The energy plant is notable not only for converting 440,000 tons of waste into clean energy every year, but also being a destination for skiing, hiking and climbing. No snow is needed on the innovative green slope for skiers to enjoy their practice, while rock scalers can attempt the tallest man-made climbing wall in the world. Free for all, parts of the hiking routes here are connected to stairs and elevators, so both kids and the elderly alike can participate. A SPOT OF WATER THERAPY Copenhagen has one of the cleanest harbours in the world, and it shows. Not only is it safe to swim in, but it also sports harbour baths along the waterfront for all to enjoy – and for free, too. Other than having a good time by the waters at sites like the Islands Brygge Harbour Bath, you can also explore the waterways without getting wet. Captain your own solar-powered boat with GoBoat and explore the city from another perspective, or just cruise with a picnic on the boat – a table in the middle of the craft provides ample space. Otherwise, get your daily workout in with some tours from Kayak Republic. Swap paddle for pedal and explore the canals on the ground. The Harbour Circle route is a wonderful way to witness the harbours’ beauty as well as to explore many of the iconic bridges, such as The Circle Bridge and Kalvebod Bolge. MINTING SOME GREEN MICHELIN STARS Every foodie knows that Copenhagen’s Noma was dominating the epicurean world for a while, and today, its philosophy and techniques continue to highlight New Nordic cuisine on the culinary map. Its rich legacy has inspired a burgeoning food scene that is at once exciting and delicious. At Amass, one can really taste the country with a menu dedicated to locally-sourced ingredients showcasing different terroir and climate. An 800sqm garden sits alongside the dining room to remind guests of its farm-to-table approach. Urban farming also gets a shout-out at Gro Spiseri, a picturesque rooftop restaurant that boasts a lush garden right beside it. And for the complete experience, BaneGaarden is a green oasis hidden behind train tracks that offers farming workshops in addition to sumptuous meals. Dining in Copenhagen is also fully experiential with places like Alchemist. It’s a theatrical experience that leaves an indelible mark on its diners, with imagery and interactions that are thoroughly sensorial. Stretch out that checklist to include Geranium – the newly-minted world’s best restaurant – along with a visit to Reffen, which touts the best of Copenhagen’s delectable street food.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/electric-motorcycle-singaporean-rwanda-ev-2809251,"In Rwanda, a Singaporean company selling electric motorcycles woos bikers fed-up with high pump prices","KIGALI, Rwanda: In the late afternoon of Jun 27, Singaporean Simon Ting wound down his day in a nondescript warehouse at the foot of a dusty slope in Kigali, Rwanda, an east African nation more than 8,000km away. A big part of the warehouse was filled with neat rows of metal racks, lined with dozens of batteries being charged. A smaller and more haphazard section contained motorcycle spare parts. Mr Ting's desk, spartan with only a laptop, is tucked away in a corner. It sounds like modest surroundings, but Mr Ting, business development manager at Rwanda Electric Mobility (REM), is playing an important role in the uber-green country: Helping to electrify its more than 100,000 internal combustion engine (ICE) motorcycles. Almost half of these are used as motorcycle taxis, a cheap and mobile app-driven form of point-to-point transport that locals prefer. According to a December 2021 article by GreenTech Research, Rwanda has 46,000 of these ""moto taxis"", with 26,000 in Kigali alone. REM sells its own brand of electric motorcycles in Kigali, and for a cheaper rate, retrofits popular ICE models with batteries to convert them to electric. The target is to retrofit 25,000 motorcycles, most of them moto taxis. Roughly one in five trips in Kigali goes on these red-vest rider moto taxis, contributing to air pollution, high demand for imported fuel and rising greenhouse gas emissions, the GreenTech article said. While Rwanda has banned plastic bags, vowed to eliminate single-use plastics and designated a community cleaning day each month, it wants to do more to cut vehicular emissions. In 2019, President Paul Kagame unveiled a plan to make the country's motorcycles fully electric, in line with a 10-year climate action roadmap to reduce 4.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. ""The government could mandate electric bikes in the near future, in fact in a few years' time,"" Mr Ting, 63, told CNA. The idea for REM was conceived in Singapore in 2018, by Singaporeans Chia Lee Wee, Timothy Liew, Kelvin Tan and Paul Ho. Mr Chia, Mr Liew and Mr Tan, all aged 63, were schoolmates from primary school to junior college. Mr Ho, 57, is a mutual friend of the trio with a broad base of contacts in China, home to almost half of all electric cars in the world. ""They had this idea of coming to Kigali because Rwanda is very green and is trying to go completely green,"" Mr Ting said. ""They thought electric bikes would work here."" For their business venture to work, REM first looked into electric motorcycles, including their parts and design. The company wanted to ensure their bikes had a technological edge and could be marketed well. In 2019, the founders hired Mr Ting, who had also gone to the same primary and secondary schools, and by then had vast experience working abroad in industries like sand dredging and bulk procurement. The deal was that Mr Ting would set up the company's base in Rwanda and eventually oversee operations on the ground. He took up the offer, and was first sent to China to learn about electric motorcycle technology. REM decided that its motorcycle would have a dual battery swap system, meaning that its two depleted batteries could be swapped out for fully charged ones in minutes at battery swap stations around the city, instead of making riders wait three-and-a-half hours for them to be fully charged. Extended downtimes would turn away moto taxi riders, who earn more by transporting more passengers. REM would also pitch the electric motorcycles as a way to cut costs. Mr Ting said the company did its research and found that a rider could save up to US$900 a year by switching to electric bikes, given the lower maintenance fees and currently high fuel costs. The price of a full tank of petrol for motorcycles is now about US$8.50, compared to less than US$1 (900 Rwandan francs) for a single battery swap. Even swapping out a major faulty component takes less than half an hour, Mr Ting said, as opposed to three hours for the routine servicing of ICE motorcycles. ""We just diagnose the fault, replace the part and they’re off to make money,"" he added. ""Of course, the strongest point is the bikes are environmentally friendly."" If riders do not want to spend US$1,700 on a brand new REM electric bike, they can get their existing ICE bike - assuming it is an eligible model - retrofitted for a US$600 fee. Mr Ting pointed out that some moto taxi riders have worked hard to buy their own bikes, and that the company had always planned to offer retrofitting as a ""value-added service"". ""We help the moto riders make more money, but then again, what are they going to do with their old bikes?"" he said. ""If you build up the ability to retrofit petrol or diesel bikes to run on batteries, it’s a win-win for both parties."" Retrofitted bikes would have their engine, sprockets and chain removed, to be replaced with two batteries, a controller and a motor attached to the rear wheel. Before retrofitting, the motorcycle is safety inspected to ensure it can physically handle the modifications. With plans firmly in place, Mr Ting landed in Kigali in January 2020, just as the pandemic hit. But Mr Ting persisted through the lockdown and set up REM's first premises ""pretty much on my own"". ""We brought in with us the parts and technology and finetuned after our arrival. Some additional parts were then air freighted to Kigali,"" he said. The orders came in quickly. Mr Ting said a security company bought eight electric motorcycles, whose parts were shipped from China and assembled in Kigali. Mr Ting himself rode the bikes and did about 50 test runs to ensure they were fit for purpose. Swapping batteries on REM's bikes is easier as it has two relatively lighter batteries, Mr Ting said, pointing out that REM's competitor in Rwanda Ampersand uses a single battery system that made swapping more labour intensive. REM's swapping system only works because it has two electric trucks that ferry fully charged and depleted batteries between its centralised charging station - located in the warehouse - and three other battery swap stations. This is a 24-hour operation. Riders seem to have recognised the benefits and have been ""very happy"" with the cost savings, Mr Ting said. REM has so far sold 170 motorcycles and retrofitted 86 motorcycles. Mr Ting expects the take-up rate to ""keep skyrocketing"". Current demand for both brand new bikes and retrofits is outstripping supply, he said, adding that the company is awaiting the delivery of more batteries held up due to pandemic-induced supply bottlenecks in China. Even the microfinancing companies that work with REM to provide loans for buyers are urging the company to bring in more bikes, Mr Ting said. ""Especially now, who wants to be caught out by the petrol prices? We just have to tell them to hang on, we are waiting for the next batch of batteries,"" he said. ""When the batteries come, of course we will be happy to do business with you."" Mr Ting revealed that the company is also working to make their stocks available to moto taxi rider cooperatives, which sometimes rent out motorcycles to the riders. ""They also want to keep up with the times. They don't want to be stuck with petrol bikes and then the government says stop. So, they also want to be retrofitted as soon as possible,"" he said. In December 2021, Rwanda partnered the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to launch a sustainability project aimed at rolling out more electric motorcycles. The government worked with REM - with financial support from UNDP - to retrofit 80 moto taxis in a pilot. ""We are very lucky that they gave us that opportunity,"" Mr Ting said. As business expanded, REM that same month moved to its current warehouse, a larger space with four times the capacity to charge batteries and assemble motorcycles. The facility can handle up to 500 bikes and has a larger power supply, Mr Ting said, gesturing at an ""expensive"" transformer right next to the warehouse. ""We will continue to expand, either by moving to larger premises or setting up more centralised charging stations,"" he said, adding that the Singapore-based founders are in talks with Rwandan authorities on a more spacious base with an even larger power supply. These initiatives, coupled with high demand, meant REM has had to beef up manpower. The company has hired 31 locals, including mechanics, administrative staff and a chief executive officer. REM also runs student internships to attract future talent as it grows. In fact, Mr Ting said the company will hire another 10 local employees in the next two months. As dusk descended on the warehouse, REM's electric bikes continued to pull in beside a small container facility, swapping out batteries that had run out of juice. The moto taxi riders looked surprised by Mr Ting giving a tour to yet another foreigner. At the charging racks, Mr Ting demonstrated how REM's batteries were designed exclusively for its chargers, protecting intellectual property and deterring theft. Photos in this area were not permitted for security, he said. Mr Ting is also proud of how he has organised the warehouse to maximise operational efficiency, especially in terms of battery charging and the storage of spare parts. His job now, however, is focused on requisition. He reviews the daily service logs to ensure every maintenance detail, including faults and what parts have been used, is recorded properly. ""Because of the fact that it takes more than 35 days for goods to arrive, I’ve got to be very careful with stock balance,"" he said, noting that Rwanda as a country is landlocked. Rwanda might not have a beach, but Mr Ting described life there as ""pleasant"" with ""fine"" weather. The country, dubbed the ""land of a thousand hills"", is at a relatively high altitude. Kigali's average daily temperature is about 21 degrees Celsius. ""You don't need to be in air-conditioned place; you can actually sit down with a cup of coffee and chit-chat and it’s still very pleasant,"" he said, praising the lack of flies or mosquitoes unlike in other African countries. He also called Rwanda the cleanest country in the world and stressed that Kigali is ""very safe"". The policemen stationed at many road junctions were not just for show during the recently held Commonwealth summit, he said. ""It’s a daily thing ... it’s providing a sense of security which is important. It makes you feel as safe as in Singapore,"" he added. Nevertheless, Mr Ting said as a foreigner he has had to pay more for daily necessities. While a moto taxi ride to work cost him 2,000 Rwandan francs, a local paid 700 Rwandan francs for the same journey. When he bought a pair of jeans for 25,000 Rwandan francs at a market, he felt pleased with his bargaining skills. During another visit with a local colleague, the price for an identical pair dropped to 12,000 Rwandan francs. ""People here are very honest. They don't steal, they don't rob, but they try to get a better bargain from you,"" he said. ""Locals here will call you mzungu, which means white but also foreign. Anything not African is mzungu, which means everything is more expensive."" Mr Ting, a Muslim convert, has an Indonesian wife and a Singaporean daughter, both living in Jakarta. His daughter has just started university, and Mr Ting said she feels ""comfortable"" there. Furthermore, he prefers to focus on his work in Rwanda, noting that even family could be a ""distraction"" in a foreign land. ""The reason why I had my wife and daughter stay together is because I have postings all over, so let the daughter grow up with the mother,"" he said, adding that he visited them ""pretty often"" when he was based in Singapore. Mr Ting plans to use his 60 days of accumulated leave - COVID-19 prevented him from going home - to see his family sometime this year and take a ""well-deserved"" break, including a trip to Singapore to settle administrative issues. ""I won't be here forever,"" he said of his time in Rwanda. ""It's a pleasant challenge."" Singapore is also challenging itself to phase out ICE vehicles by 2040 in a push to cut emissions. While electric cars might be gaining popularity in the country, adoption of electric motorcycles severely lags behind. Land Transport Authority figures show that in 2021, only five of Singapore's 141,594 motorcycles were electric. According to a public transport analyst, challenges to adoption include a lack of charging infrastructure and the high cost of electric bikes compared to their ICE counterparts. “While key manufacturers have started producing electric motorbikes, the entire electric bike ecosystem still lags behind the electric car market,"" Mr Satya Ramamurthy, global co-head of public transport at KPMG, previously told CNA. Indeed, REM's chief technology officer Albert Tan, another schoolmate of the co-founders, told CNA that most electric vehicle initiatives in Singapore revolve around electric cars, including for charging points. ""I think ultimately for electric bikes the business case is harder, simply because each bike, even the bigger ones, you put in about a maximum of four or five kilowatt hours (of charging that costs) S$2 or S$3,"" the 63-year-old said. ""Car batteries are three to 15 times bigger, so immediately you have a big revenue differential."" Furthermore, Mr Tan said REM's business model targets moto taxi riders who can chalk up more than 100km a day and do not have time to wait for batteries to be charged. Many Singaporean riders, on the other hand, do not use their motorcycles so consistently and would thus have the time to charge their own batteries, he said. ""In Singapore, clearly there is a business of people riding the bike for the whole day, especially now the delivery riders, but it still forms a relatively small percentage of all bike riders,"" he added. ""In Rwanda, the motorcycle taxis form a fairly large percentage. So it's not a matter of whether we are interested. The Singapore environment is just different, circumstances and usage are different. It simply says this particular business model will not work.""  There are signs that things are changing. Following a review, the Government in March allowed swappable batteries for electric motorcycles, paving the way for wider adoption of smaller models that use this technology. Still, REM co-founder Timothy Liew said the business is focused on expanding in Africa, with countries like Kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania each having more than a million moto taxis. ""I mean, that's enough to keep us busy,"" he said. The company's pilot franchise has also launched in Kenya, and Mr Liew said ""quite a few"" African countries have reached out with interest. Mr Liew pointed out that REM has carved out a niche in Africa, something that would be harder to achieve in Singapore given the presence of many large automotive-related companies. ""Over there, we have the attention of the Rwandan government. Over in Singapore ... who are we?"" he added. ""Essentially, I'd rather be a big fish in a small pond than a small fish in a big pond."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/living/local-designer-conceptualised-sustainable-way-make-soap-home-2885341,This local designer conceptualised a sustainable way to make soap at home,"Twenty-nine-year-old Teo Ying Xuan, by her own admission, never really thought much about sustainability, at least, that was until she moved to the Netherlands to attend the Design Academy Eindhoven. There, through her classmates and new friends, she began to understand how important it is to be less wasteful and to appreciate how, as a designer and artist, she can add value to the push for a more sustainable world. The result was a project exhibit that first showed at the Dutch Design Week 2018 and then again here in Singapore in 2021. Called the Mass Production of Happiness, it is a highly notable work exploring industrial production and daily rituals. And while Teo is taking a break from her more artistic projects to focus on contributing – as a designer – to her family’s business, she is definitely one to watch. DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF A DESIGNER OR AN ARTIST OR BOTH? A little bit of both. I generally take on a light-hearted approach when I create. When embarking on a new project, one of my favourite things to do is to design playful research methods. Most of my design decisions are informed by the research behind each project. However, I also have an artist in me who believes that not every project has to end up with a functional product or outcome. It can also be a random and funny object. Humour is important too.  WERE YOU ALWAYS CREATIVE, EVEN AS A KID?       I wouldn’t say that I have always been creative but I did grow up in a pretty ‘hands-on’ environment; my father is a sofa craftsman and my mother is a seamstress. They are the creative ones! The factory and office have always been my playground since young and I guess that is how being in touch, and experimental, with materials became natural for me.  LAST YEAR, YOU PRESENTED A REALLY INTERESTING PROJECT, MASS PRODUCTION OF HAPPINESS. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE WORK?  Mass Production of Happiness envisions an alternative future with no more plastic soap bottles, but only little machines that add soap-making into our daily self-cleansing rituals. This is an apparatus for the home that harks back to the traditional craft of extracting natural saponins from soap nuts so that users can take comfort in knowing the provenance of their skincare products. Each apparatus is designed based on the natural ingredients which can be added to the soap nut solution, in this first edition, it is the aloe vera.  The project was inspired by manufacturing processes like what we see in ‘How it’s Made’ videos. The addictive and satisfying videos which show object or food going through different industrial machines is so fascinating! They help us understand processes, make sense of and appreciate objects and our environment. I wanted to create a mini-factory that reproduces a similar kind of satisfaction we get from watching these videos. COULD THIS BE A VIABLE COMMERCIAL PRODUCT?  Although looking more like an installation, the product itself is surely viable. Its only challenge will be the cost of production. Most of the components are currently made out of glass as the entire idea is to move away from plastics. WHAT SPARKED YOUR INTEREST IN WASTE AND SUSTAINABILITY?  It is extremely easy to buy bottled soap off the shelves and I never questioned anything about it in the past, neither the plastic nor the ingredients. I am even guilty of having my choice of soap influenced by attractive packaging designs.  The word ‘sustainability’ has never been approachable to me either. It is such a big topic and slightly overwhelming for me. Living in the Netherlands definitely made a difference in the way I look at it. I was curious about how my friends chose their soap and whether it is related to their nationalities. To my surprise, a handful of anti-soapers (showering with water only) and many went for soap bars as they preferred natural ingredients. Most importantly, they did not want to contribute to plastic waste. These conversations have helped me gain interest in the topic of sustainability which used to be daunting for me. YOU LIVED IN THE NETHERLANDS FOR SEVERAL YEARS. WHAT STRUCK YOU AS THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LIFE THERE AND IN SINGAPORE? I felt like a sponge in the Netherlands. Working alongside friends from all over the world, it is a space that is so rich in culture, ideas, and newness. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, the right place at the right time. After moving back to Singapore, it is not every day that I get to meet people from a different culture/nationality, but I have learned to embrace our own Asian culture much more than before.   GETTING BACK TO MASS PRODUCTION OF HAPPINESS, HOW LONG WAS THE PROCESS OF IDEATION, RESEARCH AND DESIGN IN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT THE FINAL WORK? AND CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH YOUR PROCESS? It took me about four months to arrive at my first working prototype, blown by a glass craftsman in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, where I used to study. Imagining it to be a domestic product instead of a ‘soap factory’ at home, it was important and also challenging to make the machine approachable in its size and relative to the form of soap and its recipe. Having decided to produce most of the components in glass, it was important to first understand more about the material, possibilities, and limitations of the glass-blowing lathe. Without any glass-blowing background, the wood lathe was a lifesaver. Technically, if it is achievable on the wood lathe, it will work on the glass-blowing lathe as well. A good amount of time was spent on it before arriving at its final form. It went through many rounds and months of refinement before it was finally ready to be exhibited.  YOU’RE A FULL-TIME DESIGNER. WHERE DO YOU WORK AND FOR WHOM?  After concluding Mass Production of Happiness, I have joined both my elder sisters in our family business which my parents started about 35 years ago – Benel. I am currently immersed in the learning journey of office furniture manufacturing, its craft, processes, and the industry as a whole. WHAT MARK WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE THROUGH YOUR WORK? Honestly, I struggled a lot trying to figure out my identity as a product designer until I finally realised that for me, the end goal of a project isn’t necessarily its function. It can also be the thoughts or emotions it stirs in the user. Take for example Mass Production of Happiness, the product isn’t the apparatus itself but the happiness it brings when the user completes the ritualistic process.  ARE YOU CURRENTLY WORKING ON ANY NEW ART-BASED PROJECTS? I have shelved some material experiments after deciding to focus on Benel, but I am sure I will revisit them at some point. It might make more sense to start one which is related to furniture, but I am still exploring! WHAT ARE THE THINGS, PEOPLE OR IDEAS THAT MOST INSPIRE YOU?  I once came across a piece of reading in Architect Ettore Sottsass' book which inspired and completely enlightened me as a designer. It said: “I started to think if there was a reason for designing objects, it was in one way or another to help people live… to achieve a sort of therapeutic action, to make objects that stimulate the perceptions that each of us has or can have from our own experience.” "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/food-diet-sustainability-agriculture-meat-plants-2881316,"Commentary: Which diet will help save our planet - climatarian, flexitarian, vegetarian or vegan?","LONDON: The food we consume has a massive impact on our planet. Agriculture takes up half the habitable land on Earth, destroys forests and other ecosystems and produces a quarter of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. Meat and dairy specifically accounts for around 14.5 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. So changing what we eat can help reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainable farming. But there are several “climate-friendly” diets to choose from. The best known are the completely plant-based vegan diet, the vegetarian diet, which also allows eggs and dairy, and the pescetarian diet, which also allows seafood. There are also “flexitarian” diets, where three-quarters of meat and dairy is replaced by plant-based food, or the Mediterranean diet which allows moderate amounts of poultry, pork, lamb and beef. Deciding which diet to choose is not as simple as you might expect. Let us start with a new fad: The climatarian diet. One version was created by the not-for-profit organisation Climates Network, which says this diet is healthy, climate friendly and nature friendly. According to the publicity, “with a simple diet shift you can save a tonne of CO2 equivalents per person per year” (“equivalents” just means methane and other greenhouse gases are factored in alongside carbon dioxide). Sounds great, but the diet still allows you to eat meat and other high emission foods such as pork, poultry, fish, dairy products and eggs. So this is just a newer version of the “climate carnivore” diet except followers are encouraged to switch as much red meat (beef, lamb, pork, veal and venison) as possible to other meats and fish. The diet does, however, encourage you to cut down on meat overall and to choose high-welfare and local meat where possible, while avoiding food waste and choosing seasonal, local foods. So saving a tonne of carbon dioxide is great but switching to vegetarianism or veganism can save even more. A western standard meat-based diet produces about 7.2kg of CO2 equivalents per day, while a vegetarian diet produces 3.8kg and a vegan diet 2.9kg. If the whole world went vegan, it would save nearly 8 billion tonnes CO2 equivalents while even a switch to the Mediterranean diet would still save 3 billion tonnes. That is a saving of between 60 per cent and 20 per cent of all food emissions which are currently at 13.7 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalents a year. To save our planet, we must also consider both water and land usage. Beef, for instance, needs about 15,000 litres of water per kilo. Some vegetarian or vegan foods like avocados and almonds also have a huge water footprint, but overall a plant-based diet has about half the water consumption of a standard meat-based diet. A global move away from meat would also free up a huge amount of land, since billions of animals would no longer have to be fed. Soya, for instance, is one of the world’s most common crops yet almost 80 per cent of the world’s soybeans are fed to livestock. The reduced need for agricultural land would help stop deforestation and help protect biodiversity. The land could also be used to reforest and rewild large areas which would become a natural store of carbon dioxide. A plant-based diet is also generally healthier. Meat, especially highly processed meat, has been linked to a string of major health issues including high blood pressure, heart disease and cancer. However, meat, dairy and fish are the main sources of some essential vitamins and minerals such as calcium, zinc, iodine and vitamin B12. A strict vegan diet can put people at risk of deficiencies unless they can have access to particular foods or take supplements. Yet both specialist food and supplements are too expensive for many people around the world and it would be hard to scale up supplements production to provide for billions of extra people. So a climatarian or flexitarian approach means there are fewer health risks and also allows people to still exercise choice. One study suggests a move to a global plant-based diet could reduce global mortality by up to 10 per cent by 2050. One of the issues that seems to be lacking in many food discussions is the ethical dimension. Every year we slaughter 69 billion chickens, 1.5 billion pigs, 650 million turkeys, 570 million sheep, 450 million goats, and 300 million cattle. That is more than nine animals killed for every person on the planet per year – all for nutrition and protein which we know can come from a plant-based diet. So what is the ideal global diet to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce habitat destruction and help you live longer? I suggest being an “ultra-flexitarian” – a diet of mostly plant-based foods but one that allows meat and dairy products in extreme moderation, but red and processed meat are completely banned. This would save at least 5.5 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalents per year (40 per cent of all food emissions), decrease global mortality by 10 per cent and prevent the slaughter of billions of innocent animals.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/travel-flight-sustainable-offset-train-car-carbon-emissions-2861376,Commentary: Revenge travel wreaks havoc on more than just airports,"SINGAPORE: Air travel is making a comeback. Singapore’s Changi Airport is seeing passenger traffic at 50 per cent of pre-pandemic levels, while airports in Europe have crossed the 80 per cent threshold. But the aviation sector is struggling to meet surging demand as major airports worldwide are plagued by endless queues at counters and pandemonium at baggage carousels. Some like London’s Heathrow had to impose caps on departing passengers to manage the chaos. This revenge travel can be attributed to pent-up demand as holidaymakers try to make up for lost time. It has strained resources not only in aviation, but hospitality and related service industries. Besides causing headaches for customers and companies, revenge travel is bad news for our warming planet. COVID-19 grounded planes to an unprecedented extent in 2020, resulting in huge drops in flight-related carbon emissions. The International Energy Agency said emissions from international aviation fell almost 45 per cent from 2019 to 2020 – a decline comparable to taking 100 million cars off the road. History suggests the rebound in travel we’re seeing now will be accompanied by an increase in carbon emissions. During the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, air travel emissions declined by up to 7 per cent. But as the economy recovered in 2010, emissions rose 6 per cent, wiping out any gains made for the climate. But even as the travel-starved among us take to the skies, people in Southeast Asia are becoming more eco-conscious. Google searches related to sustainability have increased this year by 45 per cent since 2019, while searches related to greenhouse gas emissions jumped 163 per cent in Singapore and 156 per cent in the Philippines. Studies show tourists are willing to fork out more to travel sustainably too. A survey published in 2021 found that more than half of visitors to a small Indonesian island were willing to pay up to US$7.50 extra per night for hotels certified as green. So how can we minimise the environmental impact of our post-pandemic adventures abroad? An easy way to minimise the carbon footprint of your holiday is to minimise travel time. That would mean choosing nearby destinations when planning a trip. According to the International Civil Aviation Organization’s carbon emissions calculator, a round trip from Singapore to London generates 933kg of CO2 (carbon dioxide) – which is roughly an eighth of an average Singaporean’s annual carbon footprint. In contrast, a round trip to Bangkok produces 183kg of CO2. While emissions per kilometre travelled in short-haul flights typically exceed that of long-haul flights, less time spent in the air equates less carbon pollution overall. How you fly also determines how much you emit. According to UK government data, in comparison to an economy-class passenger, a business-class passenger emits three times more CO2 per kilometre travelled, while a first-class passenger emits four times more. Upgraded seats take up more space, so account for a larger portion of the plane’s pollution.  Other perks of regional getaways include saving money, travel time and jetlag. If you are keen to visit a faraway place, consider an extended holiday and commute to other cities by public transport during your stay. Besides where you travel, how you choose to travel also matters. While comparing emissions of different transportation modes is not straightforward due to variants like vehicular efficiency, passenger load and fuel types, generally planes are the heaviest emitters and trains the lightest. As reported by The Sunday Times in 2019, a flight from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur produces 62kg of CO2 per passenger. A Toyota Prius generates 10kg of CO2 per person, assuming there are four passengers in the car, and the same figure applies for a bus of 30 passengers. At the leanest end of the spectrum, a passenger who travels to KL by train only emits 0.8kg of CO2. But they would have to hop on three different trains to get from Woodlands to KL Sentral, which could take up to eight hours in total. The carbon savings from commuting to Malaysia by train could therefore be substantial. That Malaysia and Singapore are now discussing the possibility of reviving the terminated KL-Singapore High Speed Rail project is cause for hope. Meanwhile, other travel options beyond road and rail are opening up in the region, such as the ferry service between Singapore and Desaru launched on Jul 7. While the maritime industry is also identified as a heavy polluter, these transport alternatives present their own opportunities for decarbonisation, which could be realised sooner rather than later as more travellers grow aware of their carbon footprint. Because we’ve been deprived of travel the past two years, it seems onerous to limit or inconvenience ourselves for the sake of sustainability. We might even wonder what’s the point, when a recent study reveals how much more celebrities contribute to global warming by flying on private jets – with Taylor Swift identified as the worst offender. Indeed, private jets emit more greenhouse gases than the whole of Denmark each year – so what difference can regular people like us really make? This is why travel’s decarbonisation must be industry-led too. Several airlines now inform passengers of their flight emissions and nudge them to buy offsets, sometimes bearing part of the cost. But critics say carbon offsets are a form of greenwashing, since they allow airlines to continue polluting without meaningfully decarbonising their operations. One of the most viable ways to slash planes’ emissions is through sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a biofuel cleaner than conventional jet fuel. Airlines like ANA and Cathay Pacific have adopted 10 per cent SAF targets by 2030, while Singapore Airlines and Scoot will offer customers the option to purchase SAF credits, which go towards supporting the fuel’s adoption and development.  More can certainly be done. Observers had once suggested that the pandemic would prompt the retiring of fuel-inefficient aircrafts – but cash-stripped airlines may defer the decision today when demand for travel is still peaking.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/us-china-climate-change-talks-diplomatic-breakdown-2863121,US-China diplomatic breakdown clouds outlook for global climate progress,"WASHINGTON: China's decision to halt bilateral talks on climate change with the United States has cast a cloud of doubt over whether the world can rally enough ambition to address global warming in time to avert its worst impacts. Tackling climate change has been a key area of cooperation between the two superpowers and two biggest emitters of greenhouse gas emissions. But China has suspended talks on the issue less than 100 days before the next landmark international climate summit, COP27, as part of its escalating retaliation over US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. ""No country should withhold progress on existential transnational issues because of bilateral differences,"" said John Kerry, the former US Secretary of State, who is currently the Biden administration's top climate diplomat.  ""Suspending cooperation doesn’t punish the United States – it punishes the world, particularly the developing world,"" he said. Over the last few years, climate change has remained an open avenue for cooperation between the United States and China even as tensions have escalated on other issues like human rights, forced labor, Hong Kong and Taiwan sovereignty, and trade. U.S. and Chinese officials had started to ramp up engagement on climate issues in the lead-up to the COP27 United Nations climate summit, which takes place in Egypt in November. Pelosi's brief visit this week to self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as its own, infuriated Beijing and triggered Chinese military drills on an unprecedented scale in the seas and air around the island. Previous bilateral engagement on climate change between the two countries helped pave the way for the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015, and reignited flailing international climate negotiation in Glasgow in 2021. With the pivotal climate summit on the horizon and countries backsliding on the emission reduction pledges they made in Glasgow, a lack of engagement between the superpowers could upend negotiations and sap ambition among other countries, analysts said. ""The fear is that the US-China tension can become an excuse for those countries that are unwilling to step up,"" said Bernice Lee, executive director of the Centre for Sustainable Resource Economy at Chatham House. ""It is definitely important that the international community - especially vulnerable developing countries - continue making sure that large emitters continue to deliver what they promised,"" she said. John Kerry, the US Special Envoy on Climate Change, often repeated that the US and China could isolate climate change as an area for joint discussion given its global importance without getting entangled in other complex issues. “By letting geopolitics now be the tail that wags the climate dog, it represents a shift in Beijing’s approach — from seeing the merits of allowing climate to be a standalone 'oasis' in the relationship to instead succumbing to those thinking purely through a geopolitical prism,” said Thom Woodroofe, a fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute. Domestic pressure may force China to continue to address some of its emissions despite the diplomatic chill. China may forge ahead, for example, with a plan to slash its methane, analysts said. Much of its methane emissions derive from coal mines in the huge producer nation. ""There's a huge effort right now by policymakers in China to come up with a domestic plan to curb methane emissions,"" said Joanna Lewis, professor of energy and environment at Georgetown University. ""Even if international engagement on this topic comes to a pause, this domestic war on methane is not going to come to a halt because it is very much part of China's strategic plan to control emissions."" Other observers say the pause in negotiations may only be temporary and that the US and China have still joined forces even amid years of changing relations. ""This has always been an up-and-down relationship,"" said Alden Meyer, a senior associate of consultancy E3G. ""I think the question here is this a short-term tactical move by Beijing to try to get Washington's attention or is this part of bigger, longer-term strategic adjustment by China?"""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/taylor-swift-worst-celebrity-private-jet-jay-z-kylie-jenner-carbon-emissions-2847851,Study: Taylor Swift is worst celebrity polluter when it comes to private jet CO2 emissions,"It all started when reality star Kylie Jenner recently drew a torrent of criticism after her tone deaf post on social media boasting about her and partner Travis Scott’s private jets. Amid the backlash, many delved deeper into Jenner’s private jet flight history and were horrified to discover that it regularly took flights as short as 12 minutes.   According to research data from UK-based sustainability-driven marketing agency Yard, it turns out it’s Taylor Swift’s private jet which has emitted the most carbon this year of any celebrity’s plane. The findings showed that Swift’s private jet rides have emitted 8,293.54 metric tons of carbon in 2022 (approximately “1,184.8 times more than the average person’s total annual emissions”), putting her at No 1 on the list.   Yard also concluded Swift’s aircraft travelled about 139.36 miles with an average flight time of 80 minutes.  To come up with these figures, Yard scrapped data Celebrity Jets, which tracks the use of private jets across the globes. It then measured the top celebrity private jet offenders by cross-comparing the data with the general population's CO2 emissions (CO2e) and each celebrity's CO2e. The data looks at the number of flights each star has taken so far, the average time of their flights, miles, and total CO2e just since the beginning of the year. Second on the worst offenders list was boxer Floyd Mayweather, whose jet has a total flight time so far this year of 326 hours with 7,076.8 metric tons of carbon emitted.   In third place was music mogul Jay-Z, at 321 hours and 6,900 tons, and retired baseball player A-Rod (Alexander Rodriguez), at 246 hours and 5,300 tons. Jenner’s half-sister Kim Kardashian was ranked No 7 while her boyfriend Scott was placed No 10 on the list. Rounding out Yard's top 10 were Blake Shelton, Steven Spielberg, Mark Wahlberg and Oprah Winfrey. Among the top 20 were Kylie Jenner, Drake, Tiger Woods, Magic Johnson, Harrison Ford, Jim Carrey and Tom Cruise. According to the Yard, Rolling Stone magazine contacted each of the celebrities for comments, following the release of their data. While the other celebrities have not yet commented, Taylor Swift’s representative has responded, insisting that the report is misleading.  “Taylor’s jet is loaned out regularly to other individuals,” her representative reportedly told Rolling Stone. “To attribute most or all of these trips to her is blatantly incorrect.” As a disclaimer, the Yard also posted a statement on the report. “Yard is aware that this list is not conclusive to the biggest offenders, but the biggest offenders according to the data as presented on the CelebrityJets Twitter page. Yard is also aware this data is based on these celebrities’ planes and whilst there is no way to determine if these celebrities were on all the recorded flights the purpose of this study is to highlight the damaging impact of private jet usage."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/indonesia-south-kalimantan-floating-toilet-waste-pollution-environment-2841991,‘Wait until surrounding is quiet’: Villagers in Indonesia’s Kalimantan make do with primitive floating toilets,"BANJAR, South Kalimantan: Every time Ramjaena wants to use the toilet, she first checks if there is anyone in the vicinity of her home. Like most residents of Paku Alam village which lies on the tributary of Martapura river, her house is built on stilts and situated along the waterway. In front of her house is a small, wooden walkway which leads to a 1.5 sq m latrine made of hardwood, also built on stilts. A piece of cloth is used as a substitute for a built-in door to allow for privacy when she or her family members have to use the latrine. Their waste is deposited directly into the river. But there is no total privacy. “What falls (into the river) … It’s embarrassing,” said Ramjaena, 35, who goes by one name. In Indonesia's South Kalimantan province, there are about 150 rivers and thousands of such latrines. Locals typically refer to them as “floating toilets”. This is a problem in the region of over 4 million people as they end up polluting the water, which is the lifeblood of the residents.  Ramjaena and other villagers also told CNA that they are uncomfortable when they need to answer the call of nature in such a way. Their preference is to have proper toilets.  Environmentalists have urged the government to look into the problem. However, it is easier said than done and despite several programmes to eliminate these floating latrines, many are still in use. Kisworo Dwi Cahyono, executive director of non-governmental organisation (NGO) Walhi South Kalimantan said that historically, South Kalimantan and its former capital of Banjarmasin have always been known for their numerous rivers and tributaries. “This means that culturally and traditionally, people have not been far from the rivers … It is a habit of the communities to conduct their activities in the river such as bathing, urinating and defecating, and even commuting (by boat),” said Cahyono. Hanifah Dwi Nirwana, head of the provincial environment agency noted that most people along the rivers of South Kalimantan have come to rely on floating toilets over the years.  She said that the local government does not know the exact number of such households. “It is an old habit for people to live near the river ... They have limited access to clean water if they live on land,” said Nirwana. She added that it is part of South Kalimantan’s traditional way of life, as people have a habit of washing their clothes in the rivers and mingling with neighbours. This way of life is especially visible in the early morning in Banjarmasin when villagers bathe along the Martapura river or row to the famous floating market Lok Baintan, which is a popular tourist attraction. However, locals interviewed by CNA said that the phenomenon is not just due to their traditional way of life. Ramjaena of Paku Alam said the main reason why she has been using a floating toilet is due to financial difficulties. “My toilet is like that because I don’t have money (to build a proper toilet inside the house),” she said.  One needs to fork out about 5 million rupiah (US$ 333) to build a proper toilet, which is above the provincial minimum monthly wage of about 3 million rupiah. It is out of reach for her and her husband who are farmers with four children. Idup, who also lives in Paku Alam told CNA that he can only afford to have a floating toilet. “I wait until the surrounding is quiet when I want to use it,” said the farmer who is in his 70s. Like many other Indonesians, he goes with one name. Some families even have to share a floating toilet.  Community head Abdus Samad is among those who are in this group. “We share the toilet because we don’t have money. So we collected money together (to build a shared toilet).”  In the past, floating toilets may not have been considered a problem as there were fewer of them, said Cahyono the environmentalist. But as the population in South Kalimantan grew, so did the number of floating latrines. Based on the provincial government’s research, the river water contains high levels of bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), a type of faecal coliform often found in the intestines of animals and humans which can cause illness.  “Not only in the Martapura river but also upstream, the water is below the standard quality,” Nirwana of the South Kalimantan environmental agency told CNA.  There are many parameters to assess water cleanliness, she said, such as the amount of dissolved oxygen. “If the dissolved oxygen amount is low, the fishes cannot live well. In the past, when we went fishing in the river, it was easy to catch a big fish or big prawns. But now it has become harder.  “So the ecosystem is disturbed,” said Nirwana. She added the agency aims to achieve the United Nations 2030 sustainable development goals targets, one of which is clean water and sanitation. “Our water quality is still not good. It is about 54.25 (on the water quality index), so it is average.” In Indonesia, water quality is assessed based on certain criteria such as the amount of dissolved oxygen and faecal coliform in water as directed by a ministerial regulation. A score of between 0 to 50 means that the water quality ranges from very deficient to deficient. If the score is between 51 to 100, it means that the water quality is moderate to very good. Nirwana noted that this also affects the province’s score on the overall environmental index, which currently is around 71, out of a maximum score of 100.  The overall environmental index comprises the water quality index, seawater quality index, peat ecosystem quality index, air quality index, and land quality index.  Banjarmasin-based urban design expert Akbar Rahman called for all floating toilets to be torn down. “The floating latrines cause the river to become a place for faeces which can increase water pollution. “Especially because the residents who live on the river banks also use the river water for bathing, washing, urinating and defecating. So the water used by people is unhealthy,” said Rahman.  However, Cahyono the environmentalist noted that floating toilets are not the only source of water pollution in the province. “We shouldn’t just blame the latrines because there are also industries and mining here,” he said. The local authorities have rolled out various programmes to eliminate floating toilets.  For instance, the Banjar regency government introduced a programme in 2016, with the aim of removing 1,000 floating latrines. It removed 1,019 floating latrines by 2020 but there are still around 2,400 remaining in the regency. Samad, the community head in Paku Alam village, Banjar regency, recounted that he was approached by officials sometime ago. The latter wanted to know how many villagers were using floating toilets and needed new toilets to be constructed.  But the regency-level initiative has not been a game changer, he said. The government did build a proper public toilet in the neighbourhood. But as it is a 30-minute walk from his home, he rarely uses it. Thus, he continues to use the shared floating latrine near his home.   “We really need a toilet so my family feels comfortable and if I have guests, they also feel comfortable,” said Samad. The main problem is limited budget, said Nirwana of the provincial environmental agency.  “The challenge is in order to eliminate the floating toilets, we of course have to replace them with new ones which fulfil the technical requirements for waste management so the waste can be discharged into the river. “Therefore, one of the most important things is the funding,” she said. She also said there is a need to continuously educate people on the importance of keeping the rivers clean so that when they are given new toilets, they will actually use them. Nirwana revealed that some villagers decided to rebuild their floating toilets, even though the government has constructed proper ones. “We still have to approach the community and educate the community. The problem isn’t automatically solved when the floating latrines are removed.”  Currently, the provincial government is running a programme called ‘Beautiful Martapura’. It aims to clean up the Martapura river which flows into five different regencies and is considered to be the backbone of many tributaries.  The programme comprises cleanup activities, public education, providing trash bins and eliminating floating toilets.  Rahman, the urban design expert, said if financial constraints are the problem, the government could build more shared toilets.  “The point is, the latrines shouldn’t be on the river anymore, they should be built on land. “In the initial stage, they can build shared toilets for several families,” said Rahman who is also a lecturer at Lambung Mangkurat University in Banjarbaru, the capital of South Kalimantan.  Over in Paku Alam village, Ramjaena just hopes that the government would act quicker. “I want a real toilet because it will be comfortable to have one inside (the house), so nobody can see (when I use it),” she said. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/gic-sets-new-sustainability-office-2836311,GIC sets up new sustainability office to deepen green research and integration efforts,"SINGAPORE: Singapore’s GIC has established a dedicated office focusing on sustainability, as the sovereign wealth fund ramps up its focus on this front amid a global shift towards a low-carbon economy. Set up last month, the new office will deepen GIC’s research into key sustainability issues and integrate sustainability further into all its investment and corporate processes, it announced on Wednesday (Jul 27) as part of the release of its annual report. It will be headed by Ms Rachel Teo, who is GIC’s head of sustainability and a member of the firm's sustainability committee. Speaking at a media briefing, chief executive officer Lim Chow Kiat said GIC has been rolling out sustainability initiatives and building up related capabilities over the years. But it saw the need for a dedicated team to focus on specific issues. “For example, reporting standards have become a very complicated area because there are so many reporting standards, so how does GIC gain capability to determine what is a good set of standards?  “How can we contribute to the industry (through) consultation? How do we do our own implementation internally? All these things (will) need a dedicated team of sustainability experts,” he told reporters. GIC, which has more than 1,900 employees globally, declined to comment on the headcount for the new office. It told CNA, however, that it “will be bringing together existing resources who are working on sustainability and also recruit more dedicated sustainability professionals”. “This unit will work with other sustainability capabilities across our investment and corporate teams to deepen and accelerate GIC’s overall sustainability efforts,” the spokesperson said. GIC said in its annual report that time is running out to take decisive action on climate change. To drive the low-carbon transition, it actively invests in new technologies, such as green hydrogen, carbon removal, and nuclear fusion. It had in July 2020 launched an internal investment fund to invest in sustainability-related opportunities that would generate good returns over time. Beyond the fund, GIC views “sustainability as a part of the regular investment process” across all of its teams. Said Mr Lim: “Every deal that we do, we ask the question – ‘What is the sustainability angle for this deal?’”  Some of its recent investments include China-focused sustainability data and analytics platform Miotech and Swiss start-up Climeworks whose green technology removes carbon dioxide from the air. More crucially as part of “making a positive impact in the real economy”, GIC engages its portfolio companies to nudge them along on their transition efforts, with divestment as a “last resort”. On whether GIC gives its investees specific transition timelines, Mr Lim said it depends as businesses in different jurisdictions face varying challenges. “The good news is that, especially in recent years, most companies understand the importance of this because it’s not just a shareholder telling them. Their customers are telling them as well, and regulators.”  As to why divestment is a last resort, Mr Lim, who took on the top job at GIC in 2017, said: “As an investor, you could, as some people advocate, change the composition of your portfolio to reduce the carbon intensity. We don’t find that particularly helpful.  “Because you’re just passing the high carbon intensive assets to other investors. Maybe over time, at the margin that will help but that’s not really the best solution.”"

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/plastic-bag-ban-charge-waste-rwanda-2767096,"IN FOCUS: Experiencing Rwanda's plastic bag ban, and whether Singapore could adopt a similar approach","KIGALI, Rwanda: The signs in airport arrival areas around the world commonly warn passengers against smuggling drugs, weapons or large amounts of currency. But the white sign that confronted me as I cleared customs in Rwanda’s Kigali airport last month presented a rather unusual message: ""Use of non-biodegradable polythene bags is prohibited."" In 2008, Rwanda banned plastic bags in a push to protect the environment, part of a plan to help revive the country after it was devastated by a civil war in the mid-1990s. The small east African nation is one of at least 40 countries that have restricted, banned or taxed the use of plastic bags, but its approach is one of the most extreme. Owners of factories caught producing non-authorised plastic bags face up to a year in prison, while those who sell them could be fined a maximum of 300,000 Rwandan francs (S$408). Exceptions include plastic bags used in the packaging of meat, chicken, fish and milled cassava leaves, so they can easily be refrigerated. In Singapore, large supermarkets will have to charge at least 5 cents for each disposable carrier bag from mid-2023. The Government has stopped short of a full ban, citing how bags are used to dispose of trash and then incinerated, instead of taking years to degrade in a landfill. Back at Kigali airport, I had two plastic bags in my suitcase: One for my slippers and another for laundry. Rwanda's plastic bag ban did not cross my mind as I was packing, and now I was at the mercy of customs officers. ""Any plastic bags in your luggage will be confiscated at the airport or other point of entry,"" Rwanda's official tourism site cautioned.  Officers did not check my bags, so off I went with my polythene contraband into the country (I made sure to take them back home with me). I was in Kigali to cover the Jun 20 to Jun 25 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, which involved both the leaders of Rwanda and Singapore. Rwanda has been dubbed the Singapore of Africa, and if first impressions were anything to go by, the African nation more than 8,000km away has taken this comparison seriously. The hilly and pleasant streets of Kigali were lined with grassy verges, trees and traffic cameras that strictly enforced a 60kmh speed limit. Locals I spoke to painted the image of a law-abiding population, and after asking where I was from, lavished praise on Singapore. ""Singapore became a first-world country in a short amount of time,"" a bespectacled man cooed behind a counter as my colleague waited to buy a SIM card. But the biggest similarity for me was how clean the streets were. I noticed hardly any litter in Kigali. What I saw every 100m or so was a sanitation worker in a high-vis vest sweeping the pavements. This was not an act put on specifically for the Commonwealth meeting. Articles about Rwanda over the years have called it one of the cleanest nations in the world. The country even sets aside every last Saturday of the month for a community work day called Umuganda. Citizens work together to clean the streets, cut the grass or trim the bushes. While Umuganda helps keep up the high level of cleanliness, part of it is also thanks to the plastic bag ban, said my driver and Kigali resident Igor Kayiranga, 33. ""People threw a lot of them on the roads,"" he said of the pre-ban era. ""It was something that was not good."" In Rwanda, improperly discarded single-use plastic can prevent rainwater from penetrating the soil and cause flooding as well as low agricultural productivity, or clog drains and produce breeding grounds for bugs that transmit diseases like malaria. Rwandan authorities were also concerned about how some plastics were being disposed of. When burned, they released harmful and toxic pollutants into the air. ""Moreover, toxic chemicals used for manufacturing plastic often enter the food chain when animals consume them. This is a concern since a big proportion of the population’s diet is meat,"" a spokesperson for the Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA) said in emailed responses. The spokesperson said the plastic bag ban was implemented to protect the environment, economy and public health through the reduction of trash and litter. ""Plastic bag bans save municipalities money by way of less trash to pick up. Bans can also save retailers time and money since they no longer need to provide plastic bags,"" the spokesperson said. The early days of the ban were not without challenges. A ""large black market"" for plastic bags emerged, REMA said, attributing this to a lack of alternatives and an unwillingness to change habits. ""Rwanda had at that time no industries that produced environmentally friendly, reusable bags. Huge investments were also required to expand nascent recycling capacities,"" the spokesperson said. To tackle this, companies that used to make plastic bags were given tax incentives to buy equipment to recycle plastic or manufacture environmentally friendly bags, REMA said. Authorities also conducted routine inspections and acted on tip-offs to ensure compliance from business owners. More than a decade since the ban kicked in, I observed how it has become the status quo. Supermarket cashiers packed groceries in small paper bags, the kind used to take out a fast-food meal in Singapore. Public bins and those in hotels were not lined with plastic or anything at all. I did not spot a single plastic bag lying on the streets or being freely handed out. At home, people combined their rubbish in burlap or polypropylene sacks that were used as packaging for food like potatoes or flour, before leaving them outside for collection, Mr Kayiranga said. Sometimes, refuse workers would only take the trash so the sacks could be reused. These sacks could also be bought at the market. If they were not available at home, people used any sort of packaging – even gardening gloves – to consolidate their rubbish. When asked if bins at home got dirty because they were not lined, Mr Kayiranga said people usually put food waste in empty cartons first. ""Of course, at the start of a new policy you will have difficulty, but progressively now we're good with this. And it's also nice to see the roads clean,"" he added. In fact, the Rwandan government has gone a step further. In 2019, it passed a new law banning single-use plastic like bottles, straws, plates and forks. Businesses that sold single-use plastic materials had three months to clear their stock, while manufacturers had two years to start shifting to producing greener alternatives. Once this grace period ended, errant manufacturers could face heavy fines, lose their trading licence or even face closure. Despite that deadline, my experiences showed there was still some way to go. One restaurant I visited still gave out plastic straws with beverages. When asked why, the waiter said the establishment had not finished its stock of plastic straws, and would switch to alternatives once they ran out. At one cafe, my four cups of takeaway iced coffee came in plastic cups. When I wanted to find out more, the waiter thought my driver was from the government. He clammed up and said he could transfer the coffee to paper cups if we wanted to. While it was clear that there was not yet full compliance, REMA said ""good progress"" has been made, citing ""future plans"" to promote single-use plastic alternatives and reusable packaging materials. As I continued to go about Kigali, I encountered some practical difficulties with the plastic bag ban, like during a trip to the supermarket without my own reusable bag. I bought a carton of fruit juice, two blocks of chocolate and a 1.5L bottle of water, which the cashier put in a single paper bag. I had barely left the supermarket when the bag started to tear at the bottom. I ended up carrying the water bottle separately. At a fast food place, I requested to take out a side of poutine, or fries topped with cheese curds and gravy. The waitress packed it in an aluminium container and put it in a paper bag. During the car ride back to the hotel, the gravy seeped through the container's paper cover and inevitably the paper bag. I entered my room with my jeans slightly soiled and smelling of poutine. Separately, my colleague who stored a paper bag with banana cake in the fridge found that the bag tore easily after a few days kept in cooler temperatures. When asked about such concerns, REMA acknowledged that people had become dependent on plastic because it is cheap to produce, light and therefore easy and cheap to transport, and ""incredibly"" strong and durable. ""But it’s these advantages which also make it so harmful. The micro-plastics that result from these processes are harmful to the environment. It is also very difficult to recycle,"" the spokesperson said. ""Shoppers are encouraged to make more environmentally friendly choices in packing and transporting items."" Still, there continues to be some pushback. REMA said some people still smuggle plastic bags into Rwanda, something alluded to by local non-governmental organisation Rema Environment Awareness Organization. ""We are doing a lot, but when your neighbours don't have that policy, I think it will be difficult for us,"" said its project coordinator Johnson Kayitare, pointing out that people could buy plastic bags in countries like Congo, Burundi and Tanzania and bring them across the border. Mr Alan Gahamanyi, who runs a supermarket on a busy street in Kigali, told me that some customers have ""begged"" to be given a plastic bag so they could use it at home, for instance, to store vegetables. ""It's illegal,"" the 31-year-old said. ""Unless I pack meat in it, I cannot give you one."" With prior approval from authorities, supermarkets are permitted to hand out biodegradable plastic bags if customers buy fresh meat. Mr Gahamanyi then pulled out a plastic pack of nuts imported from a neighbouring country, saying that he thinks authorities are still working with food exporters to modify the packaging on Rwanda-bound products. The REMA spokesperson acknowledged that some neighbouring countries still use single-use plastic, which is why their products arrive that way. Mr Gahamanyi felt this discrepancy in packaging standards could hurt the local economy. For instance, he gestured at a similar pack of nuts that was produced locally but came in paper packaging. This cost more, yet the packaging was of lower quality, he said. ""Imported goods can be more competitive than local ones, and economically it's not very smart,"" he said, adding that his customers always choose imported products over local. ""Imported products come in plastic, then you tell the locals not to use it. This doesn't make sense."" On a more personal level, Mr Gahamanyi admitted that the plastic ban has led to some challenges. For example, he said the sacks used to pool rubbish were ""not user-friendly"" and difficult to tie up, while unlined bins get dirty and needed to be cleaned from time to time. ""You've got to change your lifestyle if you want to eradicate plastic,"" he said. ""It's challenging, but it's for the good of nature."" REMA said the plastic ban has helped cut emissions, reduce waste, increase agricultural productivity and fight climate change. The environmental benefits have also led to an increase in tourism, the spokesperson said, asserting that Rwanda is cleaner than neighbouring countries. ""Not only did eliminating plastic trash save lives, it also boosted economies,"" the spokesperson added. In 2021, Singapore generated 982,000 tonnes of plastic waste, of which only 6 per cent was recycled. According to Singapore's National Environment Agency (NEA), households and trade premises threw away about 200,000 tonnes of disposables each year in 2019 and 2020, with disposable bags making up about two-thirds of this. This amount of disposable bags can fill up about 400 Olympic-sized swimming pools. ""Such excessive consumption is unsustainable. It not only uses up resources, but also adds to Singapore’s carbon emissions when they are incinerated in our waste-to-energy plants,"" NEA said in January when it invited public feedback on charging for plastic bags in supermarkets. Professor Seeram Ramakrishna, who chairs the Circular Economy Taskforce at the National University of Singapore, said scientific studies have shown that materials contribute to about 23 per cent of total emissions by human activities. ""In other words, a careful management of single-use plastics, and plastics commingled with solid waste in the society, will have impact and hence important in our fight against climate change and bringing back a healthy living environment,"" he told me. Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said in August 2020 that Singapore was not ""in a hurry"" to ban plastic bags, given that plastic waste is incinerated and in turn produces energy. Therefore, the value of such a ban is ""a little different"", she was quoted in media reports as saying during an online dialogue on sustainability and plastic recycling. Instead, the Government has decided to introduce a charge on plastic bags to discourage excessive use, stressing that the charge will not remove access to such bags used for bagging waste, one of the most common concerns raised. A 2018 study by the Singapore Environment Council found that shoppers take 820 million disposable carrier bags from supermarkets alone each year, an average of 146 bags per person. ""Households can consider repurposing packaging from the products they purchase for bagging their rubbish,"" NEA said in a summary of responses to the public consultation. Prof Ramakrishna said it should be noted that Singapore's per capita usage of plastics is ""far higher"" than Rwanda's. ""Plastics are entrenched in our society serving a range of purposes unique to Singapore,"" he said. ""However, for Singapore to be taken as a good role model in sustainable development by the world, Singapore needs to draw up an aggressive plan on plastics similar to the recent pledges on carbon tax and carbon neutrality by 2050."" Prof Ramakrishna called for ""bold efforts"" on several fronts, including developing a full-scale plastics recycling industry, mandating recycled content in products, and getting companies to report their measures and performance in the circular economy of materials. NEA said the bag charge will contribute towards the Singapore Green Plan 2030 objective of reducing the amount of waste to landfill per capita per day by 20 per cent by 2026, and 30 per cent by 2030. The Plastics Recycling Association of Singapore was also launched in August last year to improve Singapore's capability in plastics recycling, by bringing together stakeholders to exchange knowledge and best practices. Prof Ramakrishna said a plastic bag ban in Singapore could contribute to a ""desired change"" in consumer behaviour and promote new business models as well as innovations in products and services. ""Leveraging own experience, Singapore Inc can serve other markets and societies, thus creating new avenues of economic growth and competitive advantage,"" he added. ""Furthermore, such credible practices and pro-earth outcomes will touch, inspire and transform our young minds and hearts."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/money-cash-lottery-millionaire-charity-wealth-2823321,Commentary: How much money do people really want in an ideal life?,"BATH, England: Money can’t buy happiness. Many of us are told this at some point in our lives, but that doesn’t seem to stop many people from wanting more of it – even very rich people. The question is, how much money do we each need to satisfy our desires? Economists often treat people as having unlimited economic wants but limited resources to satisfy them – a foundational economic concept known as scarcity. This idea is often presented as a basic fact about human nature. Our recently published research found instead that only a minority of people actually have unlimited wants, and that most would be happy with a limited, if still significant, sum of money. We surveyed people about this issue in 33 countries spanning all inhabited continents, obtaining responses from about 8,000 people in total. We encouraged participants to focus on what it would mean to have all their wants fulfilled by asking them to imagine their “absolutely ideal life”, without worrying about whether it was realistically achievable. To assess economic wants, we asked people to consider how much money they wanted in this ideal life. But money rarely comes for free, and we thought their responses could be influenced by what they imagine it would take to obtain large amounts of money – working long hours, high-risk investments, or even criminality. So we made it about chance, by asking them to choose a prize in a hypothetical lottery. They were told the chances of winning each lottery were the same so their choice was about how much money they wanted in their ideal lives, not which lottery they were most likely to win. The lottery prizes started at US$10,000 (converted to local currencies, so £8,000 for UK participants) with options increasing by a multiple of 10. At the time we ran the study, the top prize of US$100 billion would have made them the richest person in the world. Our prediction was straightforward: If people truly have unlimited wants, they should always choose the maximum US$100 billion. But in all 33 countries, only a minority chose the top prize (8 per cent to 39 per cent in each country). In most countries, including the UK, the majority of people chose a lottery equivalent to US$10 million or less, and in some countries (India, Russia) the majority even chose US$1 million or less. We also wanted to understand differences between people with limited and unlimited wants. Our analyses ruled out many personal factors – responses didn’t vary meaningfully by gender, education or socioeconomic status. However, more younger people reported unlimited wants than older people, although this varied across countries. In less economically developed countries, the influence of age was weaker. We also examined cultural differences using a widely used model of major dimensions of cultural difference. We found that more people chose the US$100 billion lottery in countries where there was greater acceptance of inequality in society (called “power distance”) and where there was more focus on group life (called “collectivism”). For example, Indonesia is high in power distance and collectivism and almost 40 per cent of the Indonesian sample chose US$100 billion. The UK is relatively low on collectivism and power distance, and fewer than 20 per cent chose the maximum lottery prize. Finally, we asked people about the most important change they would make if they won the prize, as well as to rank different values that were important to them, such as having power or helping others. Here there was some inconsistency. People with unlimited wants were more likely to tell us they would use the money to help others, but in terms of values they were no more concerned with helping others than those with limited wants. Assuming people have unlimited economic wants provides a rationale for policies that prioritise economic growth, such as interest rate policies, to allow people to achieve as many wants as possible. But the never-ending pursuit of wealth and growth has increasingly damaging consequences for our world. Showing that unlimited wants is not a human universal, and that the level of people’s wants varies with values and culture, suggests they are open to social influence. Advertisers already know this, spending huge amounts to try to convince us to want things we previously neither knew nor cared about. Even some economists have questioned whether wants produced by marketing should really be called wants. The results of this research give us hope that human nature is not fundamentally at odds with sustainable living. Many are paying more attention to how to improve and even reorient society to live fulfilling lives without exhausting our planet’s resources. Understanding the lives and motivations of people with limited economic wants may teach us something about how to achieve this. Paul Bain is Reader in Psychology at University of Bath.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/climate-change-carbon-emissions-ipcc-green-transport-energy-meat-2799461,Commentary: Every action counts when it comes to net zero - here are the most effective,"BERLIN: Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels requires reaching net zero emissions by the middle of this century. This means that, in less than three decades, we need to reverse more than a century of rising emissions and bring annual emissions down to near zero, while balancing out all remaining unavoidable emissions by actively removing carbon from the atmosphere. To help speed this process as individuals, we’ve got to do everything we can to cut down our use of fossil fuels. But many people aren’t aware of the most effective ways to do this. Thankfully, the latest report by the UN climate change panel IPCC devotes a chapter to all the ways in which changes in people’s behaviour can accelerate the transition to net zero. The chapter includes an analysis of 60 individual actions which can help fight climate change, building on research led by Diana Ivanova at the University of Leeds – and to which I contributed. We grouped these actions into three areas: Avoiding consumption, shifting consumption and improving consumption (making it more efficient).  By far the most effective things to avoid involve transport. Living without a car reduces greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 2 tonnes of CO2 emissions per person per year, while avoiding a single long distance return flight cuts emissions by an average of 1.9 tonnes. That’s equivalent to driving a typical EU car more than 16,000km from Hamburg, Germany to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia and back. Since the vast majority of the world’s population do not fly at all – and of those who do, only a small percentage fly frequently – fliers can make very substantial reductions to their carbon footprints with each flight they avoid. But living sustainably is not just about giving things up. Large reductions in emissions can be achieved by shifting to a different way of doing things. Because driving is so polluting, for example, shifting to public transport, walking or cycling can make an enormous change, with added benefits for your personal health and local air pollution levels. Likewise, because of the high emissions associated with meat and dairy – particularly those produced by farming sheep and cows – shifting towards more sustainable diets can substantially reduce your carbon footprint. A totally vegan diet is the most effective way to do this, but sizeable savings can be made simply by switching from beef and lamb to pork and chicken. Finally, the things we do already could be made more efficient by improving carbon efficiency at home: For example by using insulation and heat pumps, or producing your own renewable energy by installing solar panels. Switching from a combustion car to an electric one – ideally a battery EV, which generates much larger reductions in emissions than hybrid or fuel cell EVs – will make your car journeys more efficient. Plus, its effect on emissions will increase as time goes by and the amount of electricity generated by renewables grows. In the race to net zero, every tonne of CO2 really does count. If more of us take even a few of these suggestions into account, we’re collectively more likely to be able to achieve the ambitious goals set out in the Paris climate agreement. Of course, these changes will need to be backed by major political action on sustainability at the same time. If we’re to use less fossil fuel energy, the use of fossil fuels needs to be either restricted or made more expensive. The social consequences of this need to be carefully managed so that carbon pricing schemes can benefit people on lower incomes, which can happen if revenues are redistributed to take the financial burden off poorer households. But there’s a whole lot more that governments could do to help people to live more sustainably, such as providing better, safer public transport and “active travel” infrastructure (such as bike lanes and pedestrian zones) so that people have alternatives to driving and flying. There’s no avoiding the fact that if political solutions are to address climate change with the urgency our global situation requires, these solutions will limit the extent to which we can indulge in carbon-intensive behaviours. More than anything, we must vote into power those prepared to make such tough decisions for the sake of our planet’s future. Max Callaghan is a PhD student at the University of Leeds.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/what-value-nature-countries-now-have-first-guidelines-2802136,What value on nature? Countries now have first guidelines,"BERLIN: Countries have approved the first comprehensive guidelines for judging the value of nature following four years of intense debate, officials said on Monday (Jul 11). The report was endorsed by 139 countries that are members of the United Nations-backed Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, or IPBES. Its authors hope the guide they have drawn up with the help of experts from a wide range of disciplines will make it easier for governments to consider more than just the economic benefits of a project when deciding whether and how to go ahead with it. This includes figuring out how local communities will gain or lose from a project such as a hydroelectric dam - a situation that has regularly led to friction between businesses, citizens and authorities in the past. Rather than prescribe a set way for governments to estimate these non-economic benefits, the report provides them with tools for working through the often complex assessment process, said its co-author Patricia Balvanera of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. “We provide a roadmap to decision-makers for how to deal with this very complex situation they face every single day,” she said. Fellow author Unai Pascual of the Basque Center for Climate Change in Bilbao, Spain, said the report's approval represents a “milestone” for the way governments view nature, by challenging some of the underlying assumptions that have contributed to environmental destruction. The report was drafted with the help of dozens of experts from both social and natural sciences in an attempt to bridge the often considerable differences between disciplines and find a common approach they could all support, he said. “We don’t know what will come next,” said Pascual, but suggested the guidelines are likely to be reflected in the negotiations at December's UN conference on biodiversity in Montreal. Representatives of Indigenous groups welcomed the new guidelines and an IPBES report published last week which highlighted the need for sustainable use of nature. “There is a growing body of evidence showing that when the rights of Indigenous peoples are guaranteed, we outperform all other forest managers in reducing deforestation and preventing wildfires,” said José Gregório Díaz MIrabal of COICA, a coordinating body for the indigenous organizations of the countries of the Amazon Basin. “If the goal is to succeed in saving the Amazon, any plan must be carried out in collaboration with Indigenous peoples,” he said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/women-sustainability-farizan-davezac-de-moran-greena-consultants-2789871,"From Singapore to Tanzania, she's future-proofing the world's cities one green building at a time","Many of us have seen climate change projections. With temperatures expected to rise between 1.1 and 5.4 degrees Celcius by 2100 according to some reports, melting glaciers, rising sea levels, coastal flooding, heatwaves, droughts, famine, rampant disease and mass extinction are sobering possibilities. Urbanisation has been largely blamed for this. Cities are well-known to be massive energy guzzlers and carbon-producing factories. But what if we could continue developing cities and homes without wrecking the environment for future generations? That is the burning question Farizan d’Avezac De Moran has spent more than a decade trying to answer. “We need buildings and houses to live in. We need cities. But we must also be aware of the environmental cost. We need a mitigation plan. We need to adapt and change the way we live,” said the Singaporean entrepreneur who founded homegrown sustainable building company GreenA Consultants. From Africa to China, Southeast Asia and Singapore, the 52-year-old has spent the latter half of her career greening one building at a time. From airports to seaports, offices, schools, malls and homes, she has helped to shape a new generation of sustainable buildings that conserve energy, water and other materials. Her vision: Cities of the future that are low, zero or positive energy. OUR FUTURE CITIES “This planet is our home. It gives us life and supports everything around us from the weather to the people. It is only natural to care about sustainability,” said Farizan. “When it comes to the building industry, there is so much we can do from innovation to design that is not only more sustainable but will have a positive impact on how we live and feel. I don’t understand why we are not looking more deeply into it,” she reflected.   Sustainable buildings may sound rather technical, but to cut all the jargon, they simply refer to more environmentally responsible and resource efficient designs.  They may harness solar energy, reuse rainwater, optimise natural lighting and natural ventilation, or feature high-tech innovations such as energy-efficient thermosiphon cooling beams instead of air conditioning, or artificial intelligence and machine learning for greater efficiency. In Singapore, Farizan has used many of these innovations to transform well-known landmarks such as Changi Airport Terminal 4, PSA Tuas Maintenance Base, NUS Techno Edge Building, Sentosa, and Singapore Discovery Centre. She was part of the team that designed the Republic of Singapore Air Force’s first net positive energy building, Changi Air Base Hangar. With solar panels that produce enough electricity to power 273 four-room HDB flats in a year, the hangar produces 30 per cent more electricity than it uses.  In addition, its rainwater harvesting system recycles rainwater for general washing, toilet flushing and the irrigation of its green roof, reducing yearly water consumption by the equivalent of 28 four-room HDB flats. The design optimises airflow and ventilation to keep the airmen cool as well. Beyond our shores, Farizan has also transformed both high-end and community projects. She worked with a French environmental designer to deck the five-storey Shanghai high-end department store Galeries Lafayette in verdant greens; and designed 452 sustainable homes for the Kigamboni Housing Estate in Tanzania for those who might otherwise have been unable to afford their own homes. This was the first Green Mark Certified project in Africa. TURNING A GREEN LEAF Farizan discovered her passion for sustainability in 2006 while she was still working in an architecture-specialised engineering company and took a Green Mark course by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA). This ignited a passion that set her career on a new trajectory. “Though sustainability is mainstream now, it was quite new in Singapore then. When I told the partners at the company I was working for about it, nobody was interested,” she said. “Because I was very passionate about it, I snuck it into my existing projects over the next two years. For example, I included a zero-energy security guardhouse that was lit with energy from solar panels within a larger project,” she recalled. For another project, she created containers with a 10m tall glass facade made of recycled beer bottles, grew plants in between the beer bottles, and made a roof out of corrugated recycled newspaper coated with bitumen.  “That was before the height of sustainability. When I collected close to 1,000 beer bottles for this project, people thought I was crazy,” she recalled. These small sustainability passion projects strengthened Farizan’s conviction that green was the future of building and architecture. “I told my boss we should venture into it, but he was not keen. The partners at my former company felt that we already had a successful formula and there was no need to reinvent the wheel,” she said. So in 2009, Farizan quit her job, and with S$200,000 of her own savings, started her company GreenA Consultancy. Farizan may have plunged headfirst into the sustainability business, but the market took much longer to warm up. “Back then, people didn’t really believe in sustainability. They thought it meant installing solar panels and would cost more money,” she mused. “After many presentations, I woke up to the fact that the market was not mature enough to invest in sustainability for its own sake. But they would do it for branding and advertising. So that’s what I pitched, hoping it will get the needle moving and perhaps along the way, clients would develop a deeper understanding of sustainability,” she said. While working with clients to achieve Green Mark certification, which rates a building’s environment impact and performance, she continued to find small creative ways to push boundaries. For instance, for a People’s Association Water Venture in Kallang, she installed a vertical windmill outside the air conditioning condenser blowing out hot air to generate energy for the pump used to wash canoes. Over the following decade, sustainability began to gain momentum in the building and construction industry and Farizan bagged bigger projects such as Changi Airport Terminal 4 in 2015 and the PSA Tuas Maintenance Base project in 2021. She also won the Green Building Advocate Singapore award in 2015. THE PATH LESS TAKEN Reflecting on her journey, Farizan believes her difficult childhood was what initially pushed her to challenge herself in the male-dominated field of building and construction. “I came from a mixed marriage family – my dad is Malay and my mum is Chinese. At that time, there weren’t a lot of mixed marriages so I felt like an outcast in school and experienced a lot of discrimination,” she recounted. “When I was nine years old, my parents got divorced for the first time. Over the next seven years, they re-married and divorced each other three times. Their third and final divorce took place during my O-Levels when I was 16,” she said. “I stayed with my dad and two brothers. Those days, men were perceived to be breadwinners and women were thought to be destined for marriage. But I knew from a young age that that was not the life I wanted,” she said.  This sense of wanting more in life led Farizan to chart her own destiny in her early 20s. Investing in progressive study and night classes whenever she had any extra money, she put herself through an accounting course, a basic engineering diploma, a postgraduate marketing diploma and a Bachelor of Science in Engineering and Technology. “I really wanted to prove myself. I liked the challenge of succeeding in a male-dominated field,” she reflected. Farizan also admitted that her childhood was what inspired her to build better homes for others. Recalling her affordable housing project in Tanzania, she said, “The house looks incredibly beautiful. When I spoke to the residents after the project, I was moved by how happy they felt about finally owning their own piece of land, having shelter over their heads, a kitchen to cook in and privacy.” “I have a soft heart for any living thing on land or in the blue ocean, especially children. I believe a home gives them a sense of security and sets the tone for their entire life,” said the mother-of-three.  “My vision for cities of the future is a place where we can live in harmony with one another, the landscape and our climate.” CNA Women is a section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/car-workshop-electric-vehicle-uncertain-future-2785261,‘How to get business?’: Motor workshops face uncertain future as Singapore moves towards electric vehicles,"SINGAPORE: Mr Khor Joo Heng, 60, was hurrying about his stuffy motor workshop in AutoCity at Sin Ming when he was asked what he would do if Singapore achieved its aim of phasing out internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles by 2040. ""Die lah,"" he quickly told CNA without missing a step, shuffling from car to lorry wearing stained overalls with tools in hand. Mr Khor is among a number of traditional motor workshop owners who said they would likely shut down if Singapore's vehicle population becomes fully electric, attributing it to factors like advancing age and a potentially crippling lack of business. In particular, the workshop owners pointed to how brand new electric vehicles (EVs) would come with extended warranty periods – longer than some ICE vehicles – and thus be exclusively maintained at authorised agents, ending their stream of customers. And with no potential successors intending to enter what could be an increasingly niche and costly market, the workshop owners said they were only biding their time before retirement. The Singapore Motor Workshop Association (SMWA) said about 50 to 60 per cent of its roughly 2,000 members have indicated they could shut down once EVs fully roll out. ""Either they stop business or they diversify,"" its president Mike Keh told CNA, explaining that this includes shifting to EV maintenance or other areas like body work. ""Right now, most of the workshops are run by first-generation owners. They are old already, with no second generation to take over. So, they got no choice. They have to close."" Many of these traditional workshops specialise solely in servicing ICE vehicles, which require a number of maintenance tasks at various age or mileage milestones in their lifetime. EVs, on the other hand, require significantly less maintenance as they do not have an engine and thus have fewer moving parts. ""For ICE cars you have to change engine oil and other minor things, mostly on the mechanical parts in the engine,"" Mr Keh added. ""Whereas for EVs there’s totally nothing you can do, other than checking the battery health and how much they are in working condition."" The plan to phase out ICE vehicles was first unveiled during Budget 2020, when then-Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat announced that all vehicles should run on cleaner energy by 2040 in a bid to cut emissions. While Mr Heng mentioned cleaner alternatives like hybrids and EVs, it should be noted that hybrid vehicles are still powered by ICEs with batteries that cannot be charged externally. In February 2021, the Government launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030, aiming to achieve its long-term net-zero emissions goal ""as soon as viable"". This includes ""a strong push to electrify our vehicle population"", supported by a campaign to raise awareness of EVs, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said on its website. By the end of 2021, the EV population more than doubled as authorities doled out about S$30 million in rebates under the Electric Vehicle Early Adoption Incentive, announced in Budget 2020. There were 3,713 EVs in 2021, up from 1,397 the year before. Then in March, the Government said it would push forward a target to make every Housing and Development Board (HDB) town EV-ready from 2030s to 2025, with charging points to be installed at nearly 2,000 HDB car parks over the next three to four years. Inadequate charging infrastructure is commonly cited as one of the main roadblocks to widespread EV adoption. Finally in May, authorities introduced a move that made EVs more affordable, by allowing more mass-market EV models to qualify for the smaller car Certificate of Entitlement category. Premiums for this category are usually cheaper. Mr Khor of BKS Automotive said he is getting fewer customers these days as some have switched to EVs. ""If you don't have a contract with a dealer selling EVs, how are you going to get the business? The EVs will all come with a warranty of eight years to 10 years, so drivers won't (service) their cars outside (at regular workshops),"" Mr Khor said. Mr Khor admitted that this, coupled with fierce competition amid a glut of workshops in Singapore as well as increasing rental and utility prices, means he would eventually have to pull the shutters on his business. ""What to do? Maybe I will go and work for other people,"" he said. Another workshop owner Mr Lee, who only wanted to be known by his surname, said more established workshops or automative-related businesses could set up specialised EV maintenance facilities, further drowning out the competition. For instance, a taxi company with a fully electric fleet could run its own maintenance facility that caters to other EVs as well, the 56-year-old from Lee Brothers Automotive at AutoBay in Kaki Bukit said. ""EVs will go there, so they will definitely have a better volume than us,"" he said. ""I don't think we can fight with them."" Furthermore, Mr Lee said the cost of the equipment needed to service EVs will likely be ""very high"", expressing concerns about whether it would be worth it. ""You must invest a lot of money, but whether people come is another thing,"" he said. Mr Hanip Abdul Hadi from Hanip Automobiles, another workshop at AutoBay, said Singapore's plan to phase out petrol and diesel vehicles has pushed forward his retirement plan. ""Honestly before EVs came, I don't have this type of thinking (to retire),"" said Mr Hanip, who declined to reveal his age but said he wanted to retire when he hit 60. ""But now the Government is pushing for EVs very hard. When the Singapore Government wants to do something, they make sure it happens. They are not like others, they will go for it."" Nevertheless, Mr Hanip encouraged younger automotive technicians who want to enter the burgeoning EV industry to upgrade their skills, recalling how he had to do the same when hybrid vehicles first entered the local market. ""If you want to sustain the business, you have to upgrade. If not, you will be left behind,"" he added. Over at Precise Auto Services, also at AutoBay, its managing director Eric Ong said he has sent two of his five employees for a basic EV maintenance safety course organised by SMWA, covering topics like how to disconnect the battery and isolate the power supply. ""We just need to prepare for the next 10 years; we have to,"" the 62-year-old said, noting that the course costs about S$1,000 per person, which is a subsidised rate for association members. In December 2020, the SMWA opened a new training facility for technicians to learn about servicing hybrid and electric vehicles. An EV's high-voltage batteries can pose a safety risk if not handled properly during maintenance. Then in May this year, LTA said it would work with training providers and institutes of higher learning to train and certify automotive technicians in safety-related areas of EV maintenance and servicing. The courses are expected to be available in the second half of this year. Despite that, some workshops might be wary of sending their employees for EV courses, Mr Ong said. ""With this kind of knowledge, there's a likelihood they might jump somewhere else. So, a lot of companies are also quite reluctant to send workers for this type of upgrading courses,"" he explained. ""For other workshops with owners up to my age, if they can't deal with all this sort of electronic stuff, or if they have no successors for the business, then likely they will wrap up."" Back at AutoCity in Sin Ming, Ricardo Auto Centre director Jeremy Soh believes it is only a ""matter of time"" that EVs are widely adopted, saying that his workshop will move towards EV-applicable maintenance. This includes aesthetic-related areas like tyres and rims as well as undercarriage maintenance like wheel alignments and suspension changes. ""For us, we don't intend to just call it a day. We will try to pivot to newer areas where you can still work on EVs,"" the 41-year-old said. ""We are also doing financing, insurance and things like that. So, it’s not just about operating a workshop for us."" But Mr Soh said he will not be ""jumping straight into"" sending his employees for EV courses as they are currently ""very basic"". ""We might even have to send our boys overseas instead, rather than training in Singapore,"" he added. While Mr Keh of SMWA acknowledged that the current EV courses are basic, he stressed that they have to be foundational at the start to cater to technicians who might have little formal education, especially since many of them are foreigners. He said SMWA has conducted a ""few runs"" of the courses together with engineering company Robert Bosch for a total of 70 technicians thus far. In fact, Mr Keh is concerned about the national plan to roll out certification courses as they might prove too complicated for technicians. ""Because you are training someone only with primary school knowledge, and you straight away want to go to a diploma course,"" he said, adding that he will bring this up with LTA. Despite that, Mr Keh suggested that no course can currently prepare technicians for the nitty-gritty of servicing EVs, pointing to how EV manufacturers do not sell their vehicle spare parts, motors or circuit diagrams in Singapore to protect their intellectual property. ""For EVs, the only things involved are the motor and the battery. The battery you can maintain by measuring the battery (health). Whichever cell is spoilt, just change it out,"" he explained. ""For the motor, you can't repair because it has a lot of winding armatures. Once damaged, you have to change the whole motor. Then the other thing is the inverter. These are all electrical components; you don't have the circuit diagram, you can't repair."" Mr Keh said technicians also require the circuit diagram to know where the EV's ""main switch"" is, so they can take the crucial first step of isolating the battery before maintenance. ""Current motor workshops can only attend to the battery, bodywork and brakes. That's about it, unless they diversify and go towards servicing diesel vehicles,"" he added. ""Diesel will never die."" Mr Keh cast doubt on whether EVs can truly become mainstream in Singapore, highlighting that logistics vehicles that go for long distances would still have to run on diesel. This includes freezer trucks that use a lot of energy and would thus drain a battery quickly. ""You can't use EVs if you are travelling long distance, only 300km max,"" he said, referring to an EV's range before needing a 30-minute charge. ""If you doing delivery every day running here and there, one day you can easily cover 300km. You can't wait for an EV to charge and do delivery."" Beyond range limitations, Mr Keh identified potential battery supply bottlenecks globally as well as insufficient charging points locally as speed bumps in the rise of EVs. ""Whether EVs will (fully) roll out is still a big question mark,"" he added. ""I'm not fully convinced."" Indeed, Mr Jason Tan at Lai Huat (Meng Kee) Motor in AutoCity is adopting a wait-and-see approach before taking steps to switch to servicing EVs. ""We definitely thought about it, just that we are still gathering information. Currently EV adoption is very low. From my point of view, these numbers are not a big deal,"" the 50-year-old said. ""You think everyone will change to EVs? I think it’s not practical, a lot of hidden costs. Nobody knows at the moment. An EV has to be very affordable, or else I don't think it will be adopted by the middle class."" In 2021, only 2,942 out of 568,376 cars were fully electric, or a meagre 0.5 per cent of Singapore's total car population. ""For now, I'm definitely not going to jump in and say I'm going to plan for the future and invest in equipment or upgrade my workers’ skills,"" Mr Tan said, noting that EV equipment could cost tens of thousands of dollars and courses could become obsolete in a few years. Ultimately, Mr Tan feels the question is how ""broadly"" the Government will push for EV adoption. ""I know some government sectors are changing (their fleet) to EVs. Are you even talking about heavy vehicles? Are companies doing logistics going to convert their fleet to electric?"" he asked. ""Things are changing fast, and I don't see any (EV) volume or even sales coming in in the next five years."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/heatwave-india-asia-europe-temperature-humidity-stress-climate-change-2796626,Commentary: Just how much heat and humidity can the human body withstand?,"STATE COLLEGE, Pennsylvania: Heatwaves are becoming supercharged as the climate changes – lasting longer, becoming more frequent and getting just plain hotter. One question a lot of people are asking is: “When will it get too hot for normal daily activity as we know it, even for young, healthy adults?” The answer goes beyond the temperature you see on the thermometer. It’s also about humidity. Our research shows the combination of the two can get dangerous faster than scientists previously believed. Scientists and other observers have become alarmed about the increasing frequency of extreme heat paired with high humidity, measured as “wet-bulb temperature”. During the heatwaves that overtook South Asia in May and June, Jacobabad, Pakistan, recorded a maximum wet-bulb temperature of 33.6 degrees Celsius and Delhi topped that – close to the theorised upper limit of human adaptability to humid heat. People often point to a study published in 2010 that estimated that a wet-bulb temperature of 35 degrees Celsius at 100 per cent humidity, or 45 degrees Celsius at 50 per cent humidity – would be the upper limit of safety, beyond which the human body can no longer cool itself by evaporating sweat from the surface of the body to maintain a stable body core temperature. It was not until recently that this limit was tested on humans in laboratory settings. The results of these tests show an even greater cause for concern. To answer the question of “how hot is too hot?” we brought young, healthy men and women into the Noll Laboratory at Penn State University to experience heat stress in a controlled environment. These experiments provide insight into which combinations of temperature and humidity begin to become harmful for even the healthiest humans. Each participant swallowed a small telemetry pill, which monitored their deep body or core temperature. They then sat in an environmental chamber, moving just enough to simulate the minimal activities of daily living, such as cooking and eating. Researchers slowly increased either the temperature in the chamber or the humidity and monitored when the subject’s core temperature started to rise. That combination of temperature and humidity whereby the person’s core temperature starts to rise is called the “critical environmental limit”. Below those limits, the body is able to maintain a relatively stable core temperature over time. Above those limits, core temperature rises continuously and risk of heat-related illnesses with prolonged exposures is increased. When the body overheats, the heart has to work harder to pump blood flow to the skin to dissipate the heat, and when you’re also sweating, that decreases body fluids. In the direst case, prolonged exposure can result in heat stroke, a life-threatening problem that requires immediate and rapid cooling and medical treatment. Our studies on young healthy men and women show that this upper environmental limit is even lower than the theorised 35 degrees Celsius. It’s more like a wet-bulb temperature of 31 degrees Celsius. That would equal 31 degrees Celsius at 100 per cent humidity or 38 degrees Celsius at 60 per cent humidity. Current heatwaves around the globe are approaching, if not exceeding, these limits. In hot, dry environments, the critical environmental limits aren’t defined by wet-bulb temperatures, because almost all the sweat the body produces evaporates, which cools the body. However, the amount humans can sweat is limited, and we also gain more heat from the higher air temperatures. Keep in mind that these cutoffs are based solely on keeping your body temperature from rising excessively. Even lower temperatures and humidity can place stress on the heart and other body systems. And while eclipsing these limits does not necessarily present a worst-case scenario, prolonged exposure may become dire for vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with chronic diseases. Our experimental focus has now turned to testing older men and women, since even healthy ageing makes people less heat tolerant. Adding on the increased prevalence of heart disease, respiratory problems and other health problems, as well as certain medications, can put them at even higher risk of harm. People over the age of 65 comprise some 80 to 90 per cent of heatwave casualties. Staying well hydrated and seeking areas in which to cool down – even for short periods – are important in high heat. While more cities in the United States are expanding cooling centres to help people escape the heat, there will still be many people who will experience these dangerous conditions with no way to cool themselves. Even those with access to air-conditioning might not turn it on because of the high cost of energy – a common occurrence in Phoenix, Arizona – or because of large-scale power outages during heat waves or wildfires, as is becoming more common in the western US. A recent study focusing on heat stress in Africa found that future climates will not be conducive to the use of even low-cost cooling systems such as “swamp coolers” as the tropical and coastal parts of Africa become more humid. These devices, which require far less energy than air-conditioners, use a fan to recirculate the air across a cool, wet pad to lower the air temperature, but they become ineffective at high wet-bulb temperatures above 21 degrees Celsius. All told, the evidence continues to mount that climate change is not just a problem for the future. It is one that humanity is currently facing and must tackle head-on.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/nepal-bagmati-river-kathmandu-rubbish-dirty-water-2763851,"IN FOCUS: From life-giving source to murky brown water, is there hope for Nepal’s Bagmati river?","KATHMANDU: The stench was unavoidable. Mr Bhakta Bahatur Khawas recalled nights where he would wrap a blanket around his face for some relief. Metres away from his home in the Thapathali squatter settlement in Nepal’s capital city of Kathmandu, the Bagmati river reeked. “When I first came to live here, the water was black and the smell was bad. The smell would not go away, it would be there all day and all night. When the smell got very bad, we would pinch our noses (and get on with our daily lives),” said Mr Khawas, who has lived in the area for about 15 years.  “It would sometimes be difficult to sleep at night and we would cover our faces with our blankets when we sleep.” Fellow settlement resident Gopal Pandey recalled how waste from a nearby hospital was discharged directly into the Bagmati via a drainage pipe. Residents knew it posed a threat to the river and so they wrote a letter to the authorities, said Mr Pandey. The practice was eventually stopped. “When the river was really dirty, the only option we had was to tolerate the smell. We had no other option,” he said. Down a flat, sandy path from Mr Khawas’ hut lives Mdm Durgamaya Darji and her three children. “When I first moved here, the water level was near to our doorstep. The quality of water was really bad, there used to be lots of plastic bottles, carcasses of animals and household waste in the river,” she said. Mdm Darji, 48, and other residents in the settlement use hand pumps to draw water from wells for some household needs. As the groundwater from these wells is not clean enough for consumption - a possible side effect from the rampant pollution of the Bagmati - they have to also buy drinking water. “I feel very sad that I cannot use water from such a big source in front of my house. We are compelled to spend money to buy water,"" she added. But the Bagmati wasn’t always like this. The Bagmati begins its journey in the hills north of Kathmandu. The river carves its way through the Kathmandu Valley where it is fed by a number of tributaries and flows through the Pashupatinath Temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site of great significance for Hindus. Further downstream, it meanders into southern Nepal and joins the Koshi River in India’s Bihar province. In the 1970s and 1980s, the river was an important source of water for those living in the Kathmandu Valley.  Freshwater ecologist Deep Narayan Shah, who is an assistant professor at Tribhuvan University's Central Department of Environment Science, recalled how it used to be integral to the day-to-day life of families like his own. “We had cows, buffaloes, so we used to bring them to the river for water,” he told CNA. “We visited the river for swimming, we also went to the river to wash clothes. So we were very close to this river because our day-to-day life was very much connected to the river.” Rather than rely on the city’s limited water supply, Mr Madhukar Upadhya, a climate change and watershed expert, recalled how he too would use the Bagmati’s waters to do his laundry during his younger days. This was a common practice, explained Mr Upadhya, who lived along a small tributary of the Bagmati. Ramesh Upreti, a former CEO of the Pashupati Area Development Trust, whose role is to safeguard, maintain and develop the temple and the surrounding area, noted that the Bagmati was an integral part of the community and people's daily lives.  “During my childhood, I used to drink water from this river. There used to be a lot of beautiful fishes, and the water used to be used for irrigation,” he added. Apart from daily living, the water in the Bagmati is also seen as holy for Hindus. Religious activities, rituals and rites are performed at temples along the river banks, with river water sometimes used. Cremations continue on the banks of the Bagmati until today. Kathmandu resident Chaturchand KC recalled how he would take “ritual baths” in the river more than four decades ago. “During (the) Bala Chathurdashi (festival) we used to come here and stay here throughout the night to worship and take a bath in the river. We used to take the water in our hands, bring it to the main temple and offer it to Lord Pashupatinath,” he told CNA. The Bagmati’s decline began with the proliferation of carpet factories in the Kathmandu Valley in the 1980s, experts said. “There were a lot of carpet factories, and they were mostly located along the riverbanks. So all the waste generated - either liquid or solid - were directly discharged into the river,” explained Dr Shah. “After the carpet industry (grew) ... the colour (of the river) changed, and people could not use it, especially for bathing. There was also the wool produced that used to be lying on the sides of the water, so that looked dirty. It started to look ugly since then,” added Mr Upadhya. This pollution affected aquatic life and animals living along the river. Mr Upreti recalled how fish in the river started dying and monkeys in the Pashupatinath area became sick. As the years rolled on, more people moved to Kathmandu in search of job opportunities. The mushrooming population meant rapid urbanisation and heavy industrial activity. Untreated sewage started flowing directly into the river. “Due to the direct discharge of sewage and wastewater into the rivers without treatment, all the rivers in the valley have been turned into open sewers,” said the Kathmandu Valley Environment Outlook in 2007.  “The degraded quality of both surface water and groundwater in the valley is due to sewage, industrial effluents, leachate from solid wastes, and infiltration of agricultural residue,” said the report, which was produced by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, the United Nations Environment Programme and Nepal's Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology. It noted that in cities within the Kathmandu valley, about 21,000kg of domestic sewage was being discharged daily into the Bagmati. A 2015 report by Nepal River Conservation Trust, a non-profit organisation established by a group of river guides, noted that the portion of the Bagmati which flows through the Kathmandu city area was unsuitable for drinking and irrigation, did not meet the requirements to support aquatic life and exceeded the regulations for effluent discharge. “The general take-home message was that in 2015, the river was already extremely polluted in the major areas of Kathmandu city. Only the river stretches that are in the forest areas, in the mountains surrounding Kathmandu, are clean,” said Dr Shah, who was part of the expedition team that conducted the research. “The pollution that we generate within Kathmandu Valley affects (stretches) at least 60 to 80km downstream of Chobhar, the place from where the river leaves Kathmandu Valley.” A follow-up study in 2017 resulted in mostly similar findings, said Dr Shah. “If you have been to the river, it's no more a river … This is like sewage. People don't like to move around, walk along the river because it smells bad,” he added. “It’s not even pleasant to the eyes, or pleasant to the nose.” In addition, the lack of water in the river means that whatever is dumped into the Bagmati can be stuck for a long time. “In the past, the rain fell on the ground in the rice fields, and then the water seeped (into aquifers), and the aquifers were charged. All this water started to flow back again to the river channel. This means the river had continuous flow even after the monsoon ends,” Mr Upadhya said. This process is now mostly gone, he added. “The amount of water used to wash away everything has not increased but the waste has increased many, many fold,” Mr Upadhya explained. As a result of the pollution of the river, religious practices have also changed. “To worship the god Pashupatinath, every day worshippers must take water from the river. But due to heavy pollution, they are not doing that now. For that, (now) they use dug wells and from that they collect water and take water to the temple for worship,” said Mr Upreti. Those who do use the river water only take a little bit of it for symbolic purposes, added Mr Gaurishanker Parajuri, who is the current chief executive officer of the Pashupati Area Development Trust. “I don’t think it's now possible to do the (full) rituals here and I don’t think the river water will be clean anytime soon,” added Mr Chaturchand. While the odds seem stacked against the river, there have been efforts to restore the Bagmati to its past glory. As early as 2009, the Nepalese government drew up a five-year plan with the goal of a ""clean, green and healthy Bagmati river system full of life and valued by all"". Known as the Bagmati Action Plan, it zoned five portions of the river system, identifying specific issues to be tackled in these zones. The Nepalese government also enacted the Solid Waste Management Act in 2011 to tackle waste-related issues. Today, the High Powered Committee for Integrated Development of Bagmati Civilisation spearheads the government’s efforts to clean the Bagmati. It has a number of ambitious plans in place, including the construction of wastewater treatment plants, as well as building various sewer pipelines and planting green belts along the river banks.  ""The main objective of this High Powered Committee is to keep Bagmati River and its tributaries clean by preventing the direct discharge of solid and liquid wastes to the river and to conserve the river system within the Kathmandu,"" said the committee on its website. It did not respond to CNA’s request for an interview. Local citizens have also taken the initiative to clean up the river. One of these groups is Bagmati Safai Maha Abhiyan (Bagmati Clean-Up Mega Campaign), a movement that was started by a few organisations in 2013. One of those involved in the early days of the campaign was Dr Bijay Man Shakya, a researcher who was part of Jeevan Vigyan, an organisation which provides meditation, yoga, psychological sciences and management development programmes, and was one of the first five groups involved in the river clean-up efforts. “I was thinking that it wouldn’t last long, but whatever, we had to start anyway. Let's give it a try … We were amazed, there were lots of people on the first day, more than 300,” recalled Dr Shakya. “I don't remember exactly how many tonnes of waste we collected. But it was a lot ... five or six trucks (worth), nine or 10 tonnes.” And as more people joined, awareness of the issue increased, he said. “It was changing the mindset, creating an awareness. So the main theme of this campaign was not (just) cleaning, but creating a mindset among the people,” he added. Almost 10 years on from the first clean-up session, locals such as Kishor Singh Shahi continue picking up litter on stretches of the Bagmati on Saturday mornings. “Before 2013, we saw the Bagmati river was very polluted, we hesitated to use the water (because) of things like skin allergies,” he explained. “When we came here to worship, we saw the river and felt like guilty people. So we (had to) take the initiative (to be part of the clean-up process).” When they first started cleaning the Bagmati, Mr Shahi recalled how a number of volunteers would suffer skin diseases after coming into contact with the water. There were some who also ended up vomiting, he noted. He added that they would find dead bodies of animals by the river, such as dogs and cows. “Now it is better than the past,” Mr Shahi said. “I will continue to do this and I hope it will be clean in the future … Kathmandu city’s main river is the Bagmati, we have to clean this."" For the river quality to improve, Mr Shahi noted that there needs to be stricter enforcement of rules and regulations, as well as proper waste segregation in Kathmandu. “The people living in Kathmandu have already realised that the status of the river reflects our status, our lifestyles. It's not acceptable and we should do something for it,” added Dr Shah. The Pashupati Area Development Trust is also doing its part to reduce the environmental impact of religious activities have on that particular stretch of the Bagmati. In 2016, it opened an electric crematorium to provide an alternative option to using traditional wooden pyres by the river banks during the cremation process. “We are very much conscious about the Bagmati river,” said Mr Parajuri. “We have to develop a less polluted river for the sake of the community.” “I feel very bad that in the past the water was very clean and (we) could drink (from it). Now even the fish can’t survive, I even feel very guilty that I am also one of the polluters of the Bagmati river. All of us have to make a joint effort (to save it),"" added his predecessor Mr Upreti. Research also continues to be carried out on the Bagmati.  For one, a team from NEWRIComm, the philanthropic arm of the Nanyang Environment and Water Research Institute (NEWRI), is in the process of conducting a detailed analysis of the Bagmati’s organic contaminants. As part of the project, water samples will be collected from 18 different segments of the Bagmati river stretch (upstream, urban areas and downstream). The samples are then separated according to their chemical and physical properties for greater accuracy in analysis. Once completed, water samples are shipped to Singapore for further data analysis.  It is NEWRI’s goal that the study findings will reveal the extent of water pollution and help to advocate for the preservation of the river.  NEWRI executive director Shane Snyder noted that preliminary findings six months into the two-year project have yielded “pretty remarkable results”.  “We found that in certain sections, the water is highly toxic to human cells. I was very surprised at the amount of pharmaceuticals that are in that water, including antibiotics, which can lead to antibiotic-resistant bacteria,” Prof Snyder explained. Should that happen, it would be a ""very dangerous scenario"", he added. Experts remain divided on whether the Bagmati can be restored to its original state. For Mr Upadhya, it is now about damage limitation for the Bagmati, he noted. Cleaning the river is possible, but restoring it is not, he noted. “I’ll not be shy to say it. Restoring is bringing it back to the situation that existed in the past, restoring it to the situation four decades ago when the river was still clean ... Can we restore it to that level? We cannot. We have destroyed the system that kept that (river) system alive,” he said. He explained how river water comes not just from its source, but mostly from surrounding areas or the river's watershed, which has also been significantly reduced over the years due to urbanisation. And with the valley floor now being mostly sealed due to urbanisation, this makes it impossible for rainwater to permeate the ground.  “The state of the river now, what you see today, is after lots of efforts, of cleaning, providing treatment of sewage water. And this is what you have. Don't expect that your children will one day have a beautiful river with gardens around and clean water flowing. No, you can't. It is not possible.” Dr Shah noted that restoring the Bagmati will require huge financial expenditure. “We have degraded the river (to) such a state that it will require huge financial requirements, and we'll need a lot of technology and a lot of time to bring it to the state it was before, a few decades back,” he said. “There is (a) possibility but that will cost a lot.” A number of issues need to be solved, he pointed out. This includes ensuring no sewage or waste enters the water and there is a better waste management system in Kathmandu. “At the first stage, we need to control all those sources that pollute the river. So whatever liquid waste that is generated in the house or in businesses, corporate (settings) or anywhere, so that all needs to be piped and brought to a treatment plant,” explained Dr Shah. “Only when the wastewater is treated properly, and it is acceptable to release in the river then it should be released. (For the) solid waste that has been generated, 100 per cent of it needs to be collected. The collection rate is low. If it is low, those waste will ultimately find a way to the river.” It is also important that authorities look beyond merely beautifying the river, he noted. ""Are we simply thinking of water or thinking of the ecosystem? Because the river is not simply water, it's the entire ecosystem. And for functioning of the ecosystem, both abiotic and biotic components should interact properly and that will keep the ecosystem going, to keep on functioning well,"" said Dr Shah. ""And if the ecosystem is functioning well, we will get the ecosystem services which are vital for our day-to-day life.” While some have stopped disposing of their rubbish in the river, it remains a problem, say those who CNA spoke to. “If you ask people, they all know - yes, we should not throw it (in the river). But where do they throw (it) then? You have to throw it out. It's like not in my backyard, it goes out to your backyard or wherever. So you want to remain clean but at the cost of somebody else,” said Mr Upadhya. “The river is a public place, nobody complains, everyone can throw it and no one is bothered about it. So that became a very easy spot.” “The major problem that we have seen - not just Kathmandu but the whole of Nepal - is out of sight, out of mind. Not in my backyard,” explained Dr Shakya. “If I throw it in the river,  it goes somewhere, not my problem now. It’s like whatever, finished ... It’s like out of my sight, I’m clean, I don’t care.” Back at the Thapathali squatter settlement where more than 100 families live, Mdm Darji recalled how people would arrive in the middle of the night to dump rubbish in the Bagmati. ""There have been a lot of rules made to stop people from dumping waste in the river ... But at night, there are people (from elsewhere) who come in motorbikes and big cars to throw their household garbage into the (opposite bank of the) river,"" she said. Mr Pandey added that the settlement's residents do not dump their rubbish into the river. All biodegradable waste is fed to animals, while non-biodegradable rubbish is either burned or buried in the ground. But residents that CNA spoke to were in general agreement that things have improved slightly over the years. “Now it has gotten a lot better, it does smell now also but it's not as bad. They have blocked one sewage pipe that comes from the temple nearby so the waste from there does not directly mix with the river. So maybe that is why it has gotten better,” said Mdm Darji. “The quality of the river water in my opinion has improved by more than 30 per cent,” added Mr Pandey. ""Once, the river water was usable. But it was because us people (in Kathmandu) who polluted the water. It is upon us to make the river clean.” Having grown up in the squatter settlement, 22-year-old Binod Waiba summed up the current situation as “the best of the worst”. “It is not only the responsibility of people living by the river, but everyone in the city should be responsible. The direct effects are upon us (who live here), but indirectly it will affect everyone,” he said. “The Bagmati is a symbol of the identity of Kathmandu. It should have been preserved well but it was not.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/malaysia-chicken-ban-lab-grown-plant-based-meat-alternative-proteins-2796401,Commentary: How to make room for alternative proteins on Singapore menus,"SINGAPORE: Many in Singapore went into a frenzy after Malaysia banned chicken exports from June 1. Since then, Malaysia has partially lifted the ban to allow the export of live kampung and black chicken;  Indonesian sources will start exporting chicken “really soon”. It looks like we have taken these shocks in our stride, turning to frozen chicken or cutting down on our favourite chicken rice. But the “Great Chicken Crisis” shows that Singapore cannot take food security for granted. It’s why the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) wants 30 percent of nutritional needs to be produced locally by 2030.  One possible way to meet that goal? Alternative proteins – plant- or lab-derived versions of fish, beef, eggs, milk, and yes, chicken.  Alt proteins are manufactured, rather than grown or raised, which means they can be produced anywhere, in almost any weather. The starting point for many early adopters of alt proteins is to have an alternative to meat for health, ethical or environmental reasons.  Their use could reduce intensity of industrial farming and pressure on land, resulting in fewer greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions: Methane from cattle is the second-largest source of global GHGs, accounting for about 20 per cent of the total. If cows were a country, they would emit more GHGs than the United States.  Over the past few years many alternative meat options have hit supermarkets, restaurants, and even hawker centres in Singapore. Loo's Hainanese Curry Rice at Tiong Bahru Market and Keng Eng Kee Seafood both had pop-ups earlier this year selling dishes with cultivated chicken.  But when it comes to food, cognitive arguments aren’t enough: Alt proteins need to win over hearts, minds—and most importantly, stomachs. There are three priorities.  Alt proteins need to taste and feel right. They need to evoke the same emotions of our favourite comfort foods or Grandma’s classic dishes. The closer they come to the real thing, the greater the chance of consumer acceptance.  Informal evaluations, such as by Singapore students or a journalist in CNA videos, are positive, as they found very little difference with conventional foods. But isolated opinions are unlikely to move the needle much.  To scale up, what can help is a critical mass of early adopters, most likely among those who lean vegetarian, or who are particularly health conscious. In a 2019 survey, about two-thirds of those who had bought alt proteins said health was the main reason they did so: plant-based proteins can have higher fiber, iron, and folates.  Rigorously testing, and tasting, the product throughout the R&D process alongside chefs and consumers can also help with acceptance.  Producers also need to communicate better. For example, because new alt proteins are new, cooking it can seem daunting. Consumers can reject it if a dish doesn’t turn out as imagined. When it comes to food, there are few second chances.  As Max Rye, chief strategist at Singapore-based TurtleTree Labs that uses cell-based tech, told me: “For a food to be truly sustainable, it has to be… a way of eating that people can, and want to, come back to over and over again.” Price matters – especially when soaring inflation has squeezed our wallets. Alt proteins need to be affordable; Why would people pay more for meat alternatives if they can get meat for less?  Some might be willing to do so, as a “green premium,” but that is an uneasy economic foundation. Right now, meat alternatives are considerably more expensive than the conventional kind.  But the trends are in the right direction. The first lab-grown hamburger cost US$325,200 (S$456,000) in 2013. Today, you can find options at a broad range of restaurants, including fast-food restaurants and popular cafes, with prices growing closer to that of conventional options.  Greater consumer acceptance and a growing market could mean  economies of scale eventually kick in. A McKinsey study estimates that plant-based and fermentation products could reach cost parity with processed meat in a decade, and cultivated meat with whole muscle cuts by 2050.  Those timelines could speed up if climate change policies become more aggressive, such as imposing a cost on emissions or raising land-use standards.  The alt-protein industry also needs to ensure that it delivers on its promises, such as emissions reductions and general sustainability. Making cultured meat is an energy-intensive process, for example, and if these efforts are not powered by low-emissions technologies, they may not make much of a difference.  They also need to address concerns about health. As Josh Tetrick, CEO and cofounder of cultivated meat company Eat Just, said: “In our research, we’ve seen that there’s a concern about the word ‘cell,’ there’s a concern about the process.”  Attitudes to food are both complex and sensitive; it’s critical to build trust. And it’s fair to ask if alt proteins aren’t a “First-World solution”—something richer consumers can afford and big companies can invest in, but ultimately is irrelevant to the billions more worried about having enough to eat.  But there are reasons to believe Singapore could embrace meat alternatives. A Blackbox survey indicates more than half of Singaporeans are willing to switch at least 10 per cent of their meat consumption if alternatives taste as good and costs the same as meat.  For one thing, Asians been eating non-meat proteins (like tofu, tempeh and soy milk) for thousands of years. Consumers are therefore likely to be receptive to the idea.  Already, big groceries routinely stock major alt-protein brands. And the government is supportive, too. In 2020, Singapore was the first country to approve a cultured chicken product, and its investment arm, Temasek, has invested US$8 billion in food tech.  Investors, including major meat processors, also find the sector increasingly appetizing. Since 2018, Singapore-based alternative-meat startups have taken in more than US$200 million, according to McKinsey estimates. Local start-ups are creating cell-based shrimp and milk.   Investors are betting on fast growth because Asia has been slower to the alt-protein table. The region accounts for less than 1 percent of the global alt protein market, or about US$300 million; but it could grow to more than US$1 billion by 2025.  Alt proteins are not the sole answer to climate change and they won’t solve the food insecurity that preceded but worsened with the Ukraine war. But as the world seeks new ways to foster more sustainable food systems and improve food security, it makes sense for alt proteins to be on the menu.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/fast-food-chain-kfc-mcdonald-jollibee-asean-green-net-zero-climate-change-2794341,Commentary: Franchises like fast food chains could lead fight against climate change,"PERTH: KFC Singapore recently announced that it had paired up with local foodware company Tria to introduce what they claim is the world’s first closed-loop recycling for single-use packaging. Over the next six months, dine-in packaging and food waste in its Northpoint City store will be turned into compost. This comes a few days after McDonald’s Philippines declared that two more stores in its Philippines operations would become solar-powered. Their conversion to solar energy, following in the footsteps of the burger chain’s Quezon City and Pangasinan shopfronts, preempts an estimated 17,000 kg of CO2 emissions. Both of these incremental moves towards sustainability have received some attention, but they also represent the untapped – and overlooked – potential for business franchises to drive a greener future. This major business sector has the capacity to play a lead role in reducing emissions, but appears to be a bit of a blind spot for climate change support and action by governments. Today there are more than 4,300 franchise systems in existence throughout Southeast Asia. These chains effectively control more than 150,000 franchisee firms licensed to sell goods on behalf of master franchise brands. Together, they provide plenty of scope to quickly and effectively change business practices across much of the retail, services and accommodation sectors where many franchises now proliferate. Whereas most other emissions-reduction programmes require voluntary participation by firms, franchising is different. The franchisor largely dictates the terms on which the goods and services are produced and delivered by their franchisees. Because many chains are massive consumers of raw materials and goods – Philippines-based Jollibee alone has more than 1,000 outlets in Southeast Asia – they can also lay down the rules on how their own supply chains work and the environmental standards they should comply with. In other words, greening a franchise system can lead to significant improvements in both the upstream and downstream supply chains that it oversees. It seems to be a quick, effective way of promoting emissions reductions through many businesses simultaneously. Yet there appear to be few moves by governments in the region to support the greening of franchising. A glance through the business support programmes of various agencies reveal an abundance of assistance schemes operating in conjunction with industry associations and chambers of commerce, and plenty of schemes targeted toward particular industries. These are all important and useful measures, but they are focused on working with the private sector one business at a time. Meaningful, widespread change via this route will take a very long time. Few, if any, agencies seem to be engaging with the franchising sector per se, despite its enormous capacity to effect large-scale change for the better, and in a much shorter time frame. Franchising now deserves a specialised focus by climate bodies, and a better understanding of how it works, especially since it operates in some different ways compared to stand-alone, independent businesses. For example, in countries such as Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia, franchising activities are dictated by sector-specific regulations. Various challenges stand in the way of going greener. Some international franchisors, such as the many US-based fast food chains now popular in Southeast Asia, still source original products from faraway suppliers. The franchise system may also struggle to monitor compliance by their franchisees with new rules. For all of these reasons, there is a good case for governments to provide specialised support to franchise systems to facilitate their transition to a net-zero world. This should be a comparatively easy sector to engage with, as franchise chains tend to be more organised into representational bodies than most other parts of the business community. Across Southeast Asia, there is a major regional franchising trade forum held each year, and national franchise associations are active in at least eight of the 10 Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members. These in turn meet regularly as part of the Asia-Pacific Franchise confederation. Finally, the World Franchise Council provides a global perspective on the sector. These facilitating bodies make working with franchise systems en masse easier, in general, than dealing with independent firms. Whilst there is certainly a role for national governments to be involved, a region-wide approach could also help. It makes sense that ASEAN as a whole should work with the sector. Many of the best-known and largest franchise systems in the region operate across most of Southeast Asia, often in sync with a pan-Asia or ASEAN-wide business strategy.  ASEAN could potentially play an important role in providing cross-border support schemes and capacity building, improving public sector knowledge about the franchising community, and collating reliable statistics about the size and nature of the sector. Regional cooperation can help ensure that franchise systems are included when government consults business on climate change issue. ASEAN could also help Asia-wide franchise chains to “reshore” and bring their supply chains closer to home. Amid the current convergence of trade uncertainty and the race to net zero, the regional bloc can foster a potential win-win situation through helping member states deal with the disruptions caused by China’s continued zero-COVID strategy and Russia’s blockade of Black Sea trade, while reducing travel distance and encouraging more sourcing from within the region. It’s not yet happening, but ASEAN ought to start thinking about doing so. In the meantime, though, some players are making their unilateral moves instead of waiting for government support. For example, many food brands are continuing to review their packaging (partly driven by impending bans on single use plastics), adding more plant-based items to their menus, and seeking to reduce their carbon footprints when opening new stores. That’s a good beginning, but imagine how much more effective it could be if a holistic, region-wide perspective is embraced. Would I like a combo meal with fries and a drink? I’d rather have lower emissions, thanks.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/advertorial/three-disconnects-impeding-southeast-asias-climate-goals-and-how-eliminate-them-2784536,The three disconnects impeding Southeast Asia’s climate goals – and how to eliminate them,"The 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference – better known as COP26 – saw eight out of 10 ASEAN member states pledging to pursue net zero emissions, a welcome move given the region’s exceptional vulnerability to climate change. Fulfilling these pledges, however, demands the radical scaling of sustainable solutions – and the financial support needed to do so. According to Bain & Company and Temasek’s Southeast Asia’s Green Economy 2022 Report, with contributions from Microsoft, there are gaps in emission reduction plans and investment commitments across the region.  To accelerate the path towards a zero-carbon future, the report highlights key investment areas with rich carbon abatement potential and recommends actions to boost the Southeast Asia green economy. Said Mr Dale Hardcastle, partner and director of Bain & Company’s Global Sustainability Innovation Centre: “Southeast Asia is uniquely positioned to expand the green economy, being home to some of the world’s most valuable natural capital – about 25 per cent of global investable pantropic forest carbon stock, 19 to 46 per cent of blue carbon stock and 97 per cent of tropical peatland carbon sinks.”  CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE REGION To be aligned with the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global warming to not more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, Southeast Asia must close an emission gap of around three gigatonnes by 2030.  According to the report, the region is currently well short of where it needs to be. Less than one per cent of the US$3 trillion (S$4.17 trillion) needed to drive sustainable regional infrastructure and nature-based solutions has been invested.  Still, there is a growing desire to catalyse change in the region, with US$15 billion worth of cumulative investments being deployed since 2020 – primarily in the renewables and built environment sectors – and the fast-growing energy and agri-food spaces seeing greater focus on the building and scaling of sustainable solutions.  On a heartening note, the report cited that 90 per cent of Southeast Asia’s consumers were willing to pay more for green products and noted that private equity and venture capital sustainability investments have tripled in the last two years. For Southeast Asia, the real hurdle lies in moving from awareness and goal setting to implementing actions that have tangible results. This is no small task, given that around half of the region’s gross domestic product (GDP) comes from small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) – and many of these outfits have yet to engage in the green economy.  Additionally, governments are grappling with macro challenges stemming from widespread inflationary forces and global events like the war in Ukraine, which have impacted food and energy security in a region still recovering from the economic shocks of COVID-19.  Green investment can help to mitigate these challenges while driving the longer-term goal of decarbonisation. Said Mr Hardcastle: “Investment in three key sectors – energy, nature and agri-food – can impact decarbonisation progress positively, as they contribute to 90 per cent of Southeast Asia’s carbon abatement potential.” According to Mr Hardcastle, there will be an estimated US$1 trillion’s worth of economic opportunities in Southeast Asia by 2030 – but more must be done to strengthen the investable market and increase green capital flows.  “Five key levers in the sectors of forest conservation, renewables (solar and wind), electric mobility, sustainable farming and built environment are most investable today, and will be pragmatic in delivering both returns and carbon impact,” he added.  THE THREE DISCONNECTS Drawing on interviews with industry experts, the report identified three critical disconnects that are impeding greater investment and action across Southeast Asia.  The first is a lack of incentives to scale decarbonisation rapidly, resulting in limited private capital opportunities and inconsistent returns.  The second is the insufficient focus on proven solutions that have a low-risk impact across SMEs and other segments of the economy that are not yet engaged in sustainability. The report identified a bias towards new solutions, in a case of “revolutionary over evolutionary”. The last is a lack of clarity on system costs during discussions on energy transition, resulting in an incomplete roadmap for scaling investment forward. Serious engagement and planning must take place to address who pays for the new – for example, renewables and grid upgrades – and for phasing out the old, such as coal assets. MOVING THE NEEDLE ON DECARBONISATION  To expedite the progress of green investment, the report recommended four key actions.  First, it highlights the need to unlock the potential of proven solutions by adopting a more holistic decarbonisation programme with incentives to drive accessibility and encourage mass-segment participants like SMEs. Thereafter, a fuller picture of the system costs for renewable energy transition should be developed, with clearly defined funding sources and mechanisms for drawing investments.  At the same time, green financing should be boosted by the development of abatement investment products to lower the cost of capital for businesses embarking on a green transition. Last and perhaps the most important of all, regional collaboration must be scaled up to mitigate risks, leverage the vast creative potential of Southeast Asia and build fruitful partnerships across industries, the value chain and public and private sectors.  Said Mr Hardcastle: “We’ve seen meaningful progress from COP26 last year and our climate ambitions must now be translated into action. Stakeholders must come together to capture today’s opportunities and meet climate targets – or risk falling short of both.” To learn more about how you can be part of the greening of the region’s economy, download the Southeast Asia’s Green Economy 2022 Report.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ves-enhanced-vehicular-emissions-scheme-extended-until-2025-nea-lta-2782836,Enhanced Vehicular Emissions Scheme to be extended until 2025,"SINGAPORE: Drivers who buy cleaner car models will continue to receive higher rebates beyond this year after the enhanced Vehicular Emissions Scheme (VES) was extended until the end of 2025. Tightened pollutant thresholds will be introduced for the scheme from 2024, however, the National Environment Agency (NEA) and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said in a joint statement on Thursday (Jun 30). ""The measures support the Singapore Green Plan vision for all new car and taxi registrations to be of cleaner energy models from 2030,"" they said. VES was introduced in 2018 to encourage drivers to choose vehicles with lower emissions across carbon dioxide and four pollutants: Hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. Under the scheme, buyers of cleaner cars receive rebates to offset the additional registration fee for their vehicles, while buyers of vehicles that produce more emissions are required to pay surcharges. The enhanced version of VES with bigger rebates and higher surcharges was introduced on Jan 1, 2021, and was initially slated to last until the end of this year. Enhanced VES rebates will remain unchanged until Dec 31, 2023, while current surcharges will remain unchanged until Dec 31, 2025. Rebates from Jan 1, 2024, onwards will be announced next year. The tightened pollution thresholds for enhanced VES will clearly distinguish between pure internal combustion engine (ICE) cars, cleaner alternatives such as hybrids, and electric vehicles (EVs), NEA and LTA said. “Only cars with zero tailpipe emissions (for example, EVs) will qualify for Band A1, while Band A2 will include EVs with high power consumption, most hybrids and some pure ICE cars that are smaller and more efficient,” they said. “Other pure ICE cars and some hybrids will fall under the other bands.” NEA consulted the motoring industry on the tightened pollutant thresholds last year. “Most motor dealers had no objections to the revisions, and the implementation timeline was extended to allow a longer lead time for the import of cleaner vehicle models, given the tightened thresholds,” NEA and LTA said. More information on VES is available on the OneMotoring website."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sustainability/singapore-host-international-rainforest-competition-2023-2776336,Singapore to host international rainforest competition in 2023,"SINGAPORE: While small and fragmented, Singapore’s forests could hold the key to unlocking new solutions to advance the protection and conservation of the world’s rainforests and biodiversity. Singapore has been chosen to host the semi-finals of international competition XPRIZE Rainforest, which aims to identify technologies that can be used to monitor rainforests and their biodiversity in real time. The semi-finals testing will take place in 2023. This was announced by the organiser XPRIZE, a non-profit organisation that organises large-scale competitions to crowdsource solutions to tackle world challenges, during the World Biodiversity Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday evening (Jun 28) Singapore time. In a media release, the organiser said Singapore was chosen because of its conservation efforts and its efforts at harnessing science and technology to address biodiversity in an urban landscape. This includes developing new technologies such as video and camera trapping to map animal populations as well as satellite tracking of migratory shorebirds. The National Parks Board is also using acoustic sensors and minute traces of DNA in the environment to survey Singapore’s flora and fauna. XPRIZE said that the ""proximity of Singapore’s rainforests to the resources of the city will be a critical asset for teams at this still early stage of testing"". “It’s vastly different from the typical field sites where autonomous technologies like the ones being developed in the prize will be most useful, but the teams that succeed at semi-finals testing will move on to test their tech in a remote location, without those helpful and accessible resources, at the competition finals in 2024,” the organiser said. Today, the largest rainforests surround the Amazon River in South America and the Congo River in Africa. Dense rainforest habitats can also be found in the tropical islands of Southeast Asia and parts of Australia. Although they cover just 6 per cent of the Earth’s land surface, rainforests play an important role in stabilising the climate as they absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen. They are also home to more than half of the world’s plant and animal species. In a video address during the event, National Development Desmond Lee said Singapore is honoured to host the semi-finals. “The autonomous technologies that they are developing for rapid biodiversity assessments will be very helpful for enhancing our collective understanding of rainforest ecosystems, both in Singapore and around the world,” he said. In the final round of the competition, which will be held 2024, teams will have to survey the most biodiversity in 100 hectares of tropical rainforest in 24 hours and provide the most impactful insights within 48 hours. ""We're really hopeful that the teams' technologies will be beneficial for assessing and protecting rainforest biodiversity, and not only involve Indigenous Peoples, but ultimately benefit them once they come online,"" said founder and president of Amazon Watch Atossa Soltani, who is also one of the XPRIZE Rainforest judges. The panel of nine judges includes Singaporean conservation scientist Koh Lian Pin, who is also director of the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Centre for Nature-based Climate Solution. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ukraine-war-energy-commitments-walk-back-grace-fu-2774231,Ukraine war has made some governments walk back on energy commitments: Grace Fu,"SINGAPORE: Some governments have walked back on energy commitments as a result of the Ukraine war and are reconsidering the use of coal to counter record fuel prices, said Sustainability and the Environment Minister Grace Fu on Tuesday (Jun 28). She added that there has also been some scepticism about environmental, social and corporate governance - also known as ESG - investing in the wake of greenwashing scandals.  Greenwashing refers to companies overplaying their environmentally-friendly virtues to appear greener. Speaking at the 9th Singapore Dialogue on Sustainable World Resources, Ms Fu said that the upcoming UN climate change conference (COP-27) in November will have to tackle the triple confluence of COVID-19, conflict and climate, which has caused economic and geopolitical shockwaves. “Nations need to rekindle the spirit of partnerships to limit temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius and prevent the setback that we cannot afford,” she said. To do this, she said, will require nations to challenge limits, collaborate and fulfil commitments. “By understanding the limitations facing us and others, we can help one another for mutually beneficial outcomes,” said Ms Fu, adding that Singapore has actively assisted other nations where it could.  This includes launching a climate action package in 2018 to support capacity-building efforts in areas such as climate science, mitigation and adaptation, disaster risk reduction and green climate finance.  She added that Singapore has also been at the forefront of developing carbon markets and playing important roles in global carbon initiatives such as the World Bank’s Climate Warehouse on carbon credit trade and the Clydebank Declaration for green shipping corridors. While Singapore contributes 0.1 per cent to global emissions, Ms Fu said the country will be 100 per cent affected by the remaining 99.9 per cent, due to its vulnerability to rising sea levels, extreme weather and supply chain shocks.  “We benefit when everyone does better, including ourselves,” she said.  “We must act in good faith and meet our obligations – otherwise we suffer a trust and credibility deficit that undermines partnerships,” she added.   She pointed out that Singapore participates actively and contributes to various multilateral instruments. The country has also pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by or around 2050.  Despite the disadvantages that Singapore faces such as limited land, the country has focused on maximising its energy and food resources.  In August last year, the country launched its first large-scale floating solar farm in Tengeh Reservoir – one of the largest in the world. It also opened its fifth desalination plant to increase water supply resilience in the face of climate change.  “While there were opportunity costs in both endeavours, we pushed ahead because we must address our limitations through innovation and investments,” Ms Fu said.  Last week, Singapore initiated its first multilateral cross-border electricity partnership by importing renewable energy from Laos through Thailand and Malaysia. "

He acknowledged that the Commonwealth does not have a lot of resources available for official group cooperation, but pointed out that member states still work informally together. “With that branding, we are both Commonwealth countries, there is a certain, I would not go on to say shared values, but certain commonality in a broad approach and mindset, which means if I work together with you, I think it is likely to go somewhere. That is very valuable,” he said. While Mr Lee is on his first official visit to Africa, he recounted how Singapore’s founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew first visited the continent more than 50 years ago. “Even now, some of the African leaders I met at CHOGM still recall his visit to their countries. And I am grateful for this reservoir of goodwill in Africa towards Singapore,” he said. Mr Lee said Singapore is encouraging its people and businesses to venture into new markets in Africa. “We are also happy to share our experience in economic development, human resource development and capacity building with others,” he said. This is why the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP) was launched in 1992, Mr Lee said. The programme offers training courses on topics like public health, trade and economy, as well as leadership and governance. “On this 30th anniversary of the SCP, I am happy to announce a three-year Singapore-Africa Partnership Package,” Mr Lee said. “We will customise courses in priority areas for Africa. These will cover emerging issues such as on climate change and sustainability, and digitalisation and smart cities.” African officials will also get “priority placement” in SCP courses, while senior African officials will be offered postgraduate scholarships in Singapore universities, he continued. “Rwandan officials have actively participated in SCP courses over the years,” he added, noting that more than 12,000 African officials, including many from Rwanda, have attended the “well-received” SCP courses to date. “And we look forward to Rwanda’s and Africa’s continued participation in the SCP.” In response to a question on Africa’s potential and how Singapore could help develop it, Mr Lee said Africa is a “continent on the move”. “It's a huge population. It's very diverse. The countries have a huge range of economic situations and political environments. And in that complexity, there are multiple bright spots and Rwanda is one of them,” he said. “It's had a traumatic past in the genocide … And it's determined to pick itself up beyond that, to reconcile the hurt and to move forward and see hope for the future.  “And when a population feels like that and is on the move, and has a leadership and a government which is organising it and setting the direction and making things happen, there are opportunities for themselves and for their partners.” Before meeting Mr Kagame, Mr Lee paid respects at the Kigali genocide memorial, where he laid a wreath and left a message in a guestbook. In 1994, Hutu extremists killed 800,000 people in Rwanda across 100 days of vicious ethnic violence. In the years following the genocide, Mr Kagame has been hailed for transforming Rwanda through policies that encouraged rapid economic growth. “The Rwandan people have showed great fortitude. May they continue to enjoy peace for many years,” Mr Lee wrote in the memorial guestbook. Singapore is Rwanda’s largest trading partner, with about US$150 million (S$208 million) worth of foreign direct investments made by Singapore companies in Rwanda. In August 2021, the two countries also signed a memorandum of understanding on digital economy cooperation. “Singapore looks forward to deepening our cooperation, and increasing trade and investment between Singapore and Rwanda,” Mr Lee said. The Prime Minister highlighted that Singapore and Rwanda, despite being on different continents, have “much in common”.  Both are small countries with limited resources that place importance on international cooperation – including with other small countries – to secure peace, progress, and prosperity for their people in a “dangerous world”, he said. “I therefore look forward to working closely with President Kagame to ensure that the relationship between our two countries continues to grow from strength to strength,” he added. When asked how else Rwanda could work with Singapore and Asia, Mr Kagame said the country will look at increasing trade and investment as well as education cooperation. “We will work together in the area of technology which can catalyse our development, and see (how) the use of technology has contributed to the development in Singapore or other Asian partners,” he said. “We will look at issues of security and work with them in dealing with climate change which affects other parts of the world.” Mr Kagame in his speech thanked Singapore for being a “valuable partner” over the years, saying that the countries will be doing even more together in the years ahead. “Singapore's development model and its commitment to social cohesion and national unity are very impressive,” he added."

""Without a healthy ocean life, our planet as we know would not exist,"" Momoa said with the sea behind him as he took part in an event on a Portuguese beach ahead of the United Nations Ocean Conference in Lisbon, which starts on Monday (Jun 27). Around 7,000 people, from heads of state to environmental activists, are expected to attend the conference, which was postponed from 2020 to this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Dozens of youth activists from various countries clapped and cheered as Momoa, who will soon become the UN Environment Programme advocate for Life Below Water, spoke about the problems facing the world's oceans. ""We must seek to right the wrongs we have done against our children and grandchildren, turn the tide on our irresponsible stewardship and build momentum for a future where humanity can once again live in harmony with nature,"" said Momoa, 42. Momoa is known for his role as Arthur Curry, a half-human, half-Atlantean character in DC Comics' Aquaman, which takes viewers to the underwater world of the seven seas. Aquaman 2 is scheduled for release in March 2023. UN Secretary-General António Guterres joined Momoa at the event and apologised on behalf of his generation for not doing enough at the time to tackle climate change, save the ocean and protect biodiversity. ""Even today we are moving too slowly...we are still moving in the wrong direction,"" Guterres said, also pointing a finger at the fossil fuel industry. ""It's time for these behaviours to be seriously condemned."" The ocean covers 70 per cent of the planet's surface, generating over half of the world's oxygen and absorbing 25 per cent of all carbon dioxide emissions but climate change is increasing its temperature and causing sea levels to rise. Eleven million metric tons of plastic ends up in the ocean each year, a figure that's expected to triple by 2040 unless production and use of throwaway are reduced, multiple scientific studies show."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/green-jobs-talent-youth-esg-energy-economy-sustainability-2765671,Commentary: Youth in Asia want green jobs but companies aren’t delivering,"SINGAPORE: The idea of creating a more sustainable world has great appeal to young people across the world, but nowhere more so than in Asia Pacific (APAC).  In a 2022 Accenture survey, 77 per cent of APAC individuals aged 15 to 39 said they wanted to work in the green economy within 10 years, compared to 57 per cent in Europe and 52 per cent in the US. While APAC youth still want good pay, stability and opportunity, they also want to help their economies transition to cleaner transportation, decarbonise or switch to sustainable agriculture and land use.  Companies can and must bank on this demand for green jobs. They cannot attract fresh talent through traditional corporate citizenship initiatives such as annual donation drives, beach clean-ups and environmental pledges alone. APAC youth are looking to work on the cutting edge and firms must appeal to that desire. But many solutions to the climate crisis – like clean hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage – are nascent or may not even exist yet. So roles specifically structured around these solutions are scant.  Compounding the issue is that where jobs do exist – and where green talent is most needed – are industries young workers find least attractive.  By 2030, Accenture expects some 6.5 million jobs to be created to produce renewable energy to power grids in Australia, China, India, Indonesia and Japan. Yet just 15 per cent of the region’s youth want to work in the energy industry.  Fewer still want to work in other “old economy” industries – utilities, chemicals manufacturing, and metals and mining. To attract young talent into these industries, companies must take an unvarnished look at their sustainability credentials and take concrete action. Discerning and critical, today’s youth will see superficial rebranding attempts as “greenwashing”.   Steps include decoupling green businesses from legacy operations – as is the case in how some oil and gas companies are moving into offshore wind energy – and pursuing decarbonisation strategies that best suit their assets. Companies can also build new internal capabilities for sustainability, for instance by introducing and tracking sustainability indicators and appointing new leadership. These steps would create new “green-collar” roles too such as carbon auditors and environmental, social and governance (ESG) managers. Companies will also need to look beyond current job titles to design green-collar jobs that encourage innovation. Often, this will involve hiring for positions still in their infancy – think biofuel engineers who harness fuel from plant sources or artificial intelligence engineers who design smart power grids that optimise energy use.  Already, LinkedIn has observed that job postings in the US renewables sectors are on the rise and could outnumber job postings in the US oil and gas industry by 2023. Many green solutions will emerge at the intersection of multiple disciplines. Sustenir Agriculture founder Benjamin Swan, for instance, drew on construction, banking, robotics and hydroponics to create the vertical farm which grows non-native crops using up to 95 per cent less water for up to 127 times more yield. Within the start-up’s facility in Singapore, 28-year-old plant science specialist Eunice Koh combines technology and agriculture in her quest to improve the company’s baby spinach, a crop typically imported from cooler climates. Just as Swan and Koh blend different areas of expertise in the up-and-coming field of sustainable farming, companies must hire a mosaic of talent profiles and provide them with the tools, technologies and creative freedom.  While start-ups are more nimble, multinational and legacy companies should also design jobs around problems that need to be solved, rather than filling out the same traditional job titles. It is important to recognise not all this talent will need to have tertiary education or advanced technical qualifications. Many will be bright young people at the beginning of their careers. In industries like construction and manufacturing – where we estimate 76 per cent of the new green jobs will be created due to strong demand for green infrastructure and products – many roles favour strong vocational qualifications instead.  On an encouraging note, our research also shows a large proportion of young people are willing to build their skills to join the green economy, opening up opportunities for companies to upskill or reskill these employees for specialised pathways. Indian infrastructure developer L&T, for instance, offers construction certifications for 15 occupations and 75 different job roles, including solar technicians. The company has so far trained more than 240,000 employees for jobs at construction sites across India. APAC youth inherit a challenging legacy as the region produces about half of the world’s carbon dioxide and is home to two of the three largest emitters, namely China and India. But young people are passionate about making a difference and are increasingly drawn to organisations committed to environmental stewardship. To attract the best talent, companies will have to make real and concerted shifts towards environmental sustainability, and rethink and plan for the roles and skillsets required. As Singapore transitions into a green economy, it bears remembering that a new workforce will be essential to the journey. By acting now, companies secure both their green credentials and future prosperity. Gianfranco Casati is the Chief Executive Officer for Growth Markets at Accenture."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/freegan-food-rescue-waste-lifestyle-cost-living-sustainability-2753251,Commentary: Living in Singapore doesn't have to be so expensive when you're a freegan,"SINGAPORE: With the cost of food and petrol increasing on a weekly basis, every conversation with friends is sure to touch on inflation.  Sometimes I am shy to admit I have not felt it at all, because my expenses have not increased in the past five years. Yet life has only gotten more abundant. At home, our fridge is full of fresh vegetables and fruits, sourced from food rescues where we collect “ugly” but edible produce from shopkeepers. Our cupboards are full of canned food and condiments, gathered from cafes and restaurants that have shut down.  We have more soap and shampoo than some provision shops stock, enough for maybe a decade of use. We have a brand new CorningWare gifted from a family after spring cleaning and a Rommelsbacher 40L oven picked up from a void deck.  As freegans, we collect things other people no longer want, to reuse or repurpose for our own needs. We limit our participation in the conventional economy as much as we can to save the environment and our expenses. Freeganism originated in San Francisco in the 1990s and has since spread globally. Our Facebook group Freegan In Singapore has grown to 10,000 members since I co-founded the movement in 2017.  Many of us find that a freegan lifestyle enables us to be more generous without having to be rich. Such a caring and sharing community attracts many to join and stay. Alongside the growing popularity of freeganism is rising concern about our carbon and waste footprint. According to a study by the Institute of Policy Studies published in 2021, three in five Singaporeans believe protecting the environment should be prioritised over economic growth. However, making more sustainable choices is not always cheap. Vegan and fair-trade foods and clothes tend to be more expensive than their regular counterparts. So are electric cars, even with incentives and rebates. But the freegan lifestyle marries sustainable and frugal living through its emphasis on reducing consumption. Each item you buy comes from a long supply chain that uses up resources and produces waste at every stage, even if those products are sustainably sourced.  Take for example an audio store owner whom I recently met. He needs to keep a surplus stock of earphones to provide exchanges for customers claiming their warranty. After a few years as warranty periods lapse, the remaining stock is discarded.  That’s how I ended up receiving a hundred boxes of brand-new earphones. Multiply this by the number of businesses in Singapore, big and small, and it’s no wonder the country’s non-domestic sector generated 5.12 million tonnes of waste in 2021.  But freegans don’t always strive to cut waste out of a passion for the environment. Some have a much more pragmatic reason – to reduce personal expenditure. I used to spend S$2,000 a month in my pre-freegan days. Now my necessary monthly expenses have dropped to just S$350, including insurance. As I eat mainly rescued food, I’ve lowered my food costs from $500 a month to zero, not counting the occasional birthday treat at a restaurant for a loved one. I am also a lot healthier as the variety of food I eat has expanded. I don’t remember when I last stepped into a shopping mall because I’ve been able to get items on my wishlist for free. What I spend on entertainment has plummeted because all my favourite leisure activities cost nothing: Communing with nature, visiting our island’s many parks and beaches, volunteering with social causes, and enjoying meals made from rescued food with friends. My one luxury is travelling. Before the pandemic, I was travelling five to six times a year – much more frequently compared to the one or two yearly trips in my pre-freegan days. This was due to having not only more disposable income but more free time. Because freegans spend less, we aren’t as pressured to earn more. Full-timers become part-timers. Dual-income households become single-income. Some choose to retire early, like I did three years ago. Freegans believe the price of making money is too costly, because we buy money with our limited time alive. Think about it: In any kind of paid work, you are exchanging your lifetime for cash. Some squander it on impulse purchases, meaning they need to spend more lifetime to earn more money.  I would rather spend four to five hours of my lifetime each week collecting things I need than spend 40 to 50 hours each week earning money to buy the very same things. With that time saved, freegans can focus on activities that matter to them. This could be making art or writing, growing plants to beautify the surroundings and improve mental health, or building communities where members look out for each other.  We rediscover the hobbies we enjoyed before a money-centric world taught us we had to monetise what we like to do or drop it. We no longer sell irreplaceable lifetime to buy replaceable material goods. When so many things we need can be acquired for free, there is little else we absolutely need to spend money on – meaning that the cost of living in Singapore doesn’t have to be sky high. What many people find expensive could be the cost of lifestyle instead. Not everyone can make the jump into freeganism, such as those with chronic conditions requiring long-term medication that can only be purchased or those with very young children. But there are simple ways to incorporate freegan habits, starting with diet. You can use sharing apps such as OLIO to look for people staying nearby with surplus food to give away. Or you can volunteer with a food rescue group such as Fridge Restock Community SG to stock and use its community fridges. The main goal of these programmes is to reduce food waste, so all are welcome to make use of them, especially those struggling to make ends meet. Instead of buying appliances and clothes brand new, you could first ask around to see if family, friends and neighbours would like to give theirs away. Many people don’t like to throw away pre-loved items but don’t know who to pass them to.  Third, consider joining a sharing community online. It’ll help you find items you’ve been meaning to obtain and find new homes for those you don’t want.   These three habits aren’t just freegan – they can be adopted by anyone looking to trim down lifestyle costs. And with prices set to go up in Singapore with GST hikes in 2023 and 2024, every item we choose not to buy can be a greater saving. For me, the greatest gift of freegan living is the freedom to choose what we want to do with our lifetime, which is the only real currency we have. Daniel Tay is the co-founder of the freegan and food rescue communities in Singapore."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sentosa-resorts-world-install-solar-panels-carbon-neutral-18-sites-2747631,"Sentosa, RWS to install solar panels at 18 locations as part of carbon neutrality efforts","SINGAPORE: Sentosa and Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) are embarking on a large-scale deployment of solar panels to harness energy across the island from this month, as part of its efforts to go carbon neutral by 2030. The panels will be installed at a new batch of 18 sites, including Palawan Kidz City, Beach Station, Universal Studios Singapore and Hard Rock Hotel, said Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) on Wednesday (Jun 15). This marks the first major renewable energy milestone under the refreshed Sustainable Sentosa roadmap, which was launched in September last year.  Under this, Sentosa has committed to becoming a carbon neutral destination by 2030 and a “globally recognised, certified sustainable tourism destination”. It is also studying other sources of renewable energy, such as tidal energy and waste-to-energy generators, as part of its long-term strategies. Small-scale pilots are currently being explored with a view of scaling them for mass deployment should they prove successful. The island aims to power 10 per cent of its electricity usage through onsite renewable energy by 2030. As part of the deployment, SDC launched a tender on Wednesday for the installation of solar cells, marking the first time that “rooftops with varying tenures are being consolidated into a single tender in Singapore”, it said. These will include seven sites such as Palawan Kidz City, Beach Station and three Sentosa Line cable car stations. “The consolidation will strengthen the tender’s commercial viability, with more spaces activated for solar energy generation,” SDC said.  “Under this tender, tenure refers to the duration that each rooftop is available for photovoltaic cell installations, based on considerations such as development and renovation plans for each building.” The locations were chosen after taking into account the availability of sufficient sunlight and unobstructed guest experience, it added. SDC’s chief executive officer Thien Kwee Eng noted that solar power is one of the most viable renewable sources of energy for Sentosa and Singapore, but the challenge is in optimising underutilised spaces to harness its potential. “The deployment of photovoltaic cells across Sentosa’s establishments through a consolidated approach, comprising different rooftops with varying sizes and tenures, is an illustration of how we can collaborate as a business ecosystem to tap on such opportunities,” she said. Separately, RWS will begin installing such cells at 11 sites on its premises, including the rooftops of Universal Studios and Hard Rock Hotel. “These 11 new sites, along with an additional site at RWS’s warehouse at Pandan Green Gardens, will quadruple RWS’s existing solar network which already hosts one of the largest solar photovoltaic systems in Singapore’s hospitality sector,” said SDC. Collectively, the solar panels at the 18 new sites will cover about 2.5 ha, with a solar capacity of 3.094 megawatt-peak (MWp). This can produce 3,871,500 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of clean energy annually when fully installed by 2023, said SDC. “This will result in an overall reduction of 1,643 tCO2 per year, which is equivalent to the carbon generated by 60,000 hotel room nights.” Mr Tan Hee Teck, CEO of RWS, said the transition to renewable energy is “an important means to combat climate change and forms an integral part of RWS’ decarbonisation strategy”. “Our aim is to accelerate our transition to next generation renewable energy which includes solar, wind, tidal and kinetic energy through applied research and test-bedding at RWS, which will then be adapted for scalability across a variety of environments within our resort,” he added.  “This will all culminate towards RWS’s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2030.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/advertorial/making-sustainable-choices-simple-todays-businesses-2635921,Making sustainable choices simple for today’s businesses,"In late 2021, the United Nations’ (UN) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a major report detailing the latest scientific assessments of climate change. The report warned of the need for immediate and significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions made, as the world trends towards concerning surface temperature shifts. Today, more so than ever before, the spotlight has been placed on the environmental impact of organisations around the world. Governments and businesses alike are placing a keener emphasis on sustainable development, whether it means investing in environment, social and governance (ESG) talent to create change from the inside out, or by investing in technologies to drive greater resource efficiency and lower carbon output. The need for progress on this front is compounded by global economic factors such as inflation, growing resource scarcity and the rising cost of energy – all of which are push factors compelling cost-conscious businesses, particularly small-to-medium enterprises, to do more with less. While many corporations continue to adopt initiatives such as digitisation or implementing carbon reduction strategies, some businesses are struggling to juggle the dual challenge of efficiency and sustainable use.  DESIGNED WITH A PURPOSE Printers, scanners and laser projectors are an important part of everyday workflow for many modern businesses. As such, IT decision makers must recognise the potential environmental impact these technologies can have for the organisation.  For example, modern document scanners enable the digitising and distribution of soft copy documents to team members simultaneously, reducing the need for paper copies and minimising waste. Likewise, inkjet printer technology consumes less energy compared to laser printers because it doesn’t require the heating element of laser printers. Modern laser projectors are also more sustainable now as they are mercury-free, designed for lower power consumption, and do not need lamp replacements. In choosing to upgrade legacy hardware, decision makers need to consider both long-term financial and environmental costs. This is in addition to meeting corporate sustainability goals – having a plan and the means by which to go about proper end-of-life waste management is a critical tenet of meeting such goals. These principles drive Epson to design its products with an intent to empower businesses to activate their sustainability journey without compromising on cost or performance. Mr Derek Tan, head of Epson Singapore’s sales division, shared: “Sustainability is at the core of what Epson does. Through eco-innovation, we seek to empower global corporations to revolutionise the way they conduct business. Our smart products and solutions tackle business pain points while also considering people and environmental needs for a more sustainable economy.” PLACING EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABILITY HAND IN HAND Green technologies are essential towards realising Epson’s vision of a more sustainable tomorrow. Cutting-edge printers that incorporate Epson’s proprietary heat-free technology and inkjet innovation are one example of the brand’s commitment to delivering on this promise. According to Epson, its inkjet printers consume up to 85 per cent less power 1 and generate 85 per cent less carbon dioxide 2 versus laser printers. Because no heat is required in the ink ejection process, the paper does not curl – an issue that often leads to jammed printers. This allows for consistent high-speed printing while creating a lower carbon footprint.   Epson inkjet printers come with high-capacity consumables, resulting in a reduction of up to 59 per cent less replacement parts 3 compared to laser printers in the market. Laser printers often require frequent replacement of consumables like toner cartridges and other supplies such as printer drums and printer fuser units. By reducing the need for more frequent replacements, these devices help mitigate the burden on IT departments and create less waste for the environment.  ALIGNING WITH SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS Epson’s Environmental Vision 2050 is a goal to become carbon-negative and underground resource-free by 2050. According to Mr Tan, part of that commitment involves advancing the frontiers of green business through creative, open innovation and by being active agents of sustainable change within the region. “Since the recent inception of the Epson SEA regional hub, we have been in close collaboration with regional stakeholders to help them meet the combined needs of productivity and sustainable growth as they each walk their own paths towards a collectively more responsible, eco-minded economy,” he shared. Today, Epson offers businesses a holistic range of business solutions to empower like-minded organisations in their mission towards sustainable development. Beyond enterprise-grade printers and scanners, the brand has also delivered innovative technologies to help reform the way organisations approach resource consumption.  Epson’s signature PaperLab is one such example. The paper recycling system that can be used within office premises employs proprietary dry fibre technology to recycle waste paper into new paper. Unlike conventional papermaking, PaperLab uses virtually no water from start to finish. This process makes it possible to produce new paper in a small, localised cycle that also demands less resources. PaperLab presents a reduced carbon footprint and sustainable alternative that businesses can employ, helping them address corporate sustainability goals at every step of the resource life cycle.  OVERCOMING THE CHALLENGES OF TOMORROW In recent months, success stories of businesses adopting sustainable technologies and practices have shown that most not only maintained productivity, but also created added benefits such as long-term cost savings. As decision makers continue to learn, adapt and pivot in this way, subject matter expert partners like Epson will be instrumental in helping organisations upgrade their devices to meet changing business needs, better serve employees and unlock greater efficiencies in the evolving business climate.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/businesses-need-incorporate-decarbonisation-climate-risks-strategies-teo-chee-hean-2731206,"Businesses need to incorporate decarbonisation, climate risks into strategies to remain competitive: Teo Chee Hean","SINGAPORE: To remain competitive in the long term, businesses will need to incorporate decarbonisation and climate risks into their strategies or risk being written off as “doing too little, too late”, said Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean on Tuesday (Jun 7).  Speaking at sustainability conference Ecosperity Week, Mr Teo warned that the effects of climate change will affect businesses, and disrupt their operating models and supply chains.  Growing awareness about the climate crisis has also changed how people define value in business, and what values a company upholds, he said.  “Companies can no longer solely focus on short-term returns from current assets and business lines,” he said, adding that shareholders, creditors, customers, and even employees will demand more sustainable practices and plans. “As demand for sustainable practices increases, first movers will capture upsides while laggards may be written off as doing too little, too late.”  “Questions will be asked about your companies’ strategies to avoid stranded assets or legacy lines of production that may be rendered obsolete,” he said. He pointed to the oil and gas industry, which has found itself under a harsh spotlight as concern over climate change increases in the world.  It has led the Big Five oil giants - Shell, ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips - to respond by pledging to reduce emissions. Shell, ExxonMobil and Chevron, which have major operations in Singapore, have committed to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.  Mr Teo called on the private sector to do more to tackle climate change. “Climate policies, technological advancements and stakeholder preferences will fundamentally impact what is the sustainable value of a company, and its valuation in the long term,” he said. Mr Teo said the private sector and private finance have an important role in the shift towards the green economy, by providing investments to plug the financing gap, or taking the lead in adopting greener business models.  “Sustainable private financing and corporate net-zero targets have a powerful mutually reinforcing effect, by drawing capital preferentially towards sustainable projects and new opportunities in the global green economy,” he said.  “This in turn makes it more difficult and expensive for companies to obtain financing if their projects are not green.”  On Monday, Temasek launched a new investment platform company GenZero, which aims to accelerate decarbonisation globally. Temasek committed an initial S$5 billion to establish GenZero, and a number of investments have already been made in the company’s focus areas which include tech-based as well as nature-based solutions, and carbon ecosystem enablers. Besides spurring private initiatives, government policies also play an important role in combating climate change, said Mr Teo. This goes beyond reducing carbon emissions, and achieving sustainable development goals such as creating a circular economy, and building sustainable and liveable cities, he added. “Governments need to have the right policies that get to the root of the problem, and create solutions at the system level,” he said.  Citing sustainable urban transportation as an example, he said Singapore has invested heavily in public transport to minimise the need for cars. “Sustainable urban transportation is not just about replacing all internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles with electric vehicles,” he said. “If we did that, we will convert our traffic jams with ICE vehicles today with electric vehicles,” he said. Instead, he said the more fundamental system solution is to minimise the need for cars, through well-integrated urban planning and a comprehensive public transport system.  The country has set a target of limiting peak hour journeys to no more than 45 minutes under its Land Transport Master Plan 2040.  Mr Teo said the country is already two-thirds of the way to achieving this target. Later this year, Singapore will update its long-term low emissions development strategy (LEDS), along with its revised plans to achieve Singapore’s net-zero goals by 2050.  Mr Teo stressed the need to continue exploring emerging technologies that could bring about more sustainable solutions in the longer term. These include carbon capture, utilisation and storage and green hydrogen. “If we use technology right, it can be a valuable tool to help us overcome resource constraints and unlock greener and more sustainable solutions,” he said. He added that Singapore has been putting in place “the building blocks” to support a high integrity carbon credits ecosystem and invited like-minded researchers and investors to use the country not just as a testbed but as a launchpad to build regional capabilities. “We hope this helps to unlock the potential of the APAC region and develop mutually beneficial partnerships and solutions for our climate challenge,” he said."

Temasek has committed an initial amount of S$5 billion to establish GenZero, and a number of investments have already been made in the company’s focus areas. “The climate crisis is intensifying and the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned that the world is not on track to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels,” Temasek said. “There is an urgent need to accelerate decarbonisation across all sectors to avoid irreversible damage to the planet by reducing global carbon emissions and address the emissions gap, which is estimated (to be) between 19 and 26 gigatonnes of carbon in 2030 for a 1.5 degrees Celsius scenario.” GenZero will aim to “catalyse decarbonisation solutions with its ability to deploy long-term and flexible capital” and will invest in a range of opportunities, “from early-stage companies and solutions that require patient capital to commercialise and grow, to more mature ones that are ready to scale”. GenZero’s focus areas “present a holistic and integrated approach to address the emissions gap, with solutions across both the near- and longer-term horizons”, the company added. Temasek International managing director for sustainable solutions Frederick Teo has been designated as GenZero’s CEO, and will fully transition to the role on Jul 1. Mr Teo has held leadership positions in Temasek for nearly 12 years in roles across sustainability, portfolio management, business continuity and strategic stakeholder engagement. “Recognising the importance of immediate action, we will focus on investment opportunities that can deliver positive climate impact by 2030 while ensuring sustainable financial returns,” Mr Teo said. “Besides deploying capital, we will work with our investee companies to address operational challenges and accelerate the deployment of their solutions to achieve our shared net zero target.” Temasek International chief sustainability officer Steve Howard said that GenZero “expands Temasek’s focus on deploying capital to catalyse solutions for a better world” and will help the company achieve its goal of reducing its portfolio’s net emissions. “Achieving net zero globally will require deployment of around US$5 trillion annually by 2030, to rapidly adopt and commercialise sustainable energy solutions,” Dr Howard said. “(GenZero’s) flexible approach will enable it to catalyse near- and long-term solutions to support ongoing efforts to achieve net zero globally. “GenZero will not only support Temasek’s efforts as we strive towards halving our portfolio’s net emissions by 2030 and working towards a net zero portfolio by 2050, but also those of the wider ecosystem.” GenZero will invest in “technology-based solutions that deliver deep decarbonisation impact through climate-driven technologies”. “While many decarbonisation technologies and innovations currently exist, they require capital to further advance commercial viability and deployment to scale,” Temasek said. “GenZero will invest in carbon-reduction and carbon-removal technologies such as low-carbon materials; carbon capture, utilisation and sequestration (CCUS); and advanced biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). “These opportunities will help deliver fundamental decarbonisation impact in sectors such as power and energy, transport and building, industry and manufacturing.” One company that GenZero has invested in is the United States-based Newlight, a manufacturer of biomaterial produced from methane as an alternative to plastics. GenZero has also made a joint investment with C-Quest Capital to fund the deployment of energy efficient cookstoves to rural households in Southeast Asia. “GenZero will also invest with third-party funds to expand its networks and collaborate with like-minded partners,” Temasek added. “It is currently working with Decarbonization Partners, a Temasek-BlackRock partnership launching a series of funds that focus on late-stage venture capital and early growth private equity decarbonisation solutions investments; and Brookfield Global Transition Fund, which aims to accelerate the global transition to a net zero carbon economy by targeting investment opportunities relating to reducing emissions and energy consumption, as well as increasing low-carbon energy capacity and supporting sustainable solutions.” Another investment focus area is nature-based solutions. These are “climate solutions such as the protection, restoration, and management of natural ecosystems to avoid, reduce, or remove carbon emissions, while empowering local communities and enhancing biodiversity,” Temasek said. “They are a crucial factor in climate action as they can provide over one-third of cost-effective climate mitigation needed to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Yet, less than 3 per cent of global climate finance is going into supporting nature-based solutions, signalling a clear mismatch between its climate mitigation potential and the investments towards that potential. “GenZero will support and scale the deployment of nature-based solutions through investments and project co-development with partners in forestry and agriculture sectors, and leverage carbon credits as a market mechanism to accelerate funding into these solutions.” The company has teamed up with the Global EverGreening Alliance to support farming communities in Kenya through land restoration and the planting of trees. It has also invested in the New Forests Tropical Asia Forest Fund 2, “which aims to develop a diversified portfolio of sustainable forest plantation assets in Southeast Asia and support the region’s transition towards responsible forestry management”. GenZero’s third area of focus is carbon ecosystem enablers. “Carbon markets can play a critical part in delivering real emissions reduction and driving climate ambition, but only when it is done right,” Temasek said. “An effective and trusted carbon market will help accelerate decarbonisation by providing a mechanism to fund decarbonisation technologies and projects; while a credible ecosystem and market will be critical to enhance transparency and confidence. “To support this, GenZero will invest in carbon ecosystem enablers including areas such as climate advisory services; carbon trading infrastructure; monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) technologies and rating providers.” One such enabler GenZero has invested in is climate solutions firm South Pole, “which develops and implements emission reduction projects and strategies for companies, governments and organisations around the world”. The company is also working with global carbon marketplace and exchange Climate Impact X, which is aiming to establish “a credible carbon trading infrastructure based in Asia”. “In addition, GenZero has made an investment in Perennial, a US-based early-stage start-up using artificial intelligence and remote sensing to accurately quantify soil organic carbon sequestration on agricultural lands,” Temasek said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/nparks-khatib-new-nature-corridor-central-catchment-reserve-new-parks-2729116,NParks to establish new nature corridor in Khatib joining up existing green spaces with new parks,"SINGAPORE: A new green corridor comprising parks, recreational trails and routes where wildlife can travel through will be established in Khatib. The future Khatib Nature Corridor will connect the Central Catchment Nature Reserve with an upcoming 40ha nature park in Khatib.  This is to enhance ecological connectivity between the two source habitats, said the National Parks Board (NParks) on Monday (Jun 6).  These plans come as the area makes way for two upcoming residential and mixed-use developments at Springleaf and Miltonia Close.  NParks said it worked with the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and the Housing and Development Board to safeguard sizeable portions of land in the two areas as Nature Parks. As such, the new nature corridor will pass through three new parks that will be established in Springleaf and Miltonia Close, as well as within the site occupied by Orchid Country Club when the club’s lease expires in 2030. These will serve as buffer and stepping-stone habitats for wildlife to move between the Central Catchment Nature Reserve and Khatib Bongsu Nature Park. The new corridor will join up 150ha of green spaces, with 80km of curated trails. It will also be connected to three recreational routes - the Round Island Route, Coast-to-Coast Northern Trail, and the Central Corridor. Speaking at the launch of URA's long-term plan review public exhibition, National Development Minister Desmond Lee said that the authorities are taking an ""ecologically sensitive approach towards masterplanning for the Springleaf area"" following input from key stakeholders. ""We are working with ecologists and landscape architects to calibrate our designs and phase developments, in order to maintain ecological resilience and minimise habitat loss.""  Besides Khatib, NParks also identified three other ecological corridors in Seletar, Kranji, and Lim Chu Kang.  However, no plans have been firmed up yet for the remaining three.  These corridors were all identified in consultation with a panel of local biodiversity experts in an ecological profiling exercise, which aimed to develop a more comprehensive picture of Singapore’s islandwide ecosystem and ecological connectivity.  The exercise involved mapping out vegetated areas across the island, and then modelling paths that animals may take to move from plot to plot. For the study, experts chose to look at six species including the Sunda pangolin that are sensitive forest dwellers but may venture out of the forest if conducive habitats are provided for them.  NParks said the ecological profiling exercise serves to guide urban planners in carrying out longer-term planning, while committing to land stewardship and sustainable development.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/hsbc-climate-risk-green-finance-sustainable-invest-climate-change-2727621,Commentary: HSBC executive’s cavalier attitude to climate change might be shared by many,"SINGAPORE: When Stuart Kirk, global head of responsible investing at HSBC, delivered a presentation titled “Why investors need not worry about climate risk” at a Financial Times conference in May, he touched a nerve in the finance industry and global arena alike. Alluding to decades spent in the finance industry, Kirk said, “There’s always some nut job telling me about the end of the world”, in front of a slide headlined “Unsubstantiated, shrill, partisan, self-serving, apocalyptic warnings are ALWAYS wrong”. The presentation sparked backlash in the global finance community, while HSBC quickly distanced itself from his statements. Chief executive Noel Quinn said Kirk’s remarks were “inconsistent with HSBC’s strategy” and “do not reflect the views of the senior leadership of HSBC”. Just three days after the speech, Kirk was suspended from his role. There are two ways to read this turn of events. One is that Kirk’s remarks were simply the provocations of an executive gone rogue. His suspension set the record straight, and financiers working hard on the green transition will carry on. After all, green finance – finance that aims to better the environment or prevent further harm to it – is in vogue. The green bond market is projected to double in size to hit US$1 trillion by the end of this year, then US$5 trillion in 2025.  Financial institutions, regulators and citizens not only see the potential of green investing, but are also spurred by scientists’ warnings that the world is on track for 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming by 2040. But the other interpretation of the Kirk saga is that he revealed unspoken truths accepted by a silent majority in the finance industry, the suspension being a cover-up to maintain the green pretences he had railed against. If this is true, we must face the chilling idea that one of the largest and most influential sectors in the global economy is fundamentally unconcerned about climate change. A key premise of Kirk’s argument is the short time horizons of financial institutions. Since the average loan length at big banks like HSBC is six years, “what happens to the planet in Year 7 is actually irrelevant to our loan book,” he said. Factually speaking, Kirk is right. But it reveals a different truth from the one he probably intended: If climate change is not a financial risk, it is because financial markets are structurally incapable of taking into account the long-term risks from climate change.  Indeed, the problem of time horizons is precisely what former Bank of England governor Mark Carney – one of the targets of Kirk’s polemic – raised in his 2015 speech, Breaking The Tragedy Of The Horizon, which is widely credited as setting the agenda for green finance today. Carney explained, “impacts of climate change will be felt beyond the traditional horizons of most actors – imposing a cost on future generations that the current generation has no direct incentive to fix.” In other words, financial valuations do not account for the risks of climate change. There is little to dissuade financial actors from investments that may be highly profitable in the short-term, such as fossil fuels which are currently booming due to high energy prices, but will lock in emissions for many decades to come.  Short time horizons are a structural feature, rather than a bug, of financial markets. Kirk’s focus on the short-term also rests on a long-term outlook of perpetual, linear growth. Here, his argument moves to a higher register. He asserts that just as the last hundred years have seen monumental economic and technological progress, so too will the next hundred years. Humans will adapt to climate change and find ways to profit from it. But fixating on long-term growth obscures the fact that the last few decades were no smooth journey of progress and development. It was interspersed with major crises - the oil shocks of the 1970s, the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic today. Kirk's belief we all profit in the long run is a Panglossian take on Keynes’ famous aphorism “in the long run, we are all dead”. It's worth remembering what Keynes wrote next: ""Economists set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is long past, the ocean is flat again.""  What this tells us is that we should not assume our long-term problems simply sort themselves out. Our long run is conditioned by what we do in the immediate present.  This is as true for climate change as it is for other urgent issues, such as inflation. To achieve net zero emissions by 2050, McKinsey estimates an additional US$3.5 trillion in climate investment is needed annually, and it will need to be front-loaded and significantly ramped up within the next decade. Enormous climate investments will be needed in the short run to reap benefits in the long run. Such a temporality is out of sync with that of financial markets. In Kirk’s confidence that humans will be able to innovate their way out of climate change, he overlooks the inequality between countries’ vulnerability to climate risks. Over half of the world’s countries most susceptible to sea level rise are in Asia, Singapore included. But unlike Singapore, not every country has large financial resources to dedicate to climate change adaptation. Less developed, food-insecure countries like Zimbabwe or Zambia face less favourable circumstances. Debt constraints imposed on them by financial institutions make it more difficult to secure the green investment needed to build resilience against climate change. Kirk’s glib remark that “Amsterdam’s been six metres underwater for ages and that’s a really nice place” doesn’t apply across the board. This brings us to the elephant in the room. Seven years from Carney's seminal speech, the sustainable finance agenda has gone mainstream, but whether it has made positive contributions is still questionable. Financing fossil fuels and other dirty assets continues on a massive scale: Despite the Paris Agreement coming into effect in 2016, fossil fuel financing from the world’s largest banks have amounted to US$4.6 trillion since.      The sustainable finance landscape also remains plagued by charges of greenwashing, where companies make misleading claims about their environmental contributions without any real change to their business models. These flaws provide the opening for Kirk's cynicism, and explain why his jibes at the hollow words of green financiers are not entirely misplaced. His presentation is a wake-up call to regulators to steer finance flows towards real decarbonisation. To do so, green finance must aim to reduce the cost of capital, increase access to liquidity and improve governance practices for green projects, as a new study by the Oxford Smith School points out. Accomplishing this will require doubling down on the tools of green finance, such as green bonds, better reporting standards and an official taxonomy to accurately classify green assets – efforts already in the works in Singapore. To this end, it is strong regulatory institutions, not the fictions of the free market, which are paramount.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/women-sustainability-fashion-trixie-chua-dear-samfu-2668261,Meet the young Singaporean bringing back grandma’s fashion style and shopping habits,"The cheongsam is fast becoming a fixture in the wardrobe of many Chinese women as more embrace their Asian heritage. In contrast, few know about the cheongsam’s more “practical cousin”, the samfu, even though we may see our grandmothers wearing it daily. “Samfu” is Cantonese for shirt and trousers. Before fast fashion gave us an endless carousel of blazers, bralets, mini skirts and maxi dresses, it was the wardrobe staple of young Chinese women from our grandmother’s generation. This two-piece outfit took them everywhere. They did household chores, visited relatives and even attended weddings in it.  It was also designed to last a lifetime. Many elderly ladies in their 80s and 90s still own and wear the same decades-old pieces today, rarely throwing out old clothes. That, to entrepreneur Trixie Chua, is the epitome of sustainable fashion.  In 2020, the 30-year-old tech marketer started her label Dear Samfu as a side hustle to bring grandma’s fashion and ethos back. She has since sold around 1,000 pieces to young women aged between 25 and 35, spearheading a mini-samfu renaissance.  Describing her collection as “permanently out of season but always in style”, she modernises the samfu, as well as other staples such as skirts and dresses inspired by grandma’s fashion sensibilities.  Her brand uses timeless florals, as well as geometric, plaid and checkered prints and plain solids fabrics leftover from larger manufacturers and mills, saving 1,600 metres of fabric from landfills. HOW GRANDMA BECAME THE MUSE Once an avid consumer of fashion trends and fads, Chua never thought her grandmother would one day be her muse. She even confessed to owning a leopard print dress that she only wore once and then sold at a flea market. “I did not have a clear style. But every week there would be a parcel arriving at the door. It came to the point where I did not know what I had anymore,” she recalled. In 2019, the series Tidying Up with Marie Kondo inspired Chua to curate her wardrobe, producing a mini mountain of unwanted clothes in her living room. It was a rude awakening.  Chua was ruminating on this when she noticed her grandmother’s radically different approach to fashion. “My grandma’s wardrobe is very small – it has only two racks with around 20 pieces. The samfus on the top rack are what she wears on a daily basis, and the ones on the bottom rack are for special occasions with details like mandarin collars or fancy fabrics,” she said.  “I like her prints. Because they are quite distinct, I began to realise she is wearing the same samfus today as she did in a photo she took with me as a baby.” Intrigued, Chua began to search for and buy a few samfus on Carousell and from friends of friends. These became reference pieces for her to sketch her own samfu collection, which she launched in May 2020. WHY BRING BACK THE SAMFU? Chua believes that the samfu can help women to build a modern-day capsule wardrobe that is more personal than the little black dress and jeans. After all, timeless doesn’t have to be bland, she reasoned. “The samfu is seasonless, but the prints and cuts also allow you to bring out your style and flair. While it usually comes as a matching set, you can also mix and match clashing prints and be very loud and proud about it,” Chua explained, recalling how a customer who bought a matching set emailed her to say that she turned a lot of heads in Chinatown.   Compared to the cheongsam, the samfu is also more practical. “When I asked my grandma why it comes with pants, she said that in the past they needed to squat down to wash clothes, and wanted something effortless and comfortable,” she said. “Samfus are also more wearable than cheongsams. Most people associate cheongsams with fancier occasions such as Chinese New Year or weddings. But the samfu can be worn and re-worn every day and can be dressed up or dressed down for different functions and occasions.” Beyond form and function, Chua’s idea is to bring Grandma’s ethos of dressing up to this generation. “Before the term ‘sustainable fashion’ even came about, our grandmothers' generation already embodied such values. After all, this was before the time of fast fashion houses,” she said. “When I talked to my grandma, I realised the whole process of shopping was very curated and personal in those days. They would select the fabric from Chinatown and then visit their regular seamstress to get something tailor-made. They only do this for special occasions such as a wedding or Chinese New Year,” she explained, adding that she hoped that Dear Samfu’s curated and personal pieces would encourage women to treasure them for longer.   THE SUSTAINABILITY OF SAMFUS To reduce resource wastage, Dear Samfu uses deadstock fabric, which are end-of-roll fabrics left behind by larger manufacturers and mills in Thailand and Cambodia, so they would not be discarded.  “When you work with deadstock fabric, you are restricted by design, material and the quantity of fabric left. Instead of a restriction, I see this as an opportunity because it means my designs are limited edition.  “Once my items sell out, I most likely won’t be able to restock. I also create my clothes in small batches of less than 100 pieces per design,” she said. Dear Samfu’s clothes are produced by a family-run factory in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Based on video calls with the owner and validation from other sustainable brands in the industry, she ensures workers are paid living wages and the factory delivers quality clothes. Reflecting on her own and her brand’s sustainability journey, Chua said: “Sustainability can sometimes feel like a competition – who composts more or throws less trash… But sustainability for me is about progress and not perfection – taking baby steps, looking for better alternatives, being a little bit more deliberate and conscious about what we are throwing out,” she said. She added that for Dear Samfu, nostalgia is its own form of sustainability. It is about reverting to the sustainable fashion model before fast fashion completely changed our consumption habits. “Nowadays, when I visit my grandma, she would tell me stories of the past. It is nice to unplug from the world, listen to her talk and think of life in a different way. She teaches me to treasure the people and things.  “From her clothes to her comb and radio, my grandma always treasures and reuses things because she came from a very humble background. To her, it is about remembering the source of things,” said Chua. “This is why I associate the samfu with prudence and humility. To me, that is sustainable fashion at its very best – cherishing what you have and wearing timeless styles you love.” CNA Women is a section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/explainer-what-are-key-climate-themes-davos-2699276,Explainer: What are the key climate themes at Davos?,"DAVOS, Switzerland: While the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's war in Ukraine will be focuses of the World Economic Forum’s gathering of business and government leaders, so too will climate change. It's captured the world’s attention in unignorable and devastating ways. The acceleration of rising temperatures, the ferocity and costliness of major weather events, and the impact, particularly on people in developing countries, have pushed the issue from one of science to something that touches every aspect of life, including (or, perhaps especially) business and economics. Of the roughly 270 panels Monday (May 23) through Thursday, one-third are about climate change or its direct effects. US climate envoy John Kerry, Ugandan climate activist Vanessa Nakate and Alok Sharma, president of last year's international climate conference COP26, are among the climate leaders expected in the Swiss resort town of Davos.  At the forum’s first in-person gathering in two years, the climate panels are as varied as the issue. They range from combating “eco-anxiety"" to helping debt-ridden countries finance a renewable transition. Here's a look at some broader themes that are likely to emerge: Several panels will wrestle with an approach to investing that considers the environment and other key factors. Known by the acronym ESG, it's become a force, with trillions of dollars invested in companies that meet certain criteria. When it comes to climate change, ESG can be important. For individual investors all the way up to firms and government agencies that analyse how companies operate, disclosures and public declarations are paramount. They can be the basis of evaluating a company’s emissions, environmental impact and financial risks tied to climate change. They are also controversial and raise questions: Should certain declarations be mandatory? Should they be standardised and regulated, and by whom? Or has the ESG movement already gone too far, ultimately hindering investment and doing little to rein in greenhouse gas emissions? Viewpoints sometimes fall along political lines. In the US, many Republicans call them ""woke"", while many on the left, particularly environmentalists and campaigners, argue that ramping up reporting and transparency could lead to real change. Many managers of some of the world’s largest mutual funds have argued ESG is essential to evaluate risk. Just last week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the approach had “been weaponised by phony social justice warriors.” The world’s top climate scientists have warned that significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions this decade is necessary to minimise warming and avoid the most devastating effects to the planet. That will require major changes in how business is done, from the way products are produced to how they are transported. Several panels will look at areas where businesses have successfully transitioned much of their energy portfolio to renewables, the role of finance and government to incentivise or mandate changes, and strategies to keep businesses accountable. Despite heightened consciousness and pledges by businesses, emissions are going up worldwide. “Moving climate debate from ambition to delivery” is a title of one panel that sums up the enormous challenge. Sessions will look at sectors, like decarbonising shipping and aviation, renewable transition plans and the challenges of achieving them in countries like China and India. There will be discussion of strategies to ensure major shifts are inclusive and consider people in historically marginalised countries, which are feeling some of the most intense effects of climate change. An important current through all the discussions will be identifying what ""net-zero"" is — and isn’t — when looking at pledges from companies and countries. Moving away from fossil fuels like coal and oil to renewables like solar and wind can reduce emissions and get a company closer to goals of taking an equal amount of emissions out of the atmosphere as it puts in. But a transition to renewables often makes up only a small part of company plans. Many rely on balancing their carbon footprint by investing in forest restoration or other projects. While better than nothing, experts note that depending on carbon offsets doesn’t represent a shift in business practices. Russia's war in Ukraine will loom large at the conference. When it comes to climate change, the conflict raises two central questions: How should countries respond to energy shocks from reducing or being cut off from Russian oil and gas? And will the war hasten the transition to renewable energies or help fossil fuel companies maintain the status quo? Since the war began, there has been no shortage of businesses, environmentalists and political leaders trying to influence the answers to those questions, which will carry over to Davos. “Energy Security and the European Green Deal” is one panel where participants are expected to argue that the way forward is away from fossil fuels. But European countries, some of which are heavily reliant on Russia for energy, also are scrambling to find other sources of natural gas and oil to meet short-term needs. While no sessions explicitly make the case for a doubling down on reliance on fossil fuels or expanding extraction or exploration, if the last few months are any guide, those points of view will certainly be present.  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/nuclear-geothermal-energy-singapore-decarbonising-power-electricity-2689846,Could the future of Singapore’s power be nuclear or geothermal?,"SINGAPORE: It is the year 2050 and Singapore has started generating nuclear power, supplying about 10 per cent of its energy needs. It comes after decades of monitoring the progress of emerging nuclear technologies overseas and building deep capabilities to assess the safety performances of these technologies. Meanwhile, the bulk of the country’s energy is now supplied by low-carbon hydrogen, replacing natural gas as its main fuel. This is one possible scenario of what a decarbonised Singapore power sector in 2050 may look like, according to a recent report commissioned by the Energy Market Authority (EMA). In the Energy 2050 Committee Report, nuclear energy - which was once assessed to be unsuitable for Singapore - was identified as a potential power source for the country, along with low-carbon alternatives such as hydrogen and geothermal energy. Nuclear energy is a form of energy released from the core of atoms - or the nucleus. It is considered a clean form of energy as it does not release greenhouse gases during the generation process. It can be produced in two ways: Fission – where atoms are split into several parts – or fusion – where atoms are combined or fused together to form a larger atom.  Today, nuclear energy harnessed around the world to produce electricity is through nuclear fission, while technology to generate electricity from fusion is at the R&D phase. During nuclear fission, a neutron collides with a uranium atom and splits it, releasing more neutrons. These extra neutrons continue to collide with other uranium atoms, which will also split and generate additional neutrons in a multiplying effect, creating a chain reaction. Each time the reaction occurs, a large amount of energy in the form of heat and radiation is released. The heat can be converted into electricity in a nuclear power plant, similarly to how heat from fossil fuels such as coal, gas and oil is used to generate electricity. According to the World Economic Forum, around 10 per cent of the world's electricity - or about 4 per cent of the global energy mix - is generated by around 450 nuclear power reactors. As of 2020, just 15 countries made up for more than 91 per cent of global nuclear power production, with the US accounting for nearly 31 per cent. There were more than 50 additional nuclear reactors under construction in 2020, and hundreds more are planned primarily in Asia. The report described two other scenarios through which Singapore could achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, taking into account uncertainties in geopolitics and the development of clean energy technologies. Dr Philip Andrews-Speed, a senior principal fellow at the Energy Studies Institute, said significant developments in nuclear technology have helped to make it safer and more reliable. This includes making reactors smaller, which can help to bring down costs, as well as reduce the impact if an accident were to occur. Studies have also shown that death rates from the production of nuclear energy are comparable to modern renewables such as solar, wind and hydropower, and remain much lower than fossil fuels. According to Our World in Data, which took into account death estimates from the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine, direct and indirect deaths from the 2011 Fukushima disaster and estimated occupational deaths, nuclear energy has a death rate of 0.07 deaths per terawatt-hour. In comparison, the death rates of brown coal and coal are around 33 and 25 per terawatt-hour respectively. However, given Singapore’s small size, even a small accident could have a devastating impact, said Dr Andrews-Speed. “In a place with lots of empty space, that’s alright. But this is why Singapore is being very cautious, and they will wait to see what happens,” he said. “Singapore will want to see how other countries deploy these different technologies, what the costs are, the management, regulation, safety, waste,” he added. “The timetable is tight and it's possible in 20 years' time that convincing results from different technologies are not suitable for Singapore, even though they may be available for lots of other places.” In Parliament last month, Minister of State for Trade and Industry Alvin Tan said new designs such as small modular reactors and Generation IV nuclear technologies have the potential to be much safer than many of the plants in operation today. This includes the ability to cool safely and passively without requiring external systems or operator actions, especially during emergencies. He added that nuclear fusion technology, which is being developed globally, also has the potential to be much safer as it does not cause chain reactions and produce long-lived radioactive waste. Besides nuclear energy, Singapore is also considering geothermal energy as a low-carbon alternative. Last year, EMA announced that exploratory studies will be carried out in the northern and eastern parts of Singapore to determine the country’s potential of harnessing geothermal energy. One of the study sites is Sembawang Hot Spring Park, where researchers from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), research platform TUM CREATE and Surbana Jurong are seeking to obtain temperature data and improve estimations of Singapore’s geothermal resource potential. A renewable energy source, geothermal energy is derived from heat within the sub-surface of the earth, which is carried to the surface via water or steam. Depending on its characteristics, geothermal energy can be used for heating and cooling, or be harnessed to generate clean electricity. If a large amount of heat can be extracted, this can be harnessed to generate clean electricity. In Singapore, a geothermal resource with temperatures of more than 140 degrees Celsius can be used to produce electricity, according to Associate Professor Alessandro Romagnoli from NTU's School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. Geothermal energy covers a significant share of electricity demand in countries like New Zealand, Kenya and the Philippines. While installed capacity has increased over the years, challenges in deploying geothermal energy such as geographical limitations as well as higher per-unit capital costs remain. As a result, geothermal energy today accounts for less than 1 per cent of globally installed renewable energy capacity. Data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) shows that geothermal energy made up just 0.5 per cent of total renewable energy capacity in 2021. In comparison, hydropower and wind accounted for around 39 per cent and 26 per cent of global installed renewable energy capacity respectively last year. Associate Professor Alessandro Romagnoli, who is leading the study, said the hot springs and high heat flow are good indicators of geothermal potential in Singapore, however the scale and depth of the resource remain unknown. Providing an update, he said some data on temperature as well as the concentration of heat-producing elements in Singapore’s granite has been collected. “We use the data to generate our in-house geological model and near-surface temperature distribution map, which aid us in identifying the sites for our deep exploratory drillings,” he said. Assoc Prof Romagnoli added that the data from the drillings will be used to verify and constrain the computer model, to aid in resource estimation and further development plans. EMA previously said that preliminary findings from the exploratory studies will be established by the end of this year. The authority has also issued a request for information on conducting a geophysical survey across Singapore. This will help to provide a more comprehensive assessment of Singapore’s geothermal potential and suitable deployment locations, said Dr Karen Lythgoe, a seismologist at Earth Observatory of Singapore. “It’ll allow us to be able to understand what exactly is the heat capacity, where and how much water is flowing, where would be the best location for geothermal power plant, and whether we would get enough energy from that,” she said, adding that a survey of this scale has not been conducted in Singapore before."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/living/shawn-siepler-clean-world-soap-recycling-2692566,"What happens to the soap left behind in hotels? This US nonprofit collects, cleans it, then gives it away","When hotel or motel guests check into their rooms, they expect at the very least to be greeted with a clean space, a made-up bed and in the bathroom, soap. But what happens when you leave that soap behind? They typically end up in the trash, said Shawn Siepler, the founder of Clean the World, a nonprofit founded in 2009 that recycles bar soap from over 8,000 hospitality partners, including Marriott International and Walt Disney Resorts, for those in need.  By collecting, melting, reforming and packaging partially used soap left behind by hotel guests, the nonprofit has distributed nearly 70 million bars of soap in more than 120 countries, including Romania, where many Ukrainian refugees have arrived. Clean the World currently focuses on repurposing bar soap in seven warehouses worldwide. Companies can enroll in the programme online and receive boxes to collect discarded products at their properties. Full boxes are shipped to the nonprofit’s warehouses. The organisation now has approximately 60 employees, but its beginning was far more humble, with Siepler and a small group of family and acquaintances scraping used soap by hand with potato peelers in a garage in Orlando. “The first time that the police came by the garage, they wanted to see what all of us Puerto Ricans were cooking. So I gave them a tour,” Siepler said during a video interview. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. BEFORE STARTING CLEAN THE WORLD, YOU TRAVELED A LOT AS A SALES EXECUTIVE. HOW DID YOUR JOB LEAD YOU TO THE NONPROFIT? I was traveling – New York on Monday, Chicago on Tuesday, St. Louis on Wednesday, Los Angeles, Thursday and back – and two clients that I personally managed were Target and Best Buy, both headquartered in Minneapolis. I was in Minneapolis in a hotel room when I came up with the concept of Clean the World. In Minneapolis, my alcohol consumption had to be increased to stay warm. So it was one of those nights that I’m like, “What happens to the soap?” and called the front desk to ask. And they said it was thrown away – they actually told me to have another cocktail. I was doing very well, but had an itch of wanting to do something on my own and thinking about sustainability and green technology as an entrepreneur. And that led to me ask, “What happens to the soap?” I was looking for items that could be recycled. THE COMPANY STARTED IN YOUR COUSIN’S SINGLE-CAR GARAGE – TELL ME WHAT THOSE EARLY DAYS WERE LIKE. I’m an original born-and-raised South Floridian, and we were collecting soap from hotels around the Orlando airport area in my cousin’s garage. We’d all sit around on upside-down pickle buckets with potato peelers, and we would scrape the outside of the bars of soap to surface clean it. My other cousin was on the meat grinder, and he would grind it down. And then we had these Kenmore cookers, and you would cook the soap. All the impurities would bubble up, and you’d wipe those off, and it would turn into this paste. Then we made big wood soap moulds, and the paste would dry the next day. We’d wire-cut the bars, take them out and put them on racks. We had to have music on – salsa and merengue. Of course, we couldn’t get the power right when the meat grinder was on, so the power would cut out every 30 minutes. HOW DID CLEAN THE WORLD BECOME THE OPERATION IT IS TODAY? We launched in the garage February 2009. We were distributing just to local charities in Orlando, and then we had an opportunity to go to Haiti in July of 2009. We take 2,000 bars of soap and go into a church that has 10,000 people in it. I remember just saying, “We’re gonna come back. We’re gonna bring more soap. I promise.” When we did that trip, our local Fox affiliate went with us and documented our work. When it ran in New York, it just so happened that Katie Couric was doing CBS Evening News and a senior producer called us in late August or September 2009 and said, “We want to do a piece on you.” That’s what forced us out of the garage and into a warehouse of a friend of ours. He gave us a little corner spot where we set up our operations. We were there from September 2009, and we started to get a lot of hotels contacting us from outside Orlando, so that’s when we started setting up a shipping process to get hotel bins shipped to us.  About three months later, the Haiti earthquake hits. We had started to move into our first facility, a 3,000-square-foot facility in Orlando, and the Haiti earthquake helped drive us into more advanced machines because the demand really took off for our programme. TELL ME ABOUT THE PROCESS OF CLEANING AND REUSING THE SOAP. We have the same type of machines that a soap manufacturer uses. When we get the soap, the first thing we do is run it through what’s called a plotter, and the end of it has a very fine filter that’s pushing all the soap through. And when the soap is coming out, the filter is catching the hair, paper and all the surface stuff. That heat and action disinfect the soap, while the guys and gals in our facility, who we call the soap whisperers, have to feel the batch itself to know if it has the right moisture level so that when it goes into manufacturing, it’s not crumbling or it’s not too wet. We send our soap on a regular basis to a third-party lab that does testing on it to ensure that it’s all coming through clean. WHAT SHOULD TRAVELERS THINK ABOUT WHEN THEY USE SOAP IN THEIR HOTEL ROOMS? If you’re staying at a hotel that does not use our programme, take the soap home with you, keep it out of a landfill, use it in your homes. Unwrapped soap can be donated to a local homeless shelter or a local charity that you support. We’d much rather get a better life for it. By Victoria M.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/masterchef-singapore-season-3-food-waste-challenge-winner-2683226,Are you guilty of food waste? Get tips on how to minimise it from this MasterChef Singapore contestant,"According to the Singapore government’s Towards Zero Waste campaign, food waste accounts for half of what households here dispose of daily, marking it out as a serious issue.  To this end, the latest episode of MasterChef Singapore Season 3, which aired on Channel 5 and MeWATCH on Sunday night (May 15), sought to raise awareness about the issue of food waste. For the first challenge, the 10 contestants had to whip up dishes which creatively used discarded food parts, all within an hour. To spice things up, the home cooks' benchtops were furnished with food scrap bins that were used to track anything they discarded. This was to ensure that, in the spirit of the challenge, contestants would only dispose of items they were absolutely unable to use. The winner of the challenge was education consultant-turned-food delivery rider Ilya Nur Fadhly, who wowed the judges with his rendition of chwee kueh. Besides safety from elimination for the week, Ilya also took home the S$3,000 prize, as well as the ability to save three of his fellow contestants from elimination. While he had initially planned to make a chwee kueh dish inspired by his mother, Ilya faced difficulty in the form of a missing key ingredient – rice flour, which forms the base of chwee kueh. He elected to adapt the recipe around the constraints he faced, adding that “the unconventional celery gazpacho is an addition to freshen and lighten up the dish since this version of the chwee kueh is denser and heavier”.  Gambling with the improvised recipe paid off for Ilya, earning him the judges’ praise. Celebrity chef Bjorn Shen, having sampled the chwee kueh, called him worthy of representing Singapore on the world stage.  Ilya himself tries to live with an environmentally conscious mindset, which he channels through his relationship with food. He added that not buying food in excess is where “innovation brings us to [use] different techniques when we utilise all our groceries”. He also pointed out how he and his family try to avoid food waste when dining out, by making sure he finishes every grain of rice or by ordering only what they can finish.  ""The evidence lies in my belly. Just look at it,"" he joked.  Here are his easy-to-follow tips on how to reduce food waste, both at home and outside the home.  Ending on a positively surprising note with no eliminations this week, MasterChef Singapore's next episode will see its Top 10 contestants taking part in the season’s first team challenge. They will also be subject to “guest appearances” from exotic wildlife in the episode, set to air on May 22. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/electricity-prices-bills-environment-solar-energy-2685141,"The Big Read: As households face soaring electricity prices, being eco-friendly can be wallet-friendly too","SINGAPORE: Whenever the sun is blazing, Mr Arun Murthy gets excited, as a mobile application on his phone would show that his house is generating more electricity than it is using. In mid-March, he installed 100 solar panels on the roof of his landed property in Bukit Timah. Since then, the family’s monthly electricity bill has dropped from about S$1,200 to about S$370. Apart from meeting some of the house's energy needs, the solar panels also generate excess electricity during the day that is sold back to Singapore’s power grid system operated by SP Group.  “Every month, we get a cheque from SP Group for selling our excess electricity, which we can use to offset our electricity bill from a private retailer … We have reduced our dependency on the grid by about 70 per cent,” said the 54-year-old chief executive officer of cybersecurity firm Invisiron.  As the family does not have a battery system to store excess electricity generated, the solar panels only fuel the house’s electricity needs when the sun is out in the day. On rainy days and at night, the home then relies on the national energy grid.  While installing the solar panels has meant lower electricity bills for the family, Mr Murthy said that the ""primary reason"" for doing so was to do his part for the environment. Installing the S$54,000 solar panels on his roof also means less reliance on natural gas — regarded as the cleanest form of fossil fuel and is used to generate 95 per cent of Singapore’s electricity supply, but whose prices have skyrocketed recently amid a global energy crunch. Singapore’s electricity tariffs for Apr 1 to Jun 30 increased from the preceding quarter by around 9.8 per cent to 27 cents per kWh, excluding Goods and Services Tax.  Earlier this month, in his May Day Rally speech, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong spoke about the soaring energy prices, which will set the country back by about S$8 billion a year, as he warned that Singapore must be prepared for more economic challenges ahead. The increase in electricity prices is due to a confluence of factors, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, Singapore’s lack of alternatives for electricity and rising demand for electricity as the world recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, experts told TODAY. And with electricity costs expected to continue rising for at least a year, Singapore’s move towards greener energy sources has become more important than ever, some of the experts added. Indeed, by reducing electricity consumption or turning to renewable energy, households now can not only do their part to save the Earth — but also go easy on their wallets.   One reason for the rising electricity tariffs for the past two years is that 95 per cent of electricity in Singapore is generated by natural gas, a byproduct of crude oil, said Associate Professor Chang Young Ho, head of the business and management minor at the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS).  Because it is a byproduct, the price of natural gas is indexed to the price of crude oil. Hence, recent spikes in oil prices have caused energy prices to similarly jump. He also noted that while the cost breakdown of generating electricity is not publicly available, industry experts have estimated that 60 to 70 per cent of the total cost is related to fuel costs.  “The recovery from COVID-19 has increased demand for oil, such as for use by industries, commercial and transport, so the price of oil increased,” said Assoc Prof Chang. “The Ukraine-Russia war affected production and supply of oil (so) it also increased oil prices … As long as the war continues, the price is expected to increase,"" he added.  Dr David Broadstock, a senior research fellow and the head of the Energy Economics Division at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Energy Studies Institute, said the decision by Europe and other countries to stop purchasing natural gas from Russia has forced them to search for new gas suppliers. “At the same time, there are limits to how much gas supply chains can scale up without major new infrastructure development, which would also take some years to provide. “This is a perfect recipe for natural price increases for natural gas, as those countries which are willing and able to pay higher prices may choose to do so to ensure a secure energy supply,” said Dr Broadstock. He also noted that China’s demand for natural gas has been consistently growing as it searches for a cleaner fuel option as compared to coal. This is especially so during the winter season, which has created long-term pressure on markets. While all these have resulted in the rise of oil and energy prices, Dr Broadstock said that key energy commodity prices have, to some extent, stabilised.  He added that the Energy Market Authority (EMA) implemented mechanisms following local power market disruptions in 2021, to help Singapore reach stable prices faster. This would take about a year, other experts including Assoc Prof Chang estimated.  On Apr 4, Second Minister for Trade and Industry Tan See Leng spoke in Parliament about these mechanisms, which include a standby liquefied natural gas facility and requirements imposed on power generation companies to “bolster existing stockpiles and provide additional layers of fuel security to cope with the short-term shocks to global gas supply”. They were introduced after ""upstream production issues in Indonesia’s West Natuna gas field and gas pressure issues from South Sumatra in the fourth quarter of 2021 caused disruptions to our piped natural gas supplies,"" said Dr Tan, who is also Manpower Minister. ""As a result, some companies had to purchase more liquefied natural gas at elevated global gas prices to make up for the drop in piped natural gas supplies."" EMA has also modified market rules, allowing the agency to direct power generation companies to use gas from its standby facility, allowing the authority to manage the cost impact on consumers.  “These measures have ensured that we have sufficient fuel and electricity supply and stabilised the uniform Singapore energy price,” said Dr Tan. However, experts said that the prices and impact on supply reinforce the need for Singapore to diversify its energy sources and improve its local production — which currently makes up just 5 per cent of the country’s energy supply. Dr Chua Yeow Hwee from the Nanyang Technological University's (NTU) economics division said: “The increase in electricity costs during the past few months is a good opportunity for the Government to accelerate the adoption of green energy.” Dr Broadstock added: “The more power that can be produced locally, the more secure and predictable energy costs will become. “However, there are limits to just how much solar energy can be deployed in Singapore. While more investment into solar will be very welcome, Singapore will inevitably need to explore additional energy resources.” Dr Broadstock referred to recommendations made by a committee commissioned by EMA on Mar 22, which include importing renewable energy from verified resources — such as wind, large-scale solar and hydropower — which are abundant in other countries.  Some households looking to cut their electricity bills without changing too much of their lifestyles can turn to generating their own electricity via solar power, which is the main renewable energy option here.  Professor Subodh Mhaisalkar, executive director of NTU’s Energy Research Institute, noted that solar panel technology has advanced over the years, reaching efficiencies of between 20 and 22 per cent. This efficiency refers to the amount of electricity generated from solar energy that falls on the panel.  “Efficiencies used to be around 15 per cent a decade ago, and we have seen a 30 per cent improvement … it definitely makes sense from both sustainability and cost perspectives,” said Prof Mhaisalkar. He noted that a barrier to getting these panels installed is the upfront cost, but solar leasing and favorable financing options have made installation a compelling value proposition. Under solar leasing, a company pays for and installs a solar system from which home owners can buy electricity from.  Solar panel installation companies told TODAY that they have seen increased interest in their services this year, with more homes looking to do their part for the environment while saving money. Mr Satish Prasath, founder and director of PMCE (Global), said his company used to receive about one enquiry a day for its residential services when it first started in December 2017, but that has increased to three queries daily this year.  The company has since outfitted 300 residential homes with solar panels. On average, households spend between S$18,000 and S$22,000, and the average home installs 30 panels. This would equate to about S$300 to S$400 saved a month, Mr Prasath estimated. “We’ve installed panels in about 50 homes (so far) this year … people are concerned about the impact of the Ukraine-Russia war so they are looking for long-term solutions,” he said. His company put up panels in about 95 homes for the whole of last year.  The panels have a warranty of 25 to 30 years, so home owners stand to profit from installing them, he added. Mr Benedict Goh, chief investment officer of UTICA, said another draw of solar panels today is the increased efficiency and return on investment.  “When we started selling goods related to solar panels in 2004, costs were much higher and the return on investment was around 10 to 15 years … people purchased to show off new technology, or because they wanted to go green,” he said. “But now, it's more efficient and costs (for the solar panels) have dropped by half of what they were in early 2010.” Mr Goh said his company has done “hundreds” of installations, and enquiries for landed properties have increased by 30 per cent in the past two to three years.  “The energy generated is often more than the household consumption, so when they sell to the grid, some of our customers even get negative utility bills each month because they’re owed money,” he said, adding it can save customers between 40 and 80 per cent of their monthly consumption bills. Mr Christophe Inglin, co-founder and managing director of Energetix, added that residents stand to get a return on investment within four to six years, although that time frame is likely to be shorter as electricity prices increase.  Energetix focuses on installing solar panels for commercial projects, with residential installations making up less than 5 per cent of its volume of sales. However, the company has also seen a spike in enquiries from home owners. While it typically received around two queries a month two years ago, the company now gets around six a week — mostly through referrals. Mr Inglin declined to share the average number of panels installed, but estimates a terrace house generates 10 to 15 kilowatt peak (kWp) a day, 15 to 25 kWp for semi-detached homes and 20 to 60 kWp for bungalows. However, while solar energy may provide future cost savings, it has its own limitations. For one, households still need to rely on electricity from natural gas as solar panels generate electricity only during the day. Dr Broadstock noted that many households’ demand for electricity increases at night — when people are back from work. And while they can combine solar power with chargeable batteries, Dr Broadstock said battery technologies can be unsafe, which makes their use in residential and high-density urban environments like Singapore “challenging”. The installation of solar panels is also subject to a building's structural limitations, be it for a landed property or an HDB flat. According to the Building Construction Authority's (BCA) handbook for solar photovoltaic systems, there are constraints whereby standard development control guidelines apply — for example, if solar panels are to be installed on the rooftop of an attic, attic guidelines would apply. Apart from possibly requiring an electrical installation licence, BCA said in its handbook that existing buildings may require a professional structural engineer to carry out an inspection of the roof structure and calculate the structural loading. ""If the roof is unable to withstand the loading of the solar photovoltaic system, structural plans will need to be submitted to BCA for approval before a building permit can be issued for commencement of installation works,"" the authority said. It also noted that the solar panels are exposed to the threat of lightning strikes and hence, require proper lightning protection. For landed properties, the existing roof’s material and the angle it is at can make it expensive, unsafe and inefficient to install solar panels. Mr Prasath said: “About 30 to 40 per cent of homes that enquire are unable to install the panels. “Some roofs have tiles that are glued directly to it, so it can become unsafe for us to clear up some tiles and place our brackets for solar panels on top. It may compromise the roof’s integrity.” He added that roofs which are at a 45-degree angle or have protruding windows would not be suitable for solar panels. For condominiums, home owners seeking to install solar panels will need to get approval from their management committees — commonly known as Management Corporation Strata Title, or MCSTs — and the authorities, and the green light is given on a case-by-case basis depending on various factors.  Both Mr Prasath and Mr Goh said that their companies have received enquiries from condominium home owners interested in installing solar panels, but faced difficulties in getting the necessary approvals. Condominium home owners interviewed said that even if they manage to get the green light from their MCSTs to install solar panels, they are unsure if authorities require additional approvals.  Approvals aside, cost savings for condominium owners are also limited because they are ineligible to sell excess electricity to the national grid. Their apartments also need to be on the top floors with roof access belonging to them, and where there is enough sunlight to generate electricity. Mr Prasath added that another obstacle is that condominiums often use submeters, which allows condominium home owners to track their individual consumption.  ""Solar panel systems require testing and commissioning by SP Group before they can be connected to the grid, which (SP Group) only does for buildings connected to master meters such as (landed homes) and private-owned industrial buildings,"" he said. SP Group did not reply to TODAY's queries.  For HDB flat home owners, their options are further limited as solar panels not only take up space, but also require direct sunlight to generate a significant amount of electricity for home usage. In 2020, an HDB resident made the news when he put up solar panels — reportedly weighing 10kg to 20kg — on top of a clothes-drying rack and an air-conditioner. HDB told the media then that said such installations outside flats are not allowed as they may affect the structural integrity of the building, and can pose a risk to the public. It also reiterated that installations outside of a flat are prohibited unless approved by the town council.  Dr Chua from NTU’s division of economics noted that households on high floors can still tap solar energy in a limited fashion, such as hanging small solar panels at their windows and using them to power their mobile phones or laptops. Smaller solar power generators are also readily available in the market. Such generators can cost anywhere from several hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars.  Mr Goh from UTICA, which sells such products, said they are commonly bought by hikers and campers looking to tap solar energy while outdoors. Some residents have also bought these generators to place in their balconies to power their mobility devices and other gadgets at home. As part of a government initiative to harness solar energy, HDB has to date installed solar panels on about 2,700 blocks and plans to reach 8,400 blocks in the next “two to three years”. In total, this will produce enough electricity to power 95,000 four-room flats. On how these panels will benefit residents, the Ministry of National Development (MND) said in a written parliamentary reply on Jan 10 that the energy generated is ""first used to power common services in HDB estates, such as lifts and lights"", and any excess solar energy will be channelled to the national grid. ""Town councils managing these HDB blocks will enter into a service agreement with the solar vendor to pay for the solar energy consumed, at a preferential rate not higher than the retail electricity tariff rate,"" MND added. ""This may help the town councils in mitigating the rising cost of energy."" For now, there remain significant limitations as to how individual households can turn to renewable energy as an alternative power source.  Nevertheless, consumers can still take matters into their own hands, in terms of reducing their electricity consumption.  For example, Ms Valerie Khoo, a 27-year-old wealth management consultant, said she does not use a fan or air-conditioner on cooler days but instead, leaves her windows open at night while she sleeps. ""With the (electricity) price increase, we've been a bit more conscious and my mom nags at us more about not using the air conditioner unless it's really too hot,"" she said.  Her family of four spends about S$120 a month on electricity for their five-room flat. Apart from ensuring they turn off the lights when not in use, they also chose a two-tick refrigerator — the highest energy rating available for her nearly 650 litre fridge when it was bought in 2018.  Apart from her parents and younger brother, Ms Khoo lives with the family's two dogs. The food for her dogs takes up half the space in the freezer, she said.    The ticks system by the National Environment Agency (NEA) rates the energy efficiency of household appliances, with five ticks being the most efficient, and one tick being the least efficient. This is displayed on the energy label, which also shows consumers the annual energy cost of the appliance. Ms Khoo said that while the family is keen to save electricity, the cost of big-ticket items has to justify the long-term savings, and be within their means, before they decide to buy a pricier appliance with a higher energy saving rating. Like some other consumers whom TODAY spoke to, Ms Khoo said her electricity-saving habits have been shaped over the years, motivated by a desire to not just reduce her electricity bill but also to reduce her carbon footprint.  Responding to TODAY's queries, NEA noted that small habits can help reduce electricity costs — for example, simply using a fan instead of an air-conditioner can save households around S$384 a year based on electricity tariffs of 26 cents per kWh.  “Based on an earlier household energy consumption survey conducted by NEA, cost-savings is the key motivating factor that households consider when deciding on the purchase of more energy-efficient appliances,” the agency said. “By using energy-efficient appliances and adopting good energy consumption habits, households will enjoy lower utility bills whilst contributing towards climate action.” To help inform consumers' purchasing decisions, NEA said they can use its online Life Cycle Cost Calculator to check yearly energy costs and compare these with upfront costs for electrical appliances.  NEA also said its ""enforcement checks"" at retail outlets have shown that there are appliances with higher ticks that are not more expensive than those with lower ticks. “With rising electricity prices, the higher cost of a more energy-efficient appliance can be quickly recouped and the owner saves even more over the appliance’s lifespan,” it said. Under the government's Climate Friendly Households Programme, one-, two- and three-room HDB households can register for S$225 worth of e-vouchers to offset the purchase price of resource-efficient appliances. For example, households may get a S$150 e-voucher for the purchase of an energy-efficient refrigerator, or a S$25 e-voucher for LED lights. Nevertheless, consumers can do more beyond opting for appliances that are more energy-efficient, experts said.  Mr Tan Tsiat Siong, lecturer at SUSS’ School of Business, said households should not just replace damaged appliances with more energy-efficient ones but do so with their older appliances as well.  Amid higher electricity prices, energy-efficient appliances can bring about long-term savings, Mr Tan reiterated.   He added that the simple actions of turning off switches when not in use, not leaving chargers on when devices are fully charged, and unplugging cords when not in use, can help reduce electricity consumption. Likewise, Prof Mhaisalkar from NTU’s Energy Research Institute said home owners can minimise energy losses through simple steps such as by ensuring their windows are sealed well when using an air conditioner or relying on natural ventilation instead.  Dr Broadstock from NUS' Energy Studies Institute suggested setting the timer on appliances such as water heaters to help eliminate unnecessary energy consumption. Households should also watch out for appliances with standby modes, which he dubs as “electricity vampires”.  “These constantly ‘suck’ a little energy from the socket even when on standby, hence the name 'vampire'. Turning these off when they are not being used will help to reduce some power consumption,"" he said. He added that when it comes to saving electricity, a ""reasonable guiding principle"" is to look for options to reduce energy consumption without reducing quality of life and even gaining ""co-benefits"" in ideal situations.  ""For example ... take an extra 15 minutes to walk around your community after dinner, reducing the energy used at home while getting health co-benefits,” said Dr Broadstock.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/rising-sea-level-climate-change-singapore-coastal-big-read-2670131,"The Big Read: Without fanfare, a 40-strong team is laying the groundwork to save Singapore from sea level rise","SINGAPORE: Many people sat up and took notice when Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong spoke at the 2019 National Day Rally about spending S$100 billion over the next 50 to 100 years to protect Singapore from rising sea levels. It was after all, a matter of ""life and death"", as Mr Lee put it. Since then, the buzz has somewhat dwindled as more pressing issues occupied Singaporeans' minds. And there was also the not insignificant matter of a pandemic which seized Singapore and the rest of the world, and very much put everything else on hold.     Quietly in the background though, efforts to lay the groundwork to protect Singapore's coastal areas have continued unabated: For now, the gigantic task of preventing parts of the island from becoming partially submerged beneath the waves — possibly by the end of the century if nothing is done — falls onto a group of public servants comprising senior assistant director Sarah Hiong, 36, senior engineer Eugene Lim, 33, and their colleagues from national water agency PUB’s coastal protection department. Not that any of them are fazed by the size of the undertaking — the urgency and significance of which, in fact, seem to be lost on some members of the public such as the team members' own friends and family. “During Chinese New Year, or even at gatherings, when I tell them (friends and family) about my job, they will be like, ‘Oh, what is sea level rise and what do you do?’” said Mr Lim.  But instead of getting disheartened by the lack of awareness, Mr Lim said their curiosity often presents him with an opportunity to educate them on the need to get Singapore ready for rising sea levels caused by global warming and melting ice sheets. Mr Lim has been with PUB for eight years. He previously held an operations-related role in another PUB department, and was assigned to the coastal protection department in 2020 when it was first formed. The coastal protection department currently has more than 40 members.  “Transiting from an operations role to a planning role was something very, very new to me … but I thought it would be very exciting to be part of a pioneer team of engineers embarking on a journey to protect Singapore from sea level rise.” Today, his team manages Singapore’s first site-specific study for the City-East Coast coastline which covers 57.8km of coastline across areas including Changi, East Coast, Marina East, Marina South as well as part of the Greater Southern Waterfront. The study was announced a year ago and is slated to complete by 2025.  Part of the job, said Mr Lim, entails understanding the characteristics unique to the area, which will then allow PUB to design suitable coastal protection measures. Although the department was formed during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr Lim said it has been making “steady progress in charting coastal protection strategies to combat rising sea levels”. According to data from the National Climate Change Secretariat, about 30 per cent of Singapore is less than 5m above sea level.  The sea levels are projected to rise by 1m by 2100. However, they could go up to 4m or 5m above today's mean sea level if factors such as daily tidal activity, storm surges and land subsidence — the sinking of land caused by tectonic movement — are taken into account, said PUB on its website. Referencing these facts, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said in March that this is “high enough to potentially flood one-third of Singapore”. PUB was appointed in April 2020 to lead and coordinate the Government’s efforts to protect Singapore’s coastlines.  In any case, Ms Fu described coastal protection in her speech in March as a “long-term endeavour”. Among those in the coastal protection department helping with this endeavour is Ms Hiong and her masterplanning and regulatory team. Ms Hiong, who has been with PUB for 13 years, said her division is responsible for reviewing Singapore’s long term-coastal protection strategies, policies and regulations that need to be put in place. “As climate science and projections are continuously evolving, we have to think about the implications of different scenarios of sea level rise on Singapore. This complicates the planning of coastal protection strategies,” said Ms Hiong, adding that coastal protection against rising sea level is a relatively new field here. Unlike Mr Lim, Ms Hiong was previously from a department dealing with climate change adaptation plans for water supply and drainage infrastructure and was already “plugged” into the Building and Construction Authority’s (BCA) Coastal Adaptation Study. “As much as (the topic of) coastal protection is familiar to me, it is also exciting to be part of a brand new function for PUB. “I think of it like a blank canvas. Today there is no coastal protection policy or master plan in place, so it is up to this team to … set the rules, so to speak,” she said. Still, Ms Hiong was quick to stress that this does not mean that the coastal protection department is working in the dark. Aside from using BCA’s study as a starting point, she said Singapore is also learning from other nations which have already begun their journey such as the United Kingdom and the world leader in coastal protection technologies, the Netherlands. She added that PUB has also set up a coastal protection panel, comprising experts here and abroad, to strengthen its knowledge and expertise in coastal engineering. “So that really mitigates the problem of us working in the dark,” she said. Among the suggestions given by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to tackle rising sea levels during his 2019 National Day Rally was one that involved reclaiming a series of islands offshore from Marina East to Changi, connecting them up with barrages and creating a reservoir, similar to Marina Reservoir. Singapore has also already put in place some measures, including the use of polders, which are tracts of land that lie below sea level and are reclaimed through the building of dykes, drainage canals and pumping stations. There is an ongoing polder project on Pulau Tekong, led by the Housing and Development Board, that is more than halfway complete and set to finish by the end of 2024. Minister for National Development Desmond Lee said last month that the project, the first of its kind for Singapore, will help the nation to gain experience in developing polders, which “could be an option for coastal protection and resilience against sea-level rise”. There are also plans to build infrastructure higher above the sea level. Professor Benjamin Horton, the director at the Earth Observatory of Singapore at the Nanyang Technological University, said that Changi Airport, for example, is building Terminal 5 at 5.5m above present sea level to protect against future rising sea levels. “We can further think about engineering advances that will enable buildings to float,” he added. PUB's coastal protection department is also looking at other possible solutions, with senior assistant director Sarah Hiong reiterating that it is “important to study all options, even long-term ones, comprehensively”. Here are some other alternatives being studied by Singapore:  SEA WALLS AND ROCK REVETMENTS Both are hard structures that protect against coastal erosion. At present, PUB says they line about 70 per cent of Singapore’s coastlines. “Building sea walls around the entire Singapore is a simple and direct but not an entirely feasible solution, because we also have to consider the interactions between the land and sea,” said senior engineer Eugene Lim from PUB's coastal protection team. For example, this could include natural coastal habitats, recreation and industries that require waterfront access. “It will also not be aesthetically pleasing for the public too. Try imagining having a great wall built around the entire coastline of Singapore,” he added. NATURE-BASED HYBRID SOLUTIONS  Mr Lim said PUB intends to explore hybrid solutions, which combine engineering solutions with nature-based elements, including the planting of mangroves, seagrasses or vegetation. A benefit of this option, said Mr Lim, is that it provides an opportunity for Singapore to create habitats to enhance biodiversity. However, it will not be possible to rely entirely on nature-based elements. Taking mangroves as an example, Associate Professor Koh Tieh Yong, a weather and climate scientist from the School of Science and Technology at Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS), said that when sea level rises, the higher seawater will still infiltrate mangrove lands. “During a storm, mangrove tree roots serve to break up the waves and hold down the earth, thus reducing coastal erosion. In this way, mangroves can protect areas further inland until the sea rises beyond a level where even mangroves cannot thrive.” Thus, there will still be a need to pair it with man-made structures like sea walls as the main solution to sea level rise, he said. Another downside is that most of Singapore’s coastal land is needed for residences, industries, maritime port, airport or recreational beaches and so cannot be replaced by mangroves. MULTIFUNCTIONAL COASTAL DEFENCES  Due to Singapore’s land scarcity, multifunctional structures such as Marina Barrage, would be an ideal solution, said Mr Lim. The barrage not only provides a source of water supply, it acts as flood control and even a venue for recreation — a “hot spot for families” to have picnics, fly kites and spend quality time together, he said. One overseas example that protects against sea level rise which Ms Hiong highlighted is the Katwijk underground parking garage in the Netherlands, where much of the country is below sea level. Designed by the Royal institute of Dutch Architects, it was the winner of the Best Dutch Building of the Year in 2016. Situated beside a popular beach, the project is a car park that is not only able to house 650 cars, but also plays a critical role as a dyke to protect the small, eponymous town against future floods. What is interesting about the project, said Ms Hiong, is that “you can't even tell that it's actually a coastal protection measure” because it is concealed within a sand dune so that it blends in with the beachfront. “So this is an example that really inspired us… to build something that not only has such an important use for the nation, but also something that the public will actually come to enjoy,” she said. One of the coastal protection department’s first tasks was to conduct studies on how to protect specific segments of the coastline along City-East Coast. The site was identified due to the potential impact a flood event would have on critical assets such as the airport and economic and industrial districts within the area, as well as opportunities to dovetail with upcoming developments. Mr Lim said part of the site studies involves examining the existing conditions of the coastline, as well as working with other government agencies to find out what their future land-use plans for the area are. He added that the first tranche of the study, which began in May last year, was completed in December. Aside from completing literature reviews of existing coastal protection measures used both locally and internationally, he said it highlighted the need to integrate the “multifunctionality within our coastal defences” for land-scarce Singapore, as well as the importance of stakeholder engagement. A vertical sea wall in the south of Singapore. According to data from the National Climate Change Secretariat, about 30 per cent of Singapore is less than 5m above sea level. Another concept that the team learned from other countries and their expert panel is “adaptive planning”, said Ms Hiong. “What this approach entails is that we first implement coastal protection measures, such as sea walls, such that they are sufficient to safeguard Singapore against near to mid-term sea level rise while keeping long-term protection options open,” she said. Sea level rise is then monitored closely, with plans reviewed regularly. “Should sea level rise faster than projected, we will activate the next round of construction to raise the coastal protection measures higher, ensuring that our coastal areas remain adequately protected,” said Ms Hiong. Additionally, the first stage of the study had also identified “data gaps” in biodiversity information. “A big part of our consideration when developing measures is of course, their potential impact to the environment. So, we have commissioned a study to find out more on this,” Mr Lim said. PUB said there are different nature elements to consider, such as seagrass meadows and intertidal marine life in Changi, turtle nesting grounds at East Coast beach, mangroves at Berlayer Creek, as well as nature areas and coral reefs at Labrador Park. Moving forward, Mr Lim said his team is in the process of identifying flood-risk areas and collecting site data to support the next stage of the study, which involves the planning and design of coastal protection measures along the City-East Coast coastline. Similar studies for the North-West Coast coastline have recently started, and another for Jurong Island — led by site developer JTC Corporation — will commence this year. PUB said it hopes to complete formulating coastal protection plans for these three areas by 2030. Once that is done, Mr Lim said implementation of the measures will start. As for the other coastlines in Singapore, he said that the respective site-specific studies “will be rolled out progressively”. PUB said earlier this year that the study for the North-West Coast coastline will be split into two separate studies. The first study is a 24-km stretch from Tuas Checkpoint to Lim Chu Kang jetty that consists mainly dams and dykes that make up the Murai, Poyan, Sarimbun and Tengeh coastal reservoirs. The second is a 15-km stretch that includes Sungei Kadut and Lim Chu Kang, which not only hold key assets such as Kranji Reservoir and the Woodlands Checkpoint, but are also home to nature areas as well as industries such as timber and waste management. Beyond these site-specific studies, Ms Hiong said PUB had also embarked on the development of a Coastal-Inland Flood model in April last year, which will help assess the impact of climate change on Singapore’s coastal and low-lying areas. “With the model, we can simulate the combined effects of both inland flood, which is caused by heavy rain, and coastal flood risks, caused by rising sea levels,” she said. This means that in theory, it would be possible to see how extensive the damage caused by rising sea levels would be if there are no coastal protection measures in place. While no deadline for when the purpose-built model will be completed, Ms Hiong said it will be continually updated with the “latest climate data to help us evaluate the effectiveness of proposed coastal protection infrastructure”. Given that Singapore is one of the most densely populated and urbanised countries in the world, Mr Lim pointed out that ""this means that we can expect damage to be more extensive, like disruption to lives, damage to infrastructure, if we are inundated”. And due to Singapore’s “very limited land”, there is a need to be creative and find coastal protection solutions that optimise land use or serve multiple uses in order to balance coastal resilience with other land needs. While it is useful to learn and adapt what other countries or cities have done, Mr Lim said there is a need to understand why these measures work, and “critically review if they will be equally effective when implemented in Singapore, as our conditions are different”. Ms Hiong also said that the coastal protection department does not work in isolation, as a large part of the work involves engaging different stakeholders such as other government agencies, nature groups, businesses or even residents. “We are also learning along the way…and taking one step at a time. So we can’t say, ‘Oh we’re two years old, so we already have a plan for the whole country’. We’re taking it slowly, studying each site carefully while learning the best practices (from other countries).” Be that as it may, Ms Hiong said there are still segments of society who think that rising sea levels is a “future problem”, and with almost eight decades to go till the next century, it may be deemed too far down the road for them to be concerned with now. But because planning for coastal protection and the construction of the physical coastal protection structures take time, it has to start now. Ms Hiong added that “beyond developing Singapore's coastal protection strategies, there is also a need to educate and engage the public” to increase awareness and understanding of the topic and what is at stake. One way PUB has gone about this task is through a three-part edutainment series about coastal protection, “The Investigations of Sea-rius Li”, featuring local actor Alaric Tay. The series, in which Ms Hiong also makes an appearance, was launched on PUB’s website and social media channels in February. As global warming continues its relentless march, rising sea levels are not a distant threat, scientists told TODAY. As it is, global sea level has been rising in the 20th and 21st centuries at an “unmatched rate” for at least the last 3,000 years, said Professor Benjamin Horton, the director at the Earth Observatory of Singapore at the Nanyang Technological University. Prof Horton, whose research concerns sea-level change, said since 1900, the sea level has risen by 20cm and the “waters are only rising faster”. He said the average rate of sea level rise has increased from 1mm per year between 1901 and 1971, to 4mm per year between 2006 and 2018. While this might seem like a miniscule amount, its impact has already been felt by some of Singapore’s neighbours, such as Indonesia where its capital Jakarta is sinking at a rate of 10cm a year due to a confluence of rising sea levels, land subsidence and rapid development. The Indonesian government has since made a decision to shift its capital from the megacity, which has already sunk by at least 2.5m in 10 years according to a 2020 article by CNA, to Nusantara on the east coast of Borneo Island near Balikpapan. Elsewhere in the central Pacific Ocean, the status of the low-lying atoll nation Marshall Islands as a country is similarly being threatened by rising waters. A report by the World Bank last year said that projected sea level rise would mean 40 per cent of the buildings in the Marshall Islands’ capital of Majuro would be permanently flooded and entire islands would disappear. Said Prof Horton: “We know that rising sea levels affect every coastal nation. But in the coming decades, the greatest effects will be felt in the Asia region, due to the number of people living in the continent’s low-lying coastal areas.” He said eight Asian countries — China, Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Japan — are likely to be most adversely affected. “Together, these eight nations account for roughly 70 per cent of the 340 million people on land facing flooding from sea-level rise by the middle of the 21st century,” he said. Associate Professor Koh Tieh Yong, a weather and climate scientist from the School of Science and Technology at Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS), also warned of other consequences of sea level rise which could have a knock-on effect on Singapore. Regions such as the Mekong Delta in Vietnam could experience higher risk of coastal flooding during a storm, not only because they are low-lying but also because the societies there are more vulnerable. “When it is not flooding, the intrusion of seawater into underground aquifers causes the soil to become more saline in the Mekong Delta. This threatens rice production in Vietnam, which is the third-largest supplier of rice to Singapore in 2020,” said Assoc Prof Koh.  Prof Horton added: “Here’s a depressing fact: Sea-level rise through to 2050 is fixed. “No matter how quickly nations lower emissions now, the world is looking at about 15 to 30cm of sea-level rise through the middle of the century, given the long-drawn impact of global warming on the oceans and ice sheets.” Assoc Prof Koh said that even if the world achieves net carbon neutrality right now, many generations of humanity will still have to live with climate change. This is because enough greenhouse gases have been emitted into the atmosphere that global warming — and hence, sea level rise — will continue for the next few hundred years. “The train has left the station, so to speak, even if it is an electric train,” he said. As such, Prof Horton said that adaptation to sea-level rise should be a long-term obligation. Despite the somewhat bleak outlook, both Mr Lim and Ms Hiong see similarities between the coastal protection department’s current objective and Singapore’s other long-standing existential issue — ensuring an adequate water supply. “Singapore is one of the most water-stressed countries in the world, but through a combination of grit and ingenuity, we have managed to develop a robust and diversified water supply with the four National Taps strategy,” said Mr Lim. In essence, the strategy involves sourcing water from local catchment areas, importing it from Malaysia, reusing it and desalinating it from the sea. “Today, Singapore is recognised as a model city for its successful water management,” said Mr Lim. While rising sea levels are indeed a multi-faceted and complex challenge, he shared that the department is optimistic that PUB will, in the same way, turn this vulnerability into an opportunity. Ms Hiong said she is hopeful that this will transform Singapore’s coastlines into “vibrant and beautiful spaces in time to come”. “We are committed to using this opportunity to remake Singapore’s coastline, through integrating coastal protection plans with other agencies’ plans and through extensive stakeholders’ engagement to hear what they want to see in these coastal areas,” said Ms Hiong. PUB said it intends to engage with the public, though details have yet to be announced. “As a citizen, I am looking forward to enjoying these coastal areas myself in the future,” said Ms Hiong.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sustainability/brazil-amazon-deforestation-april-record-2669061,"Brazil's Amazon deforestation hits April record, nearly double previous peak","SAO PAULO : Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon surged to record levels for the month of April, nearly doubling the area of forest removed in that month last year - the previous April record - preliminary government data showed on Friday, alarming environmental campaigners. In the first 29 days of April, deforestation in the region totaled 1,012.5 sq km, according to data from national space research agency Inpe. The agency, which has compiled the monthly DETER-B data series since 2015/2016, will report data for the final day of April next week. April is the third monthly record this year, after new highs were also observed in January and February. Destruction of the Brazilian Amazon in the first four months of the year also hit a record for the period of 1,954 sq km, an increase of 69 per cent compared to the same period of 2021 – clearing an area more than double the size of New York City. Deforestation in the Amazon has soared since right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro took office in 2019 and weakened environmental protection. Bolsonaro argues that more farming and mining in the Amazon will reduce poverty in the region. ""The cause of this record has a first and last name: Jair Messias Bolsonaro,"" said Marcio Astrini, head of Brazilian advocacy group Climate Observatory, in a statement. Bolsonaro's office and the Environment Ministry did not immediately respond to request for comment. Even with deforestation already on the rise, Climate Observatory said its analysts were astounded by such a high reading in April, which is part of the rainy season when the muddy forest is harder for loggers to access. Preservation of the Amazon is vital to stopping catastrophic climate change because of the vast amount of climate-warming carbon dioxide it absorbs. Ane Alencar, science director of the Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM), said she had expected deforestation to keep rising ahead of the October presidential election, like it has in Brazil's past three election years, as officials wary of angering voters generally do less to enforce the law. Still, she called the surge in deforestation last month ""absurd"". ""It seems that the clearing of forests has become institutionalized in the country as something common, with record after record,"" Alencar said.    "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sustainability/upl-indian-agrochemicals-manufacturer-toxic-pesticides-south-african-sea-2658151,Indian agrochemicals manufacturer applies to flush toxic pesticides into South African sea,"JOHANNESBURG: Indian agrochemicals manufacturer UPL has applied for permission to flush water contaminated by a toxic pesticides spill in South Africa's city of Durban directly into the sea or the sewerage system, the company said on Saturday (Apr 30). The municipal authorities have judged the pesticides - which were being contained in a dam that overflowed during devastating floods that struck the eastern port city earlier this month - as being ""highly toxic to the environment"". Looters set fire to a UPL warehouse containing the pesticides during a wave of looting and arson in July last year. That caused a chemical spill which shut down beaches, released severe air pollution and killed marine wildlife. Sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen cyanide were among the chemicals released into the dam. UPL told Reuters in an emailed statement that the ""toxicity testing of April 11 showed extremely low levels of marine toxicity, capable of being completely neutralised"" by dilution. The municipality of eThekwini, which includes Durban, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. UPL ""has discussed with authorities disposal by various methods (including) to sewer and or sea outfall via the municipal sewer system,"" a company representative said, adding that ""the entire proposal is based on the general acceptance by both the authorities and UPL that it is nonsensical"" to truck 5224 cubic metres of contaminated water to landfills. Environmental scientists are increasingly concerned about the contamination of the oceans by industrial chemicals, including pesticides, fertilisers, detergents and petroleum products."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/china-promotes-coal-setback-efforts-cut-emissions-2643916,China promotes coal in setback for efforts to cut emissions,"BEIJING: China is promoting coal-fired power as the ruling Communist Party tries to revive a sluggish economy, prompting warnings Beijing is setting back efforts to cut climate-changing carbon emissions from the biggest global source. Official plans call for boosting coal production capacity by 300 million tons this year, according to news reports. That is equal to 7 per cent of last year’s output of 4.1 billion tons, which was an increase of 5.7 per cent over 2020. China is one of the biggest investors in wind and solar, but jittery leaders called for more coal-fired power after economic growth plunged last year and shortages caused blackouts and factory shutdowns. Russia’s attack on Ukraine added to anxiety that foreign oil and coal supplies might be disrupted. “This mentality of ensuring energy security has become dominant, trumping carbon neutrality,” said Li Shuo, a senior global policy adviser for Greenpeace. “We are moving into a relatively unfavorable time period for climate action in China.” Officials face political pressure to ensure stability as President Xi Jinping prepares to try to break with tradition and award himself a third five-year term as ruling party leader in the autumn. Coal is important for “energy security,” Cabinet officials said at an Apr 20 meeting that approved plans to expand production capacity, according to Caixin, a business news magazine. The ruling party also is building power plants to inject money into the economy and revive growth that sank to 4 per cent over a year earlier in the final quarter of 2021, down from the full year's 8.1 per cent expansion. Governments have pledged to try to limit warming of the atmosphere to 2 degrees Celsius above the level of pre-industrial times. Leaders say what they really want is a limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius. Scientists say even if the world hits the 2-degree goal in the 2015 Paris climate pact and the 2021 Glasgow follow-up agreement, that still will lead to higher seas, stronger storms, extinctions of plants and animals and more people dying from heat, smog and infectious diseases. China is the top producer and consumer of coal. Global trends hinge on what Beijing does. The Communist Party has rejected binding emissions commitments, citing its economic development needs. Beijing has avoided joining governments that promised to phase out use of coal-fired power. In a 2020 speech to the United Nations, Xi said carbon emissions will peak by 2030, but he announced no target for the amount. Xi said China aims for carbon neutrality, or removing as much from the atmosphere by planting trees and other tactics as is emitted by industry and households, by 2060. China accounts for 26.1 per cent of global emissions, more than double the US share of 12.8 per cent, according to the World Resources Institute. Rhodium Group, a research firm, says China emits more than all developed economies combined. Per person, China’s 1.4 billion people on average emit the equivalent of 8.4 tons of carbon dioxide annually, according to WRI. That is less than half the US average of 17.7 tons but more than the European Union’s 7.5 tons. China has abundant supplies of coal and produced more than 90 per cent of the 4.4 billion tons it burned last year. More than half of its oil and gas is imported and leaders see that as a strategic risk. China’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2060 appears to be on track, but using more coal “could jeopardise this, or at least slow it down and make it more costly"", Clare Perry of the Environmental Investigations Agency said in an email. Promoting coal will make emissions “much higher than they need to be” by the 2030 peak year, said Perry. “This move runs entirely counter to the science,” she said. Beijing has spent tens of billions of dollars on building solar and wind farms to reduce reliance on imported oil and gas and clean up its smog-choked cities. China accounted for about half of global investment in wind and solar in 2020. Still, coal is expected to supply 60 per cent of its power in the near future. Beijing is cutting millions of jobs to shrink its bloated, state-owned coal mining industry, but output and consumption still are rising. Authorities say they are shrinking carbon emissions per unit of economic output. The government reported a reduction of 3.8 per cent last year, better than 2020′s 1 per cent but down from a 5.1 per cent cut in 2017. Last year’s total energy use increased 5.2 per cent over 2020 after a revival of global demand for Chinese exports propelled a manufacturing boom, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Stimulus spending also might raise carbon output if it pays for building more bridges, train stations and other public works. That would encourage carbon-intensive steel and cement production. China’s coal-fired power plants operate at about half their capacity on average, but building more creates jobs and economic activity, said Greenpeace’s Li. He said even if the power isn’t needed now, local leaders face pressure to make them pay for themselves. “That locks China into a more high-carbon path,” Li said. “It’s very difficult to fix.”"

Shinji Aoyama, Honda's global head of electrification, told Reuters on Thursday (Apr 21) the firm will introduce an electric mini commercial vehicle in Japan in 2024, built on a new small EV platform. This will be followed by full-size electric model in North America in 2026, on a new large platform. Both platforms will be used for other models. Speaking in a video call, Aoyama said a third platform, which he described as ""medium size"", will be shared with General Motors, starting in 2027. The two companies in early April said they would jointly develop ""affordable electric vehicles"" for global markets, but released few other details. ""Whether they will be based on Honda's architecture or on GM's platform has not been decided,"" Aoyama said. ""We have not decided which plants (or) what will be produced,"" he added. ""But we are going to share the bill of process"" for manufacturing ""to enable the cars to be produced at either"" Honda or GM plants. GM is building two premium electric SUVs for Honda in North America, starting in 2024, based on the dedicated EV platform that underpins GM's Cadillac Lyriq. Aoyama said Honda has agreed to use GM's next-generation Ultium battery, though the specifications have not been finalized. But the Japanese automaker has no plans to participate in GM's Ultium battery joint venture with South Korea's LG Energy Solution, he said. Honda has said it plans to build two million electric vehicles globally by 2030, including the mid-size models being developed with GM. Aoyoma said Honda is targeting North American production of 750,000-800,000 electric vehicles in 2030, and about the same in China, with another 400,000-500,000 in Japan and other markets.    "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/e-waste-bins-old-electronics-phone-dispose-recycle-repair-2636221,"Commentary: E-waste bins now a common sight, but can we be counted on to use them properly?","SINGAPORE: While heading to work, I spotted an electronic waste bin tucked in a corner. How convenient, I thought, that I could recycle e-waste on my way to the office instead of trekking to a drop-off point somewhere else. Amassing broken earbuds, fraying USB cables and old phone chargers at home, I vowed to recycle them when I went to the office again.  But when that time came, I found the bin filled with tissue wads and random bits of rubbish. It was a massive face-palm moment. How could anyone miss the giant “E-WASTE” sticker? It’s something worth dwelling on this Earth Day. Singapore businesses and government agencies alike are going big on recycling, with e-waste identified as a priority waste stream. It has never been easier to recycle our e-waste. Singapore has deployed more than 500 e-waste recycling bins in public places like town centres, shopping malls and community centres. The National Environment Agency also launched the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme in July 2021, which requires producers to manage the collection and treatment of electronics sold to Singapore consumers. For instance, retailers have to provide in-store e-waste collection points and offer to take back unwanted household appliances upon the delivery of a new one. Recycling e-waste is one step towards the circular economy – taking junk we don’t want and salvaging its valuable parts for making new products, with less need for extracting fresh resources from the environment. Laptops can be scrapped for copper, while circuit boards can be melted down to recover precious metals like gold. But does making e-waste recycling too easy enable mindless consumption? If we could magic our e-waste away without seeing the costs and labour that go into treating them safely, would we confront the staggering amount of e-waste that we make in the first place?   Singapore generates 60,000 tonnes of e-waste annually, which adds up to about 70 mobile phones per person. Around 3,500 tonnes of consumer e-waste have been collected under the EPR scheme so far. A 2019 study by NTU students found that only one in 10 young Singaporeans recycles e-waste. One-third of them do it wrongly by throwing it into general recycling bins. And of what does end up in an e-waste bin, about 30 per cent isn’t regulated e-waste. Anything outside ICT equipment, light bulbs and batteries shouldn’t be put in the bin. Misplaced junk could end up at Singapore’s Semakau landfill, which is due to run out of space by 2035. Proper recycling is crucial to slash the volume of waste that gets incinerated and disposed there.  Incinerated e-waste also has its hazards. Heavy metals and mercury can seep into our soil and pollute water. They contaminate ash at the landfill, so it cannot be reused for construction materials in the future. Besides recycling, repairing electronics is the other solution to reducing e-waste. After all, many of us don't part so easily with our unwanted gadgets – the NTU survey found that 64 per cent of respondents hoard their old mobile phones and laptops. But getting electronics repaired today is a tall order, with brands making their products easily outdated and less durable. Through a combination of planned obsolescence and sleek marketing, consumers are nudged towards replacing their devices once they show signs of age and buying entirely new accessories to go along with them. Consider how Apple’s new iPhones no longer come with headphone jacks or USB-C chargers. While the tech giant says that it’s a sustainable move to avoid giving customers new add-ons, more cynical observers see it as a cash grab where customers can only use AirPods and Lightning cables instead of generic accessories which they might already own. Because the problem of e-waste is embedded in our relentlessly consumerist culture, recycling isn’t a silver bullet. For one, recycling e-waste is high-effort but low-yield. At e-waste processing facilities, much manual labour is needed to sort and dismantle electronics, but one tonne of e-waste might only contain 200g of gold. The ubiquity of e-waste drop-off points could make us victims of convenience. Once we dump it, it’s out of sight and out of mind, and we won't grasp how much e-waste we make and how challenging it is to process it. This point is pertinent given the broader context of Singapore’s recycling statistics. In 2021, Singapore recycled 55 per cent of overall waste, a rate higher than 52 per cent in 2020, but lower than 59 per cent in 2019. Households recycled 13 per cent of waste, a figure unchanged from last year and lower than the 22 per cent in 2018. It’s striking that these figures remain stubbornly low despite so many policies, national initiatives and campaigns.  Moreover, we produced 18 per cent more waste in 2021 as economic activities resumed, making the issue of cutting down the waste which we generate in the first place, rather than just recycling it, more pressing. When it comes to cutting down on e-waste, the most obvious solution is to resist buying new gadgets we don’t need.  But that’s rich to say when e-commerce platforms push ad after ad about monthly sale bonanzas. Or when nobody will repair your decades-old television and refrigerator – or at a price so exorbitant that you might as well buy a new one. Singapore’s efforts to get producers to take charge of their customers' e-waste are a step in the right direction. Brands too are cluing in. In March, HP launched a subscription programme for printer ink cartridges in Singapore, which allows customers to return used cartridges for recycling while cutting printing costs by half. This is a win-win situation because new printer ink cartridges can be so expensive that buying a brand new, cheap printer would be more cost-effective. Seeing the business case in salvaging e-waste, Apple said in 2016 that it was developing a robot, named Liam, to recycle its products. While it’s unclear how much Liam has recycled since, the US government is funding research into robots that can identify different smartphones, remove batteries and harvest valuable parts. With the wide variation of electronics out there, it might be a tall order to expect artificial intelligence sophisticated enough to take apart every product ever designed. This is why moves to standardise certain parts – like the European Union’s plans to mandate USB-C charging ports for device makers – are sorely needed across the industry.  But these solutions are in their early days. And while some of us are counting on trash robots to power our circular economy, perhaps we can do the bare minimum: Read the labels on an e-waste bin properly and avoid putting stuff in there that doesn’t belong.

While she is aware of the pollution caused by petrol cars, she does not intend to switch to an electric vehicle. Like Mdm Tan, many Singapore residents are generally aware of climate change and more sustainable alternatives to their day-to-day goods. National awareness campaigns and revamped policies, such as raising the carbon tax and the Singapore Green Plan, have brought the issue of climate change to the fore. But in August last year, an inaugural Climate Index research found that while Singapore residents had a high awareness of environmental issues across the four lifestyle themes of transport, home, food and goods, this was not reflected in terms of their adoption of green practices. The survey, which gathered responses from 2,000 Singapore residents, was launched by OCBC Bank in partnership with Eco-Business, an independent media and business intelligence company. On a 10-point scale, the respondents scored an average of 8.3 in awareness, but only 6.5 in adoption and 5.6 in advocacy. For example, the survey showed that while 81 per cent of respondents are aware of the time taken for a plastic bag to degrade, only 22 per cent of people are shopping with reusable bags every time. Most of the respondents cited cost and inconvenience as the top two reasons that stopped them from adopting green practices, while 24 per cent said either the status quo was sufficient or that they did not care about the issue. There is a long stream of research that proves the disconnect between attitudes and intentions versus behaviours, explained Professor Sharon Ng, head of the marketing division at Nanyang Business School.  She has authored academic papers on the impact of globalisation on sustainable consumption and the role of personal responsibility when it comes to environmentally friendly products. Prof Ng said she was not surprised by the survey's findings. She added: “The minute you put in trade-offs, financial resources or … time ... The minute this comes to the computation, we no longer hold on to the strong belief that yes, you need to do it for the good of the world. ""Doing it for the good of the world doesn't cost you anything. (When) there is some cost, the computation changes. “And that’s what I mean. This attitude and behaviour don’t necessarily correlate very strongly.” When there is a trade-off to be made, cost is a big factor when people make decisions, said Prof Ng. Referencing one of her research publications, she shared how there was a gap between consumers’ desire to support sustainability efforts and their willingness to pay for environmentally friendly products. “We did a study where we actually asked people to indicate how much they will support sustainability behaviour. Usually you get quite a high percentage, 70 per cent, 80 per cent, on average. Everybody thinks they should support sustainability behaviour,” she said. But when the respondents were given products to choose from, researchers saw a drop in the percentage of people who were willing to buy a green product that was marked up by 5 per cent to 10 per cent. There is also the issue of time and effort. The survey identified cost and inconvenience as the top two reasons for not adopting green practices. The survey’s respondents exhibited a dissonance between intent and action. While 95 per cent of drivers who responded were aware that travelling by car generates 12 times more CO2 emissions than travelling by train, about 78 per cent of them still drive for more than 30 minutes daily. The survey also showed that while about 90 per cent of respondents were aware of the carbon impact of different fuel categories, 74 per cent of them still owned diesel or petrol vehicles, which have a much higher carbon footprint than hybrid or electric options. People also value their time over sustainability efforts, and money over recycling, said Prof Ng. Mdm Tan related strongly to these two factors. “On areas that involve cost-savings, I would say that I have good (eco-friendly) habits, like saving electricity and water … But I don’t think I can adopt (further) practices as it will require too much change to my current lifestyle,” she said. Connecting a person’s day-to-day encounters and climate change may be key, said Mr Ho Xiang Tian, the co-founder of environmental group LepakInSG. In the past two years, new work modes amid the COVID-19 pandemic saw many employees working from home, eliminating their daily commute. The commute typically exposes them to the elements, allowing them to take notice of climate changes. “This February has been very wet, which is quite strange. I don’t think people connect this to climate change,” said Mr Ho. The Met Service found 2021 to be Singapore’s second wettest year since 1980. One consequence of climate change is increased rainfall, which can lead to floods like those in Sydney recently that swamped whole cities. But in Singapore, most floods are flash floods that subside quickly with little danger. Mr Ho gave another example of how Singapore deals with dry spells, compared to other countries. “In previous years, when we had dry spells in February, people also don’t really connect that to climate change. They just think ‘oh the weather is strange’,” said Mr Ho. While parts of Malaysia had to do water rationing during a dry spell in 2014, Singapore did not have to. Technology investments, such as NEWater and desalinated water, saw Singapore through some of its driest periods in early 2014. “People don’t connect this dry spell with ‘I need to save water'. It's just, ‘oh got dry spell, I don’t know, the grass outside looks like it’s going to die’. But that’s it,” he said. “I would say, people have no reason to change their lifestyles and habits. Because of their awareness of climate change – to them, it’s something that’s happening somewhere else, it’s not happening to me now,” he added. Ms Sarah Lin, a climate action activist, said her “awakening” was sparked by a photograph of cutlery, plates and cups in large green dustbins at the back of hawker centres. “It was filled to the brim with disposable plates, foam plates, cups, and everything else. It just hit me … this is probably like half a day's worth,” she said. “Imagine it accumulating to become a day's worth, and a month’s worth … that really shocked me.” Connecting that image to the waste she saw every day working in the events industry made her recognise that her actions have an environmental impact. Since that realisation, Ms Lin has transitioned quickly from awareness to adoption and then to advocacy. She has been volunteering with LepakInSG to manage and organise events around environmental action and awareness. “Until people are willing to make the trade-off, any sustainability initiative the authorities come up with will be met with limited success. As a society, we cannot rely on punishment as the only solution to get people to be more sustainable,” said Prof Ng. “A successful sustainability culture needs to be cultivated and this requires mindset changes and a deep belief that such trade-offs are worth it.” Education might be the key, particularly for children in their formative years. Mr Ho started his environmental journey from a young age. “When I was in kindergarten, I got this set of children's books from NEA (National Environment Agency). It’s about this character called Captain Green. He and his friends go around, learning about the three Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle),” Mr Ho said. “And they basically learn, if you litter everywhere, and you don’t recycle, then the whole of Singapore will be filled with trash. That shocked my five, six-year-old self.” He started asking friends and family to be more environmentally friendly. “Cultivate sustainability practices from young. Do not make it an option but make it something that is ingrained in our regular behaviour – equivalent to brushing our teeth or washing our things every day. Make it a habit,” said Prof Ng. Mr Ho agreed. “When (you) are six years old, you don’t care about cost and inconvenience, right? You just think this is something we should do,” he said. This mindset change is “not that far” away, Prof Ng said. “Once we get more people involved, once the younger generations come out and become consumers, then we’re going to see more of these things happening,” she added. “Right now, the Gen Zs are definitely way more sustainable in their thinking. But they are not the major consumers yet.” Former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in 2015 that this generation was the “first generation that can end poverty and the last that can end climate change”. But more than half a decade later, climate activists and scientists are saying that current adaptations to climate change would not be enough to save our planet. The Sixth Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said that unless excessive global warming is reined in by the mid-century, Southeast Asia will experience a range of worsening conditions and disasters. These include heat waves, intense rain events, powerful tropical cyclones and coastal cities inundated by rising sea levels. “We cannot wait 20 years for the next generation to learn. In the long term, yes, education is important,” said Mr Ho. How can people make a difference now? Measures, such as government support and extended producer responsibility, can help remove cost and inconvenience from consumers’ considerations when it comes to taking environmentally friendly actions, said Ms Lin. ""Being an active citizen, and actively voicing out your stand on these things, not only individual matters like ‘I want to bring a bag’, but also, ‘I want to see companies shifting away from plastic bags and charging for them’ for example,” she added. “I think using that voice and actively engaging businesses, governments, your MPs are some of the ways that society can be more involved in sort of shifting that change. “It is a long process, I would say, but it has also seen … more accelerated change in recent years.” Those interviewed said that it is important to reframe sustainability conversations so as to make climate change more relatable. Prof Ng said: “(Studies) have shown that if we highlight the impact of (climate change) on your community, it makes it a little bit more concrete. “So you can visualise if this happened, this is what is going to happen to my life, or this is what is going to happen to my local community. That makes it a little bit more tangible. “It is not this abstract ideal that we’re fighting for. It is a more tangible thing that I know is going to affect me.” Agreeing, Mr Ho said that people need “more visual reminders of climate change”. He suggested installing sensors at Housing Board blocks. While residents are waiting for lifts, these sensors tell them the current temperature and rainfall levels, as well as the historical temperature and rainfall trends. This way, residents can understand how these trends have changed. “I feel that environmental issues are quite intersectional to social issues. Not everyone would be concerned about the environment – there are some people who are just in that camp,” said Ms Lin. “It's about how we reach out to them in different aspects. So maybe it's connecting to social issues. “For example, we see more and more homeless people being exposed to the extreme elements. We are quite sheltered, so we get to hide from the rain and the sun, and on the aircon, but they don't. So, I guess it's the way we frame things.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/indonesia-only-tropical-glacier-puncak-jaya-melting-2631916,Frozen no more: Indonesia’s only tropical glacier could melt away as soon as 2025,"JAKARTA: Primary school students in Indonesia are taught that the country has something significant, a tropical glacier in Papua’s Jayawijaya mountains which is the only one in the region.  Located at Jaya summit or Puncak Jaya in the Indonesian language, some people call it the Eternity Glacier. However, in a few years, teachers may not be able to tell their students about this geographical trivia. After existing for about 5,000 years, the days of the glacier are numbered as research shows that it is melting and there is only a little left of it. “The year when the glacier would be gone is between 2025 to 2027,” Mr Donaldi Permana, a climate research and development coordinator with the country’s meteorological, climatological and geophysical agency (BMKG) told CNA. He has studied the glacier extensively since 2009. Global warming is believed to be the main reason for the melting of the glacier.  Mr Permana said this has been happening since the industrial revolution in 1850 when developed countries shifted from agrarian economies to one which is dominated by industries releasing greenhouse gas emissions causing warmer temperatures. “But we only knew after the 1990s, that the (Indonesian) glacier is melting,” he said.   Jayawijaya mountain is situated in Lorentz National Park, at an elevation of 4,884m above sea level. It is the highest mountain in Indonesia and some people also refer to it as Carstensz Pyramid, since the mountain has several peaks with different names, said Mr Permana. Other tropical glaciers in South America and Africa are also melting, Mr Permana noted. However, as the elevation of Puncak Jaya is lower as compared to the other mountains with tropical glaciers, the one in Indonesia will disappear sooner. Head of BMKG Dwikorita Karnawati also told the parliament at the end of last month that the glacier could be gone in 2025. Earlier studies have measured the area of the glacier, said Mr Permana. Based on the soil maturity and vegetation distribution patterns around the glacier, it was concluded that the glacier area was about 19 sq km in 1850, he said. Satellite imagery later showed that the glacier area was down to only 2 sq km in 2002. By 2018, the size was only 0.46 sq km. Last year, it was 0.27 sq km. This means that the melting has accelerated over time. To learn more about the glacier, Mr Permana and his colleagues extracted ice cores from it in 2010 by drilling 32m down to the bedrock. The ice cores were then taken to be examined.  The team also installed polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes to measure how much of the glacier is melting by looking at its thickness.  In 2015, they found that the pipe was exposed by 5m. “This means 1m of depth was gone per year,” Mr Permana noted. They also noted that in 2016 when El Nino caused drier and warmer weather over Indonesia, the melting accelerated. “From 2015 to 2016, in just one year, we lost 5m of depth,” he added.  He said that from 2016 to 2021, a further 12.5m of depth has been lost. “Based on those figures, we can conclude that there is an acceleration (of melting),” he said. This was expected because when the glacier melts, the area around it becomes bigger, absorbing more solar radiation, added Mr Permana.   Glaciers are important because they are an indicator of the Earth’s climate and how it changes. Their melting is also a clear indicator of global warming. From the ice cores that were extracted by Mr Permana and his colleagues, they recorded deposits of tritium, which is indicative of nuclear tests the Soviet Union and China conducted back in the 1960s. “The tests created tritium. This composition is recorded in all glaciers in the world,” said Mr Permana.  In general, when glaciers melt, they also contribute to the rise of sea level, he added.  “Maybe this (Indonesian) glacier’s contribution is not so significant because the initial area is not so big compared to the ones in South America or Greenland … But the animals and trees around the Papua area could be impacted by the melting, although unfortunately there is no study on this yet.” Mr Permana also revealed that there is an indigenous tribe living around the area who worships the glacier. However, there has so far been no known study about this group and how they may be affected if the glacier disappears.  Besides Mr Permana, another researcher who has also examined the glacier is Mr Yohanes Kaize.  He is the chief scientist of PT Freeport Indonesia, a gold and copper mining company. Its Grasberg mine, which holds one of the largest reserves of copper and gold in the world, is just a few kilometres away from Puncak Jaya.  On days when the weather is clear, the glacier is visible from Grasberg, Mr Kaize said. He has visited the glacier several times in the last seven years to examine air and water quality in the area as well as the rainfall. Mr Kaize also monitors the glacier from the air and takes pictures of it. “The glacier area has diminished significantly. It is very sad,” said Mr Kaize.  “Previously, there were also smaller glaciers there but they are gone now.”  The melting ice will flow into the tributaries and lake near the summit and would probably impact the river there, he said. Eventually, this could affect the Arafura sea between northern Australia and the south coast of New Guinea, he posited. But he believes that the impact may not be that significant.  “The (water) volume of the rivers or lake would probably increase but probably not so much,” he said.   He also noted that there are a few tribes living nearby, although he is unsure which one worships the glacier. Nevertheless, as a native Papuan himself, Mr Kaize stated: “We Papuans believe that nature and people are interconnected. That is why we also call it Mother Earth. “So they probably have local tales about the glacier. If the glacier is gone, the tale would be gone too.” He predicted that all glaciers will disappear in Puncak Jaya by 2030. “As a Papuan myself, the only glacier in the Oceania region, the only one in Indonesia, I can say we are proud of this. But when it is gone, our pride will also diminish,” he told CNA.  “So, now we have to save the Earth together. Even simple things like planting trees and not littering matter. Hopefully, we can still admire the glacier until the very end.” Read this story in Bahasa Indonesia."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/advertorial/building-green-data-centre-future-2583306,Building the green data centre of the future,"Data centres have been a popular topic of discussion lately, especially with the growth of the digital economy and the renewed focus on digital transformation across practically every industry. Not only are data centres enabling innovation across a variety of sectors and driving business growth, they are also creating digital opportunity for our communities. Local benefits from data centres include enabling digital access and growing job opportunities as businesses expand into new markets. Singapore is a prime data centre hub in Asia; Equinix alone powers more than 855 organisations' digital transformation with its sustainable data centers and digital services. According to a report from Frost & Sullivan, the regional data centre colocation services market is expected to expand at an estimated compound annual growth rate of 16.4 per cent between 2019 and 2026. This expansion is driven by rising investments in emerging technologies such as blockchain, the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence, as well as greater focus on cybersecurity and data privacy, growing reliance on hyperscale cloud service providers and overall higher Internet penetration in the Asia-Pacific region. However, the increasing demand for data centre services, coupled with Singapore’s tropical weather, makes it more difficult to operate these services sustainably. Data centres currently use an estimated 7 per cent of Singapore’s electricity, up to an estimated 40 per cent of which goes towards cooling systems that maintain an operationally critical temperature-controlled environment. In Singapore, power is primarily generated via natural gas – a non-renewable energy source. To minimise impact on the climate, data centre providers need to develop economically viable solutions that are aligned with local sustainability planning agendas. With its Future First sustainability strategy, global digital infrastructure company Equinix is primed to further the goals set forth in Singapore’s Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 (RIE2025), Smart Nation, and Green Plan 2030 frameworks. SUPPORTING GREEN PLAN 2030 
To support the Singapore Green Plan 2030, Equinix has embarked on several sustainability initiatives in Singapore, encompassing community development and environmental projects. It has also outlined a series of discussion topics for review with the Economic Development Board to build sustainability into design and construction and enhance transparency in reporting. In addition, Equinix is partnering Singapore Management University to develop a business scholarship for sustainability. Equinix has already deployed about S$1 million to fund these initiatives, with an additional S$1 million earmarked. Equinix participates in local initiatives linked to sustainability and renewable projects, such as investigating alternative power sources and efficient energy storage. This supports the RIE2025 goal of seeking out innovative solutions and designs for sustainability while still driving economic growth. Data centre providers in Singapore must address the quandary posed by hot weather and continue to evolve their approaches to raising the efficiency of their sites. “Running multiple servers and storage equipment generates heat that the cooling infrastructure needs to remove,” said Ms Yee May Leong, managing director, Equinix South Asia. “To do so, the latter also needs energy – and given Singapore’s humid, tropical climate, Equinix is focused on implementing the most efficient cooling systems and operational excellence best practices to minimise the use of energy for the cooling required.” In Singapore, Equinix’s data centres rely on innovative technologies that improve energy efficiency, generate green power and manage airflow. For example, at the newly launched SG5 data centre located at Tanjong Kling, innovative design means that hot and cold airflows are separated, so that machines are cooled more efficiently and the data centre’s energy consumption is reduced. 
“Our fifth data centre in Singapore, SG5, leverages Equinix’s bespoke and novel surface cooling technology, known as the Equinix Cooling Array, to support high-density customers while reducing water and power consumption needs,” explained Ms Leong. “Combined with connection to Singapore’s recycled NEWater, SG5 is well positioned to support customer requirements from higher densities to meet their environmental and sustainability needs.” Singapore targets to achieve 80 per cent of its buildings certified with Building and Construction Authority and Infocomm Media Development Authority (BCA-IMDA) Green Mark status by 2030, and Equinix is ahead of the game. Its earlier data centres have all received the SS 564 certification for Green Data Centres. SG1 IBX is Green Mark-certified, while SG2 and SG3 facilities are certified to Platinum status; and SG4 is certified to GoldPLUS status. SG5 recently received the BCA Green Mark Award Platinum and is on track to achieve Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification. Singapore is also prioritising clean energy across all sectors. Equinix has a robust history supporting the transition to renewable energy and has a long-term goal of relying on 100 per cent renewable energy for its global portfolio. Currently, Equinix sites in Singapore are covered by 100 per cent renewables and its worldwide operations achieve over 90 per cent renewable energy coverage, putting it on a clear path to being entirely climate-neutral by 2030 – the first digital infrastructure company to set this goal globally. Equinix is also looking to increase its engagement with local and regional renewable energy developers to increase the quality, locality, and additionality of its renewable energy purchases. INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIPS TO DRIVE INNOVATION Equinix works with industry partners to develop and trial innovative solutions that will shape the future of data centres and services, as well as assist its users with making headway on their carbon footprint reduction goals. Locally, Equinix is a member of the Cooling Energy Science and Technology Singapore (CoolestSG) Consortium. Elsewhere, the Equinix Co-Innovation Facility (CIF) in Washington, D.C. is an incubator for new technologies and processes such as liquid cooling, high-density cooling, intelligent power management and on-site prime power generation. “The expected impact of these sustainability partnerships on the broader digital ecosystem is sizable, and Equinix's many and diverse customers are expected to benefit from the greening of their digital supply chains. The CIF is one example of how Equinix is committed to helping reduce customers’ emissions and driving data centre innovation,” said Ms Jennifer Ruch, sustainability director, Equinix. In another collaboration, Equinix is part of the Clean Hydrogen Partnership, which is working to identify a path to clean hydrogen-enabled fuel cells. Even before hydrogen, these generators are 20 to 40 per cent more environmentally friendly than standard generators.  This partnership is also looking at the deployment of more capable lithium-ion battery solutions and the overall project has the potential to slash carbon emissions of data centre operations by up to 100 per cent. From the start, Equinix data centres are designed with high operational standards and energy efficiency in mind. Best-in-class technologies are customised for each data centre depending on the specific area’s climate and accessibility to renewable energy sources. Underpinning these local initiatives is a holistic Future First sustainability strategy to drive progress within Equinix and the broader industry. 
Equinix has been recognised with a host of sustainability awards across the Asia-Pacific region. Last year, the company received the China Light & Power Smart Award in the Energy Saving Performance category in Hong Kong and W.Media Southeast Asia Awards for Sustainable Design & Build for its SG5 data centre. It was also named Asia’s Green Company of the Year at the Asia Corporate Excellence & Sustainability (ACES) Awards, and the Singapore Data Centre Services Company of the Year by Frost & Sullivan. Equinix’s Asia-Pacific president Jeremy Deutsch was also named one of Asia’s Most Inspiring Executives by ACES. “As the world’s digital infrastructure leader, Equinix is responsible for harnessing the power of technology to create a more accessible, equitable and sustainable future,” said Ms Leong. “We continue to drive our sustainability efforts to bring the world together on our platform to create innovations that will enrich our work, life and planet.” Find out more about Equinix’s green data centres of the future."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/less-polluting-harbour-craft-port-dues-waived-maritime-sustainability-2611816,Less-polluting harbour craft to have Singapore port dues waived for five years: Iswaran,"SINGAPORE: Singapore will waive port dues for new low- and zero-carbon-fuelled harbour craft for five years from the date of their registration as part of the country's efforts to push for a more sustainable maritime sector. In addition, concessions on port dues - currently available to vessels powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG) - will be extended to include vessels using low-carbon and zero-carbon fuels, announced Minister for Transport S Iswaran on Wednesday (Apr 6).  Concessions will also be extended to vessels that exceed the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) energy efficiency design index (EEDI) Phase 3 requirements by 10 per cent or more, he added. Speaking at the second IMO-Singapore Future of Shipping Conference, the Transport Minister said that the Singapore Registry of Ships is ""committed to reducing emissions"". Mr Iswaran noted that the registry's green notation was introduced last year to recognise Singapore-registered ships that exceed the IMO’s EEDI Phase 3 requirements by 10 per cent or more, as well as ships that adopt engines that use low- or zero-carbon fuels. The Green Ship Programme - which provides incentives to vessels which reduce their emissions - will be aligned with these requirements to offer such ships rebates on their registration fee and annual tonnage tax. Mr Iswaran, who is also Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations, also pointed to other efforts made by Singapore to reduce emissions from the maritime sector, such as last year's launch of the Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation. ""The centre is developing, trialling and shaping the standards needed to deploy low- and zero-carbon fuels and solutions,"" he said.  He added that the country had co-sponsored the industry's proposal at the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee to establish an International Maritime Research and Development Board, financed through mandatory contributions of US$2 per tonne of marine fuel consumed. ""This would create urgently needed funds to make low- and zero-carbon solutions commercially viable, while supporting capacity building for developing countries’ climate action,"" he said.  ""Singapore supports global (market-based measures) that incentivise the transition to greener shipping, while addressing the disproportionate impact on States, especially developing countries,"" said Mr Iswaran, pointing to the country's support of a global carbon levy on international shipping. ""This will provide international shipping companies with greater certainty, as well as clear price signals. Most importantly, a unified, global scheme will remove the regulatory costs and complexity of unilateral regulations imposed by countries or regions,"" he added. Mr Iswaran also announced the launch of the NextGEN (Green and Efficient Navigation) Connect initiative, which invites different stakeholders to propose solutions for inclusive maritime decarbonisation. The call for proposals will be open to the industry, academia and global research centres, he said, noting he hoped to see proposals to trial action plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions along specific routes in the Asia Pacific region, in an ""equitable and inclusive manner"". ""Successful proposals, once proven in trials, could then be implemented on a wider scale along other routes,"" he said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/women-sustainability-powder-shampoo-haircare-lynn-tan-beaute-nature-2585791,She's making shampoo more sustainable by eliminating the most useless ingredient in it – water,"Did you know that 80 per cent of our regular shampoo is made of water? This water however does not enhance the formula in any way. On the contrary, it dilutes the product so consumers need a larger quantity for a single wash. “The thing is, when you shampoo, you still need to wet your hair to lather the product. So why do we need to add water to the shampoo formula in the first place?” said Lynn Tan, founder of The Powder Shampoo. “Also, why are we transporting gallons and gallons of liquid shampoo around the world? The water makes it heavier than it needs to be. And because of the liquid, brands usually use single-use plastic to store the product. It is all so unnecessary.” Her solution is so logical, it is a wonder no big brands have picked up on it sooner. To reduce single-use plastic and the carbon footprint of transporting products – simply subtract water from the formula. This April, Tan will launch four variants of this powder shampoo. Don’t confuse these for dry shampoo, which you sprinkle on your scalp to absorb excess oil. Tan has designed her product to be applied directly to wet hair for the full lathering shampoo experience. THE POWDER REVOLUTION Beauty insiders will know Tan. The 43-year-old runs a distribution business BBN International, which specialises in botanical brands such as Phyto, Lierac and Trilogy. In early 2021 however, as she was watching Netflix documentaries on sustainability, she felt increasingly shaken and saddened, and began asking questions about the beauty industry – especially the need for single-use plastic bottles in personal care products. “Only 9 per cent of plastic is recycled; 12 per cent is incinerated, which releases toxic fumes into the air. The rest is living among us.  “This plastic harms our ecosystem, birds, animals and sea creatures. It also becomes microplastic, goes in the air we breathe and the water we drink, and affects our lungs, brain, nervous system and reproductive system. A lot of reports show that plastic is poisoning us,” she said. “This led me to wonder if there will be a beautiful earth left for my children, my grandchildren and everyone’s grandchildren if we keep going like this,” added the mother-of-three. It also dawned upon Tan that she has been part of the problem. “As a business owner, you want to sell as much as you can, as often as you can, to as many people as you can. However, the more I sell, the more I contribute to this plastic plague,” she reflected. “While a lot of us are trying to be eco-friendly, it is so hard because we have very limited sustainable options. You can shampoo less, pick products that use recycled plastic packaging (but these can only be recycled once), or use shampoo bars.” While shampoo bars were a good option, Tan did not enjoy the experience. She wanted a sustainable product that was “easy to use, lathers nicely and smells amazing”. Tan decided to go to the drawing board to create her own product from scratch. And so The Powder Shampoo was born. WHY SWITCH TO POWDER? Tan’s product is not the first powder shampoo. Over the past couple of years, a handful of cult brands from the US, UK and New Zealand have launched similar products.  Most consumers, however, aren’t even aware of them. And Tan’s goal is to create more awareness and more options. “This should be a new movement and new category because you would reduce so much single-use plastic just by switching to powder,” she said. Tan also stressed that powder shampoos are longer lasting, reduce overconsumption and are more cost effective as compared to liquid shampoos. “You only need 0.5g to wash short hair, 1g to wash shoulder length hair, and 1.5g to 2g to wash thick long hair. Our 100g bottle can last for 100 washes, which means you only need to buy a new bottle in three to six months,” she said. She added: “In comparison, a 100ml bottle of liquid shampoo only lasts for 10 washes on average. Most liquid shampoos are 250ml to 500ml and only last for one to two months.” The Powder Shampoo’s water-free formulas are easy to use, gentle on your scalp and hair, and leave it feeling soft and bouncy after each wash.  A self-confessed aromatherapy junkie, Tan incorporated micro-encapsulated essential oils such as bergamot, grapefruit, tea tree and mint into the products. These double as a natural preservative, giving the paraben-free products a shelf life of two years after opening. She also uses a biodegradable coconut-based ingredient as a sulphate-free surfactant to thoroughly cleanse the scalp.   Tan has taken pains to ensure her shampoos are free of common controversial ingredients. These include: Parabens and phthalates, which Tan believes harms the body; silicone, which may clog pores and harm marine creatures when it goes into the water stream; sulphates, retinol, artificial fragrances and mineral oils, which may irritate sensitive skin. The products are vegan and cruelty-free. “There is no need to use animal byproducts when we have so many options in the plant world. And there is certainly no need to test products on non-consenting animals when there are so many people willing to volunteer to try the product,” stressed Tan, who tested her products on 100 friends and colleagues from Singapore, Canada, Europe, the Philippines and China, to ensure that they suit different climates, hair types and types of water – including hard water. Packaging was another big concern for the eco-entrepreneur. She chose aluminium because it is durable, light and can be infinitely recycled, unlike plastic, which can only be recycled once.  To reduce the production of aluminium bottles, Tan also offers 100g refill packs of the shampoo, which are packaged in 100 per cent paper; all products are available on the brand’s online store. FEEL GOOD BEAUTY Having said that, one cannot help but wonder why powder shampoo as a haircare category hasn’t taken off sooner? Tan has a theory. She believes it goes against the grain of how businesses usually run. “As a big brand, if you create a culture of people buying shampoo every month, why would you suddenly create a product where people buy from you every quarter or only twice a year?” she asked. Nonetheless, the straight-shooting businesswoman is not afraid to speak out against liquid shampoos even though it remains one of the key products she currently distributes. “Why hasn’t haircare evolved? Why are we still making shampoos the same way as we have in the 50s?” she asked. Will speaking out alienate the brands she distributes? “It may,” she mused. “Then maybe (the big brands) want to do something about it? My dream is not to be the only one selling powder shampoo, but for everyone to sell it because it makes the most sense. I hope this will create a ripple effect across the globe.” Another cool bonus for consumers, The Powder Shampoo works with non-profit organisation Tree-Nation. So each time you purchase a bottle, you will get an email notifying you that a tree has been planted in your name in Tanzania, Eastern Africa. Tan spent her childhood playing at her mother’s plant nursery in Malaysia and is a huge tree lover. “My dream is to plant a million trees by 2030, or in this lifetime. This is my beacon and will be my legacy. It’s important to choose a beacon that you feel deeply for, so you can look towards it when times are tough and you feel lost,” she said. After this launch, Tan will be introducing head-to-toe washes in the third quarter of this year and powder conditioners in the last quarter. “I spent the first 20 years of my career as an advocate for scalp care, hair care and plant-based products, but I contributed to the plastic problem. I feel everything has come full circle and I will spend the next 20 years trying to address this problem (with powder shampoos),” she said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/advertorial/iplant-manager-keeping-buildings-smart-while-driving-sustainability-2557906,iPlant Manager: Keeping buildings smart while driving sustainability,"In our hot and humid environment, air-conditioning technology is essential for health, productivity and equipment maintenance. In a world faced with climate change, however, the need for more environmentally friendly and sustainable cooling technologies is becoming dire. That is why Daikin is committed to developing cost- and energy-efficient solutions that are easy to maintain and operate. Its next-generation chiller plant optimisation solution, iPlant Manager, is designed to ensure that the chiller plant room’s air-conditioning equipment performs at its best throughout its operating cycle consistently. Incorporating advanced technologies such as performance feedback loop operating logic and machine learning capabilities, iPlant Manager enables real-time comparisons of the plant room’s actual operating efficiency versus the most ideal operating conditions. This allows iPlant Manager to obtain maximum energy savings from chiller plant systems. Utilising advanced data analytics, iPlant Manager can also quickly detect faults, subpar performance and system degeneration for quick remedial action, ensuring that the system operates optimally at all times. A SINGLE SYNERGISTIC SYSTEM Upon installation, iPlant Manager – which is easily configurable – connects to a building’s chiller plant equipment and begins to churn out complete measurements of the plant room’s key components. These measurements can be accessed both locally and remotely via a user-friendly interface for the benefit of maintenance crew, facility owners and other stakeholders. A continuous performance feedback loop powered by intelligent self-learning algorithms then begins. These algorithms calculate the real-time operating efficiencies of each chiller plant equipment and compares them against the achievable ideal operating efficiencies. Based on the performance profile of each chiller plant unit, iPlant Manager performs adjustments and determines the best unit sequence to be activated automatically, resulting in immediate energy and cost savings. Daikin’s iPlant Manager can be operated as a standalone system or be natively integrated into a new or existing building management system interface via the Niagara Framework automation platform. A GREENER, MORE SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION Green buildings have gone far beyond merely planting more greenery in the vicinity. These days, buildings are aiming for net-zero status – meaning that they produce enough power to match their own consumption. One way to do so is to optimise their existing cooling systems to ensure maximum efficiency and savings on energy consumption. By 2030, the Singapore Green Building Masterplan aims to green 80 per cent of buildings here, relying on the building energy performance data published by the Building Construction Authority (BCA) to provide benchmarks and best practices. As part of this effort, BCA in December last year raised the minimum energy performance requirements for new buildings  as well as existing buildings that are undergoing a major retrofit. Building owners that are targeting to achieve BCA’s Green Mark and Super Low Energy certification will benefit from iPlant Manager’s energy savings of up to 40 per cent, while still ensuring the physical comfort of occupants. Thanks to iPlant Manager’s improvement of chiller plant room efficiency, building owners can expect utilities, operating and maintenance costs to be pared to a minimum over time as well. When it comes to driving sustainability and ensuring cool comfort at the same time, Daikin, with its energy-efficient, tech-enhanced solutions, is your partner. Learn more about Daikin’s iPlant Manager and how it can cool your buildings in a greener way."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/ema-energy-2050-report-net-zero-hydrogen-nuclear-import-solar-2592816,Commentary: Is Singapore banking too much on emerging tech in reaching net zero by 2050?,"SINGAPORE: Singapore’s net-zero transition will depend on emerging technologies, which won’t come without unknowns. This week, the Energy Market Authority (EMA) released the Energy 2050 Committee Report, setting out strategies to help the power generation sector get to net zero by or around 2050. The headline message was that it is “technically viable for the Singapore power sector to achieve net-zero emissions while maintaining energy security and affordability”. Although not an official policy document, it is reasonable to assume that the report offers a robust indication of the priorities and pathways which Singapore will pursue. Technology plays a central role, as there is considerable commitment to a mix of emerging technologies, which we can loosely classify as being a mix of “hard” and “soft” solutions.  Hard technologies include hydrogen, geothermal energy, carbon capture and nuclear power, while soft technologies include wider use of digital technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced modelling.  The important roles of regional and international power and carbon trading are also highlighted. Such market structures have an impact on how clean energy solutions can develop. The report outlines three transition scenarios for Singapore: The “clean energy renaissance”, the “climate action bloc” and the “emergent technology trailblazer”. Each projects a varying energy mix by 2050, depending on geopolitical and technological developments. Central to each scenario is the fostering and deploying of new technologies and increasing the diversity of energy supply to help enhance Singapore’s energy security. Each scenario makes room for increased electricity imports and growth of the hydrogen economy, while two include a commitment to nuclear energy. There is a lengthy discussion around the adoption of smart power grids, which could help optimise infrastructure design and energy use. Overall, the report presents a very different energy landscape than what we have today, where 95 per cent of Singapore’s energy comes from natural gas, a fossil fuel. The question naturally arises as to whether the transition strategies discussed in the report are banking too heavily on emerging technology, to get to net zero by or around 2050. The Energy 2050 Report has been developed with caution in mind. It classifies three critical uncertainties that could make the transition hard, even impossible, to achieve by 2050. These help us understand why Singapore’s timeline for achieving net-zero emissions has progressed from “as soon as viable in the second half of the century” to “by or around mid-century”, reflecting a clear desire to target 2050 while still providing some flexibility. The first critical uncertainty concerns the hard technologies – referred to in the report as low-carbon energy technologies. Across the scenarios, hydrogen – an energy source created by splitting water with an electrical current – contributes anywhere from 10 per cent to 60 per cent of the power supply. While there is considerable promise in hydrogen for power generation, as of today, global supply chains for it are unclear and prices have not stabilised. Hydrogen is still a nascent technology, and the costs of production are currently too high to be commercially attractive. But there is strong momentum in hydrogen production technologies, making now a ripe time to commit. According to the International Energy Agency, the cost of producing hydrogen from renewable electricity could fall by 30 per cent by 2030, as renewables become cheaper and hydrogen production scales up. The report notes that “it is not certain when and where low-carbon hydrogen will be produced at scale efficiently and how it can be transported to Singapore in a secure and cost-effective manner”. It even recognises that in the early stages, it may be necessary for hydrogen to be produced from fossil fuels to ensure affordability. This may at first seem undesirable, since the cleanest version of hydrogen would use renewable energy in the production process rather than fossil fuels. The compromise would however allow for early investment into necessary hydrogen-related infrastructure. Other low-carbon energy sources are discussed too, also having unclear timing for market readiness. Geothermal energy – energy generated from naturally occurring heat trapped in the ground – is one such alternative source. Precisely what the potential within Singapore is, is unclear. Singapore has a very modest landmass to draw upon. The EMA has initiated an exploratory study into the geothermal potential for Singapore, and results are expected to emerge by the end of 2022. Geothermal energy, similar to solar energy, may have an important role, but will not deliver the scale of energy to meet national needs. Nuclear power is the other major low-carbon alternative presented as a possible option within some of the scenarios.  In addition to uncertainties around emerging nuclear technologies, there are potentially complex regulatory and regional integration issues that may need navigating. The second critical uncertainty concerns the readiness of digital technologies. Large quantities of data need to be captured, monitored, and carefully analysed for the distribution of energy resources and effective uses of smart energy grids. Data centres are enabling infrastructure where necessary data is stored and analysed. But the industry has been subject to a moratorium in recent years due to its high energy requirements, with the Government signalling it will be selective about building new data centres in the future. The third critical uncertainty surrounds regional and international coordination for power and carbon markets. For many years, there have been discussions of an ASEAN power grid.  Such a grid could allow for more options for low-carbon power generation: Our neighbours with more potential for renewable energy could produce green electricity to export to Singapore.  But this is not happening at a large scale yet, since countries within the region still need to decarbonise their power systems, creating a lot of pressure to keep domestically produced clean electricity in the country where it is generated. Sun Cable’s Australia-Asia PowerLink, an undersea cable that will transport solar energy from Darwin to Singapore via Indonesia, is an example where wider international grid connectivity could be feasible. The project could supply up to 15 per cent of Singapore’s electricity needs. What is also unclear is how international carbon markets may operate. Currently, there are no universal rules that define what is tradeable, where and how. There are efforts to develop agreed global principles, but they will take time to develop. Developments in global carbon market designs will influence the design and effectiveness of local carbon pricing mechanisms. Net zero in the power sector will not be achieved without a comprehensive approach. While there are aspects of the transition that can be solved by investment, some obstacles cannot be overcome with money alone. Efforts have been underway within Singapore and elsewhere to promote behavioural change and reduce demand for the energy we use. There have been some successes and some failures. Singapore still heavily relies on natural gas for power generation, offering both opportunities and challenges. The opportunity lies in upgrading infrastructure that can work with new fuels such as hydrogen. The challenge is that this infrastructure development will take time. We have roughly 30 years, and that should be more than enough. Carbon capture, geothermal and nuclear are relatively mature, while hydrogen is fast becoming commercially viable. The next few years are a useful window of time to develop the necessary infrastructure, which will then be ready for use when costs become much more attractive. There are uncertainties with the emerging technologies Singapore is banking on to decarbonise its energy sector, but these are openly recognised. This does not mean we will be able to alleviate them, but at least we face them with eyes wide open. At the same time, reaching net zero with the limited time we have necessitates bold changes in technology, modes of business and lifestyles. Ambition in the presence of uncertainty is a prerequisite to being on the right pathway.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/renewed-infrastructure-agreement-between-singapore-us-expanded-include-green-projects-2593946,"Renewed infrastructure agreement between Singapore, US expanded to include green projects","WASHINGTON: Singapore and the United States on Tuesday (Mar 29) renewed an agreement to deepen cooperation in infrastructure development, while expanding the deal to include green projects in the region. The memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed by Ministry of Trade and Industry's (MTI) permanent secretary Gabriel Lim and Mr Scott Nathan, chief executive officer of the United States International Development Finance Corporation (DFC). The signing took place on the sidelines of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's working visit to the US, which began on Mar 26 and will end on Apr 2.
First signed in 2019, the MOU aimed to strengthen collaboration between the infrastructure agencies of both countries so as to promote infrastructure trade and investment. Besides expanding the collaboration to cover green and sustainable infrastructure projects in the region, the new MOU will also explore new approaches to mobilise private sector participation. ""Both countries will also strengthen collaboration through information sharing, deal facilitation, capability building initiatives, and by supporting potential infrastructure projects in the region, in expanded areas of mutual interest,"" said MTI, citing renewable energy and carbon capture as examples of these new areas. ""Singapore and US companies can look forward to more infrastructure development and financing opportunities to unlock Asia's potential,"" it added."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/electric-vehicle-ev-charging-points-hdb-carparks-lta-tender-deployment-2593181,"LTA launching tender for deployment of 12,000 EV charging points across HDB carparks","SINGAPORE: The Land Transport Authority (LTA) will launch a tender next month for the deployment of 12,000 charging points across nearly 2,000 HDB carparks, it was announced on Tuesday (Mar 29). In a media factsheet, LTA said the “large-scale” tender will be launched in April and is a “key milestone” in its plan to ramp up electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure. This move, together with a pick-up in demand, will help meet the goal for every HDB town to be EV-ready by 2025, it added. The Government targets to deploy 60,000 EV charging points across Singapore by 2030, of which 40,000 will be in public carparks and the other 20,000 in private premises. Next month's tender for the 12,000 points will comprise up to 10 packages. Each is sized to cover approximately the same number of carparks, and is valid for 10 years, said LTA. Awarded tenderers will need to deploy a minimum number of three to six charging points in their designated carparks by the end of 2025. They may also scale up the deployment in each carpark to a cap of 12 charging points during their concession period.  “Tenderers will be assessed on how they plan to offer affordable, reliable and sustainable charging services,” added LTA. “They will also be assessed on their plans to trial and implement innovative solutions to deter the hogging of charging lots, as well as maximise deployment in carparks with limited electrical capacity.” The tender is expected to be awarded in the fourth quarter of this year, with the deployment of charging points to commence by the first quarter of next year. Speaking at the launch of the national EV campaign - “Power EVery Move"" - on Tuesday, Transport Minister S Iswaran said that the shift to EVs will be one of the most significant shifts in Singapore’s automotive sector in “generations”.  For one, he pointed out that in 2021, new electric car registrations grew nearly 20-fold to 1,800, accounting for about 4 per cent of all new car registrations.  “The moves we are making today – on the hardware, the software and indeed the ‘heartware’ – will help address range anxiety, last-mile challenges and help to foster a gracious culture in the adoption and use of electric vehicles,” he added. “Most importantly, I hope it will give everyone the assurance and confidence to make the transition to electric mobility.” In addition, it was also announced that the MyTransport.SG mobile application will be enhanced to offer information on charging points, starting with more than 800 public charging points at over 200 locations across the island. This will allow EV drivers to easily locate public charging points, said LTA.  The app will cover the charging points offered by all major operators, and the new MyTransport.SG feature will display accurate information such as pricing, power rating and plug type to enable users to plan their charging schedules.  Users will be able to filter and search for the charging points of their preference, and be redirected to the respective charging operators’ apps for payment or to Google Maps for navigation.  More features such as real-time charging point availability will be available with subsequent updates of the application, said LTA."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/expensive-buy-life-items-cheap-sustainable-2580636,Commentary: Do we still need expensive buy-it-for-life home items today?,"SINGAPORE: Over the past two years, we have been more homebound than ever before. Home upgrading has become an ongoing project for many. According to Think With Google, searches for kitchen appliances rose by 190 per cent in Singapore during the 2020 ""circuit breaker"" compared to earlier in the year. Along with the acceleration of e-commerce, cheap no-brand or small-brand home items are also on the rise, fuelling our home transformation – S$40 slow cookers, S$60 mixers and S$80 ergonomic chairs. That said, the ongoing climate conversation has cast a spotlight on these items’ short lifespans and how their low price point enables our throwaway culture. Buy-it-for-life or long-lasting branded items emerge in sharp contrast to these cheap dupes as a more sustainable solution. Think Le Creuset pots, Corelle dinnerware, KitchenAid stand mixers, Scanpan knives and Herman Miller office chairs. These items are made to last. And some even come with stupendous lifetime warranties or extended warranties. Prices however are equally mind-blowing. A Le Creuset cast iron pot for instance cost upwards of S$500, and that is a discounted price. KitchenAid Mixers may cost close to S$1,000. This begs the question: Is it really more sustainable for the earth, and for us as consumers, to shell out top dollar for a pot or mixer when there are so many cheaper alternatives? Our throwaway culture is getting a lot of flak – and for good reason. Thoughtless consumption and disposal are really generating too much waste. But in many cases, the solution is more nuanced than simply purchasing the most well-made product that will last “forever”. How durable we need each product to be really depends on our lifestyles and how much use it gets. For a consumer using a mixer five times a year, how long-lasting do we really need our mixer to be anyway, and how many bakes do we need to get out of it to get our money’s worth? Our lives are also constantly changing. Children grow up, our hobbies change and our home configurations and locations also shift. So splashing out on many expensive home items may end up saddling us with a lot of stuff that no longer have a place in our lives – furniture too small for our growing families, wardrobes our children outgrow, and pots and dinnerware that we rarely use as we return to the office, teenage kids eat out and everyone gets busier. In many cases, “lifetime warranties” are also simply a branding and marketing strategy for luxury products. They are not often claimed, and when they are, people might be trying to get refunds for old or salvaged products. Such abuse is why outdoor wear brands LL Bean and REI no longer issue them. Unlike decades ago, our modern society is not really designed for the repair of items. Who today keeps receipts from years ago on every pot or knife and has half a day to spare to make their way to the company’s local office to repair it? And won’t the taxi fare cost almost as much as a cheap replacement? The other question is if we actually want all items to last forever in the first place. This is especially true for electronic items where technological advances make buy-it-for-life a dated concept. Many items face obsolescence by the time they are close to spoiling.  Each year, televisions are getting more high-definition, thin and sleek. People rarely use their home phones anymore. And with Netflix and Disney+, when was the last time you touched your DVD or BluRay players if you still have one? The point is, no matter how cutting-edge the technology is at the point of purchase, you can be sure it will be outstripped very quickly. Which makes it questionable if it is a good investment to pay for a long-lasting model with an extended warranty and a sizeable price tag in the first place. Indeed, in the days of mechanical products, using items for life may have made sense. But in our tech-driven world today, sometimes replacing items is not just inevitable, it may also be more sustainable. Consider our top energy guzzlers – air conditioners, fridges, clothes dryers and water heaters. With advances in technology, many new items have become significantly more energy- and cost-efficient over the years. According to Energy Efficient Singapore, a five-tick air conditioner will cost you about S$270 less in electricity bills per year as compared to a two-tick air conditioner. Imagine how much we can progress in energy savings with newer models in years or decades to come? Having said that, if you have to purchase new items, how do you reduce your carbon footprint? The good news is the acceleration of e-commerce has created a more democratic marketplace where consumers have a bigger say in what they want. Even if you don’t want to pay hundreds or thousands for home products, you could use your dollar to vote for low-carbon businesses that channel their resources into sustainable research and design or brands that invest in greening their supply chains, packaging and delivery. We can also, as a rule of thumb, insist on more transparency of such information from retailers. For instance, IKEA, which used to be the poster child for affordable fast furniture, is now investing in designs that can be “reused, refurbished, remanufactured and eventually recycled as much as possible”. It removed all single-use plastic products from its home furnishing range and uses only renewable or recycled materials. Some say that this does not mitigate the effect of fast furniture on the environment, but this is a start. And if more consumers vote with their wallet, who is to say what possibilities modern technology can create? The best part: Low-carbon products need not be priced out of reach for the average consumer. With e-commerce breaking down barriers of entry and geography, cheap products and sustainable design need not be mutually exclusive. So there is really no need to commit to a “forever” crockpot or long-lasting television when technology, our lives and living spaces are constantly changing. And there is certainly no reason for any of these items to cost so much that we need to pay by instalment the same way we do for a car. As consumers, it is not at all unreasonable to ask for affordable products that, while not “indestructible”, are sustainable for both the earth and our wallets.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/advertorial/why-companies-must-lead-sustainability-charge-2531901,Why companies must lead the sustainability charge,"Climate change is near a tipping point – and time is running out. Last August, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that by the next decade, global surface temperatures will rise beyond the 2015 Paris Agreement’s 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold target, unless urgent action is taken.  The same report estimates that approximately 3.3 to 3.6 billion people live in contexts that are highly vulnerable to climate change. Already, the world is seeing an increase in the number of extreme weather events driven by climate change, such as flooding, forest fires and droughts. According to a study of 1,500 companies in the MSCI World Index, without any concrete action to curb emissions, the international private sector would be responsible for raising global temperatures by over 3 degrees Celsius by 2050. While many corporations have engaged in corporate social responsibility efforts centred around the environment, these measures tend to be one-off and are unable to combat climate change effectively. More must be done on the part of businesses before it is too late – a call that is being sounded by leaders in the banking, finance and insurance sectors, among others.  An outcome of corporations doing right by the environment is that they seem to clock in better financial performance. A Harvard Business School study found that companies that integrated sustainability measures into their business goals earned investors almost double in a 20-year period. According to the World Economic Forum, consumer support for sustainable businesses is also growing in both developed and developing economies.  While around a fifth of the world’s 2,000 biggest publicly-listed companies have committed to net-zero emissions, corporations are also turning to partnerships with organisations that can offer sustainability expertise and outreach, in order to maximise the impact of their efforts. Many of these efforts have so far focused on carbon off-setting, through actions such as planting trees or switching to renewable energy – but few have turned their attention to biodiversity, an important aspect of our environment. THE WONDERS OF BIODIVERSITY Biodiversity, which refers to the rich and complex web of life on Earth, not only provides essentials such as water, food, fuel and medicine but is key to mitigating the effects of climate change. According to some estimates, nature is able to provide 30 per cent of the climate change mitigation required when harnessed effectively to absorb carbon emissions from the atmosphere.  Forests in particular are critical for absorbing and storing these emissions. As such, better forestry practices not only ensure that trees store more carbon but also produce more wood for the growing needs of the human population.  One of the largest barriers to tapping the potential of natural climate solutions is a lack of financing, with less than 3 per cent of current climate mitigation financing being invested in natural climate solutions. That is where corporations can step in. MSIG Asia, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance, is committed to making the protection of biodiversity a key part of its mission by putting its weight behind natural climate solutions.  A PARTNERSHIP FOUNDED ON MUTUAL GOALS To work towards tangible conservation targets in the region, MSIG Asia has partnered with Conservation International Asia-Pacific (CIAP). The partnership seeks to invest in and leverage natural ecosystems that can mitigate the impact of climate change. It also includes various engagement activities, such as biodiversity conservation talks and conservation volunteer efforts that bring together MSIG’s employees, intermediaries and customers. When it comes to protecting biodiversity, CIAP makes for an ideal partner in more ways than one. Since 1987, Conservation International has combined fieldwork with innovations in science, policy and finance to protect more than six million sq km of land and sea across more than 70 countries. It has a presence in 29 countries and works with 2,000 partners worldwide.  In the collaboration’s three-year duration, MSIG Asia will provide support to a variety of biodiversity conservation efforts in Asia-Pacific which underpin the well-being of millions of people through the water, food, fuel, medicines, and climate regulation these natural ecosystems provide.  The partnership will support biodiversity conservation projects in MSIG Asia’s six core markets: Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. These range from restoring forests in Hong Kong to protecting threatened species in Vietnam, as well as funding marine research in Singapore.  It will also fund initiatives in Pacific nations New Caledonia and Fiji – two of the world’s most biodiverse areas, where CIAP is present and active. Through these efforts, the partnership aims to contribute to the conservation of an estimated 9,500 ha of forest – the equivalent of 13,000 football fields – as well as 72,500 ha of ocean, which amounts to an area slightly larger than Singapore.  “With climate change being the greatest environmental risk confronting our industry, the issue of sustainability is integral to our business. This is why we are partnering Conservation International Asia-Pacific, clients and rallying our employees to transform our biodiversity concerns into tangible actions by consolidating our on-ground activities, conservation efforts and communication across Asia to help create a nature-positive economy,” said Mr Alan J Wilson, CEO of MSIG Asia and deputy head of International Business Department at Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance. EMPOWERING BUSINESSES TO CHAMPION BIODIVERSITY As tackling biodiversity and sustainability issues requires a spirit of collaborative partnership, MSIG is helping its corporate clients to amplify their conservation efforts so as to continue and grow this momentum. By doing so, it hopes to inspire more businesses to do the same and encourage active corporate action on biodiversity.  For example, its client in Hong Kong, railway operator MTR Corporation, is managing the Lok Ma Chau Ecological Enhancement Area, which features reedbeds, marshlands and fish ponds that contribute significantly to the region’s biodiversity.  Over in Thailand, seafood supplier Thai Union has developed SeaChange, a sustainability strategy that centres on safe and legal labour, responsible sourcing and operations, and caring for communities.  Moving forward, MSIG intends to have eco-certified offices across the region as part of its ongoing sustainability journey. With its partner CIAP and like-minded clients, MSIG Asia is working to ensure a thriving future for our planet, one where resources are used sustainably and our natural ecosystems can flourish alongside businesses and people. For this to happen, it needs the support of many more companies to embrace the movement and lead the way with their own sustainability initiatives. Only then can we preserve the world’s vast, interconnected web of natural biodiversity.  To find out more about biodiversity or how you can do your part to protect it, visit MSIG’s knowledge hub to watch a series of educational videos produced in collaboration with CIAP and discover a wealth of information."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/data-centres-energy-digital-economy-jobs-sustainability-2550996,Commentary: Where do data centres fit into Singapore's vision of green growth?,"SINGAPORE: At Budget 2022, Singapore signalled its intent to step up climate action, with carbon tax hikes and a net-zero emissions goal by or around mid-century.  As emitters review plans to slash emissions, where do data centres fit in?  These giant warehouses packed with servers form the backbone of Singapore’s digital economy but have gained notoriety given their large energy consumption.  Data centres contribute about 7 per cent of Singapore’s total electricity consumption. With concerns about environmental sustainability and limited space, Singapore issued a moratorium on new data centres in 2019. But lifting the moratorium was never a question of if, but when. Following a review, Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong said on Jan 11 that the country continues to welcome data centre investments but will be more “selective” of such projects moving forward.   Singapore has long been the data centre hub of Asia Pacific, accounting for 60 per cent of data centre capacity in the region, thanks to robust infrastructure, high-speed connectivity and the widespread adoption of digital technologies. Policymakers surely recognise the benefits that they offer. Singapore’s data centre market is expected to attract significant investments of up to US$5 billion (S$6.8 billion) by 2026. In a rapidly digitalising world producing more data than ever, this industry is undeniably essential to a growing economy.  Over three in four organisations agree that APAC business transformation needs “hyper-scale” – massive, business-critical data centres designed for the likes of Google and Amazon –  to progress, according to a May 2021 study commissioned by global technology company ABB.  As Singapore seeks a greener path forward, it must take a hard look at the emerging challenges in the data centre industry and where data centres fit into this cleaner future.    Data centre investments have driven growth and job opportunities.  According to a study by the United States Chamber of Commerce, the average data centre injects US$32.5 million to its local community each year, in the form of investments during the construction phase, the purchase and installation of various electrical components and the day-to-day operating expenses of the facility. Each data centre creates high-value jobs in data security, network engineering, operations, project management and more. Take Amazon for example – the tech giant recently announced investments of over US$5 billion to open new data centres in New Zealand, which will generate around 1,000 jobs over 15 years.  Looking at the bigger picture, the real economic significance of data centres is their role in the digital economy. Southeast Asia’s digital economy is expected to be worth US$360 billion by 2025  – a feat that cannot be achieved without robust data centres located within the region.  The further a business is to its data centre, the longer it takes to get the information it needs – which means more delays and frustration for customers. In a digital age of one-click purchases and instantaneous communication, a slow network connection would hold businesses back and stall growth.  The data centre industry, which stores, processes and transmits data, is the driving force behind fast-growing sectors like e-commerce and digital financial services.  As Singapore seeks to continue its growth momentum and cement its status as a global tech hub, data centres will play a pivotal role in the country’s post-pandemic recovery. While demand for data grows exponentially, so will the demand for certain job skills. Expertise in cloud architecture, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity will be increasingly sought after.  Specific to Singapore, we are starting to see the emergence of a new skill gap, in the form of electrical engineers. Electrical design is one of the top roles that Singapore companies are looking to fill in 2022, according to an industry survey. Demand for all-rounded engineers with a keen understanding of various complex electrical components and how to make them work together is rising. But like many parts of the economy, a tight labour market in Singapore has had ripple effects. Data centres operating in a niche space have had to redouble efforts to recruit fresh graduates, who often feel more inclined towards big consumer or household names. Here is where perhaps more openness to tech talent, without a technical degree, can bring new opportunities including diversity in thought and ways of working. With hiring managers looking to recruit talent from outside typical industries, adaptable skillsets and an open mindset could outweigh hard skills like coding – which can be acquired and honed eventually.   Singapore will undoubtedly still have to manage the environmental costs. Though Singapore continues to be the top APAC market for data centre deployment, the current moratorium has driven data centre players to look at setting up operations elsewhere in the region. If Singapore is to maintain its competitive edge as a data centre hub, we will need to get creative in optimising our energy efficiency. Technological innovation can help drive energy efficiency. Case studies on this abound – a community college in Ohio, US, automated their data centre’s heating and cooling systems and cut energy usage by more than half. Closer to home, the Agency for Science, Technology and Research and KoolLogix developed an energy-efficient cooling system that reduces energy consumption by up to 50 per cent. This stands testament to the strength of Singapore’s R&D and innovation capabilities, which offers an optimistic outlook for data centres here. New technologies will be key in enabling Singapore’s data centre industry to do much more with less resources. Demand for data has yet to peak. As we forge ahead into a world where COVID-19 is endemic, businesses will need to consider what this new digital economy will look like in the long term as challenges like sustainability and skill shortages remain.  Sustainable technologies like smart buildings rely on data to optimise electricity consumption for greater energy efficiency. As Singapore shifts towards cleaner sources of energy, data analytics in smart grid systems can help integrate renewables into the electricity supply.  Singapore is already flourishing as a data centre hub in Southeast Asia, but we must not lose the edge we have. Central to this would be proper planning and resource policy management. Kent Chow is Data Segment Lead of the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa Region at ABB."

China, the world's biggest greenhouse gases emitter, has said its carbon emission would peak by 2030, while it has said it would achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. ""We will accelerate the adjustment of the energy structure and promote energy supply security and low-carbon transformation at the same time,"" the National Development and Reform Commission said in a statement on Tuesday. China will keep annual crude oil output at 200 million tonnes, equivalent to 4 million barrels per day, and crank up annual natural gas production to more than 230 billion cubic metres (bcm) by 2025 from 205 bcm in 2021. It said the country would ""actively expand"" exploration and development of resources such as shale oil and shale gas, and would seek to establish coalbed methane production bases in the Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and Shanxi regions. China also planned to achieve gas storage capacity of 55-60 bcm, or 13per cent of total annual consumption by 2025, and complete a southern extension to the existing China-Russia gas pipeline, the commission said. Beijing would encourage developing ethanol, biodiesel and bio-jet fuel, provided it did not affect food security, it said. China suspended a nationwide plan for blending gasoline to have 10per cent ethanol from 2020 after a sharp fall in the country's corn stocks and limited production capacity of the biofuel. China aims to make non-fossil fuels account for about a fifth of total energy consumption by 2025, up from 16per cent in 2020, and to control coal use in heavy industry including steel, chemical and cement. About 30 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired power capacity would be phased out during 2021-2025, while it aimed to raise hydropower capacity to 380 GW and nuclear power capacity to 70 GW by 2025, it said. China plans to install at least 62 GW capacity of pumped hydropower, a system that involves pumping water to a higher reservoir during off peak times to generate power at peak times. It also aims turn more than 200 GW of coal-fired power plants to peak-shaving facilities that are used to stabilise the grid operation as the use of intermittent renewable power rises. China also wants to deploy a batch of hydrogen energy projects, targeting technologies to improve hydrogen storage, transportation, application and fuel cells.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/powered-sun-should-you-invest-solar-power-2503666,Powered by the sun: Should you invest in solar power?,"SINGAPORE: Home owner Deena Bajrai has not paid an electricity bill in four years. In 2018, Deena installed 66 solar panels on her rooftop. Since then, she has not had to pay an electricity bill. The installation of the panels cost about S$40,000 and they will last about 25 years. With her last bill in June 2018 coming in at about S$260, it will take Deena about 12 years to recoup the initial investment. That means she will not have to pay an electricity bill for another 13 years or so. And not only does she not have monthly electricity bills to pay, she actually has a surplus. Since her solar panels generate more electricity than she uses, Deena has accumulated S$3,000 in credit with her electricity company. This will help offset any increase in consumption and price in future. The cost savings, however, were but one consideration in her decision to switch to renewable energy, said Deena. “The other incentive was the fact that you can’t put a cost to the environment. How can you put dollars and cents to fossil fuels when it takes years for oil to be produced in the ground,"" she said. ""Knowing that there are those intangible values that you are able to contribute to ... that was one other reason why I decided on solar panels."" Across Singapore, there were 4,750 solar photovoltaic (PV) installations as of the end of the second quarter 2021. Grid-connected installed solar PV capacity in Singapore was at 527 MWp at the end of the second quarter last year. The aim is to rapidly scale up by 2030 – with plans to produce enough to power 350,000 households a year. That is about 4 per cent of Singapore’s electricity demand. Around the world, installed solar power capacity has increased 17-fold, and its price has plummeted by more than 80 per cent in a 10-year period. This is partly due to more production being carried out in China, which has brought the price of manufacturing down. Currently, there are two ways you can opt to use solar energy in Singapore. Residential consumers, mainly landed property owners, can install and own the solar panels on their property. This involves an upfront cost of between S$10,000 and S$50,000 dollars, depending on the size of the installation. Another is called the solar leasing model. Here, the property owner need not pay the installation costs of the solar panels but instead pays a monthly fixed rate for the electricity generated from solar panels that can be on-site or off-site. According to the Energy Market Authority, just over half of Singapore’s solar energy capacity was accounted for by the non-residential private sector. One such business is Schneider Electric, which installed solar panels on its roof and parking lots. However, this was only enough to supply 5 per cent to 6 per cent of the whole building’s electricity usage. Schneider tops this up with energy purchased from an offsite solar farm. Despite the high initial investment of about S$3 million, Schneider Electric said it was able to recoup its costs in about three years. Aside from cost recovery, owning solar panels can also help consumers and businesses shield themselves from fluctuations in energy prices. ""Singapore has an open electricity market, which means that it is very susceptible to market forces,"" said Mr Matthew Yeo, Energy Transition Lead, Southeast Asia, Accenture. ""The danger of that is that electricity prices can fluctuate ... So if you have solar panels on your roof, then you kind of protect yourself in that way,"" he added. Solar power is an intermittent source of energy. This means it is not continuously available due to external factors that cannot be controlled, like the weather. Mr Yeo said that at lower levels, the power grid can withstand intermittency. “But if you start to go to 40 per cent, 50 per cent, when half of Singapore is powered by solar energy, then if suddenly you have a thunderstorm, your electricity production is cut in half, and then that becomes an issue because you don’t have enough spare capacity to ramp up power generation. And then you could have blackouts or brownouts.” He said additional costs would need to be incurred in upgrading the power grid to withstand these conditions. But some of these challenges have also become opportunities, as Singapore takes action on its sustainability commitments. One such solution is the floating solar farm at Tengeh Reservoir. The size of about 45 football fields, it is one of the largest in the world. Also in the pipeline is a project to supply electricity from Australia’s Northern Territory via submarine cable. It is one of the world’s most ambitious solar energy projects, and could provide up to 15 per cent of Singapore’s energy needs. According to Stephen Tay, adjunct lecturer at the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore, this is an example of Singapore developing innovative solutions because of geographical limitations. Dr Tay said such solutions could help boost the global adoption of solar electricity."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/women-sustainability-just-dabao-jennifer-widjaja-2550746,"She's a food waste warrior who has saved 7,500 meals from the bin","Food is undoubtedly our national obsession. Singaporeans love discovering cool cafes, trying out new creations and feeding our social media accounts with drool-inducing shots. But our exciting food scene has an ugly side. It contributes to heaps of food waste every year. Just in 2020 alone, Singapore produced 665,000 tonnes of food waste (which include surplus food), according to the National Environment Agency (NEA). That is equivalent to more than 1.7 billion packets of chicken rice. A lot of this is perfectly good and absolutely delicious surplus food. And we are not just talking about chicken rice, but cakes and caneles, gourmet bread and beer, as well as salads and nut butters – food worthy of space on the 'gram, not the bin. According to Jennifer Widjaja, co-founder of green marketplace Just Dabao, a lot of surplus food comes from cancelled events, food nearing expiry, items with mild cosmetic defects, surplus raw ingredients that have been thawed and wrong orders. “Food waste is a problem not many people see, which makes it even more scary,” said the 30-year-old entrepreneur.  Her business connects consumers to surplus food from more than 400 merchants. Items are sold at an average of a 50 per cent discount. This helps merchants recoup losses. As of February this year, the food waste warrior has helped to save five tonnes (or 5,000kg) of food from the bin. That is 7,500 meals and the equivalent of 12.5 tonnes of carbon emissions. BUILDING A GREEN MARKETPLACE Her entrepreneurship journey began in 2020 with a sad but familiar story. With the onset of the pandemic and dining restrictions, many F&B merchants were badly hurt and forced to fold. Widjaja’s friend Lisa was one of the many casualties. The pastry chef had to shut her business and throw away heaps of food. “It was a very painful process,” Widjaja recalled. “I really wanted to help her, and help the F&B industry. That spurred me to talk to food stall uncles and aunties about the problems they faced.” Her research led her to realise that food wastage was a serious problem, and it did not only happen when businesses shuttered. In general, it was just hard for stall holders and merchants to accurately forecast how much ingredients or food would be sold each day or week. Issues such as cosmetic defects, last-minute event cancellations and wrong orders were also par for the course. The thing is, Widjaja really loves food. “Food makes me happy. I find it very painful when the food I prepare, buy or enjoy doesn’t get finished.” Her mother also influenced her strong feelings about wasting food. “She has always been very conscious about storing food properly and finishing food, and even uses the juice and pulp from food as fertiliser for her plants. Growing up, this shaped my relationship with food.” In July 2020, Widjaja channelled her frustrations into an action plan. The Indonesian and Singapore permanent resident left her job as a financial analyst at Bloomberg to start Just Dabao.  Essentially, the concept combines two of Singaporeans’  greatest loves – food and bargains. The platform is designed to enable F&B merchants to sell surplus food at 30 to 40 per cent of original prices. Since the platform generally includes a mark-up of S$1 to S$2, this gives consumers an average of 50 per cent savings. “Just Dabao is not really a profit-generating platform but a cost-saving platform for merchants. Since the industry standard is that ingredients cost 20 to 30 per cent of the price of the dish, we aim to help merchants recover some of that sunken cost. The 50 per cent discounts they offer on surplus food also incentivise consumers to help clear the food,” she explained. It sounds like it would be a runaway hit. But Widjaja started Just Dabao at the height of the pandemic and at a time of great uncertainty. And even though she cold-called 10 to 20 merchants a day, she initially faced rejection after rejection. It was so tough that Widjaja began to wonder if she had quit her job too soon. “The biggest challenge was onboarding the merchants. This was a brand-new concept, and with so many scams these days, people were sceptical. Some were worried that we would run away with their money,” she recalled. Many were also already juggling multiple platforms such as GrabFood, Deliveroo and FoodPanda and did not want to manage yet another. Yet others were resistant to offering such huge discounts.  It took Widjaja six to eight weeks just to onboard her first merchant. And after three months, she had only onboarded five to seven merchants. Her problems did not stop with merchants. Widjaja also had to find a team to build the website and app during a period of worldwide digitalisation and tech talent crunch. On top of that, she had to build credibility and a community of consumers.  The young entrepreneur gritted her teeth and went without a salary for a year before she eventually gained enough momentum. A MORE SUSTAINABLE WAY TO INDULGE Today, Just Dabao onboards an average of seven to 10 merchants a week, has more than 400 merchants and close to 4,000 transacting customers. Surplus items are listed on the website, and then pushed out via Telegram or Instagram, where JustDabao has a dynamic community of more than 20,000. Merchants include Marche, Baker’s Brew, Jiababa and Crust Beer. The latter also uses surplus bread from Redmart and surplus baguette from Tiong Bahru Bakery to make its artisan beers. The platform also offers bubble tea, oat milk, nut butters and Shiok Bags with mystery items. Ninety per cent of the food is available for self-collection, and consumers may filter choices based on their location and preferred type of cuisine. The remaining 10 per cent of foods that offer delivery tend to be non-perishables such as beers and nut butter.    “It is a flash sale and treasure hunt approach to food shopping. Some items can be snapped up in seconds,” Widjaja noted. Items are available throughout the day, though you can generally look forward to more surplus nearing the end of the day. Event cancellations also create a lot of surplus, such as when ice cream merchant Bunnie Bash was dropped from a huge Facebook Live sale at the last minute. She ended up with 90 to 100 pints of ice cream without enough refrigeration space and sold it at Just Dabao.  Another time, when a supermarket cancelled a large order of cocktails-in-a-bottle, interesting cocktails such as Chrysanthemum Vodka were also sold at Just Dabao at a bargain.   The platform is also a great place to try off-menu items when chefs experiment with new recipes. Home-based bakery Cassia Caneles, for instance, has offered interesting flavours such as yuzu caneles and truffle caneles with slashed prices. Sometimes, these come with mild cosmetic defects. Widjaja stresses that no quantity is too small. The platform even accepts single orders that were wrongly placed so that, for example, not a single pizza has to go to waste. To debunk the myth that surplus food is low quality food, Widjaja places great importance on quality control, provides feedback to merchants with low ratings, and rejects merchants with repeatedly low ratings. Of the 2,400 reviews on the platform today, the average rating is 4.5 stars. While the items are only available via the website now, Just Dabao is planning to launch an app in June this year and expects sales to grow. Widjaja is also heartened by the gradual but meaningful mindset change she has observed in merchants and consumers since starting the business. “Although the government has green plans for 2030, there’s just so much they can do if the consumer is not a part of it. Sustainability is a collective effort, not just about getting instructions from the government. And the thing is, it is not rocket science; it is so doable,” she said. “That is what Just Dabao is about. A mindset change through reinforcement and slow changes in habits so that we can tackle food waste through the community,” she added.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/green-economy-sustainability-finance-singapore-scarce-talent-2519516,Commentary: Race for scarce talent in green finance looming in Singapore,"SINGAPORE: As global thinking shifts towards sustainable investing, there are significant opportunities for Singapore to leverage. Recent moves to hike carbon taxes and accelerate net-zero targets all point towards the country’s growing sustainability commitment.  With the carbon tax rate gradually rising to potentially S$80 per tonne by 2030, up from the current level of S$5, operating costs for large emitters will rise significantly. Such companies would need to modify their business activities or adopt clean technology for them to remain competitive. But there are still gaps in the picture. A key step in pivoting to a green economy is to nurture talents who can shape the future for better environmental and social outcomes in Singapore and beyond. As the list of environmental and social issues grows longer, we need to pursue both economic and sustainable development. This can only be fulfilled through a more holistic valuation of human and corporate activities.  As Singapore’s green economy takes off, a rising class of environmentally conscious investors are calling the shots. Several years ago, we examined how financial markets priced the environmental, social and governance (ESG) activities of publicly listed companies. Many firms, with their traditional business models, were not reputed for their ESG credentials. But when they tried to do better, results showed that investors paid attention. In recent years, controversy has also arisen around “greenwashing”, or the tendency by some companies to overstate their green activities. Credible verification and validation of corporate activities are critical for concerned stakeholders to understand the true impact firms make.  But many firms struggle with the regulatory requirements of sustainability reporting. Some worry that the information disclosed would erode their competitive advantage, while others simply do not allocate sufficient manpower to measure their environmental impact. Firms need to hire staff who can turn sustainability reporting to their advantage. By tracking their environmental impact, firms may uncover new revenue streams or ways of cutting costs. For instance, many companies can employ rainwater harvesting techniques at minimal cost, reducing their utility bills in water consumption or even helping to extend and sustain more greenery space. The world’s tallest indoor waterfall at Jewel Changi Airport is an example of a feature powered using collected rainwater. Navigating this change won’t be easy. Companies now need people who can distil the complicated relationship between environmental action and financial valuation. New skills are required to properly budget and value sustainability initiatives, and to evaluate their potential impact on firms and our society.  Recruiting more people into sustainable finance is also a challenge. In recent years, Asia has seen fast growth in sustainable and green investing. In 2021, borrowers in the region more than doubled ESG bond issuances to a record US$69 billion, outstripping the US. Financial institutions and intermediaries will only continue issuing sustainability-linked securities, evaluating sustainable investment projects and making large amounts of capital investments. But financial experts in sustainable finance are usually trained in European and American universities, which means there’s a lack of people who specialise in Asian markets. This can hamper firms from taking the plunge into sustainable investing. According to a September 2021 HSBC survey, 40 per cent of institutional investors in Asia are “held back from more ESG-based investing due to a shortage of expertise or qualified staff”. This figure is up from 26 per cent in 2020. The market needs more skilled professionals with a contextualised understanding of the sustainable challenges faced here and who possess the right institutional knowledge and background. More Asian talents are needed for the transition and growth of greener economies going forward.   Workers in the green economy need to understand not just finance, but public policy as well. Policymakers are moving fast to reshape the rules for building a greener and more sustainable economy. When it comes to developing policies, there’s a need for research to help policymakers determine their economic, environmental and social impacts. This also means that universities and think tanks need to hire and train more researchers who can study the impact of public policy.  For example, we found that the improvement of plumbing in HDB flats, as well as the installation of visible meter readers, resulted in lower household water consumption. We also discovered that disclosing precise flight arrival timings in Changi Airport significantly reduced the idling time of taxis at airport terminals, leading to reduced carbon emissions. This evidence-based research is useful in informing policies that nudge people towards greener actions. Research can also demonstrate if government initiatives, such as the establishment of carbon trading platforms in Singapore and other Asian countries, help businesses decarbonise. While it requires deeper investigation, our initial research evidence reveals that financial institutions are the most active market participants on a few carbon trading platforms. As these institutions are not large carbon emitters, further research has to explore how to incentivise industrial firms to reduce their carbon emissions. Sustainability is a long-term task, and we need more specialised human capital to comprehend and tackle these critical issues. We also need them to propose solutions that can be implemented on a greater scale. Singapore’s local universities are trying to catch up by offering sustainable finance certification courses and educational programmes, such as NUS’ recently launched MSc in Sustainable and Green Finance programme, which offer both theoretical and real-world training in the field. It should be tertiary institutions’ mission to nurture a new generation of these financial experts. These fresh talents will be able to think beyond the traditional approach of maximising financial profits; channel capital flows to sustainable entities and provide rigorous evidence for informing sustainability policies. Ultimately, they will encourage families and firms to play their part in making Singapore and Asia a better place to live in. Then the painting of a green economy landscape will be complete and the war for ESG talent won.  Sumit Agarwal is the Low Tuck Kwong Distinguished Professor of Finance, Economics and Real Estate at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School and Managing Director of the Sustainable and Green Finance Institute (SGFIN) at NUS.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sustainability/singapore-green-plan-electric-vehicle-ev-ready-2547936,Singapore Green Plan: EV-ready towns by 2025 and more support for businesses to improve energy efficiency,"SINGAPORE: Singapore is taking its climate action a step further with new initiatives announced on Tuesday (Mar 8), including plans to make every Housing and Development Board (HDB) town ""EV-ready” (electric vehicle) ahead of schedule, and help more businesses improve energy efficiency. The Government said last month that it would bring forward the country's target to reach net zero ""by or around mid-century"", a move Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean described on Tuesday as ""necessary, practical and implementable"", given international developments in technology and carbon markets.  Last week, a major UN report released dire warnings about climate change inaction, with findings showing that irreversible climate impacts are happening faster and with greater intensity than ever before. In particular, rising temperatures could expose Asia to threats like food scarcity and human-health risks, with an increasing likelihood of heatwaves and floods as well as water- and vector-borne diseases. ""We are already seeing some of these effects – stronger and longer heatwaves, unprecedented droughts and floods, sea-level rise and storm surges affecting communities all over the world,"" noted Mr Teo, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Security and chairman of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change. Speaking in Parliament during the ongoing Committee of Supply debate, he said the government will review its 2030 nationally determined contributions (NDCs) - a national roadmap that charts how the country plans to reach net zero - along with its long-term low-emissions development strategy (LEDS).  The Government had said previously that it would decide on a specific net zero year, and make a formal revision to Singapore’s LEDS later this year, after it consults with industry and citizen stakeholder groups. The five ministries spearheading the national Green Plan also provided updates on existing efforts and announced new initiatives to advance the country's push towards sustainability.  The five are the ministries of sustainability and the environment (MSE), trade and industry (MTI), transport (MOT), national development (MND), and education (MOE). While ""significant steps"" have been taken to build an efficient and sustainable transport system, Transport Minister S Iswaran said more must be done to work towards net zero emission.  To this end, a new target has been set - to reduce Singapore's land transport emissions by 80 per cent from its 2016 peak of 7.7 million tonnes ""by or around mid-century"". This will be a reduction in absolute emissions, Mr Iswaran said. Currently, the land transport system accounts for 15 per cent of Singapore's emissions today, making it the third-largest source of emissions.  ""This is an ambitious goal that will require policy moves, new technologies, and behavioural shifts across our land transport system. Along with the decarbonisation of the power grid, electrification of vehicles is a key initiative that will have a material impact,"" he said.  Singapore will also accelerate its target of making every HDB town EV-ready by 2025, earlier than its previous target of the 2030s.  This comes after a major survey of switchrooms and substations across the island conducted by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to assess the additional electrical capacity needed to support EV charging.  Mr Iswaran said the evaluation gave the ministry ""confidence"" to accelerate the implementation of its plans.  To support the implementation of EV-ready towns, Mr Iswaran said EV charging points will be installed at nearly 2,000 HDB car parks over the next three to four years. Meanwhile, the Government will also continue to work closely with various stakeholders to electrify more vehicle segments, said Mr Iswaran. This includes electrifying half of Singapore's public buses as well as taxi fleet by 2030, and extending the statutory lifespan of electric taxis from eight to 10 years. Businesses will also get extra help to improve their energy efficiency, as Singapore transitions to a lower-carbon economy. On Tuesday, Sustainability and the Environment Minister Grace Fu announced enhancements to an existing grant to co-fund energy-efficiency projects. Under the National Environment Agency's (NEA) Energy Efficiency Fund, businesses looking to invest in energy-efficient technologies will be able to receive a maximum grant support of 70 per cent of qualifying costs from Apr 1. Currently, the cap for qualifying costs per project is set at 50 per cent. In a joint release, MSE and NEA said the grants awarded to projects will vary, depending on the carbon abatement achieved. This means that projects that can reduce more carbon emissions will be able to enjoy higher grant support. Speaking in Parliament, Ms Fu said the increased support cap will help companies to adopt energy efficiency measures, which will go towards reducing their energy costs and carbon emissions. She added that the grant application and disbursement process will also be simplified to save businesses time and costs. As of January, 27 projects have received co-funding support from the energy efficiency fund, achieving an estimated annual carbon abatement of around 1,600 tonnes - the equivalent of taking about 500 cars off the road. The projects include retrofitting LED lighting, high-efficiency air-conditioning systems as well as variable speed air compressors and boiler systems. With Singapore looking to reduce the amount of waste sent to its landfill and to optimise its limited resources, the Government has also allocated more funding to drive new initiatives in water technologies and resource circularity. A sum of S$80 million will be channelled towards supporting research and development on sustainable solutions to recover and find useful applications for resources from key waste streams such as e-waste, plastics and food. Meanwhile, S$87 million will go towards funding R&D efforts in water technology areas including desalination and water reuse, used water treatment, and waste reduction and resource recovery. This is on top of the S$51 million funding received by PUB last year, under the Competitive Funding for Water Research as part of the current five-year national Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) Plan - RIE2025. Ms Fu said the investments will go towards developing high impact solutions for Singapore's water needs. ""Beyond that, research and innovation will also be an engine for green growth, spurring private sector R&D spending, job creation and technology spin-offs in the water industry and adjacent sectors,"" she said. To achieve sustainability as a competitive advantage, the capabilities of institutions such as universities, polytechnics, and ITEs as well as the competencies of Singapore's graduates and workforce will be the ""real needle movers"", said Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing. He added that the deep research and innovation capabilities of these institutions position them well to advance Singapore's sustainability goals. Through projects that they work on with industry, polytechnics can enable local enterprises to reduce their carbon emissions and achieve sustainability goals, said Mr Chan. He pointed out that autonomous universities are also leveraging their research capabilities for sustainability R&D, and using their own campuses as “living laboratories"" to support national research and talent development efforts. ""Our institutions also play an important role in equipping our youth and workforce with the skills and competencies for the growing green economy,"" he said.  ""We can expect more new jobs to emerge, and more … jobs to adopt green practices. We therefore need to invest in ‘green upskilling' for our workforce, so that they can seize the new opportunities presented by green growth,"" he added. Sustainability must also underpin Singapore's economic strategies, said Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong. And as Singapore transitions into a low-carbon economy, decarbonising its energy sector will be key as it currently accounts for about 40 per cent of the country's total emissions. To do this, the Government will enhance the energy efficiency of power generation plants, find ways to accelerate solar deployment, as well as tap on renewable energy beyond Singapore's shores, Mr Gan said. ""Singapore's transition to a low-carbon economy is critical not only to ensure that we are aligned with global efforts on sustainable development, but also to leverage new opportunities in the emerging green economy,"" he added. This includes new green areas such as green finance and sustainable tourism.  ""Over the past five decades, Singapore's economy has built up significant strengths and competitive advantages. We have adapted to various challenges, and constantly reinvented ourselves to stay relevant in the regional and global economy,"" Mr Gan said. ""Our transformation to a low-carbon economy is yet another chapter in the Singapore story. It will be a challenging journey, but an exciting one. The Government will partner our industries, our businesses, and workers, as we undertake this journey."" To support Singapore's ambitions to be a ""City in Nature"" and improve urban sustainability, the Government will invest more in R&D to explore solutions that tap on nature and help strengthen the country's ecological, climate and social resilience.  An additional S$64 million will be invested under the Government's Cities of Tomorrow programme, which supports R&D across the value chain and focuses on projects that have a high potential for practical implementation and commercialisation, said National Development Minister Desmond Lee. Mr Lee added that an additional S$45 million has also been committed to fund the enhanced Green Buildings Innovation Cluster (GBIC) programme to support the development, test-bedding and deployment of green technologies and solutions for buildings.  ""We will accelerate the commercialisation of these solutions through industry partnerships and help grow the local ecosystem of firms with green building expertise,"" he said.  ""This way, our companies can compete better in serving the growing global demand for sustainable urban solutions and take the lead to drive sustainable development across the Asia Pacific, home to some of the fastest growing economies in the world."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/electric-vehicles-ev-charging-points-hdb-car-parks-2025-2547471,"Nearly 2,000 HDB car parks to have at least 3 EV charging points each by 2025","SINGAPORE: To make every Housing and Development Board (HDB) town “EV-ready” by 2025, nearly 2,000 HDB car parks will each have a minimum of three charging points. These charging points will “mostly provide low-powered, overnight charging”, to meet the needs of car owners and minimise the load on the electrical grid, said Transport Minister S Iswaran on Tuesday (Mar 8). Speaking during a multi-ministry joint segment on the Singapore Green Plan 2030 at the Committee of Supply debate, Mr Iswaran said more charging points will be installed in car parks where there is demand and adequate electrical capacity. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) said in a press release that the move is a “significant step” in achieving Singapore’s target of 60,000 EV charging points by 2030. A “large-scale tender” for HDB car parks will be launched in the first half of this year, it added. Singapore’s land transport emissions peaked at 7.7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2016 - way ahead of the 2030 timeline set at the national level, LTA said. As such, the Government has set a new target of reducing emissions by 80 per cent from the 2016 peak by around 2050. To increase the adoption of EVs, all residential estates will have the required electrical infrastructure progressively upgraded. These upgrades will be financed by LTA through green bonds, and the costs will be recovered from EV charging operators and EV users over the longer term. Implementation details are being worked out, LTA said. New legislation will also be introduced to ensure “safe and reliable” EV charging. A public consultation will be published later this year. Half of Singapore’s public bus fleet will be electric by 2030, in line with plans to have a 100 per cent cleaner-energy bus fleet by 2040. More than 400 diesel buses will also be replaced by 2025. The country currently has about 5,800 buses in total. Sixty electric buses ply the roads now, which LTA said helps it better understand the “operational and technical considerations” of a larger-scale adoption of electric buses. Similarly, taxi operators have committed that at least half of Singapore’s taxi fleet will be made up of electric taxis by 2030. Singapore currently has around 15,000 taxis in its taxi fleet. The statutory lifespan of all electric taxis will be extended from eight to 10 years, giving operators more time to “optimise their electric taxi investments”, LTA added. Private-hire car operators will also increase their EV adoption, with 50 per cent of GrabRentals’ fleet to go electric by 2030. LTA will also revise the Certificate of Entitlement (COE) Category A maximum power output (MPO) threshold for electric cars from 97kW to 110kW, allowing more mass-market electric cars to come under Category A. “Based on the EV models approved by LTA for use so far, this move will double the number of models that fall within Category A from 10 to 20,” said Mr Iswaran. The MPO thresholds for Categories A and B were set at 97kW in 2013, to account for the “predominantly internal combustion engine car population” then. This threshold will continue to apply for non-electric cars. The revision will take effect from the first COE bidding exercise in May this year, from May 4 to 6. Solar panels will also be installed on the roofs of new or recently upgraded land transport infrastructure, such as train and bus depots, offices and facility buildings. This supports LTA’s existing plans to achieve the solar energy deployment targets of 16 megawatt-peak (MWp) by 2025 and 25 MWp by 2030. This month, the agency will also call an open tender to deploy solar panels on other land transport infrastructure, including the upcoming Integrated Train Testing Centre, pedestrian overhead bridges and covered linkways. With this open tender, LTA will contribute up to 20 MWp of additional solar capacity - equivalent to the power needed to charge up to 285 single deck e-buses for an entire year. “But beyond these efforts, the success of this green endeavour ultimately rests with each one of us, and the commuting decisions we make every day,” added Mr Iswaran. “Based on LTA’s estimates, compared to driving an internal combustion engine car, switching to an electric car halves our carbon footprint. Taking an electric bus reduces our carbon footprint by 70 per cent. Taking the MRT reduces our carbon footprint by close to 90 per cent. And if we walk or cycle, the carbon footprint is practically zero.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/plastic-bag-charge-5-cents-minimum-disposable-carrier-bags-large-supermarkets-2544651,Large supermarkets to charge minimum 5 cents for each disposable carrier bag,"SINGAPORE: Large supermarkets will be required to charge a minimum of 5 cents for each disposable carrier bag from mid-2023, announced Sustainability and the Environment Minister Grace Fu on Monday (Mar 7). These refer to supermarket operators with an annual turnover of more than S$100 million – such as NTUC FairPrice, Sheng Siong, Prime and Dairy Farm (which operates Cold Storage and Giant supermarkets) – making up about two-thirds of supermarket outlets in Singapore. The mandatory bag charge will only apply to purchases made at their physical stores and not for online orders. As for non-carrier disposable bags such as flat top plastic bags for bagging fresh produce as well as meat and seafood, they will not be subject to the mandatory charge. In a joint press release issued on Monday, the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) and the National Environment Agency (NEA) said the charge will apply to disposable carrier bags regardless of the material used. “Whether they are made of paper, plastic or degradable materials, disposables have an impact on the environment during their production, transportation and disposal,” they said. “In addition, disposable carrier bags used in Singapore are either recycled or incinerated. As they are not landfilled directly, the potential environmental benefits of using biodegradable materials (such as) paper cannot be realised in Singapore.” The authorities encouraged shoppers to bring their own bags and reduce the excessive use of all types of disposable bags. They also “strongly encouraged” supermarkets to use the collected proceeds from the bag charges to support charitable programmes or sustainability-related initiatives. To ensure transparency and discourage profiteering, supermarkets will be required to publish information on the number of bags issued, proceeds received from the bag charge and how they use the proceeds. Meanwhile, the authorities said supermarket operators with an annual turnover of less than S$100 million may implement their own bag charges, noting that many retailers have already done so. The decision to implement a bag charge comes after years of public and parliamentary debates on its effectiveness as well as nationwide campaigns aimed at reducing the excessive use of plastic bags and disposables. It also follows recommendations from a citizens’ workgroup, which convened in September 2020, to implement a bag charge. NEA said it had consulted close to 6,000 stakeholders from the industry and the public, including low-income groups and representatives from the social services sector. “This comprised public surveys, engagement and focus group sessions, as well as a consultation paper with proposed details of the disposable carrier bag charge for further public feedback between January and February 2022,” said the release. In deciding the minimum charge, MSE and NEA said it was kept low to moderate the cost impact on shoppers while encouraging them to be mindful of the number of disposable carrier bags they take. Speaking during her ministry’s Committee of Supply debate in Parliament on Monday, Ms Fu stressed that the bag charge is not a ban. “By making the cost of the bag visible to consumers, the intent of the bag charge is to nudge people to consider what they really need, instead of taking bags freely,” she said. “It will not remove the public’s access to disposable bags, it is a nudge to every one of us to develop the habit of bringing a reusable bag when shopping for groceries and more, and to reduce the use of disposables,” she added. Noting that households require disposable bags for their trash, the authorities said disposable bags will still be available at supermarkets including those used for bagging fresh produce such as fruits and fish, as well as non-supermarket retail outlets and wet markets. “Residents should continue with the responsible practice of bagging waste before disposal,” they said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/saf-smart-meter-jurong-camp-changi-naval-paya-lebar-airbase-2532371,"SAF installing more than 300 smart meters in 3 camps to push units to cut water, electricity use","SINGAPORE: More than 300 smart meters are being installed at Jurong Camp, Paya Lebar Airbase and Changi Naval Base in a pilot to encourage units to reduce their water and electricity consumption, amid a broader sustainability push by the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). The idea is to make units more aware of their consumption, and to possibly push reductions through “friendly competition” and “sustainability challenges” in future, said Brigadier-General (BG) Kelvin Fan, the SAF’s Chief Sustainability Officer. The pilot is expected to be completed by 2023 before more meters are rolled out to other camps and bases, added the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) in a press release on Wednesday (Mar 2). The initiative was first announced by MINDEF during its Committee of Supply debate in 2021, where it also outlined other green targets. These included reducing the growth of overall carbon emissions by two-thirds by 2030, cutting water consumption by 10 per cent and waste generation by 30 per cent by 2030. The smart meters can provide water and electricity consumption data on a daily – or even hourly – basis, compared to previous systems that provided it on a monthly basis. The Defence and Science Technology Agency (DSTA) will use data analytics to analyse consumption patterns, while the data will be aggregated on a dashboard that unit commanders can view, said MINDEF. “With access to the data, these commanders will have sight of their unit’s performance in comparison to other units, and can take concrete steps to encourage responsible green behaviour among the servicemen in order to achieve desirable outcomes in green efforts,” it said. In particular, BG Fan said “peer pressure” is one way to “incentivise excellence”, citing examples of other reported parameters such as a unit’s fitness test results or operational readiness. He also said: “There are many ideas that we can have to shape (behaviour) and we are learning from best practices – things like sustainability challenges. ""You can have friendly competitions between different camps, different units and so on. These are things we are still thinking (about), but we are developing our ideas.” Lieutenant Colonel Quek Shi Jian, Head of Logistics, 3 Div, said that since the pilot began at Jurong Camp 1, the camp’s soldiers have been “more conscious of their utility usage and more responsible for the use of precious resources like water”. “Our camp commanders have also been proactively monitoring usage patterns to study consumption behaviours in hopes of encouraging good and sustainable habits among servicemen,” he said. In addition to the smart meters, about 28,000 solar panels have been installed across SAF buildings. By 2022, about a quarter of its camps will have solar panels, delivering 20 mega-watt peak of electricity – equivalent to the consumption of about 5,000 four-room flats. And by 2025, two-thirds of its military camps will have solar panels generating 50 mega-watt peak of electricity, said MINDEF. The SAF also earlier pledged to replace its entire administrative fleet with electric vehicles – a process that will begin this year. Charging stations will be built at Kranji Camp III and Gombak Base as part of implementation trials, said MINDEF. As for efforts to reduce food waste, MINDEF noted that SAF has reduced this to 1 per cent. Food waste recycling is also being done in 14 cookhouses. In this process, food waste is collected and sent to the Ulu Pandan Water Reclamation Plant, where it is mixed with used water sludge to produce biogas for energy generation. The remaining cookhouses will join the programme when the National Environment Agency’s Tuas Nexus Plant is completed in 2025, said MINDEF. Overall, BG Fan said several of SAF’s sustainability initiatives “will be proliferated so long as they work well, and they don't compromise operational readiness, or lead to a spike in spending”. The SAF has also set up an external advisory panel for environmental sustainability to ensure its “efforts are guided by science, data and evidence”. Chaired by Professor Tan Thiam Soon from the Singapore Institute of Technology, the panel will include 12 other experts from various domains such as green energy, sustainable infrastructure and waste management. The panel will provide assessments and recommendations for MINDEF and SAF’s sustainability efforts, and share knowledge on technology and best practices. The first meeting, which took place in February, was a “productive” one, said BG Fan. “We look forward to partnering with them and benefiting from the expertise, experience and ideas throughout our sustainability journey.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/budget-2022-debate-parliament-gst-taxes-sustainability-workers-wages-2526301,"Day 1 of Budget debate 2022: MPs raise issues related to GST, cost of living and sustainability","SINGAPORE: Taxes and rising costs were key topics on the first day of the Budget debate in Parliament, as Members of Parliament rose to air their views on the Budget statement delivered on Feb 18. Tax changes, especially the proposed Goods and Services Tax (GST) hike and wealth taxes, were actively debated on Monday (Feb 28), with opposition MPs objecting strongly to the GST increase. Many MPs also raised concerns about the rising cost of living, and the manpower constraints and costs faced by businesses. Carbon taxes and sustainability were also on the agenda of numerous MPs. A total of 25 MPs spoke on the first day of the Budget debate, which lasted about seven hours. People’s Action Party (PAP) MPs who spoke supported a delay in implementing the GST and the move to increase it in two steps. Finance Minister Lawrence Wong had said in his Budget speech that the GST would be raised from 7 per cent to 8 per cent in 2023, and then to 9 per cent in 2024, although it had been widely anticipated that the tax could go up by mid-2022.
  Said Ms Foo Mee Har (PAP-West Coast): “This move by the Finance Minister brought some relief to concerns amidst rising prices. We all know that it would have been more expedient for the Government to effect the total increase in one go and the earlier the better … but we appreciate the sensitivity shown to delay it and to do it in two separate steps.” Some PAP MPs also suggested ways for the public sector to trim public expenditure and manage rising costs. ""As we rethink our nation’s taxation structure, it is equally sensible to be prudent in our use of funds and resources as well. This involves creative solutioning to problems ... working with existing resources and infrastructures instead of investing in new ones,"" said Ms Cheryl Chan (PAP-East Coast). But opposition MPs said that they would not support the Budget statement because they were opposed to the GST hike. Leader of the Opposition and Workers’ Party (WP) secretary-general Pritam Singh made clear that he thought the rise was unnecessary, and voiced doubts on whether the Assurance Package and subsidies announced would be sufficient to offset the rise in costs. He also disagreed with the timing of the rise as it “comes at a difficult time for our people”.  Non-Constituency MP Leong Mun Wai (Progress Singapore Party) started his speech by saying he would not support the Budget because of the GST hike.  He said the Government can cut public spending and had sufficient resources to cover rising healthcare costs, which was the reason given for the GST increase. “The virtue of frugality is preached by the Finance Minister, who is telling cash-strapped Singaporeans to tighten their belts again while the Government is sitting on massive reserves and under-utilised revenues,” he said. He also said that middle-class Singaporeans would bear the brunt of the burden of the GST. But Mr Saktiandi Supaat (PAP-Bishan-Toa Payoh) challenged this. He said that more than 60 per cent of net GST collected from households and individuals was estimated to be from the well-off, foreigners living in Singapore and tourists. Mr Saktiandi also pointed out that Mr Leong’s estimate of the tax burden on the middle-class did not take into account transfers that would cushion the impact of the GST on Singapore households. He, too, spoke up for middle-class Singaporeans, saying that while subsidies do help, Singapore should grow the wages of middle-income workers to cope with the rising costs of living in a “sustained manner”. He suggested raising the salaries of COVID-19 frontline workers and placing more focus on reskilling workers who face structural unemployment. While MPs welcomed wealth taxes on higher-end properties and luxury cars, some thought more could be done to narrow inequality. A number of PAP MPs highlighted that this year’s Budget is a shift in the social compact, with Mr Saktiandi praising the Government for “walking the talk” on addressing inequality. But he also asked that the Government look at reinstating estate duty. But Mr Louis Chua (WP-Sengkang), one of several MPs who said the announced measures fell short of expectation, called the taxes “tokenism”. He raised the possibility of a net wealth tax, particular in countries - such as Singapore - where neither capital gains nor inheritances are taxed. MPs also sought to allay fears of capital flight.  Mr Liang Eng Hwa (PAP - Bukit Panjang) said Singapore possessed advantages other than low taxes or costs, highlighting its status as a “triple A-rated global hub” with excellent infrastructure, and a strong and stable government. “We are rated among the best place to live in the world,” he said. ""We are a nation that is always passionate about excelling ourselves and constantly charting ahead and investing for a better future. This is the Singapore premium.” On the issue of carbon taxes - which will go up from the current rate of S$5 per tonne of emissions to between S$50 and S$80 by 2030 - Ms Poh Li San (PAP-Sembawang) said this phased increase would help businesses to transition gradually to greener practices. But she noted that there had been “little mention of grants for developing talents needed to support the green economy”. With many countries “fighting for talents” to support their sustainability-related industries, she said Singapore should start positioning itself as a “serious regional green hub” in order to attract these talents. It is also time to invest more in the training and nurturing of a new generation of innovators and engineers for the sustainability sector, she added. On the issuance of around S$35 billion of green bonds by 2030 to fund public sector green infrastructure projects, Mr Edward Chia (PAP-Holland-Bukit Timah) asked for more details about these projects, in particular the opportunities that local businesses can be involved in so as to build necessary capabilities. Mr Tan Wu Meng (PAP-Jurong) said Singapore can explore hydrogen and nuclear power as it looks to diversify its energy sources.  In a speech focused on energy security amid the climate crisis, he mooted the idea of Singapore’s potential as a hydrogen hub and suggested starting up hydrogen-based electricity generation and fuel-cell capability. Singapore should also keep a close watch on developments in nuclear energy, both fission and fusion, he added. MPs also addressed the ongoing labour crunch faced by both small and big firms. With the pandemic already exacerbating manpower shortages, planned increases to the minimum salaries of new Employment Pass (EP) and S Pass applicants will hurt businesses, said Ms Foo. It was announced in Budget 2022 that the minimum qualifying salary for new EP applicants will go up to $5,000, from the current $4,500, in September this year. For the financial services sector, where the salaries are higher, the bar will be raised to S$5,500 from the current S$5,000. Meanwhile, the minimum qualifying salary for new S Pass applicants will go up to S$3,000 from the current S$2,500. In the financial services sector, a higher minimum qualifying salary of S$3,500 will also be introduced. “With the tight labour market, employers shared that the S$500 dollar increase in work pass qualifying salaries will likely translate to ‘forced’ salary increases for their foreign workforce, as there are few alternatives in the foreseeable future,” Ms Foo said. The use of salary thresholds, she added, is “a blunt instrument” that does not take into account skills requirements and gaps in the market. Higher work pass thresholds have also “triggered international firms to review the sustainability of their operations in Singapore”, she told the House. A “points system”, which considers a range of non-salary factors for the approval of work passes, will help to make the system more transparent and economical, Ms Foo suggested. Mr Saktiandi said he welcomed the rise in minimum qualifying salaries, but wondered if the Government would consider a further differentiation of sectors beyond just financial services. This is because different sectors have vastly different salary scales, as well as needs for foreign labour and expertise. A single uniform qualifying salary may also penalise sectors that Singaporeans are less interested to work in, he added. Nominated MP Janet Ang also asked the Government to consider sector-differentiation when adjusting foreign worker policies, at least for the foreseeable short to medium term. She noted that some sectors, especially construction and food and beverage, were “very concerned” about the newly announced change, given how they have had little success in hiring more Singaporeans over the past two years. On support for low-wage workers, Ms Jessica Tan (PAP-East Coast) asked if authorities could review the introduction of a minimum income criterion for the Workfare Income Supplement scheme. The scheme – which supports workers whose earnings are in the bottom 20 per cent via cash payments and Central Provident Fund top-ups – was expanded to support more people and with higher payouts in Budget 2022. A minimum income criterion of S$500 per month was also introduced, to nudge part-timers and casual workers to take up regular, full-time work.  But this new criterion, which kicks in next year, will affect older low-wage workers, or those who are caregivers and need the flexibility of part-time work, said Ms Tan. She cited the example of a resident currently working as a relief programme coordinator at an eldercare centre. With monthly income ranging from S$200 to just over S$500, the resident in her late 60s is concerned that she will not be eligible for the Workfare scheme moving forward, Ms Tan told the House. WP’s Mr Singh also proposed that the Government remove this newly announced minimum income criterion, as it would penalise those with legitimate reasons for not taking up regular, full-time work and who are often the most financially vulnerable."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sustainability/ipcc-working-group-2-report-dire-warning-climate-change-2525681,Scientists release 'dire warning' about climate change inaction in latest IPCC report,"BANGKOK: The world is on track to be impacted by unavoidable multiple climate hazards over the next two decades, as human-induced global warming pushes people and ecosystems to the brink of being unable to adapt, according to the latest report by leading climate scientists. The second instalment of the Sixth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - released on Monday (Feb 28) -  finds that irreversible climate impacts are happening faster and with greater intensity than ever before. It underlines the need for more urgent action to mitigate and adapt to a hotter planet. “This report is a dire warning about the consequences of inaction,” Professor Hoesung Lee, chair of the IPCC, said in a press statement.“It shows that climate change is a grave and mounting threat to our wellbeing and a healthy planet. Our actions today will shape how people adapt and nature responds to increasing climate risks.” This report builds upon the findings released by the IPCC in August last year, with an increased focus on the impacts of climate change on nature and people around the globe. It also presents options to reduce climate risks, with a strong emphasis on strengthening nature. Last year’s report found that global warming is virtually certain to pass 1.5 degrees Celsius, probably within a decade. If global temperature rise hits 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the latest report concludes that climate resilient development will be nearly impossible in some regions.  As temperatures rise, Asia will be exposed to the increased likelihood of heat waves and floods in the monsoon regions of Southeast Asia, which will have cascading impacts on food availability and the prices of food. There is a high confidence that worsening climate change will cause biodiversity and habitat loss, including coral reefs, tidal marshes and other marine and coastal ecosystems across the region. At the same time, human health risks will increase in Asia, the report states. Climate change is increasing water and vector-borne diseases as well as undernutrition, mental disorders and allergic diseases. As rain and heat intensifies, diseases like dengue fever and malaria will flourish and more vulnerable people living in dense cities will die from heat-related causes. Internal displacement is also identified as an escalating climate risk - in 2019 in Southeast and East Asia, cyclones, floods, and typhoons triggered internal displacement of 9.6 million people, about a third of the world’s total for that year.   In response, when it comes to governments’ decision making, climate risks, vulnerability and adaptation measures must be taken into account, scientists agree. For this region, the report presents climate-smart agriculture, ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction and investments in urban blue-green infrastructure - those that utilise natural resources like rivers, canals, trees and parks - as opportunities.  “Together, growing urbanisation and climate change create complex risks, especially for those cities that already experience poorly planned urban growth, high levels of poverty and unemployment, and a lack of basic services,” Professor Debra Roberts, the IPCC Working Group II Co-Chair, said in a statement. “But cities also provide opportunities for climate action – green buildings, reliable supplies of clean water and renewable energy, and sustainable transport systems that connect urban and rural areas can all lead to a more inclusive, fairer society,” she said. "

EDPR, which is 75 per cent owned by Portugal's biggest utility Energias de Portugal, closed a S$1 billion deal to acquire a 91 per cent stake in Southeast Asian renewables firm Sunseap Group on Thursday after all pending regulatory conditions were met for the agreement reached in November. Apart from solar and wind projects, EDPR and Sunseap intends to explore opportunities for co-operation in energy storage and green hydrogen, the companies said in a joint statement. EDPR said the recently closed deal allows the company to establish a headquarters for the Asia-Pacific region through Sunseap, which has a portfolio of close to 10 GW of renewable projects at different stages of development across nine markets including Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia, China, Japan and Taiwan. ""The Asia Pacific region is a strategic market for us towards EDPR’s global positioning, with both high demand and growth potential in the renewable energy sector,"" said Pedro Vasconcelos, EDPR's chief operating officer for Asia-Pacific. EDPR, which currently has a portfolio with a total capacity of 13 GW, mainly in Europe, the United States and Brazil, had struck a small deal in Vietnam earlier last year, marking its first step towards establishing a presence in Asia."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-india-sign-agreement-cooperate-areas-science-technology-and-innovation-2514636,"Singapore, India sign agreement to cooperate in the areas of science, technology and innovation","SINGAPORE: Singapore and India will cooperate in the areas of science, technology and innovation, following the signing of an agreement on Wednesday (Feb 23).  A memorandum of understanding between the two countries was signed during the India-Singapore Technology Summit 2022, which was held virtually and co-organised by Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), India's Department of Science and Technology (DST) and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). In a media release, MTI said the agreement would ""encourage, develop and facilitate collaborative projects in fields of mutual interest"". These projects could advance progress in research, innovation and technological development in sectors such as advanced engineering and manufacturing, health and other emerging technologies, the ministry added.   Speaking during the summit, Singapore's Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations S Iswaran said such international collaborations in technology and research are ""vital to building commercially viable solutions that can save lives and livelihoods"". Mr Iswaran, who is also Transport Minister, identified three areas where the two countries could ""push the boundaries"" by combining their research and development talent and resources. ""First, deeptech. Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things, or IoT, hold much potential in a wide range of areas. This includes the construction and built environment sector, which we seek to transform to become more integrated and resilient,"" he said. This would lay the foundation for the building of ""smarter and more sustainable cities"", he added.  Mr Iswaran pointed to cleantech as another potential area of collaboration, noting Singapore and India had both announced ""ambitious"" carbon mitigation plans. ""R&D advancements in this domain could have a profound impact on greening the power and transportation sectors, particularly aviation and maritime transport,"" he said.  The third area where the two countries can partner is in the field of genome and bioinformatics research, said Mr Iswaran. ""Some of our researchers, including from A*STAR’s Genome Institute of Singapore, have embarked on the ambitious task of mapping Asian genomes, which I understand is an understudied and underpopulated dataset. This could be coupled with ongoing efforts in India to develop a similar dataset,"" he said.  Mr Iswaran added that ""cross border flows of data"" are crucial to the success of such initiatives, giving the example of data from IoT sensors in buildings and cities to inform better urban planning.  ""We therefore look forward to the finalisation and passing of the Personal Data Protection Bill in India, which will facilitate such cross border data flows,"" he said.  The summit also saw the signing of an implementation agreement between Enterprise Singapore (ESG) and India’s DST, to bring together corporates and startups from both countries to collaborate on developing new innovative technologies and solutions. ""DST and ESG will open at least one call for proposal annually to invite joint proposals by Singapore and Indian companies and funding will be provided for the final approved innovation projects,"" said MTI.  “Through this collaboration between the Department of Science and Technology and Enterprise Singapore, joint research and innovation projects between more Singapore and Indian corporates and startups will be co-funded to enable them to capture new business opportunities,"" said ESG assistant chief executive for innovation and enterprise Edwin Chow.  ""This is especially so in areas like the green economy, advanced manufacturing and agritech which are of mutual interest to both countries’ economic transformation and growth,"" he added. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/australias-agl-energy-rejects-35-billion-offer-investors-expect-more-2510341,"Australia's AGL Energy rejects $3.5 billion offer, investors expect more","Australia's biggest power producer AGL Energy Ltd on Monday (Feb 21) rejected a surprise US$3.54 billion takeover approach from billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and Canada's Brookfield Asset Management in favour of a plan to split in two this year. AGL said the A$7.50 apiece proposal from the Canadian group and Cannon-Brookes, Australia's second-richest man and co-founder of software firm Atlassian, at a 4.7 per cent premium to the stock's Friday close undervalued it. ""The proposal does not offer an adequate premium for a change of control and is not in the best interests of AGL Energy shareholders,"" AGL Chairman Peter Botten said. AGL's shares jumped as much as 13 per cent on Monday to a high of A$8.09, reflecting investors' view that a higher bid will emerge. The unsolicited cash proposal with an option for AGL shareholders to elect a scrip alternative provided limited other information about how the deal would be structured, Botten said. Investors see companies like AGL as tough to value with electricity prices highly volatile in the accelerating transition away from coal-fired generation. Brookfield and Cannon-Brookes would need a very low cost of capital to make the switch to renewables generate a good return, said Jason Teh, chief investment officer of Vertium Asset Management, which does not own AGL shares. ""What are they going to do? The transition from coal to renewables is going to be a huge challenge for AGL,"" Teh said. Brookfield said it would comment on its proposal soon. Cannon-Brookes and his investment vehicle Grok Ventures did not immediately respond to requests for comment. AGL, Australia's biggest polluter, has been hammered over the past few years by sliding power prices, with the influx of solar and wind power making coal-fired plants less economic to run 24 hours a day. To rebuild value, it plans to split into two companies, rebranding its coal-fired power generation business as Accel Energy and spinning off its retail arm and renewable energy business as AGL Australia by June. ""The board is confident that the demerger will create a strong future for both parts of the business,"" Botten said. It flagged earlier this month it would speed up the closure of its coal-fired generation by three years to 2045. AGL's Loy Yang A plant is scheduled to be the country's last coal-fired plant to switch off.  "

After flicking a digital switch to turn on the turbines in the first phase of the project, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed sought to assure those nations that his country did not wish to harm their interests. ""Ethiopia's main interest is to bring light to 60 per cent of the population who is suffering in darkness, to save the labour of our mothers who are carrying wood on their backs in order to get energy,"" Abiy said. His government says the project is key to its economic development, but Egypt and Sudan depend on the waters of the Nile and have worried it will affect them. Ethiopia, the second most populous country on the continent, has the second biggest electricity deficit in Africa according to the World Bank, with about two-thirds of the population of around 110 million lacking a connection to the grid. The project will ultimately cost US$5 billion when it is completed and become the biggest hydropower plant in Africa by generating 5,150 MW of electricity, some of which will be exported to neighbouring nations, the government says. The government has so far invested more than 100 billion Ethiopian birr (US$1.98 billion) in the project, state-affiliated FANA broadcaster reported. It is located at a place called Guba in the western Benishangul-Gumuz region.  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/carbon-tax-hike-emitters-improve-energy-efficiency-2508521,Emitters working on improving energy efficiency to deal with looming carbon tax hikes,"SINGAPORE: To deal with newly-announced carbon tax hikes that will take effect over the coming years, large emitters say they will continue improving energy efficiency, among other initiatives, to cut their emissions. Singapore’s carbon tax rate will go up from the current S$5 per tonne of emissions to between S$50 and S$80 by 2030, amid more ambitious climate goals announced as part of Budget 2022 on Friday (Feb 18). Rates will first be raised to S$25 per tonne of emissions in 2024, and again to S$45 per tonne in 2026. The tax is currently applied to facilities that directly emit at least 25,000 tCO2e of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per year. DBS’ Senior Economist Irvin Seah said this will create a “significant impact” on the economy, especially for the power generation, manufacturing, aviation and land transport sectors. This may in turn be passed on to consumers as higher prices, he said. One such large emitter that CNA spoke to, power generator and electricity retailer PacificLight, said the increases will certainly have “a direct impact” on operation costs. But it will deal with this by optimising the efficiency of its generating equipment, said CEO Yu Tat Ming. Mr Yu said that the firm has invested more than S$5 million in improving plant efficiency since 2013, which has helped cut its emissions by 1.5 per cent. It will also upgrade its plant next year with “the region’s first ever Advanced Turbine Efficiency Package (ATP)”. This will bring total carbon reduction to 40,000 tonnes per annum – equivalent to supplying carbon-free electricity to more than 20,000 Singapore households, he said. In addition, PacificLight has received an in-principle license for a pilot solar import project from Indonesia to Singapore, which will reduce carbon emissions by more than 357,000 tonnes per annum, said Mr Yu. As part of the Budget announcement on Friday, firms will also be allowed to use “high-quality” international carbon credits to offset up to 5 per cent of their taxable emissions from 2024. Mr Yu said PacificLight, which has been trading carbon credits since 2014, will likely make use of these offsets to optimise costs. Oil company ExxonMobil told CNA it supports an “explicit price on carbon to establish market incentives” and provide the clarity needed for investments. It has even set its own goal of reaching net-zero emissions from its operated assets by 2050, a company spokesman said. “We are taking a comprehensive approach to develop detailed emission-reduction roadmaps for our major operated assets including our integrated manufacturing complex in Singapore.” But given that Singapore has an export-oriented economy, it also noted the importance of ensuring that the carbon tax framework “safeguards competitiveness of trade-exposed industries”. As for oil company Shell, the firm “has always been supportive of putting a direct price on carbon emissions” as part of a broader framework for net-zero emissions, a spokesperson told CNA. It also welcomed the news that authorities will be using a large part of the carbon tax revenue to support companies to invest in low-carbon technologies. “This is critical as near-term competitiveness impact is real,” it said. It noted that Singapore exports most of its energy and chemical products, and has to compete with other countries that do not have a carbon price policy, or have “sophisticated mechanisms” to help their trade-exposed industries remain competitive, if they do. Shell added that it is in the process of transforming its business, moving away from traditional fuel production and instead embarking on businesses such as in circular chemical production. Ms Melissa Low, a research fellow at the National University of Singapore’s Energy Studies Institute described the carbon tax hikes as “aggressive”. On the issue of whether this will dampen Singapore’s competitiveness, Ms Low said it depends on what other countries will do in the coming years. “If other countries (adopt similar policies, and carbon prices) are rising at an accelerated rate as well, then everyone is on par with one another, and our goods and services might not be so expensive to the point where it becomes uncompetitive.” She added that having an ultimate range of S$50 to S$80 per tonne of emissions by 2030 is strategic, as it will “build in flexibility” for Singapore, depending on how the future plays out. Green advocates have welcomed the moves, calling them “a step in the right direction”. SG Climate Rally said the carbon tax is a “signal of our country’s priorities in making sure polluters pay their fair share”. On behalf of SG Youth for Climate Action (SYCA), youth delegate Swati Mandloi also noted that the new rates will move Singapore closer to the prices recommended by bodies such as the International Energy Agency and the World Bank by the end of the decade. But they also pointed out room for improvement. For instance, while Singapore has brought forward its net-zero target to by or around mid-century, it has not set an exact date, said Ms Swati. Doing so, she added, is important as it will “send a stronger message and enable a net-zero transition in line with the latest science”. SG Climate Rally echoed hopes that the Government will “commit fully to the 2050 date”. It also called on authorities to “enshrine this target by law”. Both green groups also raised concerns about the use of international carbon credits as offsets. While SYCA welcomed the move, it said it is “cautious” about this given that some carbon markets in the past have not delivered on their promises. “With the sector-based allowances and use of carbon offsets, it will be important that regulators are transparent and introduce healthy checks and balances to meaningfully deliver climate action.” SG Climate Rally added: “Given the prevalent issues surrounding the verifiability and integrity of the global carbon offsets market, proper scrutiny is needed to ensure that offsets don't give polluters the opportunity to evade their climate obligations.” Announcing the roadmap for the tax increases early will give companies time to plan ahead and “make the necessary investments” to become greener, said Deloitte Southeast Asia’s Tax & Legal Climate & Sustainability Leader, Wong Meng Yew. Firms should also see the journey to decarbonisation not just as “a matter of compliance”, but as a “timely opportunity” to adopt robust sustainability strategies for the long-term, said Schneider Electric’s cluster president for Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei, Yoon Young Kim. “Ultimately, the move to impose higher carbon tax will urge more companies to … step up their pace in making a low-carbon transition as they increasingly recognise the costs of inaction and the value of limiting emissions.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/singapore-budget-2022-carbon-tax-net-zero-climate-sustainability-goal-2506886,Commentary: Singapore’s climate ambition finally up to speed with international developments,"SINGAPORE: Singapore has made bold moves with revised carbon tax rates, and plans to achieve net-zero emissions by or around mid-century.  On Friday (Feb 18), Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong announced that Singapore’s carbon tax rate will be revised from S$5 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent to S$25 per tonne from 2024 and 2025. It’ll then increase to S$45 per tonne from 2026 to 2027 and fall within the range of S$50 to S$80 per tonne by 2030.  Admittedly, if asked last week what I thought the revised tax rate was going to be, I was quite certain it would be in the ballpark of S$10 to S$15 per tonne by 2030, as the Government had previously intended. Indeed, I’m glad to have been proven wrong.  Singapore introduced a carbon tax in 2019. The current tax rate is S$5 per tonne of emissions over a period of five years from 2019 to 2023.  Over two parliamentary motion debates on climate change in 2021, Members of Parliament called on the Government to review the tax level which many considered to be too low. Having organised youth-focused public consultation engagements to seek views on how the Singapore Green Plan and the carbon tax in 2021, I noted strong calls for a significantly higher carbon tax, among reducing waste and conserving our forests and biodiversity.  These calls for more ambition seem not to have gone unheard, which is a relief. Another major announcement is Singapore’s new net-zero target by or around mid-century. This is a massive improvement on its 2020 commitment to halve peak emissions from 65 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent to 33 million tonnes by 2050, then achieve net-zero emissions as soon as viable before 2100.  The big change in carbon taxes is a huge enabler. The strong political support behind Singapore’s Green Plans and calls by activists to get more audacious, as well as signals by youths they do not support fossil fuels and carbon-spewing industries is also part of the story.  But the big pull factor is the opportunities Mr Wong cited in transitioning to a green economy – in new technology like carbon capture and storage, and hydrogen, which can create investment and business opportunities as well as jobs of the future that will remain in high global demand in a low-carbon future. This bright future is one that is green. Singapore is among the 80-odd countries that have set net-zero targets, most by 2050. The increased ambition sends a clear signal that Singapore is serious about tackling climate change, and aligning with the science. An Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report states that, in order not to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius of global temperature increase, global net anthropogenic CO2 emissions should fall by about 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. With mitigation efforts underway, and with Article 6 rules on international cooperation on carbon markets agreed at COP26 last year, Mr Wong said Singapore is now in a position to raise its climate ambition. It is surprising that the carbon tax has increased aggressively. Many will be concerned about Singapore’s competitiveness and cost pass-through onto consumers.  The new carbon tax rates will have to be evaluated alongside Singapore’s suite of climate mitigation efforts across all sectors to understand its effectiveness and possible impact on competitiveness. The increase in the tax rate should create a stronger price signal to encourage large emitters to make energy efficiency improvements and decarbonise.  When it comes to competitiveness, much depends on how other economies implement domestic mitigation too. It is possible that making energy efficiency improvements and decarbonising earlier would make companies operating here more competitive in an increasingly carbon constrained world.  The carbon tax is therefore complementary to the suite of mitigation measures that Singapore has already introduced, including energy efficiency, solar photovoltaic deployment, green building performance standards, and a circular economy approach to waste and water.  All these abatement measures have to be considered in totality to understand whether they have real implications on Singapore’s emissions trajectory. It is important to consider the effects of the carbon tax on our economy, such as whether jobs will be displaced and if this leads to loss of competitiveness for our emissions-intensive, trade-exposed sectors.  There is also the concern of rising costs for businesses and households when raising the carbon tax. The government has said that they will enhance U-save rebates to help lower- and middle-income households shoulder higher utility bills, as the carbon tax will drive up electricity and petrol prices.  The higher carbon tax could be used to fund more social welfare measures, or put towards building a pipeline of talent and skilled experts in carbon services.  Another issue to be mindful of is the energy security risks of decarbonisation. As Singapore imports all of its energy, we remain vulnerable to supply shocks and price volatility of oil and natural gas.  Soon, Singapore will also import green electricity from its neighbours, and related infrastructure costs may be priced into our electricity price as well. We are in an increasingly carbon-constrained world, and so consumers and businesses should expect to pay a price on consumption. Instead of looking solely to the government to ease the burden of rising costs, everyone needs to be more mindful about what we consume. We must let go of the perception and belief that efforts to go green in our daily lives are inconvenient or difficult. In fact, using devices less not only helps us save on our electricity bills but will also likely improve our mental health and wellbeing.  Melissa Low is a Research Fellow at the Energy Studies Institute, National University of Singapore.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-blueprint-sustainable-air-hub-2498901,"Singapore developing blueprint for sustainable air hub, as it revives air travel","SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Transport and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) have started to put in place ""building blocks"" for a sustainable air hub, as Singapore revives air travel in the coming years, said CAAS on Tuesday (Feb 15).  With sustainability ""a key priority for Singapore's aviation sector"", the CAAS will engage industry stakeholders to ""canvass ideas and develop practical pathways to make greener air travel viable and accessible for all"". It has also set up a 20-member International Advisory Panel, CAAS added in a press release.  ""Pre-COVID, global aviation contributed about two per cent of global emissions. And once aviation resumes in the trajectory it was before the pandemic, then you must expect the emissions will continue to rise unless we do something about it,"" said Minister for Transport and Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations, S Iswaran.  ""For Singapore, we are a major international aviation hub. On one hand, sustainability of our air hub is a high priority. At the same time, we're very committed to doing our part towards sustainability of the global international aviation system.""   Mr Iswaran added that there is a need to bring all this together in an ""over-arching framework for the long term"", in the form of a sustainable air hub blueprint that will chart the pathways for achieving targets.  The blueprint for the air hub is expected to be ready in early 2023, ""given the urgency and the need to act decisively"", he said.  ""(The blueprint) will set medium-term (2030) and longer-term (2050) sustainability goals and identify practical, tangible pathways to achieve them. It will focus on the three key areas of airport, airline, and air traffic management, bringing together the various stakeholders,"" added CAAS in its press release.  It will also lay the foundation for four ""critical enablers"" that are needed to support and drive sector-wide decarbonisation efforts: Policy and regulation, industry development, infrastructure planning and provision, and jobs and skills.  In the end, sustainability must entail trade-offs, said Mr Iswaran. ""There would be economic costs, and there are costs at the individual level, the enterprise level, and ultimately at the system level. ""And that is exactly why we start with these kinds of panels and initiatives. Because we want to bring in the public sector-private sector partnership, and importantly, the commercial perspective. Because we need that commercial angle to ensure the viability of many of the ideas, especially those that we're looking at in the near-term."" At the national level, we also need to have ""a strong commitment"", noted Mr Iswaran.  ""The Singapore Green Plan is a clear statement and articulation of what Singapore stands for in this regard and how we want to move forward,"" he added. ""We do need to bring these together to the best of our ability, (and) ensure we're able to move forward in a sustainable way, but also in a manner that ensures economic viability taking into account the perspectives of all the stakeholders."" There are already existing ""building blocks"" in place for a sustainable air hub, said CAAS.  For instance, Singapore is one of the 107 states voluntarily participating in the pilot phase of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) to meet a global aspirational target of carbon-neutral growth from 2020. Besides fulfilling its own commitment, Singapore is also providing capacity building support to other countries to help them in their implementation of CORSIA. Singapore has also worked with other participating countries to develop a policy toolkit for sustainable aviation fuel, added CAAS. This toolkit aims to help policymakers around the world grow a sustainable aviation fuel supply, stimulate demand for such fuel and enable a healthy sustainable aviation fuel eco-system. The CAAS is also working with key industry players on various initiatives to decarbonise the sector, including the installation of solar panels, electrification of ground fleet, implementation of energy-efficient systems and the use of more renewable energy at Changi Airport.  Last week, CAAS and Singapore Airlines (SIA) announced that for a one-year period starting from the third quarter of this year, all SIA and Scoot flights out of Changi Airport will use ""a blend of refined jet fuel and neat sustainable aviation fuel"". ""This is expected to reduce about 2,500 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions over the one-year period,"" said CAAS.  Additionally, CAAS is tapping on ""new technologies and international collaboration"" to enhance air traffic management efficiency. This will reduce airborne time and fuel use. “While the immediate focus of the Singapore air hub is to revive air travel, we cannot lose sight of the longer-term challenge of climate change. Sustainability is a national priority for Singapore,"" said Mr Iswaran, who was at the International Advisory Panel's inaugural meeting. ""And the (air hub's blueprint) will articulate how Singapore can contribute to the decarbonisation of international aviation as well as our national sustainability efforts. This is a challenging endeavour especially at a time when aviation companies are still dealing with the effects of the pandemic. ""It will require strong public-private partnership and cross-sectoral collaboration to innovate and reinvent the aviation eco-system.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sustainability/svalbard-global-arctic-seed-vault-deposits-2495611,Arctic seed vault to receive rare deposits,"OSLO: A vault built on an Arctic mountainside to preserve the world's crop seeds from war, disease and other catastrophes will receive new deposits on Monday (Feb 14), including one from the first organisation that made a withdrawal from the facility. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault, on Spitsbergen island halfway between mainland Norway and the North Pole, is only opened a few times a year to limit its seed banks' exposure to the outside world. On Monday, gene banks from Sudan, Uganda, New Zealand, Germany and Lebanon will deposit seeds, including millet, sorghum and wheat, as back-ups to their own collections. The International Center for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas (ICARDA), which moved its headquarters to Beirut from Aleppo in 2012 because of the war in Syria, will deposit some 8,000 samples. ICARDA made the first seed withdrawal from the vault in 2015 to replace a collection damaged by the war, and two further withdrawals in 2017 and 2019 to rebuild its own collections, now held in Lebanon and Morocco. ""The fact that the seed collection destroyed in Syria during the civil war has been systematically rebuilt shows that the vault functions as an insurance for current and future food supply and for local food security,"" said Norwegian International Development Minister Anne Beathe Tvinnereim. The vault, which holds over 1.1 million seed samples of nearly 6,000 plant species from 89 seed banks globally, also serves as a backup for plant breeders to develop new crop varieties. The world used to cultivate over 6,000 different plants but UN experts say we now get about 40 per cent of our calories from three main crops - maize, wheat and rice - making food supplies vulnerable if climate change causes harvests to fail."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/f1-singapore-formula-one-carbon-footprint-environment-2487536,"Race to reduce Singapore F1's carbon footprint a good start, but experts are mixed on its impact","SINGAPORE: From replacing fossil fuels with more sustainable alternatives to going electric where possible, it seems like the Singapore Formula 1 Grand Prix is kicking climate action into higher gear. When the night race returns to the streets of Marina Bay in September – after a two-year hiatus due to the pandemic – a full sustainability audit will also be conducted, which could see data such as the amount of carbon emissions and waste generated by the event being measured and reported for the first time. The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) and race organiser Singapore GP said the audit will help to guide the development of other green initiatives that will be implemented over the next seven years under a renewed contract for Singapore to host the Formula 1 Grand Prix. Starting this year, two parties will work together to reduce the carbon footprint of the Singapore race. Responding to CNA’s queries, a spokesperson from Singapore GP said that the existing track lighting will be replaced with more energy-efficient LED lights from 2023, and that it will switch to electric or hybrid support vehicles where applicable. The hope is to make the entire event one of the most environmentally sustainable street circuits in the F1 calendar, tying in with the championship’s goal of becoming net-zero by 2030. However, while the sustainability audit and green initiatives are a step in the right direction, experts CNA spoke to were mixed on whether the efforts would be enough to reduce the gas-guzzling sport’s carbon footprint. An F1 report published in 2019 estimated that more than 256,000 tons of carbon emissions are generated each season, including direct and indirect emissions. That is roughly the equivalent of emissions produced by 55,600 cars each year.  Out of this, 45 per cent comes from air, sea and road transport required logistically to put on each race, with a further 27.7 per cent generated from the transport of personnel, promoters and partners. As the major sporting event takes place all over the world, it is not possible to eliminate emissions generated by logistics and transport completely, said Professor Vish S Viswanathan, director of the Centre for Business Sustainability at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). “To reduce emissions, (the organisers) could possibly consider and evaluate a modal shift for transport, meaning that instead of transporting car-related items by air, they can move towards less-carbon intensive modes of transport such as ocean freight,” he said. But with ocean freight being slower than air transport, Prof Viswanathan said this could pose a logistical and scheduling challenge for organisers, especially with the races taking place in quick succession and held all over the world. “This means that either there have to be custom-built vessels that complete the shipment of the items from one location to another very quickly, or there have to be duplicates of the cars and other related assets that are deployed only at alternative locations such as every second or third race venue,” he said, adding that this will provide a greater lead time for transport. “Having multiple sets of equipment means the manufacturing carbon footprint might go up a little bit so that's a trade-off they will have to make but it’s an area where they can actually think of solutions and work on it,” he added. Sustainability consultant K Sadashiv, who is a board director at sustainability non-profit Forum for the Future, said sourcing locally could also help to lower the number of items that need to be transported from overseas, further reducing emissions. As part of its sustainability plans, F1 also announced that it would move towards sustainable fuels. To do this, the championship is currently developing its own 100 per cent “sustainable” fuel, using components that come from either a carbon capture scheme, municipal waste or non-food biomass. It is currently in talks with companies about supplying fuel for the races, with an eye towards scaling up production for mainstream public use.  A working group, which includes power unit manufacturers and fuel suppliers, has also been established to form F1’s new engine regulations for 2025 that will include mandating a ”fully sustainable” fuel source. In the meantime, new regulations – which kick in this year – will force the F1 teams to freeze the development of engines, in a bid to reduce cost and reach carbon neutrality. Despite these efforts, some including world champion Lewis Hamilton and Aston Martin driver Sebastian Vettel have criticised the sport’s green push for not moving fast enough or being environmentally relevant. Echoing their sentiments, Associate Professor of Science, Technology and Society Winston Chow from the Singapore Management University (SMU) said while using ethanol or biofuels is a start, such fuels still emit greenhouse gases and require elements of carbon capture technology to be net-zero. If the goal is to advance the use of cleaner energy sources in general transportation, technology related to electric vehicles would be more relevant in the years to come as more countries switch from gasoline or diesel cars to electric vehicles, said Assoc Prof Chow. Ultimately, experts agreed that the commitment from F1, as well as measures to be implemented by SGP and STB, is “a start” and one that is aligned with Singapore’s national sustainability plan. By linking local tourism to the green economy, it also ensures that any action would not be dropped after one or two years, said Assoc Prof Chow. However, what is equally crucial is getting attendees to buy in on environmental sustainability, said Dr Nanthinee Jevanandam, director of sustainability think-tank Earthys. “The nature of events is that they tend to be quite indulgent and often generate large amounts of unnecessary waste, like leftover gift bags for attendees or materials used for the event set up,” said Dr Jevanandam. “So when organisers choose to go green and decide to do away with unnecessary items or opt for more sustainable options, organisers are concerned that event attendees may not appreciate this, which could affect their event experience. “But the flip side of this is that you also need the attendees to embrace going green in order for the event to be successful, so they actually play a very important role in the event’s push towards sustainability,” she added. “At the end of the day, we can't say we want to be 100 per cent green and just say no to everything, that's just not the direction to go,” said Dr Jevanandam. “It's about balance, so it's about doing the things that benefits the country but in a much more sustainable fashion.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/women-sustainability-chopvalue-evelyn-hew-recycled-chopsticks-2450766,Meet the Singaporean who turns your greasy disposable chopsticks into beautiful furniture,"If you have eaten at a restaurant, cafe or hospital coffee shop recently, you may be surprised to know that your greasy disposable chopsticks may already be displayed at someone else’s house today. Perhaps it is part of the wall decor. Or perhaps it is a small table or shelf. That is what ChopValue Singapore is about. Twice a week, two team members spend an entire day travelling to 100 restaurants and three hospitals around Singapore picking up our trash – hundreds of thousands of used chopsticks. They then upcycle these into gorgeous furniture. Helming this new franchise in Singapore since April 2021 is Evelyn Hew. The 37-year-old entrepreneur imported this sustainable business all the way from Vancouver, Canada. “We have always thought that Singapore lacked natural resources. Actually, we do have resources. It is our trash,” she said. “On a farm, you produce and harvest crops. In a city, where we have so many humans closely packed together, what you produce is waste. If you are creative, you can transform this waste into resources. That is what ‘urban harvesting’ is about,” she added. Hew and her team have since salvaged and upcycled 1.2 million pairs of chopsticks from people's dinner plates, saving them from the incinerator. FROM SHOPPER TO ECO-ENTREPRENEUR Hew was not always a sustainability champion. In her 20s, she was a voracious shopper with closets stacked with clothes, many unworn, with tags still intact. However, having her first child in 2014 prompted her to reconsider the impact of present-day consumption on future generations. A year later, in 2015, the serial entrepreneur founded SmartCity Solutions, offering Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions to public waste collectors to digitally transform the industry. “That was when I realised how much waste we are creating,” she recalled. “As part of our (service), we deployed RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) tags on recycling bins and witnessed firsthand how badly contaminated they were. If dirty plastic bags or food waste were found in the recycling bin, the entire bin would be contaminated and disposed of,” she said. This prompted her to search for upcycling solutions that would address the waste and contamination problem. One day, she chanced upon ChopValue Canada on Facebook, and learnt about their model for collecting, sanitising and upcycling used chopsticks. Something clicked. Chopsticks are a daily necessity in many Asian cultures, such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean. And in Singapore, because of our dabao (takeaway) culture, many use disposable chopsticks. “We cut down bamboo, birch and pine to make them, fly them 3,000 to 5,000 km from China to Singapore, and just use them for 20 to 30 minutes. Don’t you feel it’s a huge waste?” she asked. TURNING TRASH TO FURNITURE Truly, even new disposable chopsticks have never been considered beautiful or coveted by any stretch, much less soiled chopsticks discarded after a meal. However, via a fine-tuned process that combines technology and craftsmanship, ChopValue transforms them into chic minimalist furniture and home decor, each distinct with its unique grain. Every piece tells a story of Singapore’s food and dabao culture, as well as its own cool sustainability journey, interweaving the dining experience and memories of hundreds of diners. The best part? These waste products are upcycled with minimal water, zero toxins and less carbon emission. After collection, the used chopsticks are sent to a micro-factory, coated in a toxin-free resin and baked to 200 degrees Celsius to disinfect them, instead of using water. Then, they are ultra-compressed into highly densified tiles for optimal strength and durability. A single coaster uses as many as 76 chopsticks. Prices range from S$158 for the wall decor set to S$1,288 for the home office desk. Though costlier than fast furniture, such as those made of plywood, they are comparably priced to well-made oak or teak furniture. Of course, actual prices also do not reflect the cost to the environment. Upcycled chopstick-made tiles take mere days to harvest and process, as opposed to the 10 to 30 years it takes to grow trees from scratch for lumbering, and the eco-cost of deforestation.  CHALLENGES OF A SUSTAINABILITY ENTREPRISE Hew had to overcome several obstacles to transform vision into reality. As part of outreach, she contacted innumerable restaurants and met many managers with her sustainability pitch, and all in the middle of the pandemic.  Several rejected the idea because they were concerned it would be time consuming. She was however, heartened by the number of buy-ins.  Among the first restaurants to join in the chopstick collection were Nara Japanese Restaurant, Yamato Japanese Restaurant and Tatsuya. The three participating hospitals include Singapore General Hospital, KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital and Sengkang General Hospital. Over the past four months, Hew managed to increase the chopsticks collected fivefold, from 100,000 pairs in September 2021 to 500,000 pairs in January 2022. However, she would sometimes find other trash in the chopsticks recycle bins. So after collection, she and her team had to sift out sundry items such as used tissue paper. Staffing was another problem. “We don’t have a lot of factories dealing with woodwork in Singapore, so there were a lot of things we had to learn from scratch from the Vancouver team,” she said. Unfortunately, COVID-19 got in the way of the knowledge transference. When she booked tickets for the Vancouver ChopValue team to visit Singapore in December last year, they were unexpectedly turned away at Vancouver International Airport. The team had to learn all aspects of production via video calls, including how to adapt the material for Singapore’s weather and humidity. A CULTURE OF URBAN HARVESTING ChopValue Singapore currently has five products on their website, including wall decor items, shelves and tables. Over the next few months, they will be expanding their range to 50 products, including smaller items such as handphone and iPad stands, and cheese boards. They also offer custom designs at a slight premium. Moving forward, Hew also hopes to expand the collection drive to coffeeshops, hawker centres, households and offices by enlisting the help of government agencies, SembWaste, town councils and community clubs. Hew’s children have been her greatest inspiration on this sustainability journey. The mother-of-three said she often joins her children on bottle recycling campaigns organised by their school and estate, washing the bottles and dropping them into dedicated bins. “I remember a comment from my eldest child Vera. When we dropped off the recyclables, she commented: “Why do I have to do this? Will you buy me a toy if I do?” That is when I realised that it was an actual depiction of the recycling scene in Singapore – people are motivated to recycle when incentivised,” she reflected. Her goal: To motivate others to upcycle by transforming the humblest of waste materials – disposed chopstick stained with shoyu or char kway teow – into a beautifully designed home collection.  She hopes it will inspire other businesses to think about other materials from the waste stream that they can work with. “That way, maybe future textbooks will teach that Singapore no longer lacks resources,” she mused.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/indonesia-runs-early-tests-produce-palm-oil-gasoline-2458666,Indonesia runs early tests to produce palm oil gasoline,"JAKARTA: Indonesia has conducted early tests to produce gasoline made from palm oil, its energy ministry said on Tuesday (Jan 25), as it seeks to expand use of the vegetable oil in its energy sector. To absorb more of its palm oil output and slash fuel imports, the world's biggest producer of the oil in 2020 launched a mandatory B30 biodiesel, which is 30 per cent palm oil, one of the highest palm oil concentrations used in a biofuel globally. Indonesia aims to increase the palm oil content in the biodiesel and use it to produce other fuels. It conducted a test flight using jet fuel mixed with palm oil last year and plans to do road tests for biodiesel containing 40 per cent palm fuel next month. ""We must work to become independent in areas that are important for our nation, such as the energy sector. We have various energy sources that have not been fully utilised,"" energy minister Arifin Tasrif said in a statement. Biodiesel makes up around 38 per cent of Indonesia's domestic palm oil consumption last year, the Indonesia Palm Oil Association estimated. Arifin urged the Bandung Institute of Technology, which has been leading the fuel development, to scale up and speed up the testing, so the results can be a parameter in a feasibility study and engineering design for a planned production facility on Sumatra island."

Why not take your cue from what some familiar faces are doing online. As part of Mediacorp’s CNA Green Plan campaign, 15 personalities from CNA, The Celebrity Agency and Bloomr.SG, have been sharing some of their personal hacks and tips, and encouraging their followers to take part.  The island-wide campaign to spread awareness of Singapore’s Green Plan 2030 was launched last month and is rolling out in phases, with the first being an ongoing series of public engagement activities on the ground and online – including regular shout-outs from some of your popular influencers, DJs and newscasters. You can find out more about what the campaign is all about here (which also includes a chance to win some prizes). In the meantime, scroll down for ways to help the environment. GLENDA CHONG: TAKE A 5-MINUTE SHOWER WITHOUT A HEATER “By cutting your shower time by 1 minute, you can save 9 liters of water,” shared the news presenter, who even offered a playlist to “time yourself” while showering to these songs: ""Clocks by Coldplay or my favourite No Diggity by Blackstreet"". JEAN DANKER: EXPLORE A NATURE TRAIL The Class 95 DJ opted for something more active. “Really love the trails along #Thompson, from MacRitchie to Windsor Nature Park,” she wrote. If you’re ever in the area, keep an eye out and you might just spot her. STEVEN CHIA: VISIT YOUR COMMUNITY GARDENS There’s definitely one near you – and for Talking Point host Steven Chia, it’s in Bukit Panjang.  “I found out that Bukit Panjang has a community garden trail which links to 11 community gardens. Most of them grow herbs and leafy vegetables like Kailan, Lettuce and Xiao Bai Cai,” he wrote, showing photos of his family’s day out. DANIEL MARTIN: WHIP UP A MEAL WITH ORGANIC PRODUCE “Nothing beats a healthy home-cooked meal!” wrote the CNA938 presenter, while showing off his efforts at home and offering a lead to Choa Chu Kang residents: There’s an organic food store called Farm To Market to check out.  ROYCE LEE: CONSIDER SECOND-HAND AND VINTAGE ITEMS The Bloomr.SG video creator’s suggestion for going green? Opt for cool-looking vintage items when buying stuff, taking a vintage-themed cafe at Tanjong Pagar as a source of inspiration. “This hidden gem reduces consumption by thrifting instead of buying something brand new all the time!” ANAND K AND TREV THAM: GO ON A PLANT-BASED DIET Like Daniel Martin, the Vasantham personality went the food-slash-cooking route, posting a photo to boast about his culinary skills making a “delicious vegan burger” while doing his shopping around the Katong area. Meanwhile, Bloomr.SG’s Trev Tham opted for dumplings instead – and even threw in some nice memories about making these with his mum.  TIFFANIE: RECYCLE, RECYCLE, RECYCLE Finally, another Bloom.SG personality gave a shout-out to one of the most common ways of going green – recycling. “One of my goals for 2022 is to strive for a zero-waste lifestyle, and I have been going around collating all the recyclable waste (especially parcels boxes) to do some recycling,” wrote Tiffanie."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/chinese-new-year-sustainable-fashion-sustainability-clothes-shopping-2440706,Commentary: Why I break with tradition and wear secondhand outfits for Chinese New Year,"SINGAPORE: My family used to detest my insistence on wearing secondhand clothes for the Chinese New Year. My mother would ask: “Why don’t you wear new clothes?” My grandmother would chime in, in dialect: “Who knows where these came from?” Their voices would be laced with disapproval but mostly disappointment.  The first time I defied the longstanding – and as I learned, unspoken until you break it – tradition of wearing new clothes for Chinese New Year was in 2019. That year, I had thrifted a dress from the local thrift shop New2U, described, quite aptly, on Google Maps as an “unpretentious boutique”.  The dress was a soft cotton blend, white and strapless, lined with pink satin across the top and bottom. It had a watercolour print of a pink flower, repeated several times all over the dress, with spots of green for the leaves and abstract, gentle black lines. Truth be told, it didn’t fit me perfectly, but I liked it very much. At the time, my family hadn’t quite warmed up to the idea of me wearing secondhand clothes, and when it came to (inauspiciously) wearing it on the Chinese New Year, even less so. Wearing new clothes, as we all know, symbolises a fresh start, a herald for good fortunes in the new year. That’s the reason they gave me, at least, for the disapproval. But looking back now, I think there were other reasons for that. One of them is the fact that they grew up poor. Choosing not to wear new clothes when we could afford them was an affront of sorts. Another reason – probably the bigger one – was that they simply stigmatised secondhand clothing.  But we live in a world of ridiculous overconsumption and overproduction. It’s absurd that we make or buy new clothes when there’s an excess of them. If the fashion industry stopped producing clothes now, it’s likely we still would have enough clothes for a few generations at least.  The evidence? Mountains of discarded, unwanted clothing piling up across the world. In November last year, photos of clothes piling up in the driest desert in the world, Chile’s Atacama, went viral on Instagram. According to Al Jazeera, secondhand and unsold clothing from Europe, Asia and the United States, arrive in Chile to be resold around Latin America. These mounds of clothing in the desert are leftovers that nobody wants.  When we “donate” to “charity”, unfortunately, not all clothes are repurposed “for good”. When there’s an excess of donations (which happens much more often than you think), the wearable but unwanted clothes are exported to countries in Southeast Asia, South Asia, Africa and more.  The secondhand markets that have proliferated in these regions in response to our waste crisis aren’t good news. The sheer volumes in which these clothes arrive have made the clothing virtually valueless, and because of the infant state of the textile recycling industry and technology, there’s a lot of waste that we don’t know what to do with. This waste ultimately destabilises entire economies and puts families and communities who have to deal with it in precarious economic situations. This is an incredibly big problem, of course, and the solutions required for that are big too. But in the meantime, what’s within our reach is small. We can ask ourselves questions like: Do we really need new clothes? How can I better love and care for the garments I do have? How can we keep more of these garments in circulation within our communities, and not irresponsibly dumped to other countries via the global secondhand trade?  All of this is not to say that we should start the conversation on Chinese New Year with all this information about the truth behind fashion’s waste crisis. I didn’t dump all these facts on my relatives over reunion dinner, nor did I attempt to argue that the tradition didn’t make sense. I don’t imagine that either of those would have worked out well. Instead, our best bet this festive season is seeing it as an opportune time to engage our families in some accidental environmentalism. Over the years, I kept showing up to subsequent family occasions in secondhand clothes that I procured from all over Singapore, and made it a point to say that they were secondhand. With every outfit – a red dress with a vintage-looking print, a two-layered dress with dainty flowers and a pretty neckline, a navy jumpsuit, and many more – they asked fewer and fewer questions, and eventually came around. With the exorbitant amounts of clothing that exists, the truth is beautiful, more-than-wearable secondhand clothes can be found easily. My greatest finds have come from The Fashion Pulpit, an especially suitable location to bring your entire family to be convinced that secondhand doesn’t have to mean second-best. There’s also Carousell – which takes a fair amount of digging, but remains an affordable option always – and various, smaller local thrift shops. What helped me make my case, too, was my suggestion one year that I should just wear a hand-me-down cheongsam from my mother, who has a habit of buying new ones every Chinese New Year. Coming from her daughter that she had expected to ditch tradition, the idea was more than welcome, and I did eventually wear one of hers. I guess all of my efforts eventually paid off because even though they haven’t quite understood the overproduction and overconsumption crisis quite yet, at least my secondhand outfits aren’t met with disapproval nor disappointment. I asked my mother about her cheongsam-buying habit this year and she said that maybe she wouldn’t buy a new one this year. “Not like I get any luckier with a new cheongsam anyway,” she said. It’s a start.

It comes after a coalition of students in Singapore released a 68-page report on Monday (Jan 17), detailing ""extensive"" links between the fossil fuel industry and local universities in areas including finance and management. The report found that NUS and NTU both have endowment funds that are ""indirectly"" invested in fossil fuels. The other four universities contacted - SMU, SUTD, SIM Global Education and Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) - did not disclose their exposure to fossil fuel-linked assets.  For NUS, the report estimated that this sum was ""at least S$59 million"", based on a statement given by NUS Investment Office in March 2019 which said that the university's indirect investment in fossil fuels made up a ""low single digit"" percentage of its total endowment fund. Responding to queries from CNA, NUS said it adopts a “responsible investment strategy” with a focus on ensuring that its investments generate income to support its activities while closely aligning to principles of environmental sustainability and social responsibility.  It added that in 2021, it began a policy that incorporates environmental sustainability, and also stated its support in the transition to a greener and more sustainable environment. “We will continue to encourage our fund managers to divest from polluting assets,” said an NUS spokesperson.  Meanwhile, NTU said its investments enable the university to maintain a “steady stream of funds” to support its long-term strategic growth, while guarding against disruptions such as significantly increasing tuition fees during economic downturns. It said its investment framework and strategic asset allocations are closely aligned with the university’s broader strategic vision.  “The University’s investment fund does not specifically target the fossil fuel industry,” said an NTU spokesperson. “Environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations are carefully integrated into the investment management process to balance the University’s sustainability objectives with its fiscal health and financial outcomes for the portfolio and endowment fund over the long term.”  In October last year, NTU announced plans to halve its carbon emissions by 2035, as part of a 15-year sustainability plan. SMU said it is actively developing its approach to environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues on a university wide basis, of which responsible investment is one important element.  “We have initiated a process which will take us forward in important ways in the short, medium and long term,” said SMU. "

Titled Fossil-Fuelled Universities, the 68-page report highlighted linkages between the fossil fuel industry and universities in areas including finance and management. It was published by Students for a Fossil Free Future (S4F), a coalition made up of 40 students from the National University of Singapore (NUS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore Management University (SMU), Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) and Yale-NUS College. According to the report, NUS and NTU both have endowment funds that are ""indirectly"" invested in fossil fuels. For NUS, this sum is ""at least S$59 million"" – a figure the report deduced from a statement given by NUS Investment Office in March 2019 that the university's indirect investment in fossil fuels made up a ""low single digit"" percentage of its total endowment fund which, as of 2021, stood at S$5.9 billion. NTU's investments had ""minimal exposure to the fossil fuel industry"" but the report was unable to put a figure to it as the university did not disclose the size of its exposure compared to its total endowment fund of S$2.5 billion. The other four local universities contacted by the student coalition - SMU, SUTD, SIM Global Education and Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) - did not disclose their exposure to fossil fuel-linked assets, the report said. ""By investing in the fossil fuel industry, universities both financially support the industry and demonstrate confidence in the industry to deliver long-term returns,"" the authors said. They added that divesting from fossil fuels will send a ""clear social signal"" that continued fossil-fuel reliance is ""backward-looking"", and companies that do so will be left behind. Beyond fossil fuel-linked investments, the report also raised concerns about possible ""conflicts of interest"", pointing out the presence of fossil fuel industry leaders - past and present - sitting on university boards. ""We also recognise that Board members may have ceased working for fossil fuel companies precisely to pursue more sustainable careers or align their careers with their personal values,"" said the coalition. ""We encourage such members to share about their decision or rationale with the university or public. ""Given that Board members have significant social standing and influence, such sharing will increase the importance which the public, students, and educators place on sustainability and combating climate change,"" the report added. The report also highlighted linkages in academia, where some scholarships and awards were funded by companies with links to the fossil fuel industry. The report gave examples of bursaries awarded by the likes of Shell, ExxonMobil, Keppel Offshore & Marine, Glencore and Geo Energy Group, a coal mining and trading company. The report was also critical of what it termed the ""co-opting"" of campus spaces by fossil fuel companies. It gave the example of the ExxonMobil Campus Concerts series in NUS, a sponsorship that started in 1986. While the report recognised the value of the event in giving students opportunities to put up music performances, it said the sponsorship also allowed ExxonMobil to ""promote itself to a wide university audience (and) cultivate a positive image and downplay their environmentally and socially harmful activities"". ""These companies can thus capitalise on universities' reputations to improve their own brand image among university or public stakeholders who attend these events and use these spaces,"" the report said. ""Such practices also normalise the ubiquitous presence of fossil fuel companies that are active contributors to the climate crisis."" The report drew a parallel between fossil fuel companies putting their names behind campus events and the Singapore Government's ban on cigarette companies sponsoring and publicising corporate social responsibility activities. ""Fossil fuel companies who have not credibly committed to a post-carbon transition should not be allowed to purchase positive branding and social acceptance from our universities,"" the report said. ""The withdrawal of such positive branding, and associated social legitimacy, may incentivise these companies to seriously reconsider their core operations."" CNA has sought comment from the universities named in the report. The report presented a set of recommendations for universities to address the fossil fuel industry’s ""associations"" with ""professional development functions"" of the universities. They include divesting all financial holdings from fossil fuel companies and fossil fuel-linked assets by 2030, as well as developing plans to secure alternative modes of funding from companies committed to reducing carbon emissions. The report also called for climate crisis education to be implemented in all universities in one to two years. The student coalition described the report as a ""ground-up, independent research effort"" by more than 60 people, including current students, alumni, academics, civil society members and lawyers. ""This extensive work is the culmination of three years of effort, and testifies to the urgency and severity all of us across generations feel towards the climate crisis and transitioning away from fossil fuels,"" said Mr Shawn Ang, a member of the S4F team. ""As students, we're constantly worried about backlash, censorship, and reprisal from publicly questioning the status quo,"" said Mr Ang, who is a third-year undergraduate student at NTU. ""Yet, we press on and dedicate countless hours, weekends, and months of our lives to this, knowing that our short window of time to act to ensure our planet remains habitable is almost gone. We cannot rest without doing everything we can."" The release of the report on Monday also marked the start of a two-week campaign, which aims to get universities to be more active and to take bold steps to address the climate crisis. As part of this, students, professionals, university leaders and the public will be invited to join discussions online and across local campuses about the report's findings and recommendations. ""What's more important than getting the report out is trying to generate some excitement and discussion over the issues that we're raising,"" said Ms Ning Yiran, who is also a member of the S4F team. ""We are not trying to dictate what schools should do but we actually want to start the conversation about the transition away from fossil fuels and how universities can play a leading role."" Editor’s note: An earlier version of this story said NUS had endowment funds with at least S$5.9 million indirectly invested in fossil fuels. The correct figure should be S$59 million. We apologise for the error."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/climate-change-singapore-economy-carbon-emissions-2418936,"Commentary: As carbon emissions rebound after COVID-19 dip, talk of building back better may ring hollow","SINGAPORE: The world has observed a 1.1 degrees Celsius temperature rise above pre-industrial levels, with feedback cycles and polar amplification resulting in a rise as high as 3 degrees Celsius in the Arctic. The last decade was the hottest in 125,000 years. Since the mid-1990s, we’ve lost around 28 trillion tonnes of ice which is causing sea levels to rise, with today’s melt rate standing at 1.2 trillion tonnes a year. The World Bank estimates that if climate change is left unchecked, it will push 132 million people into poverty in the next decade and by 2050 displace more than 216 million people from their homes. Scientists repeat the same data and alarming predictions time and again. We need to halve global carbon emissions by 2030 and reach net zero emissions by 2050. But achieving these goals requires an effort unlike any that humanity has undertaken before. Meanwhile, poorer countries who have contributed the least to cumulative emissions have the most to lose from a changing climate. In 2020, global carbon emissions fell more than 5 per cent due to COVID-19 and the resulting economic crisis. But any impact on carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations – the result of cumulative past and current emissions – is in fact no bigger than the normal year-to-year fluctuations in the carbon cycle and the high natural variability in carbon sinks like vegetation. Despite 2020's reverse trend, 2021 emissions are expected to again grow by nearly 5 per cent, to 33 billion tonnes. CO2 concentrations are currently near 420 parts per million (ppm for short), setting a record high amount despite the ongoing pandemic. The last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was 3 million to 5 million years ago, when the temperature was 2 to 3 degrees Celsius warmer and sea level was 15 to 25 metres higher than now. Climate change is driven by the combustion of fossil fuels, which contain carbon that plants pulled out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis over many millions of years. Fossil fuels are consumed at a rate of 171,000kg of coal, 11.6 million litres of gas, and 186,000 litres of oil per second. In 2019, global carbon emissions from fossil fuels and industry reached a high of 36 billion tonnes. The carbon-based fossil fuels are used for transportation, electrical generation, cement manufacturing and more. The climate crisis caused by carbon-based fuels is amplified by deforestation, agriculture, and many other practices. Each year we pump more CO2 into the atmosphere than natural processes can remove, causing global emission levels to rise. Over the past 60 years, the annual rate of increase in atmospheric CO2 is roughly 100 times faster than the increases that occurred during the last ice age. The total warming effect from human-generated greenhouse has increased by 45 per cent over 1990 to 2019. Progress in mitigating this threat is intermittent at best, with CO2 emissions continuing to rise. Given the astronomical amount of CO2 we emit yearly, structural changes to the economy are needed, and not just behavioural changes such as flying or driving less. Most of the fall and subsequent rebound of CO2 emissions has come from road transport. Deserted streets and empty highways swiftly became the norm during lockdowns, as people were ordered to stay at home except for emergencies. The actions that do make a difference include investment in renewable energy, low-carbon infrastructure, and plans to make buildings more energy efficient.  Renewable energy is becoming more and more affordable. The costs of solar and wind have fallen dramatically in recent years and will continue to do so. But even though we know what to do, the carbon intensity of the energy system has remained unchanged since 1990. Global fossil fuel consumption subsidies increased by 50 per cent from 2016 to 2018. While coal-fired generation fell in 2020, the increases of the previous few years offsets this, rendering the level of coal generation no different from that of 2015. The science of climate change describes a range of possible futures, which are largely dependent on the degree of action or inaction in the face of a warming world. The policies implemented at COP26 will have far-reaching effects. At COP26, governments had to make progress in closing three major gaps: A gap in targets to reduce emissions, a gap in rules to deliver and monitor progress, and a gap in financing climate solutions. We expected leaders to agree to a step change in the pace and scale of climate action. But based on nations that submitted targets, the world is now on track to warm 2.4 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times by the end of this century. That is a far cry from the 2015 Paris climate deal overarching limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius or even its fallback limit of 2 degrees Celsius. This was recognised in the final agreed COP26 document by including a pledge that revised (and more ambitious) plans for cutting emissions are to be submitted by each nation in a year’s time. The COVID-19 pandemic is not a solution for climate change.  But the needed changes are economically affordable, technically possible and would affect our everyday life only marginally.  The world’s largest economies are spending trillions of dollars to help their economies recover from the COVID-19 pandemic but aren’t investing enough in a green recovery. According to the latest UN Environment Programme Emissions Gap Report, of the US$16.7 trillion that has been spent globally to May 2021 on COVID-19 recovery packages, only US$438 billion is likely to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Halting the climate crisis is still possible if we scale up the global response. But the window is closing fast.  Armed with education about how the Earth works, if we act boldly and swiftly, if we set aside our political interests in favour of the air that our young people will breathe, and the food they will eat, and the water they will drink; if we think about them and their hopes and dreams, then we will act, and it won’t be too late.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/carbon-tax-financial-support-firms-time-adapt-2431166,"Firms will have time to adapt to carbon tax changes, authorities to provide financial support: Gan Kim Yong","SINGAPORE: Adjustments in Singapore’s carbon tax should be calibrated and made carefully so as to allow businesses enough time to adapt and stay competitive, said Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong in Parliament on Wednesday (Jan 12). Setting the correct carbon price will guide investment decisions and spur companies to decarbonise, but it can also bring about higher costs for businesses and consumers, he noted. “We should calibrate and pace the adjustment carefully to give companies sufficient time to adapt, put in place decarbonisation measures and stay competitive,” said Mr Gan. Authorities will complement the carbon tax with financial support for businesses, he said, citing the S$180 million Enterprise Sustainability Programme which was rolled out last October. The Government will also consider how to help ease cost increases, especially for lower-income households, as a higher carbon tax will have an “indirect impact” on households, the minister said. For instance, when the carbon tax was first introduced in 2019, the Government provided additional U-Save utility rebates for three years, he noted. A programme that provides eligible households with vouchers to offset the cost of energy-efficient appliances was also subsequently introduced. Mr Gan was responding to a motion on climate change moved by Members of Parliament (MPs) from the People’s Action Party, calling for the Government to enhance green financing, create more green jobs, among others. In a wide-ranging debate that lasted more than five hours, a central focus was on increasing carbon taxes, seen as a critical tool in Singapore’s transition to a greener future. The country’s existing carbon tax, which will be in place until 2023, is currently pegged at S$5 per tonne of emissions. Finance Minister Lawrence Wong has said that a revised carbon tax rate for 2024 will be announced in this year’s Budget. MPs who spoke during the debate, such as Mr Louis Ng (PAP-Nee Soon), agreed that the current carbon tax was too low. Mr Ng said the tax rate, which is “the most powerful tool” to slash emissions, will have to be raised “significantly”. Its scope can also be expanded, he said. At the moment, Singapore's carbon tax applies to all facilities that produce greenhouse gas emissions of 25,000 tonnes or more a year. This covers around 50 large emitters that contribute to 80 per cent of Singapore’s total carbon emissions. “We should be aiming for a higher coverage,” said Mr Ng, adding that smaller emitters with at least 2,000 tonnes of emissions are already considered as “reportable facilities” and are paying the costs of monitoring and measuring their emissions. “Given that any additional compliance costs would likely be minimal, it makes sense for the carbon tax to cover all reportable facilities,” he added. “Emitters, small and large, have a role to play.” Mr Saktiandi Supaat (PAP-Bishan-Toa Payoh) also suggested establishing a fixed formula for the carbon tax rate to evolve over a longer period, which would help firms project their potential expenses and plan accordingly. Though some experts have suggested aiming for a carbon price of US$50 to US$75 per tonne of carbon dioxide by 2030, he stressed the pace of increase must be carefully decided. He suggested first setting the carbon tax level at least around US$8 to US$9 per tonne of emissions “or only slightly higher to inject some urgency for emitters to accelerate their decarbonising plans”. This price floor is where the voluntary market is valuing and trading carbon credits, he said. MP Liang Eng Hwa (PAP-Bukit Panjang) noted that businesses will face transition costs such as higher capital outlays and compliance costs, against a backdrop of supply-chain disruptions and slower global growth. It is thus pivotal to help businesses “overcome the initial steep challenges” in this transition, he said. For instance, the tax increase should be progressively rolled out with a clear timeline. It should also come with support from the Government, he said, citing measures such as increased funding support to help industries improve energy efficiency. In addition, ample time for adjustments should be given to businesses, said MPs Foo Mee Har (PAP-West Coast) and Mariam Jaafar (PAP-Sembawang). Ms Foo cited Sweden as an example, which she said took three decades of phased implementations before reaching its current carbon pricing “without haemorrhaging economic developments”. “A clear long-term trajectory of the expected changes to carbon tax will be key to help companies make the business case to adopt new green technologies and make the necessary investment,” she added. Mr Ng and Ms Foo also suggested that additional tax revenue collected from the increase in carbon taxes be channelled back to those affected, as subsidies to cope with higher costs during the transition period, or as incentives for companies to adopt green technologies. Describing the carbon tax as “central” to Singapore’s climate mitigation strategy, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu also agreed that “a stronger price signal” is needed over time to make companies take bolder steps towards decarbonisation. But she reiterated the need to balance the coverage of the tax with potential administrative costs for businesses. The existing carbon tax threshold ensures the tax is applied at “key nodes” and flows through to the rest of the economy, she said. “This reduces the administrative load on small emitters, especially (small and medium-sized enterprises) to measure, report and verify their emissions.” But she agreed on the need to support companies on their decarbonisation journey using revenue from the carbon tax. “In fact, for the first five years, we are prepared to spend more than we collect, to incentivise the adoption of energy-efficient processes and other worthwhile abatement projects,” she said, adding that some revenue will also be used to help households. Ms Fu added that additional funds have also been channelled towards research and development for low-carbon technologies and urban solutions."

Singapore will also put in place measures to raise the efficiency of existing data centres over time, he added. As of last year, the country has more than 70 operational data centres with a total IT capacity of about 1,000 megawatts. Data centres form the backbone of a booming digital economy around the world, but they are also huge energy hogs. Everything from the servers, storage equipment and cooling infrastructures have a large appetite for electricity and water. Singapore has been mulling a more sustainable approach for the growth of data centres here. It embarked on a review of the industry in 2019 and imposed a “temporary pause” on the building of new data centres. Mr Gan said the review was necessary due to data centres being intensive users of resources. “We had to find a way to manage the growth of data centres in a sustainable manner consistent with our climate change commitments,” he said. He noted that this review was recently completed and authorities will engage the industry soon to share details and gather feedback."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/chinese-new-year-digital-red-packets-digitalisation-sustainability-2425366,Commentary: Printing money for Chinese New Year hongbao is just too costly,"SINGAPORE: With the Chinese New Year just around the corner, we recently overheard people engaged in a spirited discussion at a neighbourhood coffee shop about needing to make online reservations for new notes before queuing up to collect them at the bank.  They were agonising over the hassle just to dole out hongbao (red packets) over the festive season. This ritual of packet gifting is not unique to the Chinese. During Hari Raya Puasa (Eid al-Fitr) observed by Muslims, green packets containing gifts of cash are handed out. Deepavali also sees purple packets exchanging Hindu hands.  One feature common to all is a distinctive cultural preference for crisp new notes, fresh from the bank, including the fragrance that comes with it. It is captivating that this tradition of giving physical new notes has somehow withstood the test of time and modern technology.  Convincing the coffeeshop folks to reuse notes or even gift “e-hongbao” is probably an impossible task. What’s even more surprising that these were not older Singaporeans but young-looking people in their 30s who are probably tech-savvy. Why this hesitation? E-payments have gained traction in Singapore with the proliferation of services such as PayNow, PayLah, and GrabPay.  The pandemic has only accelerated the growth of this trend as businesses and banks encouraged consumers to switch to e-payment for contactless transactions.  With smartphone use ubiquitous, most of us should be no stranger to e-payment services. Many of us in Singapore might even be avid everyday users of such services.  This might be the case in the years ahead, given plans to turbocharge e-payments, on the back of a national drive which saw more than half of hawkers offering e-payments last year. A scheme providing S$130 million (US$96 million) in Community Development Council vouchers for use at participating heartland shops and hawker centres may also speed up consumer adoption. With the coming Chinese New Year, the Monetary Authority of Singapore has encouraged the use of used notes or switching to e-hongbao for two reasons: First, to support sustainability and second, to understandably prevent overcrowding in banks during the pandemic.  But switching to e-hongbao in the name of sustainability may be hard for some, who might feel as if they’re jettisoning their cultural traditions for the sake of convenience and modernity. Where did this tradition of giving out hongbao come from? Legend has it that there was a demon named Sui who went around terrorising children.  To ward off Sui, parents decided to tuck their children in bed with coins wrapped in an envelope. When Sui came for the children, the coins would fall out of the envelope, emanating a ray of light that scared Sui.  Since then, the practice of giving hongbao has evolved in form over various dynastic eras in China. However, coins were used, not the physical notes seen today, let alone brand-new notes.  It is probably only over the recent century that notes were used instead of coins because the newer coins did not have holes in the centre for the giver to string together. E-hongbao might be a natural next evolution of such traditions. We should also not neglect the sustainability imperative. Most red packets likely end up in the incinerator. Many tend not be easily recyclable due to their designs and materials used. It is not just the red packets. The new notes that we painstakingly queue for will only be used momentarily, and become used notes deposited back into bank accounts at the end of the festive season. If the public continues to demand only new notes each festive season, the used notes have few opportunities to be recirculated.  In Singapore, as many as 100 million pieces of new notes are issued to meet this annual demand. S$2 notes, which form the bulk of new notes issued, that are deposited are reissued as good-as-new notes the following Chinese New Year. This recycling of used notes has helped to meet about 20 per cent of annual festive demand, reduced wastage and supported the environment. But the remaining used S$2 notes, which exceed circulation needs, are subsequently destroyed. The carbon footprint from producing and destroying just the excess S$2 notes is significant – equivalent to the annual emissions from powering 430 four-room public housing flats. Sustainability is not the only reason why we should be persuaded to give e-hongbao a chance. The practical cost of printing paper currency is a key consideration too.  The US Department of the Treasury’s Bureau of Engraving and Printing’s 2021 currency operating budget was US$1.1 billion. The cost of printing a US$1 note was 6.2 cents per note - just over 6 per cent of the note’s monetary value. Traditions can move with the times, especially if we look at China where hongbao originated. In 2014, the Internet behemoth Tencent introduced the e-hongbao function in its ubiquitous WeChat platform. Many other players have joined the fray, some adding innovative bells and whistles such as embedded videos and hongbao snatches. The rest is history – the vast majority of the people in the country are now gifting electronically. Thankfully the use of e-hongbao is on the rise in Singapore. In 2021, DBS Bank reported more than 32,000 QR Gift transactions through the PayLah app totaling S$2 million (US$1.48 million) by the second day of the Chinese New Year, compared to 18,000 totaling S$660,000 (US$490,000) over the same period in 2020.  Other banks also saw an upward trend in the transaction. UOB saw three times an increase in e-hongbao transactions through the UOB app. Similarly, OCBC Bank observed a 140 per cent increase in e-hongbao transactions through the OCBC app compared to 2020. Understandably, some might feel that e-hongbao will erode the essence of a festive occasion like the New Year. However, as some pragmatic folks have put it, if we view the gifting of hongbao as a token of well wishes, it should not matter if it comes in the form of physical red packets or via electronic means.  Using e-hongbao is also convenient as one does not need to visit the bank to queue up for new notes, or to deposit the money received after the festive season. A few clicks are all that is needed to give and receive. One also does not need to worry about misplacing e-hongbao.  Let’s go beyond the reason of tradition to stick to physical hongbao. From a sustainability and practical viewpoint, the rationale for gifting e-hongbao is compelling. The historical switch from coins to physical notes did not result in a loss of tradition.  Even if we believe the original myth that the emitted light from the coins can ward off the evil spirit of Sui, we can argue that the e-hongbao, being electronic in nature and glimmering from our smartphones at night, will probably do a better job than the physical notes.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sustainability/coal-dependent-indonesia-starts-tapping-huge-solar-power-potential-2417836,Coal-dependent Indonesia starts tapping huge solar power potential,"JAKARTA: Aji Tri Atmojo lives in a traditional Javanese house with wooden walls on the outskirts of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta, but his rustic home got a modern touch after he installed a row of solar panels on his roof. Since putting them up in 2020 at a cost of 10 million rupiah (US$702.25), he has halved his monthly electricity bill and within five years the investment should break even. With a patchy track record on renewables, Indonesia's energy mix is still heavily dependent on coal but if early signs of a jump in the take up of solar are sustained, it could have a transformative impact on Southeast Asia's biggest economy. ""Because nearly all electricity generation in Indonesia ... comes from coal. This way (my family) can reduce greenhouse gas emissions,"" Aji told Reuters. Indonesia aims to wean itself off coal and become carbon neutral by 2060 or sooner. Despite being a tropical archipelago of 17,000 islands blessed with year-round sunshine, Indonesia ranks last for solar power capacity among the G20 nations. But demand is starting to pick up in the world's fourth-most populous country, driven by policy changes, a steep fall in the prices of Chinese-made photovoltaic cells (PV) and environmentally conscious middle-class consumers such as Aji, an engineer at a dairy company. From the end of 2018 to November 2021, the number of private rooftop solar panel users has risen more than sevenfold to about 4,500, with an installed capacity of 44 MW, up from just 1.5 MW, according to state-owned power utility Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN). The Indonesia Solar Energy Association (ISEA) predicts installed capacity for rooftop solar panels could top 1,000 MW next year and rise by between 3,000 MW and 5,000 MW per year starting in 2025. ""People are becoming more aware about the importance of renewable energy,"" said Amarangga Lubis, co-founder of engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) firm SolarKita. ""Since the pandemic, the work from home culture has been established and electricity needs at home are rising."" Lubis predicts massive growth in solar power installations over the next five years. ""People will be more picky and they will invest in things that are more beneficial"" for the environment, he said. To be sure, solar remains a minor energy source in Indonesia, the world's biggest exporter of the thermal coal used in power plants. Coal powers about 60 per cent of Indonesia's 73,000 MW of electric generation capacity, compared with solar's 180 MW, which includes solar farms and private rooftop PV cells. But, Indonesia has the potential for 400,000 MW of solar power, its energy ministry has forecast. Falling prices for Chinese PV cells has driven the rise in private installations since the solar power produced from the panels is cheaper than power sold from PLN. The systems from western countries that were the only ones previously available were also 10 times more expensive, said Ilham Rizky, founder of solar installer Batara Energi. New financing methods, such as solar panel leasing for commercial users, have also helped businesses invest in solar, said Solarkita's Lubis. Regulatory changes have also spurred growth, with PLN reducing its minimum energy charges in late 2019, which lowers the amount of time for solar users to recoup their installation costs. Commercial solar users can also fully export their excess power to PLN as of August, up from only 65 per cent previously, and they can participate in an Indonesian carbon market due to launch in 2025. These changes, as well as agreements by multinational companies to curb carbon emissions, mean higher solar demand from companies, factories and commercial buildings in coming years, said Fabby Tumiwa, the ISEA executive director. In addition to the commercial demand, Tumiwa also expects at least 2 per cent of PLN's 77 million household customers to put up solar PV cells in the next three to five years."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/food-rescue-singapore-volunteer-sophia-ho-2391391,This 51-year-old mum 'rescues' food daily and delivers it to rental flats and a rehab centre,"A week or so before our interview, Sophia Ho invited me on a spontaneous mission to rescue bread.  “I’ll pick u at 9.10pm at your block,”  the 51-year-old property consultant messaged. The whole thing would take about an hour and I'd be home by 10pm. That night, we ""rescued"" a lot of bread, including doughnuts from a neighbourhood bakery before it closed for the day. Armed with two large bags and a trolley, we delivered these to The Hiding Place, a rehabilitation centre sheltering the homeless, and former offenders and drug addicts, located at Jalan Haji Salam, near Upper East Coast Road. Caleb Tan, the manager of Hiding Place Kitchen, told CNA Women that Ho’s food rescue drops – which include vegetables, bread and rice – have been a great help. The residents would be able to have the food for breakfast the next day.  At the end of the rescue, I took home a priceless reminder that’s easily forgotten: A small effort is sometimes all it takes to make a difference to another’s life. LOCAL VOLUNTEERISM THROUGH FOOD RESCUE Having been in the Red Cross Youth during her secondary school days, Ho isn’t new to volunteering.  Her first rescue mission took place when she was 17, when she was activated as a first aider during the Hotel New World collapse in March 1986.   Since 2016, the mother of three went on medical missions to countries like Nepal, Bhutan and Myanmar to help children and communities in need.  “We’d go to a village to set up a polyclinic for five days, and give the villagers free medicine,” said Ho. But when the borders closed last year because of the pandemic, Ho had to relook her overseas volunteering plans and consider what she could do locally instead. She eventually found an opportunity with Food Rescue @ Events Singapore, a volunteer group that started in 2017, that aims to avoid food waste and redistribute unsold food to those who need it. The group’s focus struck a chord with her. As a child, she was often hungry. “My father left home early, and my mum was struggling. So I value the abundance of food and it pains me quite a lot when good food that can be consumed is wasted,” she said. HOW FOOD RESCUE WORKS Before a typical rescue, details such as locations, dates and times are shared on the group’s Food Rescue @ Events Telegram channel, which currently has more than 3,900 members. Those who are available to help can then respond. “We have our own network to distribute the items, and Telegram is just one of the channels,” said Ho, adding that the group also relies on referrals and word-of-mouth recommendations.  The group is organised according to the types of food needing rescue, such as perishables and those with a longer shelf life. While Ho rescues cooked and dry foods, others save fruits and raw vegetables.  Volunteers are free to decide which they prefer, as well as the rescue location. Ho, for instance, focuses on food rescue and distribution in the eastern part of Singapore. “I find that those who have a bit more flexibility in work, such as insurance agents, property agents or freelance taxi drivers, are in a very good position to help with food rescue. Most of them would already have a car, so they have their own transport,” said Ho. REWARDING YET CHALLENGING “I like to do food rescue because I can see the beneficiaries directly,” said Ho at our sit-down interview more than a week later, at The Hiding Place. “It gives me the opportunity to judge what they really need. I like to spend a little bit more time to find out: If I have this item, is it really what you need?” While food rescue may be a rewarding activity, it's not without its challenges. Assessing who to distribute the food to is important. The beneficiaries of her various food rescues, she said, range from individuals in rental flats and shelter homes to migrant workers and some families who have fallen through the cracks. “We gather these profiles through recommendations and our experience of talking to them,” said Ho. It’s also crucial to consider the type of food donated. Fresh milk, for example, has a short shelf-life, so Ho would only be able to distribute it to rental flats with a fridge. “Not all families have a fridge,” she explained. Other dairy items such as cheese and yoghurt are a rarity and considered a luxury, said Ho. They are rare because they are very difficult to rescue – none of the volunteers owns a chiller truck.   Despite that, she enjoys rescuing these time-sensitive items as they are rarely given to lower-income families who live in rental flats. “These are items that are really very well appreciated; their eyes really light up."" Another challenge for the volunteers is storage, as the group has neither an office nor warehouse. Ho said she often has to think out of the box to look for storage solutions, and even had to store pallets of energy drinks at her porch once.  She recalled the time she had to rescue a large batch of raw onions – a first for her. “The thing about raw onions is that they smell, and are very heavy,” Ho said. Most of the volunteers are women, she said, so collecting and redistributing the onions – which could go up to 15kg per bundle – proved to be physically challenging.  There’s always a surge of food rescue activities before or after a festive season, too, Ho said. From Christmas and Chinese New Year cookies to mid-Autumn festival mooncakes, volunteers would be on standby to receive calls to rescue food. Once, Ho collected 30 cartons of mooncakes the day after the mid-Autumn festival.  JUGGLING WORK, MOTHERHOOD AND FOOD RESCUES  Ho commits four days in the week to her food rescue runs. Her bread night rescue from the bakeries happens on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. On top of covering other ad-hoc food rescue assignments, Ho also does furniture rescue and finds ways to give these items a new home. This is in line with her full-time job as a property consultant, in which she focuses on commercial industrial properties. “In my line of work, I see a lot of good things being thrown away. When you want to move, some people throw away good, expensive furniture. So I started telling my clients, “Why don't you give me a bit of time while I see where I can find somebody to take these items?” said Ho. As a mum of three with a full-time job, one wonders how she finds the time to do it all. “It's very taxing … and sometimes, I cannot cope. So I have to say no to (rescue) assignments at times,” she explained. “I am quite lucky as my family is generally supportive as long as I can strike a balance.” Ho has three teenage sons aged 14, 17 and 19. When you volunteer, try not to expect appreciation, Ho advised. “A simple thank you is always there but as long as you see that the beneficiary can use the items and not waste it, that is already a comfort to us. “I always believe that you don't need a very big mission or motto to keep you going. If you compare what you can do in one or two hours, say, if I decide to spend the hour (doing food rescue), instead of just watching TV or resting, I can benefit so many families.” You can reach out to Food Rescue @ Events via Telegram, Facebook page, Facebook group or Instagram to give away excess unsold food or to be a volunteer.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/money-mind-sustainability-demand-esg-talent-2402561,Green is the new gold: Focus on sustainability drives demand for ESG talent,"SINGAPORE: Green entrepreneur Robin Pho is a man familiar with life pivots. Since graduating from university in 2004, he has had careers in three different fields. “I first started my career in banking working for ABN AMRO and UBS, and I will say back then it was more about financial performance. Then when I left banking and went to the family business, it was a lot more about manpower supply for the oil and gas industry.” Today, Mr Pho is the founder and CEO of Right People Renewable Energy, which helps customers make the switch from fossil fuels to clean energy. The company specialises in helping communities in off-grid locations, often with challenging logistics and infrastructure. The enterprise is driven by what he calls the triple bottom line of people, planet, and profit. This aim of making a positive impact while running a viable business is one of the fastest growing investment themes, as the world grapples with climate change and its challenges. In 2020, investors put more than US$51 billion into sustainable US funds, according to financial services firm Morningstar. That’s a record amount, and double the funds invested in 2019. By 2030, it is estimated that the environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment category will hit US$1 trillion. ""Green is definitely the new gold,"" said Mr Steve Stine, senior client partner at consulting firm Korn Ferry. “We’ve got another 10 or 15 years of transformation happening. It is essential right now to get the best talent in place because the clock is ticking.” The sound of that ticking is magnified by the mismatch between demand and supply of ESG talent. Around the world, demand for ESG talent is growing across sectors. But the need is especially acute in Asia. According to a recent survey by HSBC, 41 per cent of institutional investors in Asia say they are being held back from more ESG investing because of a shortage of trained staff. That is a significant increase from 26 per cent in 2020. “The talent pool is not as large or well-formed as it is in the early adopting regions like the UK and Europe,"" said Mr Kee Joo Wong, CEO of HSBC Singapore. ""The other challenge we are facing is that banking is now competing with other industries for this finite talent pool.” But Korn Ferry’s Mr Stine warns that the stakes are high, and laggards will lose out. “It’s probably, in our opinion, the biggest single opportunity since digital transformation. But to do this and to do this right, you need a leadership set to understand what’s at stake and then embrace these changes, and demonstrate to the rest of the organisation that it’s real and you’re taking it seriously.” In June 2021, accounting firm PwC unveiled a US$12 billion plan to create 100,000 net new jobs in ESG by 2026. That is a third of its current workforce. So what does it take to make the cut for such ESG jobs? HSBC’s Mr Wong said a professional in this field will not only need ESG acumen, business modelling and a broad knowledge of sustainable products, but also strong soft skills such as communication. ""We are really looking for professionals who are agile in their thinking, and can quickly absorb information in this fast moving space. So people who can prioritise because you will be inundated with requests as this is probably one of the most in-demand functions. We will need strong communicators as this continues to be a learning space for everyone and you will need to bring others along,"" said Mr Wong. ""We also need people who have empathy to different perspectives. This means that banks will widen their recruitment horizons to other professional backgrounds, such as urbanists, teachers, journalists, and corporate communications.” A recent CFA Institute analysis of investment professionals on LinkedIn found that less than 1 per cent had disclosed sustainability-related expertise on their profile. At the same time, 6 per cent of jobs posted were seeking sustainability-related skills. Universities are responding to this mismatch of supply and demand. In Singapore, there are three research centres that work on green finance with an Asian focus. The latest is the Sustainable and Green Finance Institute, which was established by the National University of Singapore and supported by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. “ESG right now is a luxury and has been for many years, and hence, corporations thought of this as the cost centre and they did not really invest in it. But now that the regulators, investors and also the banking sector are really requiring corporations to be responsible socially, environmentally and for governance, corporations are realising that this is a necessary cost that they have to incur,"" said Professor Sumit Agarwal, the institute’s managing director. ""This means they want talent. They are asking universities and other players to nurture talent that they can hire to satisfy these requirements.” A key research focus will be to measure and assess sustainability and its impact. This will help companies to put a monetary value on environmental and social performance. All with the common aim of building capabilities and expertise to support the future of green finance. ""Environmental and social and governance issues, they are here to stay,"" said Prof Agarwal. ""If we lay the groundwork correctly in terms of providing the right education level, training, to the people who are on the regulatory side but also on the corporate side, I think we will have a chance to make that environment or the planet sustainable in the long run."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/clothes-swapping-rental-fast-fashion-environment-impact-2392311,'Normalise re-wearing clothes': Experts urge consumers to reduce impact of fashion on environment,"SINGAPORE: Ms Taahira Mohamed Ayoob stopped buying fast fashion in an attempt to stand out from the crowd.  She still wanted a variety of clothes to wear, so she turned to clothes swapping. But it has now become a way of life for her, fuelled by a desire to be more environmentally conscious. A marketing and branding officer in the travel industry, the 29-year-old said she came to realise she doesn't need as many clothes as she had. And that she doesn't need something different to wear on each occasion.  ""When the pandemic hit, I realised how little clothes I needed to survive,” Ms Taahira said. When she needs to freshen up her look, she adds an accessory or something to jazz up her outfit. “It’s possible to add on elements – a scarf, a jacket. I borrow from a friend, then return it. I accepted that I don’t have to own something new to wear it.” She said that while it is normal to feel self-conscious about being seen in the same clothes repeatedly, being okay with doing so comes from a place of confidence. “Actually, nobody cares (whether you’re wearing the same outfit). It’s our perception of what people think of us,” Ms Taahira said.  Environmental experts said that the best way for people to be sustainable is to wear what they already have in their wardrobes. Swapping and renting clothes are the next best alternative, they said, and buying new clothes the last resort. Mr Raye Padit, founder and chief executive of swapping platform The Fashion Pulpit, said there is “no shame” in repeating outfits. “Normalise re-wearing clothes,” he said. “We have that passed-on belief that it’s not okay to repeat clothes, that it’s not sexy. We need to change that kind of mindset.” The most sustainable thing to do is to wear what is already in your wardrobe, said marketing associate director of Zero Waste SG Jasmine Tuan. “We have more than enough clothes in our existing wardrobes. Do we really need to buy another T-shirt, another dress, another pair of jeans?” she asked. “When you look at your wardrobe, you maybe already have these items. The next step is to wear it.” Otherwise, people can consider re-gifting the items to friends and family or donate to organisations that will recirculate them responsibly, she said. Ms Xingyun Shen, country coordinator of Fashion Revolution Singapore – a global group that calls for greater transparency, sustainability and ethics in the fashion industry – suggested that people reconsider how they want to relate to their clothing. What would happen if clothes were not as cheap or readily accessible as they are now, she asked. “How would we be shopping or acquiring 'new' clothes? The first place we would probably be looking at is our wardrobes,” she said, adding that people could also look at friends’ and family members’ wardrobes. “Can we borrow and swap clothing from our circle of friends and family? Can we ask our local seamstresses and tailors to fix a split seam or alter something to fit our bodies again?” Renting and swapping clothes is growing in popularity and acceptance by consumers in their choice of fashion, said Ms Carolyn Poon, sustainability director at the Textile and Fashion Federation, Singapore. These alternatives to buying clothes make the “take-make-dispose” linear fashion economy more circular, she said. “This is the most direct way renting and swapping help the environment. They extend the lifetime use of clothes that are already produced and consumed,” she said. Style Theory, which offers customers subscription-based plans for renting clothes, has more than 200,000 registered users, said its founder Raena Lim. The firm has done more than 2.3 million rentals and saved more than 600,000 preloved designer wear from “prematurely entering landfills” in the span of five years, she said.  Sustainability is one of the main pillars driving the firm, Ms Lim added. “We know that 60 per cent of clothing produced ends up in the landfill every year. With the rental model, we have shown that items are kept longer within the fashion ecosystem, which reduces the need to overproduce.” An item is rented an average of 30 times each, while an item in a women's wardrobe is used far less, she said. Ms Lim acknowledged that the logistics and operations of a fashion rental business also have a carbon footprint. She said Style Theory has found a good partner who uses environmentally friendly cleaning chemicals. The firm also tries to reduce the number of delivery trips made, she said, adding that it is looking to become more sustainable over time. Fashion Pulpit has also helped the environment, said Mr Padit. Since opening in 2018, the platform has saved 120,000 items with swapping, he said. The swapping community has also grown, from 115 members to 2,500 currently.  While renting and swapping are touted as environmentally friendly solutions to buying, Ms Shen from Fashion Revolution cautioned against doing too much of these as well. “Like how one is prone to over-buy or shop too much, one can over-rent or over-swap,” she said.  In Singapore, fashion and textile products account for 137,000 tonnes of waste, of which “merely” 4 per cent is recycled, said the Textile and Fashion Federation's Ms Poon, citing 2020 statistics by the National Environment Agency. “We see this somewhat as an urgent priority to develop a whole-of-ecosystems approach in circularity and towards zero fashion waste,” she said. Other experts broke down some of the global impact fashion has on the environment. For instance, cotton, one of the most commonly used fabrics, is also one of the most destructive, said Style Theory’s Ms Lim. “It can take 2,700 litres (of water) to produce the cotton needed to make a single T-shirt,” she said. Research also shows that 64 per cent of the 32 billion garments produced yearly go to landfills, she added. Garment manufacturing also releases 4 million tonnes of carbon emissions annually, she said. Chemicals are required to treat and dye textiles, which contributes 20 per cent of global industrial water pollution.  Given the amount of clothes swapping platforms are collecting, Zero Waste SG’s Ms Tuan questioned if more new clothes even need to be produced.  She said that fashion giants and beauty magazines “tap on the confidence of shoppers”, telling them what is in and what to wear in which season. “But who sets these rules? Who says so? Fashion comes and goes but style is eternal,” she said, quoting fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent. “A confident person will wear whatever, and doesn't care about trends or what fashion giants manipulate us into wearing.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/advertorial/driving-decarbonisation-through-responsibly-sourced-resources-2368236,Driving decarbonisation through responsibly sourced resources,"As the world embraces decarbonisation in the bid to tackle climate change, innovations such as electric transport and energy-efficient technologies are more important than ever. These innovative technologies are reliant on natural resources such as copper and nickel. Resources company BHP has estimated that, in a scenario developed by the company in which global warming is kept within a 1.5C carbon budget, global copper production may need to double over the next 30 years in order to keep pace with the development of decarbonisation technologies such as electric vehicles (EVs), offshore wind farms and solar farms. In the same 1.5C Paris-aligned scenario, the company estimates that primary nickel production would need to increase by nearly four times in the next three decades in order to power the next generation of battery technology. The need for decarbonisation grows more urgent by the day. Despite the two billion-tonne drop in carbon emissions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic up to  December 2020, emissions were once again found to be increasing when measured on a year-on-year basis in 2021.  BHP’s 1.5C Paris-aligned Scenario forecasts that, in order to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the world would need to enact a large-scale shift to renewable energy and that this would need to be supplemented by nuclear power and increased gas generation with carbon capture, utilisation and storage technologies. The company estimates that, in this 1.5C Paris-aligned Scenario, global demand for renewable energy is heightened by the fact that demand for electricity could rise by as much as 80 per cent, as various industries along with the transport and building sectors electrify in order to operate and grow sustainably. To help support the world’s decarbonisation ambitions, BHP is focusing on the sustainable production of the essential resources needed for the energy transition while working towards achieving its operational greenhouse gas emissions targets at the same time. THE ELECTRIC TRANSPORT REVOLUTION One of the global trends that is set to have a major impact on decarbonisation is the rise of EVs, which includes plug-in hybrid or wholly battery-powered vehicles.  Earlier this year, Singapore announced more incentives to support the adoption of EVs, such as rebates and the goal of having 60,000 EV charging points in both public and private carparks by 2030. The Land Transport Authority has also committed to having a 100 per cent clean energy bus fleet by 2040, starting with 60 electric buses that will decrease the carbon tailpipe emissions from buses by approximately 7,840 tonnes annually. Abroad, France and Germany have also stepped up their support of EV take-up while China has extended new energy vehicle subsidies to 2022. BHP’s central case global projection forecasts that, by 2035, EVs could form close to 30 per cent of annual vehicle sales globally and that by 2050, EVs could constitute close to 75 per cent of annual sales and make up half the world’s fleet of light-duty vehicles. In this scenario, EVs may consume almost seven per cent of the world’s electricity. Currently, for EVs to be more efficient and competitive on performance and cost – especially when compared to traditional engines – they require lithium-ion batteries, which are made with nickel sulphate. According to BHP, a 60kwh NMC811 battery requires 39kg of nickel. The more nickel a battery has, the longer an EV’s range.  In addition to their usage in EVs, batteries are one of the technologies that – along with wind and solar – BHP anticipates may be needed to sustainably power the world’s energy grid while still meeting rising energy needs. A SUSTAINABLE MANIFESTO FOR THE FUTURE Over 85 per cent of the nickel produced by BHP goes to the EV battery industry, while its copper – which, like nickel, is used in a wide array of industries and products – is essential in the production of EVs and renewable energy infrastructure. In fact, EVs can require up to four times as much copper as internal combustion engine cars. As demand for EVs grows alongside other initiatives aimed at decarbonisation, the resources mined by BHP remain key to supporting this transition to a greener world. The company is committed to producing these resources in a safe, responsible and efficient manner.  In keeping with its commitment, BHP has developed a climate change strategy which is set out in the company’s  Climate Transition Action Plan 2021. This plan includes targets and a goal aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the company’s operations.    BHP is also partnering other organisations to promote the development of carbon market mechanisms, particularly for natural climate solutions. Furthermore, it recognises the necessity of supporting efforts to reduce emissions in its value chain.  The global transition to renewable energy requires batteries, EVs and the development of an entire new infrastructure – all of which would be impossible without essential commodities like nickel and copper. Through working towards the sustainable production of these resources, BHP is working to ensure a clear future for all. Learn more about how BHP is working to drive decarbonisation. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/woodside-keppel-study-hydrogen-supply-singapore-2395206,"Woodside, Keppel to study hydrogen supply to Singapore","MELBOURNE: Woodside Petroleum is working with units of Keppel Corp and Osaka Gas to study a long-term supply of liquid hydrogen from Western Australia to Singapore and potentially Japan, the companies said on Wednesday (Dec 22). The study, which is in line with the Singapore Green Plan, will go on until mid-2022, before the companies decide on their next move. For Woodside, Singapore and Japan would be ideal export destinations for hydrogen from its planned H2Perth Hydrogen facility in Western Australia, while Keppel Data Centres said it is studying the use of hydrogen to power its data centres. ""It is important for us to work collaboratively with potential customers and end users such as Keppel Data Centres, Osaka Gas Singapore, City Energy and City-OG Gas Energy Services to collaboratively build out a sustainable hydrogen supply chain from our proposed H2Perth Project,"" Woodside CEO Meg O'Neill said in a statement. City Energy, owned by Keppel Infrastructure Trust, said it would look into using hydrogen to help cut carbon emissions from its town gas manufacturing processes. Osaka Gas, which has a partnership with City Energy in Singapore, said it would contribute its know-how from the LNG import business to help develop a hydrogen supply chain between Australia and Singapore."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sport/human-cost-chinas-green-energy-rush-ahead-winter-olympics-2392781,Human cost of China's green energy rush ahead of Winter Olympics,"BAODING, Hebei: Beaten, forced off their land, cheated out of money, and even falsely imprisoned - farmers in China say they are paying a heavy price as authorities rush to deliver on ambitious pledges to ramp up national green energy output. China has vowed the upcoming Winter Olympics 2022 will be the first Games to be run entirely on wind and solar energy, and have built scores of facilities to increase capacity - but activists warn ordinary people are being exploited by ""land grabs"" in the process. In a hamlet near Beijing, the Long family - who say they've lost more than half their agricultural land to a sprawling solar farm next door - now have so little income they are burning corn husks and plastic bags to stay warm in winter. ""We were promised just 1,000 yuan per mu of land each year when the power company leased the land for 25 years,"" farmer Long from Huangjiao village said, using a Chinese unit of land equal to approximately 667 sq m. ""We can make more than double the amount by growing corn in the same area. Now without land, I eke out a living as a day labourer."" China is the world's biggest producer of wind turbines and solar panels, and the Winter Olympics is seen as an opportunity to showcase the country's green technologies as they seek global markets. To ensure an uninterrupted power supply for the Games - and clear the winter smog choking the Chinese capital - Hebei province neighbouring Beijing has built a giant plant that takes in power from renewable projects in the province. That one plant creates 14 billion kilowatt hours of clean electricity every year, similar to the annual energy consumption of Slovenia. But for farmers like Long and his neighbour Pi, the green energy boom has made their lives more dangerous and difficult. Pi says villagers were forced to sign contracts - seen by AFP - leasing their land to the solar park built by State Power Investment Group (SPIC), one of the five biggest utility companies in the country. Those who didn't agree were beaten by the police, he said, adding ""some were hospitalised, some were detained."" Pi was jailed for 40 days, while Long languished in prison for nine months for ""illegally gathering and disturbing peace,"" after a public protest. ""The situation is similar to a mafia,"" Pi said. ""If you complain, then you'll be suppressed, imprisoned and sentenced."" The average annual disposable rural income in Baoding is about 16,800 yuan (US$2,600), a figure both Long and Pi said they can no longer make. AFP could not confirm that electricity from the SPIC project near Huangjiao would be used to power the Olympic venues directly, because that information is not publicly available. The company declined to confirm when asked by AFP. But the Zhangjiakou government - the city co-hosting the Games - has said that since winning the Olympic bid in 2015, the area has ""transformed itself from scratch (into) the largest non-hydro renewable energy base in China."" Government subsidies for wind and solar farms have also accelerated construction of such projects in other parts of Hebei, as China scrambles to cut air pollution before the Games. In a statement, Amnesty International said ""forced evictions, illegal land seizures, and loss of livelihoods related to the loss of land"" were among the most frequent human rights concerns associated with the wind and solar energy sectors. China wants 25 percent of its electricity to come from non-fossil fuels by 2030. To achieve this, the country has to more than double its current wind and solar capacity - but environmentalists warn land seizures will become more widespread as energy companies rush to produce renewables. And although Beijing has set a series of ambitious targets around the Winter Olympics, green campaigners face heavy pressure in China if they challenge the official line. Several told AFP they were not comfortable discussing Beijing's environmental targets for the Games for fear of reprisals. In September, China announced strict rules for compensation when land is taken over for ecological projects, including the development of green energy. ""Our land zoning (rules) also clearly regulate what agricultural land can't be occupied, especially farmland,"" Li Dan, secretary general of the renewable energy professionals committee, which promotes green development. ""This is a red line."" If farmland is being used for renewable energy projects there should be a benefit sharing programme in place such as powering greenhouses, she said. But several farmers AFP spoke to said companies were labelling agricultural fields as wasteland to skirt the rules. Xu Wan, a farmer in Zhangjiakou, lost his land to a solar installation built during the run-up to the Games. ""The company told us this was non-usable land, but actually it's all very good agricultural land used by us farmers,"" Xu said. ""They said they would give us 3,000 yuan per mu of land. But in the end, we got nothing."" Zhangjiakou Yiyuan New Energy Development, which installed the solar project in Xu's village, did not respond to AFP's request for comment. Jiang Yi, a Chinese Academy of Engineering researcher, told a state-run industry news site that in future China will need 30,000 - 40,000 sq km more land to meet the renewable energy needs. ""Where the land comes from has become the biggest issue restricting the development of the industry,"" he said. Renewable investments also made up over half the new projects under China's global infrastructure push -- the Belt and Road initiative -- last year. Priyanka Mogul from The Business and Human Rights Resource Centre, a UK-based non-profit that has studied the impact of Chinese renewable investments abroad, said some developers had also been accused of controversial practices when acquiring land overseas. ""The most prevalent issue was inadequate disclosure of environmental impact assessment (data)... followed by issues related to land rights and loss of livelihoods,"" she said. To reduce conflicts when taking over village land, China has billed most solar farms as poverty alleviation projects, where villagers get free electricity from solar panels installed on their roofs. According to 2014 state guidelines, utility companies should then buy back the extra electricity in a programme to lift two million families out of poverty by 2020. The National Energy Administration said last year more than double that number benefited. But in Huangjiao with over 300 households, only two roofs had solar panels, and villagers said there had been no programme to install solar panels. ""At a central level, the government has good policies for farmers,"" Pi from Huangjiao village said. ""But once it comes to the village level, things change. The corruption at the grassroots level is intolerable."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/cheeky-feys-kids-clothing-sustainable-fashion-raeann-heng-2383546,This young mum taught herself to sew and started a sustainable kids clothing shop,"Some have suggested that raising children can take a tremendous toll on the planet, even when it comes to basic necessities like clothing. And as a mother of two and a founder of a sustainable children’s clothing shop, Raeann Heng is well aware of the natural resources it takes to raise them. “A child between the ages of two and four may go through two clothing sizes each year. Multiply that by the number of pieces they own and you may be disposing 60 to 100 clothing items for a single child alone yearly,” said the 27-year-old. The problem is compounded when fast fashion items are priced so cheaply that parents don’t think twice about buying multiple items with similar designs and functions. Some of these items may only be worn a few times and are not made to last. Determined to break the cycle of mindless consumption and careless wastage, Heng launched her online children’s clothing shop Cheeky Feys in April this year. The clothes are made from locally sourced natural fabric such as cotton, linen and bamboo, as well as upcycled pre-loved fabric.  Unlike fast fashion brands that produce clothes in large quantities, Heng makes these for Cheeky Feys in small batches, which can also be customised for each child’s body shape. Steering away from fads, it offers more evergreen designs with a vintage touch and a lifetime guarantee on seams for longevity. HER MUMPRENEURSHIP JOURNEY You could say Heng’s small business was propelled by the demands of motherhood. The former freelance wardrobe stylist stopped work in 2019 after the birth of her second child, when her 12-hour work days became unsustainable. She has two daughters, five-year-old Ava and two-year-old Brianna. With a passion for the environment, the stay-at-home mother decided to pick up sewing to test her theory that well-thought designs, and customised, comfortable and durable clothes would substantially reduce fabric wastage. The resourceful young mum taught herself to sew via YouTube and later took a class at a community centre. Then, during the early days of COVID-19 in 2020, she used her newly acquired sewing skills to launch a Kickstarter campaign to make a thermal insulated reusable sandwich bag to reduce plastic use. Over a period of two years, she also sewed some 30 pieces of clothing for her daughters. When friends expressed interest in her designs, she launched Cheeky Feys. SLOW FASHION FOR CHILDREN Tapping into her styling experience, she curates patterns from indie designers, makes fun edits such as adding bubble sleeves to a particular design, and sources for fabrics with interesting textures and prints.  After orders are placed, she takes one to two weeks to complete the order, often working from 10pm to 2am when her children are asleep. Heng generally produces five pieces per design with each fabric. After the fabric runs out, she uses a different fabric. This makes her pieces more unique than mass-produced brands. Prices start from S$28.90 for a pair of shorts to S$55.90 for a limited edition custom-made shirt. Defining her business as slow fashion, Heng explained: “Slow fashion generally helps you buy slower. When you make items slower, people will have to buy slower. When you give people time to think about what they are buying, chances are, they will not fall into the trap of impulse buying. If they buy slow, they are also more likely to throw slow.” She added: “There is a surge of fast-fashion brands because it is convenient – you just walk in and buy something because it is cheap. According to BBC, the average American throws away 37kg of clothing each year."" Heng continued: “I used to think that mass produced items are cheaper because they are made by machines. But did you know they are actually produced by workers who rush through five pieces an hour at sweatshops, usually in very bad conditions? If you know why it is so cheap, would you still buy it? Or would you choose to change your lifestyle? I did."" SUSTAINABLE FABRICS SOURCING To support a circular economy, Heng sources for most of her fabric from small local shops in Chinatown. This ensures that the money and material circulates within the country and strengthens the local economy, she explained.   She uses natural fibres exclusively. “Natural fibres are more comfortable and also more biodegradable than most synthetic fibres. Some synthetic fibres like polyester or rayon also release toxic substances when produced,” she said. Where possible, Heng sources for pre-loved or unwanted fabric with interesting prints at Goodness Me! Fabric Destash Facebook Group.  One of her more interesting finds was a textured ivory cotton costume, which she turned into unique pieces of children’s clothing. To deep clean such upcycled fabric, she soaks them in boiling water, detergent and baking soda. To ensure that even scraps don’t go to waste, Heng also started a Scrap Fabric Swap Facebook group. “As a seamstress, you end up with pieces of odd-sized fabric that might be too small for you to use, or you just don’t want to make a second shirt with the same fabric.  ""This group allows us to swap fabric with no money involved,” she said. She uses the bigger pieces to make clothes and smaller scraps to make reusable dish sponges, which she sells at her shop as well. SUSTAINABLE SEWING PRACTICES As a rule of thumb, Heng doesn’t stockpile clothes and only produces each piece when she receives an order. “I don’t make in advance to prevent over-production. You never know if a style is going to be a hit or flop. If you have unused fabric, there are so many other possibilities – you can make it into a bag or hat. However, it is harder to repurpose ready-made clothes without wastage,” she explained. Cheeky Feys also offers customised blended sizes – Heng can lengthen clothes for taller children, or shorten them and increase the waist size for sturdier children who may not be comfortable in the standard styling chart that store-bought clothes come in. Each piece is sewn to last. Heng doubles French seams in some cases and physically stretches each piece to stress test it. She also offers a lifetime seams warranty. “I realised fast fashion children’s clothes didn’t last when my second child got hand-me-downs from her sister. While the fabric seems fine, the waistbands and hems were coming apart,” she noted. “That is why I offer a lifetime warranty on seams. I don’t want people to toss clothes out when the fabric is fine. I want my clothes to not only last for the child, but also be passed down to siblings or friends to reduce the amount of fabric that reaches incinerators,” she added. MINDFUL CONSUMPTION STARTS WITH CHILDREN Since Heng generally only sews up to 20 pieces a month, she admitted that her production is not large enough to make a significant dent on carbon emissions. But she hopes that teaching children healthy consumption habits can have a ripple effect. “As a parent, this is a good time to start teaching children that more is not always better, and that it is important to think about their purchases,” she said.  “My daughters choose the fabrics and styles they want before I make them. I don’t buy things on impulse that they don’t like and get stuck in the back of the wardrobe. When they like the piece, the same dress can be worn three to four times a week,” she said. Comfort is paramount. “Some clothes look good but are not practical for the weather or for play. When I was young, my mother made me wear dresses that I could not play in and always asked me to sit properly, hence I did not like dresses. I want to make clothes that children can play freely in,” she said. To teach the value of quality over quantity, Heng has even built a capsule wardrobe for her daughters.  Her tips: “All you need are three shirts, three pants, two dresses (for girls) and five sets of pyjamas. The design should be simple and timeless, but can be embellished with buttons, folded hems and other special touches. For easy matching, pieces can also be colour coordinated.” “As a mother, I see how important it is to preserve the Earth’s resources for the next generation. If we use all these resources in our generation, there may be no unpolluted land, oceans and air. Is this the kind of life we want to leave behind for our children?” she asked. If parents teach children about mindful consumption, sustainability, and encourage them to think before buying, this can reshape the way these children consume for life, she said.  “This child will go on to live for 80 to 90 years. Imagine the impact their daily choices will have on the environment over decades.” CNA Women is a section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/sustainable-investing-returns-environmental-greenwashing-risks-2380276,"With sustainable investing on the rise, experts warn of greenwashing risks","SINGAPORE: Three months ago, Ms Wendy Lim invested S$10,000 into a US-listed exchange-traded fund that focused on companies involved in clean energy and conservation. The possibility of good returns, coupled with lower risks, was the reason she decided to sink her money into this, said the 34-year-old, who has been investing as part of her retirement planning. Plus, the energy sector holds growth potential and seems less volatile compared to the disruption-prone technology space, she said. But Ms Lim also wondered if she could make her money work for a greater good. “I have always been following climate change (issues). Since I’m intending to invest, I might as well invest in a good cause. “I do believe that sustainable energy is our future, just like technology. The earth has finite resources and it’s only a matter of time that all countries and industries need to make the change.” Ms Lim is among a burgeoning group of retail investors looking at growing their cash by investing in companies that focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects. The environmental aspect evaluates how a firm uses its resources and limits its impact on the environment. The social front considers labour practices – work conditions, and employment and wage equality – as well as policies towards its suppliers, customers and communities. Governance assesses leadership diversity, business ethics and reputational issues, and even exposure to bribery. A recent poll by Swiss bank UBS showed that around 90 per cent of respondents in Singapore want to have investments that align with their values, be it for social or sustainable causes. Nearly 70 per cent also said they were more interested in investing sustainably now than before the pandemic. Another consumer study by local lender UOB found that 90 per cent of Singaporeans were keen to find out more about sustainable investing. Of those surveyed, 13 per cent had already made such investments. DBS said it has seen a steady increase in investments into its two sustainability-themed funds, with fund purchases as of end-September nearly three times higher compared with January. Investors were mostly between 35 and 55 years old. Given the strong demand, DBS’ head of financial planning, investment and insurance solutions Evy Wee told CNA that the bank plans to bring in more sustainability-themed investment products for customers next year. Robo-adviser Syfe, which allows clients to choose from five thematic investment portfolios, said that “ESG and clean energy” has been the most popular option, accounting for 40 per cent of the thematic portfolios created so far. To be sure, sustainable investing is not entirely new. The term ESG was officially coined by the United Nations in 2004. Before that, the idea of investing with a socially responsible goal had been around as early as the 1960s, spurred by political causes such as the civil rights movement in the US and the development of “sin” industries like tobacco production. But the trend picked up momentum globally over the past two years amid growing awareness about climate change and sustainability issues, experts said. The prolonged pandemic, whose impact has caused mindset and value shifts among people, is another reason fuelling more to invest with a conscience. Investors, particularly the younger ones, are concerned with issues like climate change, said Mr Elson Goh, head of Asia portfolio management at St James’s Place Wealth Management.  “COVID-19 has been a pandemic that has struck the world and that has probably (made people) realise that there are other areas which can have a drastic impact on our lives,” he said. ESG investing has also gained ground because more realise that it is “directly related to business-critical issues” such as board accountability. These, in turn, can affect a company’s reputation and stock valuation, said Syfe’s partner and vice-president of distribution Sebastian Sieber.  Some misconceptions about ESG investing include how it entails a compromise on returns. But data has suggested otherwise, industry players said. DBS pointed to the one-year performance of its sustainability-themed funds, which has been “healthy” at around 30 per cent. It also cited a 2018 study by Morgan Stanley’s Institute for Sustainable Investing which found that sustainable funds generated returns that are in line with comparable traditional funds, while reducing downside risks. In addition, there was “strong statistical evidence” that showed such funds being more stable during times of extreme volatility, said Ms Wee. Over at Syfe, the five-year performance of its “ESG and clean energy” portfolio is currently at 23.4 per cent. This outpaces the annualised performance of the S&P 500 index over the same period, which stands at 18.9 per cent as of end-October, said Mr Sieber. “(Our) portfolio allows investors to tap into significant growth potential tied to the growing importance of ESG factors among companies, as well as the growing importance and urgency of combating climate change,” he added. Mr Goh said companies with highly rated ESG practices would do better than their peers over time, given how they will have “better ways” of dealing with issues ranging from boardroom diversity to withstanding the impact of changing weather patterns. “That leads to better decision outcomes within the company, which also means that they are better quality companies in general,” he told CNA. But with more looking to invest sustainably, experts warn that there could be a growing risk of so-called “greenwashing” – the act of making false or misleading claims about the environmental merits of a product, service or technology. UK climate change think tank InfluenceMap studied 723 equity funds specifically marketed using ESG- and climate-related keywords like low carbon, and had more than US$330 billion in total net assets. More than half of these funds fell short of global sustainability targets laid out in the Paris Agreement, it said. Adopted in 2015, the Paris treaty calls on countries to reduce emissions in order to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius – and preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius – above pre-industrial levels so as to curb the worst consequences of climate change. More than 70 per cent of funds with broader ESG goals were also misaligned with the Paris Agreement’s global climate targets, according to InfluenceMap. It added that investors may not be able to determine if funds are really what they claim to be, given the wide spectrum of terms used to describe green funds and a lack of transparency when it comes to marketing, the Financial Times reported. Experts that CNA spoke to also cited the absence of standardised ESG regulations and benchmarks to measure fund performance. This could make it easy to ""greenwash"" ESG funds, said Mr Armin Choksey, who leads PwC Singapore’s Asia-Pacific asset and wealth management market research centre. He added that such funds tend to have confusing and overlapping terminology, as well as generic names like “socially conscious”. Professor Sumit Agarwal from the National University of Singapore’s Business School pointed out the risk that comes with the lack of a standardised measurement to calculate companies’ green or sustainability score. “If (the company) claims on their balance sheet or quarterly statement that they are investing in green technology or they are doing some efforts towards sustainability, they might be called ‘green’, but we are really not looking at public data, private data and understanding how green they are,” he said. “We just have to take their word for it."" Mr Choksey said the development of standardised regulations and labelling guidelines for funds would help ensure retail investors are better informed about ESG investments and the associated risks. Steps are already being taken in the region. In Hong Kong, the Securities and Futures Commission maintains a central database of all authorised ESG funds and allows access to this database through its website. Earlier this year, the Financial Supervisory Commission in Taiwan laid out its first set of formal criteria and disclosure requirements for onshore funds claiming an ESG label. Back home, the Singapore Exchange will start requiring companies to provide climate reporting on a ""comply or explain"" basis in their sustainability reports from financial year 2022. Climate reporting will become mandatory for issuers in the financial, agriculture, food and forest products, as well as energy industries from the financial year 2023. Those in the materials and buildings sector and transportation industries will have to comply from 2024. The Monetary Authority of Singapore has said it will announce new disclosure standards for retail funds in Singapore with an ESG investment objective by early next year. The goal is to help investors better understand the criteria that an ESG fund uses to select investments and be able to obtain more information on the investment process. Other efforts are also under way, such as the establishment of a new Sustainable and Green Finance Institute by the National University of Singapore to drive green finance education and research. Apart from developing policy recommendations for regulators, it will also build a sustainability and green scorecard for businesses in Asia that is “transparent” by using modern statistical and advanced machine learning tools, said Prof Agarwal, who is part of the team helming the new institute. The latter is likely to take three to four years. Firms in some Asian countries are ""big culprits"" of greenwashing and duping investors, he said. With a measurement that is transparent, ""we can hold them more accountable, and then the investor will make more informed decisions”. Knowledge is key, so find out what sustainable investing is all about before putting dollars behind it. For a start, read the sustainability reports issued by companies you are investing in, said Securities Investors Association Singapore founder David Gerald. There are also several misconceptions surrounding ESG, such as how it is a mere “passing fad”. Some investors also see ESG as a new asset class but it serves more as an approach to investing. “Effective sustainable investing should use traditional financial analysis, along with ESG factors, to arrive at investment decisions,” said Ms Evy Wee from DBS. Just because the world is moving towards ESG investing does not mean it is risk-free. Always invest based on your risk appetite, investment horizons and goals, said Mr Gerald. Syfe’s Mr Sieber advised investors to decide what matters most to them, given how there are three metrics within ESG and each having “wide-ranging” definitions. “Find what aligns with your beliefs and your values before investing,” he said. “Is it environmental factors or are you most concerned about issues (about) corporate governance such as executive pay?” Picking the right investment strategy is also crucial. “You will need to consider methods of diversification and management of your investment portfolio, which will vary over time depending on market direction,” said Mr Gerald, noting that these include considering new entry or exit strategies to take profit or cut losses. Don't over-invest in one company or investment product, he added. ETFs, according to Mr Sieber, is an efficient way for investors to spread their risks across companies, sectors and geographies."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/environmental-sustainability-christmas-shopping-holidays-festive-2376191,Commentary: Our festive shopping will cost us far more than our holiday bills,"ST CATHERINES, Canada: As extreme weather events in Canada and around the world are linked to human-made climate change, there is one story that continues to be left out: The connection between climate change and the products we purchase. Recent research shows that across a product’s life cycle — from raw material extraction through manufacturing, distribution, use and disposal — the total embedded carbon emissions are 6.3 times the product’s weight. Interestingly, it is the product’s supply chain, or what we do not see related to making and distributing products, that is especially carbon intensive. In the context of human history, the changes to our relationship with the material world have happened in the blink of an eye. Our ancestors lived in direct connection with the land that physically and spiritually sustained them. Only in very recent human history have so many of us lived our lives at such a great distance from that which sustains us. Today, unchecked consumerism is helping drive a changing climate that is very much affecting all people. Since the Industrial Revolution introduced mass production, companies have devoted tremendous quantities of time and money to educating people about the value of the ever-increasing quantities of stuff for sale. They have told us what to covet, what our stuff says about who we are or our status in the world and why we need to buy even more. As marketing consultant Victor Lebow wrote in the Journal of Retailing in 1955, “We need things consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing pace.” Appeals to consume more stuff — clothes, electronics, appliances, toys, cars and so on — used to be found only in advertisements. In the 1990s, the average American was targeted by 3,000 advertising messages a day. Today, appeals to consume are barely countable, as they are seamlessly and endlessly woven into our screen-filled lives, arriving via text message, personalised pop-up appeals and social media posts that celebrate consumption such as influencer haul videos. In the past few decades, those in more materially affluent parts of the world have enthusiastically added more stuff to their lives and discarded hastily. For example, in the US, the average person’s consumption of stuff has doubled in the past 50 years and, in 2019, North Americans disposed of almost 21 kilograms of electronic waste per person. The consequences of our rabid consumption are borne out in the planet’s ecosystems. Consumption in “developed” countries has led to massive-scale logging of the Earth’s forests, leaving just three per cent of the world’s ecosystems intact. The widespread production, use and disposal of plastics has deposited about eight million tonnes of plastic waste into the world’s oceans each year. These outcomes have historically been experienced as “tragedies of the commons.” This implies that the consequences are “out there,” that the degradation and devastation were not been experienced firsthand — but climate change has changed that, taking lives and livelihoods, destroying homes and entire towns with extremes of heat, drought, wind, fire and floods. It begins with the collection of “resources” — minerals, metals, oil, water and wood — and follows with their assembly into products, their distribution, use and often quick disposal. Each step in a product’s life cycle has environmental consequences and a carbon footprint. For example, trees are the Earth’s carbon storehouse but the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) estimates that 10 million hectares of forests are lost each year. Furniture and furnishings in municipal waste (mostly wood products) amounted to almost nine million tonnes in 2018, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency, nearly five times more than what was landfilled in 1960. Yet, old-growth forests continue to be cut down and consumers don’t know which forest products contain 100-year-old trees. While producing or buying differently may decrease our carbon footprint, ultimately, the planet’s wealthiest will need to produce and consume less. Making an effort to buy less during the holidays could have a meaningful impact. Americans, for example, produce 25 per cent more waste between US Thanksgiving and New Year’s Day, discarding half of their yearly paper waste — holiday wrapping and decorations — totalling about eight billion tonnes. Likewise, Canadians will send more than 2.6 billion cards and wrap gifts using 540,000 tonnes of wrapping paper over the holidays. For every kilogram of paper, 3.5 kilograms of carbon dioxide are produced. Indeed, a big part of coming to terms with consumption and climate change involves acknowledging the inordinate consumption and climate impact of the wealthy. UNEP points out that the planet’s richest 10 per cent contribute almost 50 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions, while the planet’s poorest 50 per cent contribute only 12 per cent of global emissions. Giving is a wonderful way for us to connect with those in our lives. Giving builds families, friendships and communities. Arguably such connections are needed more now than ever. But what we have been taught by the endless onslaught of consumption stories we must unlearn. We must challenge stories that encourage fast and “cheap” consumption and demand the telling of — and share — stories that accurately link our copious consumption to the devastating effects of climate change. We must elect leaders who will do the hard work of transitioning away from an endless growth economy based on the excessive consumption of monetarily cheap but planet-expensive products. We must demand vital product information such as life cycle carbon footprints. And we must all commit to resisting the constant appeals to consume fast and cheap, by giving less stuff, more slowly and thoughtfully.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/christmas-holiday-gifts-eco-friendly-reusable-container-waste-sustainability-climate-2378641,Commentary: All I want this Christmas is an end to eco-friendly gifts,"SINGAPORE: Shopping for Christmas gifts? Please take my advice: Do not buy reusable straws. Or anything reusable, really. My kitchen cabinets are spilling over with sustainable stuff: Glass tupperware, beeswax wraps, grocery bags and more. Of metal straws, I have a silver one, a chrome blue one, a multicoloured one, and a golden one with a crook on top so it looks like a bendy straw – but because it can't actually bend, it always catches on my drawer whenever someone opens it. To add to the clutter, each straw comes with a thin brush that can be slipped in to clean the inside. They resemble tiny toilet brushes but serve no other purpose. I never use these reusable straws or their respective brushes. If I were artistically inclined, I would create a sculpture out of this junk and title it, The Last Straw. Or, Carbon Sucks. It would be the centrepiece of my protest against cutlery-related virtue signalling. GOOD INTENTIONS BEHIND TOTALLY IMPRACTICAL GIFTS Friends and family might think these bits and bobs make great stocking stuffers. A little token to say they’re thinking of us this holiday season, complete with an Earth-friendly bent. Especially if they know you care to do little things like recycle or eat less meat.  The same thinking must go on at companies. Perhaps through corporate social responsibility initiatives, they’re building a BYO (bring your own) culture at the office and want their holiday gifts to be on-brand.  Last Christmas, my colleague passed me a bamboo cutlery set she got as a corporate gift, because she had already received many in previous years. Just like my assorted metal straws, I’ve never used it before. Such magnanimity from our loved ones and work contacts has unintended consequences. We're now drowning with reusable paraphernalia. If your intention is for your recipient to embark on a zero-waste lifestyle, what would they do with such excess? And if you’re giving these things in a bid to live more sustainably yourself – are you really making a difference, or are you contributing to the problem? On the outside, sustainable, plastic-free wares make great presents. They are sleek and stylish, and when marketed as 100 per cent recycled or organic, fair-trade and so on, make consumers feel good about using them. But are they actually better for the environment? Nanyang Technological University scientists found that a cotton bag has more than 10 times the global warming potential of a reusable plastic bag, considering both are used 50 times. This is because growing cotton requires massive amounts of water and land. Some studies even suggest you even have to use your cotton bag thousands of times before it’s more environmentally friendly than a single-use plastic bag. In another example of drink containers, University of Southampton researchers say glass bottles might take a larger toll on the environment than plastic ones, because their production uses relatively more energy and resources. Recycled aluminium cans, in fact, have the smallest footprint. It can be argued that anyone can cherry-pick studies demonstrating how “environmentally friendly” alternatives, which we tend to think refers to anything that isn’t plastic, might not be environmentally friendly at all. So let’s talk about the practical day-to-day use of these products. Do zero-waste gifts actually eliminate waste? While reusables were useful during the circuit breaker period from April to June 2020, when takeaways were the default, most households are probably now in possession of the whole range. Tote bags, tiffin carriers, tumblers and so on may no longer be practical gifts. And the idea that they cut back on disposables during those tough months doesn’t really hold. National University of Singapore alumni found that an additional 1,334 tonnes of plastic waste – the mass of 92 double-decker buses – was generated during circuit breaker. This is thanks to a 73 per cent rise in the number of food deliveries across surveyed households and a 50 per cent increase in online grocery purchases. If the pandemic got us hooked on these online conveniences, then all the more our reusables collect dust, because everything’s showing up at our door swathed in at least two layers of packaging. This is not to shut down efforts to slash single-use packaging from our lives, which makes up one-third of domestic waste in Singapore. But with statistics like these, it’s quite clear that gifting metal straws or bamboo cutlery won’t move the needle on reducing waste and other harms done to the planet. To believe otherwise will be to buy into what British writer George Monbiot terms “micro-consumerist bollocks”. As he wrote in his Guardian column on Oct 30: “We focus on ... tiny issues such as plastic straws and coffee cups, rather than the huge structural forces driving us towards catastrophe.” So if our choice of tableware is distraction, rather than solution to a problem on a literal global scale, then what can we do? Let’s not forget that beyond reusing, two other important principles of zero-waste are to refuse and reduce. Instead of showering people with metal straws, why not avoid straws altogether? In my mind, straws are only permissible in bubble tea or milkshakes. If medically, you need a straw, then by all means go ahead. So if we opt out of buying unnecessary things, then what should we give this Christmas? Perhaps we could give our time instead of an item. In this attention economy, time is much more valuable than money anyway. For the busy bees out there, carving out an evening for dinner might be even more challenging than buying cloth pouches en masse at the mall. Your friends will appreciate you all the more for doing the former. And if a meal sounds too basic, how about an experience? Performing arts groups put on a lot of shows, Christmas-related or not, around the December holidays. Plus, you support the local arts scene, which has been hit hard by the pandemic. These suggestions might reek of bourgeois post-materialism, but if we’re serious about conscious consumerism, the circular economy and whatever else invoked at sustainability forums, this is the simplest path to walk. This Christmas, give those metal straws a pass, and instead, catch up with your loved one over a meal. If you’re doing takeaway, bonus points if you BYO.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/world-bank-recommends-indonesia-cut-coal-subsidies-amid-green-transition-2383911,World Bank recommends Indonesia cut coal subsidies amid green transition,"JAKARTA: The World Bank has urged Indonesia to drop a policy forcing miners to supply a set amount of subsidised coal to its state power company, which it said has encouraged the use of the dirty fuel in electricity generation. The recommendation is part of a report released on Thursday (Dec 16) intended to encourage more private investment in renewable energy in Indonesia to help the country achieve a target of becoming carbon neutral by 2060 or sooner. The Southeast Asian country is the biggest exporter of thermal coal globally and among the top 10 green house gas emitters. Indonesia has a so-called Domestic Market Obligation policy whereby coal miners must supply 25 per cent of annual production to state utility Perusahaan Listrik Negara, at a maximum price of US$70 per tonne, well below current market prices. The policy has effectively subsidised coal-fired power plants, the bank said. ""It incentivises more consumption of carbon, which sends distorted price signals, which discourages a transition away to cleaner sources of energy,"" Habib Rab, the bank's lead economist for Indonesia, told reporters, adding it also reduced private investment into renewables. The bank also recommended changing rules on minimum local content requirements for energy projects because this had increased project costs and impeded competition. For solar panels, Indonesia has a 40 per cent minimum local content requirement which is expected to be raised further in the future. Under World Bank simulations, more private investment would ensure the energy transition had a greater impact on economic growth and job creation. However, the bank also said poor and vulnerable households needed to be protected during key transition phases, when the government is expected to gradually raise power tariffs to give PLN the revenue to finance its investments. PLN in September announced a plan to increase Indonesia's renewable power capacity to 25 per cent of its energy mix by 2030 by no longer commissioning new coal projects and investing in solar and hydro power, among others. Renewables currently make up around 12 per cent of Indonesia's energy sources, while coal contributes roughly 60 per cent."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mediacorp-unveils-cna-green-plan-campaign-focusing-sustainability-issues-2383431,Mediacorp unveils CNA Green Plan campaign focusing on sustainability issues,"SINGAPORE: Mediacorp on Thursday (Dec 16) launched an islandwide campaign to spread awareness of sustainability issues, aiming to “inspire individuals in our communities to take the first step towards going green”. The first phase of the CNA Green Plan will include a series of public engagement activities both on the ground and online, Mediacorp said in a news release. These are centred around the five pillars of the Singapore Green Plan 2030: City in Nature, Resilient Future, Energy Reset, Green Economy and Sustainable Living. “These challenges will help participants better understand sustainability issues and encourage them to take action to reduce their carbon footprint,” Mediacorp said. These issues include the impact of climate change on Singapore, energy consumption and securing a sustainable future for the country. “Each of the five themes will be tackled by three towns for a total of 15 towns, with all residents of any town invited to partake in an assortment of activities associated with the five Singapore Green Plan 2030 pillars,” the company added. City in Nature The on-ground challenges are slated to begin from Jan 6. The public can register their interest on the CNA Green Plan website before the event date. These activities “incorporate friendly competitive elements, such as pitting participants against each other in nature trails to track down specific species of flora and fauna”, Mediacorp said. “Other fun activities for the family include a half-day farming bootcamp, with mini challenges on how to grow your own vegetables at home and educating the public on local produce.” There will also be a “showdown” featuring 15 personalities – five CNA presenters, five artistes from The Celebrity Agency and five Bloomr.SG influencers – who will be representing various towns and ""calling upon their 'rivals' and residents in other towns to perform better in their respective online challenges"". For the online challenges, the public can create and post video and visual content on their social media platforms. Forty-five individuals with the best entries will each stand a chance to win an EZ-link card containing S$500 worth of credit. The online competition is currently open and will end on Feb 20, 2022. The on-ground challenges will also be filmed and packaged into a five-part series, Mediacorp said. Scheduled for an April 2022 release, the series will also include selected entries from the online challenges. “Other exciting engagement activities for subsequent phases of the CNA Green Plan will be announced in due course,” Mediacorp said. Editor-in-chief and chief sustainability officer Walter Fernandez said: ""This islandwide initiative is one of Mediacorp’s long-term efforts to raise awareness about sustainability as well as the related challenges and issues. ""As the national media network, we are uniquely positioned to leverage our broad base of creative capabilities, trusted journalism, and the wide reach of our personalities and platforms to bring communities together to act on the Singapore Green Plan. ""I hope our audiences can join us on our climate action mission, and that our efforts will motivate all of us to be more thoughtful about going green in our daily lives."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/living/zerrin-singapore-sustainable-fashion-beauty-2366621,The woman building a retail community around sustainable fashion and beauty brands,"The global market for sustainable products is growing fast. Big brands have begun to realise how important it is to manufacture sustainably, using eco-friendly materials and ethical processes. At the same time, an ever-growing roster of young entrepreneurs, driven to make their marks and make a difference are launching small businesses, selling everything from cruelty-free beauty products to zero waste clothing. With so many brands, big and small, getting into the space, it can sometimes be difficult to find and decide which to support. Enter ZERRIN, launched at the end of 2017 by Susannah Jaffer, who has been based here for the last nine years. Formerly a magazine editor, Jaffer grew disenchanted with her own profession, and fuelled by a belief in sustainable fashion and retail, launched ZERRIN, which is both a retailer for sustainable brands as well as a creative agency that can help these brands better market themselves.  With the rise in conscious consumerism, and Christmas just around the corner, I thought it was a perfect time to check in with Susannah. WHAT FIRST BROUGHT YOU TO SINGAPORE? I moved to Singapore in 2012 – I was 21 at the time – with an offer to teach English in a language school. Unfortunately, the visa fell through when I arrived. I was able to get a pass as a university graduate to work in Singapore for six months and ended up in a PR internship, and that was followed by a full-time role in magazines and media.  WHEN DID YOU START REALLY GETTING SERIOUS ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY? I think it came about through a cumulative realisation of how the industry really works, coupled with a sense of longing to participate in fashion in a more meaningful way; beyond the pretentiousness, beyond the “latest trends”. It was more so in late 2015/2016 when I grew the most tired of the typical narrative of mainstream brands… and even, media.  I learnt most about the impact of fashion and its complex supply chain through independent brands I came to support. That led me to doing more research which really lifted the veil for me on the impact clothing production and consumption has on the planet. For me, discovering fashion done in a better way, which is what sustainability encompasses, was a vehicle for mindfulness in my life, maybe in the same way as yoga, meditation or veganism may be for someone else. WHAT WAS THE CATALYST FOR STARTING ZERRIN? I started ZERRIN because I wanted to help streamline the process for an everyday citizen like me to find stylish, quality sustainable brands. My research and interactions with brand owners had also shown me that they struggled with marketing, creating content and finding sales channels that truly added value. I also wanted ZERRIN to be a resource and a hub of inspiration, and to cultivate a different narrative around consumption; one that felt inclusive and uplifting versus exclusive and toxic. Fashion has played a huge part in shaping culture, but so has the way we write and share about it. To create systemic change, I think all of us who put out communications; brands, PR, journalists, broadcasters, influencers, all have the power to shape a whole new narrative around fashion consumption for the next generation. With culture change comes systemic change. HOW LONG DID IT TAKE TO GO FROM IDEA TO ACTUALLY LAUNCHING THE BUSINESS? It took about a year. I first sent a pitch deck out to brands at the end of 2016, and I built the business on the side all throughout 2017, evenings and weekends. As a sole founder, I found it tough at times, with limited resources or individuals to soundboard ideas off, but got there in the end. HOW DIFFICULT IS IT TO SOURCE BRANDS THAT YOU CAN TRULY SAY ARE SUSTAINABLE? It’s not easy. Sustainability is now such an overused word. It’s become nebulous. Different brands and founders interpret sustainability in different ways. When it comes to smaller, independent businesses, which is the area we play in, many are limited by resources and the right connections to create a completely sustainable supply chain.  To help guide us internally, we created a framework (the Better Brand Framework) that analyses a brands approach to five core areas: People, planet, product, packaging and principles. If they have made (and are making) solid, tangible moves in those areas, combined with a quality, original product, we’re interested; I see it as our role to also help them develop along the way. We’re also very transparent about this; all brands we work with are at different stages of their sustainable journey. There’s no such thing as perfection, no matter how circular your model or recyclable your product. WHEN SOMEONE SAYS A BRAND IS CONSCIOUS OR SUSTAINABLE, DOES THAT ALSO MEAN IT’S CRUELTY-FREE/VEGAN/PLANT-BASED AS WELL? No. You can have vegan beauty products that aren’t cruelty-free – of course, it’s hypocritical if they’re not but it happens – and you can have more sustainable fabrics that aren’t plant-based, like recycled polyester. It’s important for consumers to have a more nuanced understanding of this so that they’re supporting brands that are actually doing what they say they are. At the same time, companies should avoid being vague and be straightforward with the actions they are taking, and what their claims actually mean. I UNDERSTAND THERE IS A LOT OF GREENWASHING IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY TOO. There are organisations that believe sustainability will give their company a competitive edge, so will jump on the bandwagon in whatever way they can. I think some of the biggest greenwashing is coming from the fast fashion industry – from companies that are producing millions of items each year, and a huge portion of the world’s waste, while saying they are creating conscious lines and recycling to mitigate their impact. They aren’t focusing on the crux of the problem, which is overproduction. The cycle is exhausting and needs disrupting. Thanks to social media, more and more citizens are seeing through this. On the flip side, given today's cancel culture, there’s also companies that are afraid to implement sustainability practices because they are too scared to make mistakes and get torn down. What cancel culture has also done is completely eliminate empathy and the capacity everyone has for change from the conversation. That’s wrong. Ultimately, I think companies shouldn’t be afraid to make a start, as long as they are being transparent, honest and upfront about where they are and want to go. More than anything, I feel like consumers are just looking for honesty and authenticity from brands today, whatever moves they’re making. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THRIFTING VERSUS SELLING NEW PRODUCTS? I think there’s a place for all alternative means of consumption, from thrifting to swapping to renting, to buying from a more sustainable brand. People need options, for different reasons. If I look at the consumption habits of my friends or customers, they’re not exclusively loyal or tied to one means of acquiring products. They’re sometimes motivated to buy new, sometimes swap, or rent a dress when they know they’re not going to wear something more than once. We need all of these options to build a more ethical, equitable fashion system. We’re all multifaceted as human beings, and so are our sartorial choices. Of course, options like thrifting are more cost effective, i.e. cheaper or the same price as new fast fashion items, but just like any means of consumption it’s not perfect. A lot of items in thrift stores are starting to be lower quality as they’re effectively second-hand fast fashion and reflective of what’s currently circulating in the market. It’s a great way of experimenting with trends in a more circular way, but not every thrifting trip will be successful, nor will you necessarily find clothing that will last you a long time. I also think it’s important to remember that the second-hand market wouldn’t exist without the first-hand market. From rental platforms driving revenue by hiring out the latest cult designer dresses, to pre-loved marketplaces selling bags on consignment, to swap stores building inventory through people’s unwanted clothes; all of this ‘inventory’ came from people buying new stuff in the first place.  While there’s already plenty of products in existence – and I believe if you’re going to create something new, you should have a jolly good reason to and make it count – if people stopped producing new products, within a few years or less this would have repercussions for the second-hand market. For example, everyone that’s thrifting Y2K fashion looks right now; they were all new clothes produced and circulating when I was growing up. In a way, both second-hand and first-hand markets are actually reliant on each other for survival. HOW DID YOU LAUNCH ZERRIN?  I did the typical; doing market research, gathering data, speaking to business owners and potential partners. But honestly, a lot of the business was also built on gut feel and I knew I would learn and pivot as I went. We started our marketplace with 14 brands, and I set the website live at my kitchen table. WHAT HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR YOU AND THE BUSINESS? Mentorship, growth and lack of resources. Ultimately, we’re a bootstrapped startup, so everything has been built on a shoestring budget; I’m quite proud of how far we’ve come despite the odds and the way we’ve developed. Letting people in; as I’m not one to usually ask for help. Finally, support and mentorship has been a big one; I think if I'd had mentors around to soundboard ideas and get advice, I could have pivoted in certain ways faster than I did.  AS THE FOUNDER, WHAT PART OF THE BUSINESS DO YOU FOCUS ON THE MOST? Oh, it’s everything at the moment. As I’ve hired on the retail side this year, I’m able to spend more time looking at partnerships and content and our agency clients.  HOW BIG IS THE BUSINESS TODAY? DO YOU HAVE A BIG TEAM? We’re a team of two plus one intern. So, we’re small but mighty! WHAT DO YOU WISH YOU KNEW BACK IN 2017/2018 THAT YOU KNOW NOW? I’d tell myself to stop wasting time on self-doubt, and to remember that building a business is going to be an exceptionally lonely journey at times; but also rewarding. I’d also tell myself to build a team earlier and say ‘yes’ to any offers of help and not let my pride or guilt get in the way.  HOW MUCH OF THE BUSINESS IS FROM THE STUDIO ARM VS THE RETAIL SIDE? It really varies from month to month. Retail has busier months and quieter months; natural ebbs and flows that most in the industry experience. It’s usually about 55 per cent studio, 45 per cent retail on any given month. But then, there are some months that retail is 60 per cent, studio is 40 per cent. HOW CAN CONSCIOUS BRANDS BETTER MARKET THEMSELVES? WHAT MISTAKES DO YOU FREQUENTLY SEE? Brands should look more at how effectively they’re sharing their product and its key USPs and how they’re balancing that messaging with the sustainability and social impact side of what they do.  My observation is that most designers aren’t marketers; they’re creatives at heart that want to focus on the making rather than the marketing strategy, content roll out and community building. Actually, some of the best performing brands at ZERRIN are not founded by trained designers, but those from other backgrounds and skill sets, for example marketing, communications, and advertising. It just goes to show that having a great product is only part of the equation. My other observation is that you can’t flog a poor quality product, no matter how sustainable it is. DO YOU HAVE ANY PERSONAL FAVOURITE BRANDS OR PRODUCTS ON THE PLATFORM? Haha. I don’t do personal favourites, but I’m proud of labels and founders who really get it together and are constantly looking to improve.  I love the label Wray Crafted; they have a special place in my heart because of the fact I’ve watched them grow; from meeting the founders at a ZERRIN event to stocking their label in our store. They’ve consistently been one of our best performing brands.  I also love Dorsu, a label we carry from Cambodia, which are upcycling local quality deadstock from big nearby factories into their capsule of evergreen, versatile basics. They create an infinitely better working environment and value proposition for female garment workers in the context of the country too, which is a well-known hub of fast fashion production and labour rights abuses. HOW HAS THE PANDEMIC BEEN FOR YOU GUYS? If I look back, the pandemic has really been about growth for us, and a big learning curve for me personally. I made my first hire in 2020, which was a big step, and having someone else’s perspective has really helped to shape and lay so many great foundations for the business.  I think an increased focus on sustainability has also really made people locally and internationally discover and pay attention to our business. We’ve seen our customer base, following, and inbound enquiries significantly increase during the last two years. But with that comes additional challenges; how do we grow purposefully? In a way that’s still of radical value to our community?  DO YOU SEE ZERRIN AS A COMMUNITY OR AS A RETAILER? Good question! It’s always been a goal to create a like-minded community at the heart of our concept; of customers and readers, of brands. We’ve definitely been doing that, but are looking to focus on this even more in 2022. Of course, one of our revenue streams comes through product sales, but our marketplace and physical store/pop-ups are also a vehicle for us to convey and educate on deeper topics like sustainability, social justice, consumption and ethics. WHAT IS THE GOAL? To build a thriving, engaged global platform and community of brands and citizens on a journey to create and consume more consciously. 2022 will be focusing on developing our content, creating international partnerships and creating more local experiences to engage the public around conscious consumption.  ANY SPECIFIC PLANS FOR 2022 YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE? I’m thrilled we’ll finally be launching a podcast in 2022. It’s been a long time coming. I’m excited for all the conversations we’re going to be having about how we can collectively create and consume more consciously; not just for the good of people and the planet, but for our own mental health and happiness too. I’m also hoping the pandemic situation eases enough to do larger scale pop ups next year to really make a greater impact for everyone. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/us-president-biden-stop-financing-new-carbon-intense-projects-abroad-2372876,Biden orders US to stop financing new carbon-intense projects abroad,"WASHINGTON: The Biden administration has ordered US government agencies to immediately stop financing new carbon-intensive fossil fuel projects overseas and prioritise global collaborations to deploy clean energy technology, according to US diplomatic cables. The cables, seen by Reuters, say US government engagements should reflect the goals set in an executive order issued at the start of the year aimed at ending American financial support of coal and carbon-intensive energy projects overseas. ""The goal of the policy ... is to ensure that the vast majority of US international energy engagements promote clean energy, advance innovative technologies, boost US cleantech competitiveness, and support net-zero transitions, except in rare cases where there are compelling national security, geostrategic, or development/energy access benefits and no viable lower carbon alternatives accomplish the same goals,"" a cable said. The announcement was first reported by Bloomberg. The policy defines ""carbon-intensive” international energy engagements as projects whose greenhouse gas intensity is above a threshold lifecycle value of 250 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour and includes coal, gas or oil. The policy bans any US government financing of overseas coal projects that do not capture or only partially capture carbon emissions, allowing federal agencies to engage on coal generation only if the project demonstrates full emissions capture or is part of an accelerated phaseout. It exempts carbon-intensive projects for two reasons: they are deemed to be needed for national security or geostrategic reasons or they are crucial to deliver energy access to vulnerable areas. The policy formalizes the goals set by the administration in earlier executive orders and policy guidances and reiterated in multilateral forums such as the G7 meeting in France in August and UN climate summit in the fall. At the UN climate talks in Scotland, the Biden administration pledged with 40 countries and five financial institutions to end new international finance for unabated fossil fuel energy by the end of 2022, except in limited cases. ""The administration has elevated climate change as a core tenet of its foreign policy,"" a State Department spokesperson said on Friday in response to a request for comment on the cables. The commitment made in Scotland ""will  reorient tens of billions of dollars of public finance and trillions of private finance towards low-carbon priorities, "" the spokesperson said. Environmental groups said the policy, for which they have long advocated, is a step in the right direction but creates loopholes that could undermine its goals. “This policy is full of exemptions and loopholes that lack clarity, and could render these restrictions on fossil fuel financing completely meaningless,"" said Kate DeAngelis, a climate finance expert at Friends of the Earth."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/advertorial/science-innovation-and-technology-lead-charge-slow-climate-change-2353381,"Science, innovation and technology lead the charge to slow climate change","COP26, net zero, carbon neutrality – these are catchphrases often associated with the climate change movement.  To the man on the street, such terms may not mean much. What hits closer to home could be the many stories on your social media feed that paint a sobering picture of natural calamities and extreme weather events. From floods in Bangalore to the sinking of Indonesia’s small islands, one can’t help but wonder when Singapore, a low-lying island, will likewise experience the worst of climate change.  As global leaders race to resolve climate issues while keeping pace with progress, they are presented with a catch-22 – often times, the quickest and easiest means to economic development is also the most detrimental to our environment.  Fortunately, this conundrum might not be a zero-sum game after all. The three-part docuseries, Climate Trailblazers, tells the stories of awe-inspiring efforts to create innovative products and solutions that are good for business, and even better for the planet. MAKING MEALS OUT OF THIN AIR Whether you live to eat or eat to live, we all need food to survive.  While alternative proteins like plant-based or cell-based meat with a lower environmental footprint are taking off, the idea of food with a negative carbon footprint sounds like a concept right out of a sci-fi novel.  But truth may be stranger than fiction in this case. Challenging the adage of there being ‘no free lunch in this world’, Solar Foods conceptualised Solein – a protein produced from microorganisms by using components such as hydrogen, carbon dioxide, oxygen and nitrogen, which are found in abundance in the air.  The production of Solein is not merely carbon-lite – it is carbon-negative. By freeing up lands earmarked for agriculture, these areas can continue to serve as carbon sinks to slow down the rate of greenhouse gas emissions and global warming.  Even the electricity used to power the process comes from renewable sources such as wind and solar power, while carbon dioxide can be obtained entirely from the air in an occupied room.  With its technology, co-founder and chief executive officer of Solar Foods Pasi Vainikka believes that food can be produced just about anywhere.   “It doesn’t end there,” he said. “We can eventually produce Solein in urban settings because each one of us breathes out about 1kg of carbon dioxide every day, which can be captured from buildings and put back into food.” The production of Solein is just a breath away from reality. With Solar Foods’ first test facility due to be completed in 2023, that free lunch might just be around the corner, after all. POWERING AIRPLANES, ONE LEFTOVER AT A TIME While food fuels the human body, energy sustains the heartbeat of modern society. The energy challenge we face today is two-fold: We need to meet the energy needs of a growing global population while minimising the environmental impact of its production.  The aviation sector is one where the use of cleaner fuels could make a huge positive impact. Blazing the trail is Finnish energy giant Neste that produces sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Unlike its fossil-based counterparts, SAF is produced from renewable waste and residues such as used cooking oil and animal fat wastes. Fully compatible with aircraft engines and existing fuel supply infrastructure, SAF reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 per cent over the life cycle compared to fossil jet fuel*.  In 2017, Singapore Airlines (SIA) trialled SAF for three months on 12 flights between Singapore and San Francisco as part of a series of green package flights. Coupled with optimised air traffic management procedures, the flights saved 320 tonnes of carbon dioxide in the process.  In January 2020, SIA entered into a year-long partnership with Swedish airport operator Swedavia. As part of Swedavia’s SAF incentive scheme, SIA began to use a blend of jet fuel and SAF on flights between Stockholm and Moscow. The company plans to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and continues to keep a lookout for opportunities to use SAF. One of the challenges to the more widespread use of SAF is its limited supply currently, which results in a high price point. Today, SAF is three to five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, hindering its scalability. However, this premium is expected to decrease over time as supply scales up.           Ms Lee Wen Fen, senior vice president of corporate planning at SIA, is optimistic about the future of SAF. “A collaborative effort among all stakeholders within the aviation industry is paramount to the large scale production and deployment of SAF. This will ensure that the deployment of SAF becomes more affordable for the airlines and our customers, making it a lot more affordable for everyone to travel sustainably. Our customers can join us in our journey towards sustainability too, when they recognise the benefits of emissions reduction and increase the uptake of SAF over time,” she shared. Looking ahead in 2022, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, Temasek and SIA will begin a year-long pilot programme for SAF at Changi Airport.  Additionally, Neste is currently expanding its production capacity of SAF in Singapore to reach one million tons per annum by the first quarter of 2023. That arrives at an important inflection point as borders gradually reopen with more air travel on the horizon.  ONE MAN’S TRASH IS ANOTHER MAN’S TREASURE  Dressing up (or down) is a daily routine some give more attention to than others. What many don’t think about is the environmental impact of fashion – the amount of land and water needed to produce natural fibres like cotton, and how fossil petroleum is a key ingredient for synthetic fibres like polyester. Coupled with storage and distribution processes, not to mention washing, ironing and disposal, it should be no surprise that carbon emissions add up in the fashion world – accounting for up to 10 per cent of the earth’s total emissions. A growth in affluence has resulted in an increase in material consumption, while the prevalence of ultra-fast fashion has exacerbated the problem, with 80 per cent of clothes ending up in landfills.  In the wake of such trends, enterprises such as LanzaTech are advocating a circular economy approach to clothing manufacturing, using waste carbon as a resource.  With the help of microorganisms, LanzaTech transforms waste carbon emissions as well as agricultural and household waste, including textile waste, into ethanol. Ethanol is then converted into mono-ethylene glycol, a key ingredient for polyethylene terephthalate (PET). PET can then be spun into polyester yarn or used to make packaging and bottles that we use in our daily lives. “LanzaTech has the technology to help fashion brands and retailers limit their environmental impact by using carbon emissions to make fabric that replaces those currently made from petroleum,” said Ms Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech.  Indeed, the shift from using fresh fossil fuel to waste materials is a climate-forward solution that has huge potential to reshape the way clothes are produced.   “That’s what we’re trying to show, that there is a future where we can decouple our fossil life from our everyday life,” said Ms Holmgren.  Watch these ground-breaking innovations and more on Climate Trailblazers: Reimagining Our Future, a three-part docuseries produced in partnership with Temasek’s Ecosperity platform.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/rebecca-wong-my-old-school-vintage-sustainability-2277486,"The Singaporean giving 10,000 unwanted items a new lease of life at her vintage shop","Two years into the pandemic, e-commerce has taken on a life of its own. Homebound and grounded, many of us seek the thrill of new experiences with our shopping carts. We cycle through shopping sprees, spring cleaning and then more shopping sprees, keeping factories and incinerators well alive. Rebecca Wong understands the love for things. On the surface, the 44-year-old vintage shop owner seems like the last person on earth to tout the “less is more” rhetoric. Her shop By My Old School is the very epitome of maximalism, with objects stacked upon objects as far as the eye can see: Mementos from Singapore’s past, nautical collectibles, antiques, photographs, toys, books, typewriters, cooking tools and jewellery.  Yet for all her 10,000 collectibles, not a single tree has been newly cut or a new piece of plastic thoughtlessly created. This is because Wong’s very business is about saving pre-loved items from the incinerator and landfills, and giving them a new lease of life.  Vintage shopping, you could say, is one of the few remaining ways to embrace retail therapy sustainably.  FINDING GEMS AMONG JUNK Collecting runs in Wong’s blood. Her father Winston Wong, 74, is also a collector. Together, father and daughter have saved countless items from second-hand dealers and families.  “You find the most interesting things in old homes when people are clearing their parents’ and grandparents’ stuff,” she said.  Before they started the shop 10 years ago, the duo kept their collection at home, occasionally running garage sales on weekends. Wong was then a senior writer at an interior design magazine and her father, a civil servant.  However, when a shop unit near their old home at Normanton Park became available in 2011, it seemed as though the stars had aligned. While still retaining their full-time jobs, they founded a vintage shop together. The name By My Old School was inspired by a line from a Beatles song, Good Morning, Good Morning.  “When you think about your old school, it always comes with very fond memories of what you do after school, the places you walked past and hung out,” said Wong.  Having since shifted her shop to Commonwealth Drive, today, Wong’s collection spans from the 1940s to the 1990s, encompassing the memories of many generations of Singaporeans.  Among these you'll find: A wooden daching instrument used to weigh cargo such as grain, rice and livestock at warehouses along the Singapore River; a vintage mould of the iconic Marie biscuit; Shanghai Diamond clocks that used to hang at our grandparents’ houses; classic kopitiam cups; vintage jewellery; and out-of-circulation products such as aquamarine powder used to whiten clothes in the past. Items are priced from S$0.50 to S$5,000. Wong knows her extensive collection intimately. You could point to almost any item and she would be able to give you some interesting tidbit on when it was created, or how it was used or made. Though she left her editorial job in 2016, her experience as an interior design writer and editor has certainly helped. She brings to customers an eye for home decorating, suggesting creative ways to upcycle vintage items for modern homes.  What should one do with a long wooden daching? Why not suspend it above the bar counter and hang plants from it?  What about this Russian copper deep sea diving helmet? Put an LED light inside and you not only transform it into a lamp, but a statement piece and talking piece, she suggested. “You can make something creative out of a lot of old stuff. There is a real need for places where these things can come to the market again instead of being thrown away and incinerated,” she added. THE BEAUTY OF VINTAGE Wong finds great beauty in things that bear the mark of time. “Part of the charm of vintage things is the patina. Many natural materials such as brass, wood, copper and leather actually look better as they age,” she said.  “Vintage items are also unique – usually we only have one of its kind, so after we sell it, it’s gone.” Another key factor is craftsmanship. “A lot of things made in the past, such as typewriters and cooking tools were made to last; not to be discarded.  “Because these were things people depended on to make their living and raise their families, they were generally made with a lot more care. Many are even handmade and hand-welded,” she noted. “In the past, they’d give you almost a lifetime guarantee. That’s the beauty of vintage – you can use it forever. It is more sustainable,” she added.  “Today, many items are mass produced and badly made. People just want to sell you things that you would throw away after two years and buy more so you are constantly consuming.”  Wong also lovingly restores many of the vintage items in By My Old School.  For instance, to make old brass items shine, she soaks them in assam water (used to make curry) before giving them a good scrub. The acidic water softens the dirt and loosens the grime. This, she said, is safer for us and the environment than using chemicals.  For electro plated nickel silver (EPNS) tableware, she uses a sanding block to remove surface tarnish. For more complicated repair and restoration work such as re-upholstery, and broken clocks, gramophones and telephones, she ropes in a rolodex of professionals. A CLOSER CONNECTION WITH OBJECTS If you ask Wong, the problem is not that we love things too much, but that we don’t love them enough.  Sustainability need not be about denying ourselves the things we love and pursuing a minimalistic lifestyle. It can simply be developing a closer connection to each and every object we buy and own.  According to Wong, our satisfaction from purchases is so fleeting because of how detached most online shopping experiences are. “The shopping experience is getting more and more impersonal. You can buy something online from anywhere in the world without stepping into the shop, meeting anyone or knowing much about how the product was made.  This does not give you much satisfaction because you are mindlessly consuming without valuing the things you consume,” she said.  Vintage shopping, on the other hand is about the “thrill of the hunt” and “looking for treasure” among what some may consider junk.  “What inspires me are the stories behind each item, how they were used in the past, and the connection between people and the things they own.”   Some of Wong’s customers have found items that their grandmothers or parents used to own. By sheer coincidence, her family friends even found their old family photo dating back to 1963 among By My Old School’s archives.  “Every collector that comes through our door is looking for specific things. They can’t tell you what it is, but they know it when they see it. It is kind of beautiful – the idea that these things are waiting for their owners.” However, she added that precisely for that reason, running a vintage shop in land scarce Singapore is challenging. Shop owners need enough space to keep things for a long time before the right person comes for it. Wong supplements her income with freelance writing. “I understand that vintage is not everyone’s cup of tea – there are people who don’t want to pay for something old. They want new things,” she said. However, she urged consumers to be open to alternative sources of shopping instead of constantly pursuing new things. “Buy something that has already been produced. Often you will find that the quality is better than many new items,” she said.  “Look for the experience, not things – the material, craftsmanship and story behind the object; not just newness.” With conscious consumption, Wong reckoned retail therapy need not burden the earth with more junk.  “If we shop in a responsible way to our environment, we can instead save 'junk' and still enjoy well-made things,” she said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/indonesia-court-rejects-bid-reinstate-papua-palm-oil-permits-2363441,Indonesia court rejects bid to reinstate palm oil permits in Papua,"JAKARTA: An Indonesian court on Tuesday (Dec 7) rejected a bid by two companies to reinstate permits for palm oil plantations in its easternmost region of Papua, in what was seen as a test of the government's pledge to halt such land conversions to contain deforestation. The verdict comes two months after Indonesia said it would not approve new palm oil permits even after the lapse of a moratorium on plantations. PT Papua Lestari Abadi (PLA) and PT Sorong Agro Sawitindo (SAS) had permits for about 70,000 hectares (172,973 acres) of land, equivalent to nearly seven times the size of the city of Paris. The firms had sued the head of the Sorong district in West Papua overseeing their permits, arguing that revoking them had harmed the companies. The Sorong district head revoked permits covering 105,000 hectares held by PLA, SAS and another company PT Inti Kebun Lestari, which is also fighting the decision in court. The court rejected ""in its entirety the plaintiff's claim,"" Petrus P Ell, a lawyer defending the head of Sorong district, told a virtual conference after the verdict. The companies' lawyer, Juhari, who uses one name, said they would appeal the verdict. Indonesia last month joined 127 other nations pledging an end to deforestation by 2030, but just days later appeared to back track, saying that a zero-deforestation goal was at odds with development interests. Instead, Indonesia promised a ""carbon net sink"" goal for its forestry sector by 2030, meaning that the sector will absorb more greenhouse gas emissions than it emits. The about-face by a country seen as critical to saving tropical rainforests triggered criticism by environmentalists, but Greenpeace Indonesia welcomed Tuesday's court verdict. ""We hope this will be encouraging for other districts and provinces,"" campaigner Nico Wamafma said in a statement. Indonesia, home to the world's third-largest tropical forests and a top producer of palm oil, has banned forest clearing since 2011. The country's environment ministry claims to have reduced the rate of deforestation by 75 per cent last year by controlling forest fires and curbing land clearing."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sustainability/pakistan-wildlife-team-green-turtles-conservation-2360426,Pakistani wildlife team cradles green turtle babies from beach to sea,"KARACHI: A female turtle lumbers across the beach in Pakistan's bustling port city of Karachi late at night, looking for a place to lay her eggs.  Waiting for her, staff from Sindh Wildlife watch quietly as the green turtle buries a hundred or more eggs in the sand before heading back out into the Arabian Sea.  Because of COVID-19 and movement restrictions, beaches around the world have been more sparsely inhabited by humans since last year. Sea turtles have taken the opportunity to return to their birthplaces in large numbers, reclaiming the now less-polluted, serene beaches to lay their eggs during the main September-November breeding season.    Green turtles seen on Karachi beaches jumped to 15,000 last year from 8,000 to 8,500 in 2019, Sindh Wildlife says. Lockdowns ended by the start of this year's season, but conservation experts still expect a large number of the endangered animals to visit. Among the largest sea turtles and the only herbivores, adult green turtles can weigh more than 90kg (200 pounds). They nest in more than 80 countries and live in tropical and subtropical coastal areas of more than 140. Conservation group Sea Turtle Conservancy says there are 85,000 to 90,000 nesting females worldwide. The weather in Karachi can be conducive to egg-laying as late as January, and wildlife officials will keep up their vigil until then.  ""The turtles have still had an ample egg-laying opportunity during this period. In this season, too, we have had a large number of turtles coming here. The result is that within a period of three months, we have nested around 6,000 eggs so far,"" said Ashfaq Ali Memon, who is in charge of Sindh Wildlife's Marine Turtle Unit. As soon as the mother turtle leaves, staff hurry to dig out the eggs and move them to a three-foot (1-metre) deep pit in a hatchery until the babies hatch, 40 to 45 days later. The hatchlings are taken to the beach immediately and released into the sea.  The Sindh turtle unit has released 860,000 turtle babies into the Arabian Sea since being set up in 1970. Memon said 900 have been released so far this season. Conservationists say that in the past, sea turtle populations were threatened by demand for their fat, meat and eggs. But in recent years loss of habitat due to pollution and land reclamation have also taken their toll."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/urban-garden-rio-de-janeiro-former-crackland-2360276,Urban garden in Rio feeds hundreds of families in former ‘crackland’,"RIO DE JANEIRO: The Manguinhos neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro, a slum where addicts once smoked crack and residents dumped trash, has been transformed into a community vegetable garden that now feeds some 800 families struggling with rampant food inflation. The urban garden covers the area of four football fields, according to Rio de Janeiro's ""Hortas Cariocas"" program coordinators, making it one of the largest of its kind in Latin America. ""This particular area was used as a 'cracolândia',"" said Julio Cesar Barros, an agronomist employed by the city. ""If you arrived here on a Wednesday at 10 in the morning, you could find two or three thousand people smoking crack in this area."" Barros said he helped create the ""Hortas Cariocas"" project in 2006 to plant vegetables in various parts of the city and supply organic products to lower-income residents. He said urban gardens also helped prevent irregular occupation of dangerous areas prone to flooding or landslides. ""While I am planting (seeds) I am thinking that in a few days I will be harvesting this and taking it home to eat it,"" said Diane Silva, an urban farm worker. ""I know I am planting to harvest tomorrow ... it gives a lot of pleasure to work in a garden, it is a job that we enjoy, I love this."" The project has now expanded to 49 vegetable gardens across Rio, according to Barros. Ezequiel Dias, a Manguinhos resident who helps to coordinate the project, said the initiative has transformed his community. ""It changed the face of Manguinhos… our communities need exactly this: peace, happiness and a better life."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/cop26-climate-change-sustainable-business-finance-global-banking-2353326,"Commentary: Why COP26 was a watershed moment for business, banks and the financial sector","EDINBURGH: The recent United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow was, it seems, a historic success. We have this on no lesser authority than that of UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who happened to be the meeting’s host. COP26 President Alok Sharma also was upbeat afterward regarding the 2015 Paris climate agreement’s target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. “We set out by saying we wanted to keep 1.5 degrees Celsius within reach,” Sharma said. “We did do that.” And Johnson claimed that there was little difference between the proposed COP26 agreement to “phase out” coal usage and the final text, which pledged only to “phase down” coal. Others took a different view. Perhaps predictably, the teenage Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg described the conference categorically as “a failure.” Climate Action Tracker projects that even if all the COP26 pledges stretching into the future are met, the planet is on track to warm by at least 2.1 degrees Celsius. And India is phasing out in the particular sense of phasing in, with coal-powered electricity generation expected to increase by almost 5 per cent per year this decade. The Financial Times’s Martin Wolf hedged his bets. For him, COP26 “was both triumph and disaster”. But for the private business sector, and especially for banks and other financial firms, the conference on the chilly banks of Glasgow’s River Clyde may well prove to have been a watershed moment. Although the cloud of coal dust obscured other issues, the gathering made some significant progress. Consider a major issue impeding progress toward greening the business sector: The absence of a clear, generally agreed framework for reporting the climate impact of corporate activity.  The problem is not that there is no framework at all, but rather that several competing models present different pictures. The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) in the United States, established by the Value Reporting Foundation (VRF) and supported by Bloomberg, has developed one model. The World Economic Forum (WEF) has worked on another. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), based in Amsterdam, has produced a wide range of sustainability standards. And the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), convened by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in Basel, recommends a set of disclosures that many banks have adopted under pressure from their regulators – many of whom are members of the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). That, you may think, is quite enough acronyms for one paragraph. But another one entered the field of battle in Glasgow. The Chair of the Trustees of the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation, Erkki Liikanen, announced the creation of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) to sit alongside the foundation’s other offspring, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The new board will be based in Frankfurt (no doubt the Germans will avoid another acronym by melding the four words into one). The ISSB will aim to produce standards that “will help investors understand how companies are responding to ESG [environmental, social, and governance] issues, like climate, to inform capital allocation decisions.” There is no doubt that standardisation is needed, and the organisation that has produced a suite of international accounting standards looks like the obvious body to take on the job. But will the ISSB attract enough support to knock together the other acronyms and carry the day? One obvious problem is that after years of effort by the IASB to reconcile its standards with those of the US standard-setters, the Americans have still not adopted them and seem unlikely to do so. Given opposition from most of the US accounting profession, the US Securities and Exchange Commission is reluctant to push the idea onto a suspicious Congress. There is also hesitancy on the other side of the Atlantic, where the European Commission has been working on its own taxonomy of green and brown assets. In an interview that the European Central Bank supervisors circulated to banks in the week after the ISSB announcement at COP26, John Berrigan, the Commission’s financial services director-general, discussed the EU’s taxonomy and plans for a new Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, without mentioning the ISSB. Nor did Berrigan mention the other major financial-sector initiative to emerge from COP26: The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) assembled by Mark Carney, the former FSB Chair who is now the UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance. Carney has corralled 450 banks and insurers to, among other goals, mobilise trillions of dollars of capital to finance decarbonisation in emerging and developing countries. The precise figure he quoted, US$130 trillion, has raised a few sceptical eyebrows, but the scale of the ambition is impressive, and most banks of any consequence have signed up to the scheme. These developments reflect the sea change in financial-sector opinion on climate change in the last couple of years. Pressure from some outspoken investors has contributed to this shift, while regulatory stress tests have exposed the vulnerability of loan portfolios to rising temperatures and policy-driven increases in the carbon price. But bankers are people, too. They now believe they will sleep easier and be able to look their children in the eye if they are part of the green transition, rather than holdouts myopically financing the last ton of mined coal and the last barrel of Brent crude. The ISSB and the GFANZ could give bankers the tools they need to help their clients fund and manage the green transition. And US and European authorities, if they bury their differences, could allow those good intentions to be translated into more effective action. That would mean fewer acronyms – and, more importantly, a clearer path to net-zero. Howard Davies is Chairman of NatWest Group. Project Syndicate."

The world's top greenhouse gas emitter is aiming to bring its carbon emissions to a peak by 2030 and become ""carbon-neutral"" by 2060. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) reiterated the targets of cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 18 per cent, and energy intensity by 13.5 per cent, by 2025, according to the plan that covers the period between 2021 and 2025. It also said it will strictly control capacities in steel, cement, aluminium and other sectors. The MIIT said it will increase clean energy consumption and encourage the use of hydrogen energy, biofuels and refuse-derived fuels in steel, cement, chemical and other industries. The plan also looks to promote the ""rational"" exploitation of mineral resources such as iron ore and nonferrous, and to develop the use of recycled sources, said the ministry."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/tokyo-gas-spend-us175-billion-clean-energy-double-profit-2030-2340421,Tokyo Gas to spend US$17.5 billion on clean energy to double profit by 2030,"TOKYO: Japanese city gas distributor Tokyo Gas said on Friday (Nov 26) it will spend 2 trillion yen (US$17.5 billion) on cleaner fuels, such as hydrogen, and renewable power with the aim of doubling its profit to 200 billion yen by 2030. ""We need to accelerate our actions in the face of a growing global trend toward decarbonisation,"" Tokyo Gas President Takashi Uchida told a news conference. ""We will begin benefitting from our planned investments in the later 2020s and aim to achieve 200 billion yen profit in 2030,"" he said. Tokyo Gas's estimated profit - operating profit plus profit from its shareholdings - for this financial year to next March is forecast at 104 billion yen. About a quarter of the 2 trillion yet budget will be allocated to renewable energy and 100 billion yen to hydrogen production and other clean fuels. Some 500 billion yen will be spent overseas, including on expanding upstream development by its US shale gas unit and liquefied natural gas (LNG) infrastructure operations in Asia, Uchida said. Tokyo Gas and other utilities are stepping up overseas expansion as they face falling demand in Japan, which has an ageing population and a declining birthrate, while the liberalisation of its energy markets has spurred competition among old-guard utilities. Tokyo Gas, which owns about 1.4 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy assets, also lifted its 2030 target to 6 GW from 5 GW. ""The addition will come from local market, including procurement from third parties,"" Uchida said. Japan narrowly averted blackouts last winter as LNG demand and prices soared during a cold snap. The situation this year may get even tighter as heavy use and restocking in Europe and Asia limits supplies and keeps prices near record highs, executives and analysts say. Uchida said he was confident the company had secured enough for even ""a very severe winter"". ""We made arrangements with gas producing countries to fill up our tanks next month, so that we can get through January and February,"" Uchida said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/fishing-singapore-sustainable-bedok-jetty-catch-release-2332636,Trying fishing for the first time at Bedok Jetty – and learning how to do it sustainably,"SINGAPORE: While I have never tried recreational fishing before, it hadn't occurred to me that the hobby could have an impact on sustainability. How could the actions of one angler on Bedok Jetty compare to the kind of overfishing done commercially? Besides, is it not the point of fishing to bring something home for dinner? After all, why else would you spend hours under the hot sun waiting for that elusive nibble? These were the thoughts I grappled with on a sunny Tuesday morning (Nov 23), when I arrived at the jetty in East Coast Park for a sustainable fishing workshop organised by the Marine Stewards, a non-profit marine conservation group. The group had teamed up with local fishing shop SG Fishing Rigz, whose anglers provided the gear and expertise to catch and release fish. The start-up is also promoting sustainable fishing through the use of environmentally-friendly sinkers and circle hooks that boost survival rates. But I was keen to find out if I could even catch anything – I have heard of anglers who spend hours by the water only to go home empty-handed – and beyond that, why I should do it sustainably. The first clue was a giant signboard right at the entrance of the jetty. No, not the one that talked about how the jetty was used exclusively by the Ministry of Defence before it was opened to the public. It was another blue signboard, designed by the Marine Stewards, that showed different species of fish that could be caught at the jetty, how big they get when mature, and whether they should be released back into the sea. The general guideline: Juveniles should be released so they can grow and repopulate fish stocks. I walked down the jetty and was greeted by people wearing caps and the blue Marine Stewards jersey. I asked programme director Andrea Leong why sustainable fishing was important. ""In countries like US and Australia, they (have) got really healthy marine life because they have really strict fisheries management laws,"" she said. ""But in Singapore, there aren't these laws. It's really about the community guidelines that we came up with. The idea is that for this sport to be sustainable in the long term, we need to be fishing sustainably, so that we don't deplete all the fish."" Not depleting fish is crucial when seen in the bigger picture. Each person in Singapore consumes an average of 22kg of seafood a year, above the global average of around 20kg. In 2020, Singapore imported 134,000 tonnes of seafood worth S$760 million, mostly from countries in the region such as Indonesia and Malaysia. Given the finite number of fish in oceans and Singapore’s food security goals, this rate of consumption and imports could be a cause for concern, argued Professor William Chen, who studies foods science at Nanyang Technological University, in a CNA commentary. So if one angler chooses to release 500g of fish every two weeks, this means 1,000 anglers would release one ton of fish per month, or 12 tons a year. These fish get to grow big and spawn, creating a multiplier effect, the Marine Stewards said previously. With the theory part done, it was time to get down and dirty. I was handed over to 18-year-old Wayne Peh, who does business development for SG Fishing Rigz. This was my first time fishing, I told my guide excitedly. The thing about catching fish is that it is not just about casting a line into the sea. So when Wayne asked if I would like to try attaching shrimp to the two hooks on the line fishing line, this wiped the smile off my face. I always got lazy when it came to peeling the shell off prawns during meals. But because I really wanted to fish, I did it anyway. Wayne instructed me to tear up the shrimp into smaller pieces of meat before hooking it on. The hooks were sharp, and I felt one almost going underneath my nail. ""Careful,"" Wayne warned. The next step was to cast. I was looking forward to pulling the rod back, throwing it forward and hearing the whip of the line flinging far into the sea. But since I was using a beginner rod that was shorter, Wayne told me I merely needed to hold it over the water before letting the line fall in. I would be lying if I said I was not disappointed. The way to let the line roll out is to lift the bail arm, a kind of lever, on the reel. The sinker should go all the way to the seabed, Wayne said. When this happened, the reel stopped spinning and I felt a little thud in the rod. Wayne unwound some more line before closing the bail arm. Now came the most infamous part of fishing: Waiting. While Wayne said it could take hours to catch a single large fish, he assured that smaller fish could be caught in minutes. And since my rod was designed for smaller fish, he was hopeful that I would succeed. Wayne showed me how to hold the rod properly, with my master hand on the rod handle and my other hand controlling the reel handle. I have always thought that the master hand was used for the reel, considering how vigorous the action could get. Maybe I just watch too much television. Still, what happens in real life paints a more grim picture. Wayne recalled how one of his colleagues at his fish shop visited Bedok Jetty during the lockdown, when fishing there had stopped for a long time, and discovered an abundance of fish in the water. ""It was one cast, one catch,"" Wayne said. But because there were so many fish, the anglers who were there simply left the smaller ones they caught under the stone benches to die, when they could easily be released into the water. This was when the shop decided it wanted to spread the message of sustainable fishing. On Tuesday, the fish were not exactly out in force. Five minutes went by, nothing. I should feel nibbles in my ""sensitive"" rod, Wayne said, adding that this was the sign for me to jerk the rod upwards before spinning the reel handle. I was not sure if I was feeling nibbles or just the current swaying my bait. Wayne asked me to pull the line up anyway, intending to check if the fish had been smart enough to get away with the bait. But the shrimps were still there. And there was no fish on the hook. Perhaps sensing my disappointment, Wayne cast his own line. Within a minute, he felt movement and passed his rod to me. I reeled it in and lo and behold, a fish appeared. Still, I was not content, determined to do it by myself. I took a few more pieces of shrimp, bigger this time, and pierced it with the hook, careful to conceal the metal tip in the meat. It was as though I was willing myself to fool the fish. Then I cast my line. Barely a minute passed when I felt my rod shake. I jerked it up, swiftly spinning my reel handle. Wayne was wearing a mask, but I could see his eyes lit up. The line emerged and brought with it a kind of yellow fish, no bigger than my palm. ""Yay!"" I squealed. ""Oh, nice!"" Wayne chimed in. It was my first ever official catch. One of the anglers identified it as a diamond wrasse. I held it up to take a picture with it, admiring the dotted patterns on its body. But the sliminess and sharp spines meant it regularly slipped out of my palm. Next, I needed to remove the hook from its mouth before placing it in a tub of water. The fish caught on Tuesday would be held there before being released at the end of the day. Removing the hook turned out to be more difficult than I had imagined. The hook was embedded deep in its mouth, and I could not twist it out even after a few tries. I passed the fish to Wayne, who was starting to show some concern after 30 seconds without results. Wayne put the fish in some water so it could it take a breather. Then he pulled it out again to try pulling out the hook. When even Wayne could not do it, he started asking for a pair of pliers. That was when Marine Stewards member Ryan Chin, 17, stepped in. Ryan, who had initially approached the Marine Stewards with his idea for the sustainable fishing workshop, wrested the hook out after a few seconds, to the awe of the anglers that by now had surrounded us. An avid angler since he was six years old, Ryan has travelled to the numerous jetties in Singapore after picking up fishing with his friends. Soon, he was surprised by the biodiversity he encountered. ""Singapore is blessed with over 500 species of marine fish, yet most of us don’t know they exist,"" he said. Beyond encouraging sustainable fishing, Ryan said the workshop will also help the National Parks Board document different species of fish in an online database. ""It's more of like a census almost of the marine biodiversity that we have in the area,"" he explained, highlighting that such records currently do not exist. ""Even if we know what we have, we don't know how much."" In addition, rarer species of fish caught during the workshop will be donated to the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum for research, Ryan said. One example is the leatherjacket fish that Wayne recently caught. ""This guy's really good at camouflage,"" Ryan said, showing me a picture of the leatherjacket fish and pointing to the grooves on its body. ""These sorts of fish, they don't have much record of in Singapore."" As for my diamond wrasse, Ryan and the team decided that it was going back into the water. The fish was now lying sideways in the tub of water. I looked at the anglers in horror, afraid that it was already dead. But Ryan assured me that the diamond wrasse loves to bury itself in the sand underwater, and that it was now mimicking this behaviour. For my attempt at releasing fish, Wayne passed me a butterfly whiptail bream. Since it was a small fish, I simply had to pick it up and drop it over the water, he said, adding that bigger fish such as stingrays would need to be carried to shore first. I picked up the bream, holding it in both palms as it struggled and almost escaped, and released it into the sea. I watched as it swam away quickly, finally understanding what this workshop hoped to achieve. ""We want to introduce the public to fishing and make the connection with sustainable seafood,"" Andrea said. ""It's also a good activity during the December school holidays, and it's something new for a lot of people. My personal take is that it's a very healthy sport."" The workshop will be conducted on nine days in December. Those interested can sign up on the Marine Stewards website. Personally, Tuesday's session made me realise there was a point to catching a fish, beyond cooking it. While I might have only caught a small fish, I could still somewhat feel the thrill of the hunt. The tension of wondering if you used an appealing bait or cast the line in the right area. The adrenaline rush when the fish struck. With my fingers smelling of shrimp and my catch safely back in the water, I left the jetty feeling satisfied, knowing this would not be my first and last time fishing."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/shell-singapore-pulau-bukom-pyrolysis-oil-unit-2332536,Shell builds Singapore pyrolysis oil unit to convert plastic waste to chemicals,"SINGAPORE: Royal Dutch Shell said on Tuesday (Nov 23) that it plans to build a pyrolysis oil upgrader to turn plastic waste into chemical feedstock at its petrochemical complex on Pulau Bukom, part of its shift from oil and gas to renewables and low-carbon energy. The company is also considering building a carbon capture and storage regional hub and a 550,000 tonnes per year biofuels plant at the 60-year-old Bukom manufacturing site, one of five remaining energy and chemical parks owned by Shell globally. The projects form part of Shell Singapore's plans to cut emissions from its own operations by half by 2030, from 2016 levels on a net basis, Shell downstream director Huibert Vigeveno said. ""This year, we have already halved our crude processing capacity, which is in line with Shell's global targets to reduce emissions,"" he said at a ceremony to break ground for the pyrolysis oil upgrader project. Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong attended the groundbreaking of the unit, where he announced the Government’s plans to transform Jurong Island into a ""sustainable energy and chemicals park"" that operates sustainably and exports sustainable products globally. The plans are detailed in the Singapore Economic Development Board's (EDB) “Sustainable Jurong Island” report, which was released on Tuesday. ""Aspirational targets"" for Singapore's energy & chemicals (E&C) sector set in the report include increasing its output of sustainable products by four times from 2019 levels, and achieving more than 6 million tonnes of carbon abatement per year from low-carbon solutions by 2050. Energy companies are facing increasing pressure from investors, activists and governments to shift away from fossil fuels and rapidly ramp up investment in renewables. Shell has pledged to halve emissions from its global operations by 2030, as well as reduce its net carbon footprint by 45 per cent by 2035. The Singapore pyrolysis oil upgrader will produce 50,000 tonnes per year of treated pyrolysis oil in 2023, the company said. The unit is Shell's first globally. It did not give an investment figure for the Singapore project. Pyrolysis melts plastic waste into products such as pyrolysis oil, which can be upgraded as raw material for plastics and chemicals, although the process isn't commercially proven and consumes a lot of energy. Shell also plans to build two chemical conversion units in Asia to convert waste plastics into pyrolysis oil for the Shell Energy and Chemical Park Singapore at Bukom and Jurong Island, similar to units in the Netherlands with joint venture partner BlueAlp which will be operational in 2023. Other projects being planned in Singapore include a carbon capture and storage hub to reduce emissions. To meet Shell's global ambition to make around 2 million tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel a year by 2025, the company is looking at investing in a facility to produce 550,000 tonnes of biofuels a year from waste and vegetable oils, Vigeveno said. Shell has previously announced that it will trial the use of hydrogen fuel cells for ships in Singapore and is exploring developing a solar farm in a landfill near Bukom."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/woodside-bhp-green-light-australian-scarborough-lng-project-2330326,"Woodside, BHP green light US$12 billion Australian Scarborough LNG project","MELBOURNE: Woodside Petroleum and BHP Group gave their final go-aheads to spend US$12 billion to develop the Scarborough gas field off Western Australia and expand the Pluto liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, with the first cargo expected in 2026. The approval on Monday (Nov 22) came at the same time that Woodside and BHP signed an agreement to merge BHP's petroleum arm into Woodside to create a global top 10 independent oil and gas producer, as announced in August. ""Today's decisions set Woodside on a transformative path. Scarborough will be a significant contributor to Woodside’s cash flows, the funding of future developments and new energy products, and shareholder returns,"" Woodside CEO Meg O'Neill said in a statement. The twinned Scarborough and Pluto Train 2 project is essential to the future of Woodside, Australia's biggest independent oil and gas company, which has had limited growth over the past several years. The final decision for the project was deferred in March last year when oil and gas prices crashed amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Spot Asian LNG prices have rocketed from lows last year below US$2 per million British thermal units to more than US$37 per MMBtu. Scarborough will be able to produce 8 million tonnes a year of LNG for export and 180 terajoules a day of gas for the domestic market. Customers have signed up to buy about 60per cent of Scarborough capacity, including for a proposed urea plant in Western Australia, O'Neill said. Scarborough gas, which will be processed through Pluto Train 2, will be one of the lowest carbon intensity sources of LNG delivered to north Asia, Woodside said. It said the all-in cost of LNG shipped to north Asia would be around US$5.80 per MMBtu, delivering a strong return on the project. Woodside's share of investment in the project is US$6.9 billion, to be funded off its balance sheet. BHP on Monday signed off on US$1.5 billion for the first phase of Scarborough development. It is not a stakeholder in the Pluto LNG plant. To spread the cost of the project, Woodside last week agreed to sell a 49 per cent stake in Pluto Train 2 to Global Infrastructure Partners. ""The announcement confirms that Scarborough economics have improved for Woodside in the wake of the infrastructure selldown,"" Credit Suisse analyst Saul Kavonic said. Green groups have sought to derail the project amid fears carbon emissions from Scarborough gas will worsen global warming. O'Neill dismissed concerns about remaining environmental approvals pending for the project. ""As we work through the series of secondary approvals, it is entirely possible that the regulators will ask us to take additional steps, and that's quite normal,"" she told Reuters. A court will hold its first hearing on Dec 20 on a case brought last year by the Conservation Council of Western Australia (CCWA). The case challenges the state's approval, without a full environmental review, allowing Woodside to process gas at the Pluto LNG plant from an expanded number of fields. The CCWA said on Monday it would continue with a coordinated national campaign against Scarborough gas."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/bosses-hsbc-tata-macquarie-urge-governments-do-more-green-transition-2323001,"Bosses of HSBC, Tata, Macquarie urge governments to do more for green transition","The leaders of Indian conglomerate Tata Sons, HSBC Holdings and Australia's Macquarie Group urged governments to get more involved in the green transition by providing incentives to develop new technology and help bring down costs. The trio were speaking at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore, days after the COP26 climate summit with a deal that for the first time targeted fossil fuels as the key driver of global warming, concluded with a deal that for the first time targeted fossil fuels as the key driver of global warming, though many delegations hoped to have achieved more. ""The hardest move is that political first move because then you create the market conditions,"" said HSBC chief executive Noel Quinn, pointing to risks that the private sector had no control over, including changing political landscapes. The CEO of financial conglomerate and the world's largest infrastructure investor Macquarie, which plans to step up green energy investments, urged governments to provide more incentives. Shemara Wikramanayake said governments can encourage private sector investments by supporting the process of funding and building new technology, such as hydrogen and carbon capture, and then exiting. ""While there will be a lot of private financing and capital available, it cannot be done without public financing,"" said Tata Sons chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran. Tata Sons is working with Macquarie on the Climate Finance Leadership Initiative in India in partnership with Bloomberg. Both Quinn and Wikramanayake highlighted that lowering costs of developing and running renewable energy won't take as much time as the development of solar and wind energy in the earlier phases of moving towards renewables. ""The weight of the world is now behind this, wind and solar - you could argue - led the way and the weight of the world was not behind wind and solar, but there is so much momentum amongst the private sector and the public sector,"" Quinn said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/europe-gas-companies-pipelines-hydrogen-highway-2322841,Europe's gas firms prime pipelines for hydrogen highway,"As world leaders hammered out a deal last week to slow climate change, gas engineer Michele Ricciardi was digging into a practical problem: How thousands of miles of pipelines across Italy and Europe can safely carry hydrogen. The Italian is at the forefront of gas carriers' efforts to prepare for a lower carbon future: If fossil fuels are phased out in coming decades, natural gas companies believe that should not mean the infrastructure that carries them must go too. They want to repurpose pipelines to carry zero-emissions hydrogen after countries wean themselves off natural gas. The effort by nearly two dozen companies reflects the accelerating pace of planning taking place in the global oil and gas industry, from drillers to refiners, keen to adapt as governments and activists ramp up the pressure to slash greenhouse gases. Besides practical preparation, the transition puts firms into competition with other energy sources for funding, even as they invest billions of euros in markets they can't predict. The hydrogen project - involving Italy's Snam SpA, Spain's Enagas S.A. and Germany's Open Grid Europe (OGE) among others – would rely on vast solar farms as far flung as the Sahara desert to create the energy needed to produce hydrogen from water. That fuel would then be piped to Europe's industrial heartland along the existing web of natural gas pipelines – a 198,500km (123,300 mile) network that, if untangled, could encircle the equator four times. ""Once we have the sun of the Sahara in German factories ... that's like the Roman roads we are still walking on today,"" Ricciardi's boss Marco Alvera, chief executive of Snam, told Reuters. ""It's forever."" The companies want to form a European Hydrogen Backbone (EHB) to prevent the pipelines from rusting up into what the industry calls ""stranded assets."" They calculate that about 69 per cent of existing pipelines can be converted for up to 81 billion euros (US$94 billion). The project is one of hundreds of plans to build a hydrogen economy, which the European Union says could involve investments of up to 460 billion euros by 2030. A hydrogen supply network could add to Europe's energy security: The bloc currently relies on natural gas to meet 28 per cent of its energy needs, with a third of the gas from Russia. Politicians have recently accused Moscow of holding back supplies as gas prices climbed to record levels. Russia says it has filled all its contractual requirements. ""I think it's a brilliant idea,"" Frans Timmermans, European Commissioner for Climate Action, told Reuters. Adapting existing natural gas networks to transport hydrogen is about 25 per cent of the cost of building a new infrastructure for renewable energy, he said. But the European Union is not providing cash for the venture - that must come from industry or national governments. So it will need political and industrial support. To succeed, the gas grids need to be able to direct hydrogen blended with natural gas to the customers who can use it – like steelmakers, chemical companies and refineries. The supply needs to be safe, and volumes big enough for it to be affordable. Eventually - if green hydrogen can be provided in huge quantities - the auto industry and home heating suppliers may also start to use it. But that wouldn't be before 2030, studies show. The gas grid companies say their main challenge now is the fact Europe has no regulatory framework for them to adapt the network. ""The regulation needs to define hydrogen as a gas that can be transported and used similarly to natural gas,"" said Maria Sicilia, strategy director at Enagas. If the regulation sets standards, she said, the networks can be interlinked. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, mostly occurring bound to oxygen in water. But it's also one of the most highly combustible. In the past, dozens of hydrogen airships that exploded or burned, including the Hindenburg fire of 1937, have convinced many that hydrogen is highly risky. Snam and other companies say their industry has decades of experience, having built the infrastructure in the first place, so hydrogen need be no more hazardous than other fuels used today. If hydrogen leaks into the open air, it rises and its concentration falls rapidly below the explosive level, according to Zukunft Gas, a German gas lobby. From his office near Snam's critical gas-flow room at Milan headquarters, Ricciardi and his team have for the past three years combed bit by bit through Europe's biggest gas transport network to make sure it can handle the gas. Snam has said it is ready to spend more than 3 billion euros on the replacement of gas pipelines that are hydrogen-compliant. ""We've been moving natural gas around for the last 80 years,"" says Ricciardi, whose job is to establish standards that the industry can agree to make pipes safe. ""Now we've got to do it with hydrogen."" Flammability is just one problem. Compared to natural gas, hydrogen also leaks more easily because its molecules are smaller. Its flow patterns are different, and it even attacks some grades of steel, making them brittle. The changes needed will vary by gas grid, but companies must examine pipes meticulously to make sure the steel is sound and the seals airtight. Compressor stations along the way may need to be adapted, and installations will be fitted with sensors to track leaks and then vent and divert them. The oil and other industries already use hydrogen as a feedstock - Germany's supply amounts to the equivalent of about a tenth of its power usage, mostly in steel and chemicals. But that gas is made using fossil fuels and is known as ""grey"" hydrogen [nL4N2S72U5]. The pipeline network already includes four lines connecting Algeria, Morocco, Libya and Tunisia with Spain and Italy. ""The problem now of course is that it is filled with natural gas,"" said Ad van Wijk, a professor of future energy systems at Delft Technical University. But ""the backbone is already in place,"" he said. He advocates linking up Europe and Africa to run Europe's energy system on 50 per cent renewable energy and 50 per cent green hydrogen. Cost is another concern. So far, ""green"" hydrogen has been produced mostly for experimental projects. It costs four to five times more than the grey variety to produce. To cut that, the industry and consumers need to scale up production and demand. Snam's Alvera says solar panels in southern Spain, the Sahara and parts of the Middle East can provide cheap renewable electricity to power electrolysis plants which pump hydrogen into the repurposed pipes. Spain is already one of the cheapest sites in Europe to produce renewable electricity, according to industry association Solar Power Europe, and costs are projected to fall. Meanwhile, the companies say they can also carry gas produced from fossil fuels but with the resulting emissions captured - known as ""blue"" hydrogen. Thomas Deser, a senior portfolio manager at huge German fund Union Investment, is sceptical. He believes that ""before the middle of the decade, without subsidies, you cannot make any money from producing green hydrogen."" The hydrogen backbone is now in competition for state money. Germany is Europe's biggest energy consumer. Berlin has pledged 9 billion euros up to 2030 to develop a green hydrogen industry, two billion of it earmarked to boost imports from partner countries such as Morocco, Chile, Saudi Arabia and Australia. But electricity is another fast-growing source of relatively clean power, and Germany's electricity transmission network is also in growing demand. Germany plans to spend 1 billion euros by 2025 on electric vehicle charging infrastructure, plus hundreds of millions more on purchasing premiums and tax breaks. The country is home to the world's biggest carmaker by volume, Wolfsburg-based Volkswagen AG. While car firms are developing hydrogen fuel-cell prototypes alongside battery cars, Europe's automakers don't see hydrogen as their first choice of power. VW has already committed billions of euros to battery-based electric vehicle technology. It told Reuters it believes changes in powering mobility must take place in large volumes. Herbert Diess, VW's CEO, tweeted in May that ""the hydrogen car is proven to NOT be the climate-friendly solution,"" saying ""electrification has established itself in traffic."" Nonetheless, new demand for hydrogen is emerging: Globally, 359 large-scale projects had been announced by July 2021, according to the Hydrogen Council and consultants McKinsey, which said 80 per cent of new initiatives were in Europe. Snam says it has successfully tested a mix of natural gas and 30 per cent hydrogen to fire furnaces at an Italian steel company. In Milan, Ricciardi says ramping up blending rates is tricky, so standards are crucial. ""We're working on the new rule book to make sure the network is up to the job,"" Ricciardi said. ""There's a lot riding on it.""  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/food-waste-nea-nus-nparks-east-coast-park-electricity-fertiliser-2319196,"Pilot project to use hawker centre food waste to generate electricity, produce fertiliser","SINGAPORE: Food waste at East Coast Lagoon Food Village will be used to generate electricity and produce fertiliser as part of a pilot project, the National Environment Agency (NEA), National University of Singapore (NUS) and National Parks Board (NParks) said in a joint news release on Wednesday (Nov 17). An anaerobic digestion system for food waste treatment developed by NUS researchers will convert food scraps and leftovers into biogas and bio-fertiliser. A biogas engine will then convert the biogas into electricity, while the bio-fertiliser will be used for landscaping applications. “Food waste is one of the priority waste streams identified under Singapore’s Zero Waste Masterplan,” the media release said. “In 2020, food waste accounted for about 11 per cent of the total waste generated in Singapore, but only 19 per cent of the food waste was recycled. The rest of it was disposed of at waste-to-energy plants. “Therefore, reducing food wastage, redistributing unsold or excess food, and recycling/treating food waste are important food waste management strategies.” The holistic management of food waste also helps to prevent the contamination of other recyclables, and stops the spread of vermin and bad odours, it added. The pilot is supported by NEA under its Closing the Waste Loop research and development initiative. “Innovations such as on-site anaerobic digestion make it possible to create useful products from food waste, which would otherwise have to be sent for incineration,” said Patrick Pang, NEA’s chief technology officer. “Such technologies help to reduce the environmental footprint of managing food waste and contribute to a circular economy.” The anaerobic digestion system works by allowing microbes to feed on source-segregated digestible food waste like fruit and vegetable trimmings, preparation scraps from hawker stalls and leftovers from diners. As part of the process, the microbes produce biogas which is rich in methane, and nutrient-rich digestate. “Biogas is used to run a gas engine to generate electricity, while the digestate could be used as fertilisers for ornamental plants and landscaping applications,” the news release said. The electricity will be used to power the digestion system itself, as well as two mobile phone charging stations for the public. Excess electricity can also be used to power up to 31 wall-mounted fans at East Coast Lagoon Food Village. The digestate produced by the system will be studied by NParks for use at East Coast Park. Group director for Parks East at NParks Chia Seng Jiang said: “NParks is working closely with NUS researchers on the experimental design of this project and practical applications of the digestate. “We are identifying pilot sites at East Coast Park to test the efficacy of the digestate as fertiliser.” Anaerobic digestion technology is in use around the world but it is typically implemented at off-site or centralised facilities, NEA, NUS and NParks said in the release. “This pilot project, however, examines the feasibility of using anaerobic digestion as an on-site treatment solution to close the food waste loop at the source of food waste generation,” they added. The pilot will “gather longer term, real-world data while showcasing that a customised anaerobic digestion system at the food village is feasible and practical”. Stallholders and table cleaners have been provided with covered bins to aid in the segregation of food waste, and the contents of these bins will be emptied into five “smart bins” placed around the hawker centre. These smart bins record data on the amount of segregated food waste each user deposits. The hawker centre has about 60 occupied stalls which together produce about 150kg of digestible food waste each day. Associate Professor Tong Yen Wah from the NUS Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering will lead the team overseeing the operation and maintenance of the anaerobic digestion system. The team will also study the human psychology and behavioural factors in encouraging hawkers and cleaners to segregate food waste from other waste. “Our NUS team is excited to be leading this effort, with support from NEA and NParks, to reduce waste in Singapore and turn food scraps into a green energy resource,” Assoc Prof Tong said. “Our technology is unique because it is easy to operate, and can now generate heat, fertiliser and electricity for areas at or around the hawker centre. “When coupled with the human behavioural studies, our system is no longer just mere technology, but a component of social change that will help to ensure the success of an on-site system to close the food waste loop at its source.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/coal-singapore-energy-phasing-out-challenges-cop26-2314791,From 1.2% to zero: What will it take to phase out coal from Singapore's energy mix?,"SINGAPORE: Even though coal makes up just over 1 per cent of Singapore's energy needs, phasing out the use of the fossil fuel may not be such a straightforward affair for Singapore, experts say.  On Nov 4, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu announced that Singapore has joined the Powering Past Coal Alliance, an international coalition of 137 governments and businesses promoting the transition from coal to clean energy. This was announced at the 26th United Nations Climate Change conference, otherwise known as COP26, held in Glasgow, Scotland earlier this month.  Singapore’s membership in the alliance requires that it phases out its own use of “unabated” coal power – referring to the burning of coal without the use of technology to capture carbon emissions – by 2050, as well as ends direct government financing of such unabated coal power internationally.  On coal financing, the three major local banks – DBS, UOB and OCBC – have pledged not to finance any new coal-fired power plants. In addition, DBS has announced a commitment to phase out thermal coal exposure, which includes coal mining. Coal is often described as the “dirtiest” fossil fuel, producing twice as much carbon dioxide compared to natural gas and responsible for 46 per cent of global carbon emissions, according to the International Energy Agency.  Given the almost three-decade headstart, observers say Singapore may well be able to meet the first goal far ahead of the 2050 deadline. More than 95 per cent of Singapore’s electricity demands are met by natural gas, with coal making up just 1.2 per cent of the country’s energy needs.  Singapore’s only coal-burning utility plant is the Tembusu Multi-Utilities Complex on Jurong Island, which supplies steam and electricity to chemical companies on the industrial island.  Officially opened in 2013 at a cost of S$2 billion, the complex – which burns low-sulphur coal as well as other materials such as wood chips and natural gas – is operated by Tuas Power, which has been owned by Chinese firm Huaneng Power International since 2008. Speaking in Parliament in 2013, then-Second Minister for Trade and Industry S Iswaran said only “low ash and low sulphur” coal would be used, with biomass mixed with coal to lower the complex’s greenhouse gas emissions to below that of an equivalent fuel plant.  Mr Iswaran said then that the complex had to meet “stringent requirements” for pollutants such as particulate matter and mercury. It also had to meet environmental standards as stipulated under the Environmental Protection and Management Act and its Regulations.  “From a national level supply and demand perspective and considering current excess generation capacity, Singapore can phase out the use of coal before 2050,” said Dr Victor Nian, founding member, council member and honorary general secretary of the International Society for Energy Transition Studies. “However, with coal capturing the major proportion of the fuel supply to the complex, such action means the complex would either source for additional biomass supply or shut down the generation units before its end of service life,” he added.  Singapore Management University (SMU) climate scientist Winston Chow said there is no reason why Singapore can't phase out coal ahead of 2050, but noted that the 150 workers employed at the plant need to be retrained for other jobs. He also pointed to Singapore’s intention to explore carbon capture technology – referring to the process of capturing and either storing or recycling carbon dioxide – and said he “wouldn’t be surprised” if the Jurong Island plant was utilised for such purposes, together with other oil-fired and natural gas plants. “From a technical standpoint, carbon capture, coal-to-liquid and coal-to-gas are all potential options to reduce the environmental impact of coal use,” said Dr Nian, though he noted these could be costly.  Associate Professor Chow said the technology already exists on a small scale to capture and convert carbon from fossil fuels to other uses. He noted however that there are issues with the economics of both conversion and utilisation of carbon in such a way, as well as storing and sequestering it away from the atmosphere.  Such options would need to be deployed at an industrial scale to justify their cost, said Dr Nian.  “Given the various constraints facing Singapore and the present power market situation, phasing out coal is a more practical approach to decarbonisation,” he said.  Even so, this could lead to the Tembusu Multi-Utilities Complex becoming a “stranded asset”, he said, since a typical coal-fired power plant has a lifespan of between 40 and 50 years.  “Since there are not enough domestic biomass resources and (given) the lower heating value of biomass compared to coal, moving towards 100 per cent biomass,  instead of shutting down the plant, can hinder cost competitiveness in the power market,” said Dr Nian.  At the end of COP26 on Saturday (Nov 13), almost 200 countries came together in a pact to combat climate change.  Mr Prakash Sharma, Asia-Pacific head of markets and transitions at energy research consultancy Wood Mackenzie, noted that countries such as China and India had insisted that the wording of the final text be amended to “phase down” rather than “phase out” coal-fired power.    “Last minute changes reflect current realities of individual energy markets where countries aim to prioritise supply security over environmental goals, at least through the medium term until other clean baseload supply options are commercially available at the scale that’s needed to replace coal in power generation,” he said.   Short of eliminating fossil fuels entirely, employing carbon capture, utilisation and storage technology may well be the most environmentally friendly option for Singapore moving forward. 
 
“The most ideal carbon-friendly way is not to extract and burn fossil fuels at all, but in several contexts where there is energy scarcity and renewable energy can’t be easily upscaled, applying CCUS (carbon capture, utilisation and storage) is one of the ways to address these issues,” said SMU's Assoc Prof Chow. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/climate-change-carbon-footprint-supply-chain-amazon-logistics-2306571,Commentary: Firms like Amazon want to be ESG-friendly but have unaccounted long supply chains,"BALTIMORE, Maryland: If you own stocks, chances are good you have heard the term ESG. It stands for environmental, social and governance, and it's a way to laud corporate leaders who take sustainability - including climate change - and social responsibility seriously, and punish those who do not. In less than two decades since a United Nations report drew attention to the concept, ESG investing has evolved into a US$35 trillion industry. Money managers overseeing one-third of total US assets under management said they used ESG criteria in 2020, and by 2025 global assets managed in portfolios labelled ""ESG"" are expected to reach US$53 trillion. These investments have gained momentum in part because they cater to investors' growing desire to have a positive impact on society. By quantifying a company's actions and outcomes on environmental, social and governance issues, ESG measures offer investors a way to make informed trading decisions. However, investors' trust in ESG funds may be misplaced. As scholars in the field of supply chain management and sustainable operations, we see a major flaw in how rating agencies, such as Bloomberg, MSCI and Sustainalytics, are measuring companies' ESG risk: The performance of their supply chains. Nearly every company's operations are backed by a global supply chain that consists of workers, information and resources. To accurately measure a company's ESG risks, its end-to-end supply chain operations must be considered. Our recent examination of ESG measures shows that most ESG rating agencies do not measure companies' ESG performance from the lens of the global supply chains supporting their operations. For example, Bloomberg's ESG measure lists ""supply chain"" as an item under the ""S"" (social) pillar. By this measure, supply chains are treated separately from other items, such as carbon emissions, climate change effects, pollutants and human rights. This means all those items, if not captured in the ambiguous ""supply chain"" metric, reflect each company's own actions but not their supply chain partners'. Even when companies collect their suppliers' performance, ""selective reporting"" can arise because there is no unified reporting standard. One recent study found that companies tend to report environmentally responsible suppliers and conceal ""bad"" suppliers, effectively ""greenwashing"" their supply chain. Carbon emissions are another example. Many companies, such as Timberland, have claimed great successes in reducing emissions from their own operations. Yet the emissions from their supply chain partners and customers, known as ""Scope 3 emissions"", may remain high.  ESG rating agencies have not been able to adequately include Scope 3 emissions because of a lack of data: Only 19 per cent of companies in the manufacturing industry and 22 per cent in the service industry disclose this data. More broadly, without accounting for a company's entire supply chain, ESG measures fail to reflect global supply chain networks that today's big and small companies alike depend on for their day-to-day operations. Amazon, for example, is among ESG funds' largest and favourite holdings. As a company bigger than Walmart in terms of annual sales, Amazon has reported emissions from shipping that are only one-seventh of Walmart's. But when researchers for two advocacy groups reviewed public data on imports, they found only about 15 per cent of Amazon's ocean shipments could be tracked. In addition, Amazon's figure does not reflect emissions generated by its many third-party sellers and their suppliers who operate outside the US This difference matters: Whereas Walmart's supply chain relies on a centralised procurement strategy, Amazon's supply chain is highly decentralised - a large percentage of its revenue comes from third-party suppliers, about 40 per cent of which sell directly from China, which further complicates emissions tracking and reporting. Another important ESG metric concerns consumer protection. Amazon prides itself as ""Earth's most customer-centric company."" However, when its customers have been injured by products sold by third-party sellers on its platform, Amazon has argued that it should not be held liable for the damage, because it functions as an ""online marketplace"" matching buyers and sellers. Amazon's foreign third-party sellers are often not subject to US jurisdiction so can't be held accountable. Yet major ESG rating agencies do not appear to reflect the supply chain implication on customer protection when measuring Amazon supply chain performance. For example, in 2020, MSCI, the largest ESG ratings agency, upgraded Amazon's ESG rating from BB to BBB, reflecting its strength in areas such as corporate governance and data security, despite its consumer liability risk. These gaps are also concerns for ratings of companies such as 3M, ExxonMobil and Tesla. Currently there is no unified reporting standard, so different companies may cherry-pick certain ESG performance measures to report to boost their sustainability and social ratings. To improve consistency, the next step would be for ESG rating agencies to redesign their methodology to take into account what may be environmentally harmful and unethical operations across the entire global supply chain. ESG rating agencies could, for example, create incentives for companies to collect and disclose their supply chain partners' activities, such as Scope 3 emissions. In June 2021, the German Parliament passed the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, which will become effective in 2023. Under this new law, large companies based in Germany will be responsible for social and environmental issues arising from their global supply chain networks. This includes prohibitions on child labour and forced labour, and attention to occupational health and safety throughout the entire supply chain. Those who violate the law face a fine of up to 2 per cent of their annual revenues. The European Union's new Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, which went into effect in March 2021, adds pressure in a different way. It requires funds to report details on how they integrate ESG characteristics into their investment decisions. That has led some money managers to drop the phrase ""ESG integrated"" from some of their assets, Bloomberg reported. Without similar laws in the US, we believe ESG rating agencies could fill an important gap. To be sure, surveying a company's entire supply chain's ESG performance is far more complex. Yet by tying all the ESG dimensions to a company's supply chain end-to-end operations, rating agencies can nudge corporate leaders to be responsible for actions across their supply chains that would otherwise be kept in the dark.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cop26-singapore-climate-change-target-grace-fu-2312456,Singapore to review its climate change target as world leaders agree COP26 deal,"GLASGOW: The Singapore Government will go back and review its climate change target after top level talks concluded late on Saturday (Nov 13) at COP26. The Glasgow Climate Pact was finally agreed to after negotiations stretched more than 24 hours past the deadline in Glasgow.  For the first time, world parties agreed to reduce the burning of coal, and also promised to more urgently cut carbon emissions and provide more money to developing countries to adapt to climate change impacts. Singapore agreed to the final text, which Minister for Sustainability and Environment Grace Fu said helped keep alive the ambition of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.  ""This has been a most productive conference as it has demonstrated the weight of momentum for global climate action. It’s a very big win for the multilateral approach in addressing climate change,"" Ms Fu told reporters in Glasgow. ""This COP really has seen great momentum all round. We have made progress in all areas.  ""Not everyone is happy on all counts but we hope that everyone will see this as an important first step to operationalise the Paris Agreement rulebook that we have agreed on and use that as a foundation to further work to be done at subsequent COPs."" Part of the pact requests parties return to next year’s COP, to be held in Egypt, with even more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which are national roadmaps explaining how each country plans to reach net zero. A work programme has also been set up for countries to increase ambition by 2030, which is seen as crucial to slow down the overheating of the planet.  While acknowledging that she had been questioned by activists, NGOs and some ministers about Singapore’s overall climate goals, Ms Fu said Singapore would now review its targets.  In its latest NDC, released in 2020, Singapore stated an aim of “achieving net zero emissions as soon as viable in the second half of the century”. “We will go back and look at what we need to do, look at our responsibilities and review our position. We will review the NDC seriously. This whole package requires us as a party to take them seriously,” she said. Climate Action Tracker, an independent scientific analysis that monitors countries’ climate goals still rates Singapore’s climate policies as “critically insufficient” and “not at all consistent with the Paris Agreement”. 
In September, the National Climate Change Secretariat said the Climate Action Tracker report may not have fully accounted for the unique challenges Singapore faced.  In a speech earlier during the conference, Ms Fu had explained that Singapore was not afraid to take bold action, despite its limitations being a small island nation with limited potential to develop renewable energy infrastructure.  “There is some obligation as a party under this COP agreement to do our part,” she said, during the media briefing on Saturday. “I think there must be an appreciation in Singapore about the impact of climate change, and we must convince, encourage Singaporeans to also take collective action.”  Parties established a work programme to define the global goal on adaptation and promised to at least double finance for adaptation. This was of particular concern to many poorer and vulnerable nations already counting the costs of climate change onset.  Ms Fu said that she sympathised with the position of small island nations on such issues. Many of their representatives gave emotional pleas at the informal plenary sessions ahead of the final text agreement. 
 
“We think more needs to be done to address the concerns of small island states, particularly with adaptation and loss and damages “We’ve heard their plight, we have a lot of sympathy for their position and would like to support them as much as possible. “Many of the parties have voiced their reservations, their suggestions and their areas where they are uncomfortable. But many of them have said they are prepared to live with the package,” she added. The US$100 billion of annual financing that was meant to be mobilised by developed nations for developing nations has yet to materialise. But US$500 billion should be provided by 2025, according to Alok Sharma, the UK’s COP26 president. Ms Fu, was intimately involved in talks around Article 6, one of the most complex and contested parts of the Paris Agreement, agreed upon in 2015. Her work facilitating ministerial consultations has now helped to finalise the rules on how countries can reduce their carbon emissions using international carbon markets. It was an issue she likened to a “spaghetti bowl” due to the multiple strands intertwined within the article. “It’s one of those perennial issues that’s complicated. And the reason it’s complicated is because it has strands coming from ambition, finance, share of proceeds and also transparency.  “If you are using the carbon market, there is a fear that it will actually dilute ambition if you don't use it properly, because there’s greenwashing, there’s double counting,” she said. Throughout COP26, Singapore has signed up to several partnership coalitions: The Powering Past Coal Alliance, the Global Coal to Clean Power Transition Statement, the Global Methane Pledge, the Greening Government Initiative (GGI) and the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM4C). The country also agreed to join the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and Land Use on Friday. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/china-wields-political-might-cool-coal-prices-winter-looms-2308776,"China wields political might to cool coal prices, but winter looms","BEIJING :In just 10 days after a blizzard of meetings and official notices, Chinese regulators last month nearly halved soaring domestic prices for thermal coal, the main source of power for the world's No. 2 economy. Beijing's raft of interventions underscored the extent - and some limitations - of its regulatory might, but the country still faces the daunting task of keeping the fuel cheap and abundant through winter. The price of thermal coal - which accounts for roughly 60per cent of China's electricity needs - more than tripled in the 12 months to mid-October after years of moves to curb overproduction ran into booming post-pandemic industrial demand for power. As soaring prices forced electricity producers to curb output, sparking power rationing and sapping economic growth, Beijing raced to boost production https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/china-coal-surge-puts-supply-record-power-jump-within-reach-2021-10-22 and bring in measures ranging from price targets https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/china-planner-met-with-coal-producers-study-profiteering-standards-2021-10-28 to a crackdown on hoarding and probes into data providers. The most-traded thermal coal futures on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange plunged in the 10 days after hitting a lifetime high on Oct. 19, and were down 56per cent from that mark on Friday. Spot physical coal prices at the southern port of Guangzhou also fell sharply and are now down nearly 44per cent from their October high. Prices for both, though, are still up more than 60per cent so far this year. ""No other country could have achieved a similar result considering the scale and timeline,"" said Steve Hulton and Fabian Ronningen, analysts at consultancy Rystad Energy said.  ""It truly shows the power of Chinese authorities over the domestic coal market and the economy in general.""     The raft of interventions has spilled into the global coal market, with prices in major coal exporters Australia and Indonesia falling in recent days, and has left market participants wary of further regulatory meddling. And as colder temperatures across China crank up demand for heating and the need for more coal, Beijing is likely to face pressure to manage the country's power-generating fuel supplies and costs until well into 2022, analysts and traders said.  'STEADY DECLINE' To reverse the months-long climb in the price of coal, Beijing held dozens of meetings with producers, utilities, railway operators and industry associations, producing a flurry of market missives and warnings. Some 71 power-related documents were issued by 32 national and local government bodies in October alone, according to a summary circulated among traders, chilling trading activity in coal futures, with coal open interest and volumes slumping on the Zhengzhou exchange. ""'Never fight the regulators' is the mantra,"" noted Kevin Xue, senior Asia economist at Commonwealth Bank. Miners were urged to reverse course after years of efforts to curb overcapacity by shutting inefficient, low yielding or environmentally damaging coal deposits. So far, Beijing's cajoling has worked, with daily coal output scaling a record high of 12.05 million tonnes on Nov. 10, the country's state planner said. Traders who attended a meeting called by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) on Nov. 3 said the message from the top economic planner now was that coal prices should not fall too far and too fast. ""With more coal capacity to be released and production to continue to increase ... coal prices are expected to continue to decline steadily,"" the NDRC said on Sunday. LOW STOCKS The recent swell in fresh coal mine supply and a regulatory change allowing power producers to pass on higher prices https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/what-does-chinas-power-policy-shift-mean-metal-makers-other-energy-hogs-2021-10-13 has helped raise electricity output for households and reduce the number of power curbs in effect since September.  But analysts are closely eyeing China's coal stockpiles for signs of market tightness. Total coal inventories held at key ports across China - a measure which reflects both domestic production and imports - were at 52.4 million tonnes in October, according to the China Coal Transportation and Distribution Association. This is up 1.8per cent from September but roughly 20per cent below the October average from 2017 to 2020. Inventories held by key power plants as at end-October were roughly 38per cent below the average for that month from 2017 to 2020, according to Caixin Data Technology Co. The upcoming winter may also strain supplies, especially in open pit mines which can be affected by heavy snow - raising questions over the sustainability over the recent rise in output. And with heating demand now set to climb as winter sets in, China's State Grid Corp warned on Sunday there would be a ""tight balance"" between power supply and demand until Spring. Rystad Energy analysts expect prices to continue to retreat in the short to medium term but warned ""the thermal coal market is still currently very tight so any supply disruptions or extreme winter weather events could easily send prices shooting back up again."" ""We expect price volatility to be high,"" they added.  What is clearer is Beijing's commitment to steering the market, said Yu Aiqun, a researcher at U.S.-based Global Energy Monitor think tank. ""The government can put its hand in the market as deep as it wants,"" she said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/indonesia-mangrove-rehabilitation-jokowi-600000-hectares-2024-2306296,"Indonesia has announced an ambitious mangrove rehabilitation plan, but it could be an uphill climb","JAKARTA: Treading carefully on bamboo walkways perched above the swamp, several top Indonesian officials arrived at Jakarta’s nature park Angke Kapuk on Oct 13, ready to plant mangrove shrubs to launch the 2021 National Mangrove Map.  They clapped, and then lowered the shrubs into the water.  Along Indonesia’s coastline lies more than 3.3 million ha of mangrove forests. This accounts for about 23 per cent of all mangrove ecosystems in the world. Out of this, around 600,000 ha of them have been damaged. Earlier this year, the government set an ambitious target to rehabilitate all of the damaged mangroves by 2024.   The national mangrove map, which was launched by Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment Luhut Pandjaitan, Environment and Forestry Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar, and Head of the Peatland and Mangrove Restoration Agency (BRGM) Hartono during the October event, will be the database and reference for mangrove restoration in the country. “This one mangrove map is the right step to continue working to rehabilitate mangroves according to the president's agenda,” said Mr Pandjaitan. Signalling a sound of optimism, Mdm Bakar added: “We have many experiences from the late 1990s and 2003 on how to transform fish ponds and rehabilitate them into mangrove ecosystems.” While those interviewed by CNA noted the importance of restoring damaged mangroves in Indonesia, they are also well aware of the multiple challenges that lie ahead.  The country’s success depends on the mangroves’ regeneration period after replanting, availability of funding and public education, among other factors. Mangroves can absorb up to five times more carbon emission than a tree in an upland area. Hence, they are important especially in fighting climate change. Various studies have shown that mangroves and the soil beneath them can store up to 89 tonnes of carbon per ha. Under carbon emission trading schemes, which is an approach to tackle climate change by creating a market with limited allowances for emissions, the stored carbon can be traded.  Mangrove trees in Indonesia can grow as high as 50m. During high tide, they are usually flooded. Nevertheless, mangroves can withstand large waves and act as a barrier against tsunamis, protecting residents in coastal areas. They can also be processed for consumption or sale, not to mention the potential for ecotourism. However, many mangroves have been damaged due to natural reasons or human behaviour, said Ms Khesyia Abigail Makhas, a climate analyst with non-governmental organisation World Resources Institute (WRI) Indonesia and her colleague Mr Arief Wijaya, senior manager for climate and ocean issues when interviewed by CNA. “Naturally, they could be damaged due to high waves, for example when sea level rises, or there are storms that can damage them,” said Ms Makhas. Additionally, Ms Makhas said that WRI Indonesia has found that the biggest contributor to mangrove destruction in Indonesia is the establishment of ponds as mangroves trees must be cleared to make way for their construction.  The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said in 2007 that Indonesia had lost 40 per cent of its mangroves in the last 30 years mainly due to conversion of land for shrimp farms, excessive logging, conversion of land to agriculture or salt pans, oil spills and pollution.  Another problem is plastic waste. “Mangroves’ roots are for breathing and if they are covered with plastic, they can’t breathe,” Ms Makhas explained. Industrial waste is also another factor. “Even though one of the tasks of mangroves is to neutralise substances … they have their limits,” said Ms Makhas. Meanwhile, Greenpeace Indonesia forest campaigner Iqbal Damanik said some other causes of mangrove destruction are the establishment of settlements, plantations, as well as infrastructure in coastal areas such as reclamation, roads and ports. The Indonesian government has pledged to slash 29 per cent of carbon emissions by 2030, or 41 per cent with international help. The rehabilitation of mangroves is part of the effort to meet the target, said government officials. Earlier this month, President Joko Widodo mentioned the 600,000 ha rehabilitation target in his speech at the World Leaders Summit held at the global climate change conference COP26 in Glasgow. Also in Glasgow, Mr Pandjaitan, the coordinating minister, said that Indonesia’s mangrove restoration programme is the largest in the world, while vice environment and forestry minister Alue Dohong stated that Indonesia is very serious about conserving its mangrove forests. In a panel discussion held at the sidelines of COP26 on Nov 5, Mr Dohong said that Indonesia is initiating the development of a World Mangrove Centre (WMC) with the support of the German government. “The WMC will bridge, coordinate and strengthen the collaboration among all stakeholders at all levels in various countries to support mangrove forest management,” he said, while calling for the international community to cooperate and share knowledge and experiences in sustainable mangrove management. Mr Yaya Ihya Ulumuddin, a researcher with the Oceanographic Research Centre of the National Innovation Research Agency (BRIN) who is involved in the establishment of the 2021 national mangrove map, said that Indonesia’s target to restore mangroves is extraordinary. “Because it is big and in previous years it only managed to restore dozens of thousand ha, not hundreds of thousand ha, this is very huge,” said Mr Ulumuddin. Despite the level of ambition, Mr Ulumuddin said whether Indonesia will ultimately meet the target depends on how it defines restoration or rehabilitation of mangroves. “Rehabilitation means that after an activity, the forest must exist. But if the definition is the number of mangroves being planted or the planted area, I think that is achievable by 2024.” “For mangroves to be forests again, that would need at least five years after replanting. That’s the fastest rate,” he said. Funding is a real challenge. Mdm Ayu Dewi Utari, secretary of the BRGM, said that initially, the agency was given the target to restore 83,000 ha of mangroves this year. But due to rising COVID-19 cases which lead to budget constraints, the target for this year was lowered to 33,000 ha in 32 provinces. “So far we have replanted about 30,000 ha. The budget is not only from the state revenue budget, but also from corporate social responsibilities programmes, philanthropies, and loans or grants,” she said. “In 2021, we hope we can at least restore 53,000 from various sources of funds,” Mdm Utari told CNA. There are other impediments, she said. For instance, when mangrove areas have been converted to ponds, the authorities cannot simply replant them. They will need to engage the fishermen, who do not necessarily understand the function of mangroves, in the replanting process. Thus, the BRGM needs to educate fishermen on the importance of mangroves. It has introduced silvofishery, a form of low input aquaculture integrating mangrove trees with brackish water aquaculture, she highlighted. She added that when the mangroves that are to be rehabilitated are situated on the coast, this makes the trees vulnerable to waves and pollution. There are also times when seawater conditions do not support growth and end up encouraging the growth of pests. Given the various challenges, Mr Damanik from Greenpeace Indonesia said there must be clear indicators of success while protecting the remaining mangroves. “The rehabilitation figures are not a guarantee for trees to grow. To become a mature tree, according to forest ecology, there are four stages. “The process takes 15 to 20 years. From what we know, forest rehabilitation is only the first stage, the rest is left to natural processes. So one way to ensure this is to continue to protect the environment,"" said Mr Damanik."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/saudi-arabia-denies-playing-climate-saboteur-glasgow-2306051,Saudi Arabia denies playing climate saboteur at Glasgow,"GLASGOW, Scotland: The tightest of smiles on his face and the fabric of his traditional thobe swirling about him as he strides through a hallway at UN climate talks, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister expresses shock at repeated complaints that the world’s largest oil producer is working behind the scenes to sabotage negotiations. “What you have been hearing is a false allegation, and a cheat and a lie,” Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman al Saud said this week at the talks in Glasgow, Scotland. He was responding to journalists pressing for a response to claims that Saudi Arabia's negotiators have been working to block climate measures that would threaten demand for oil. “We have been working well” with the head of the UN climate talks and others, Prince Abdulaziz said. Negotiators from about 200 countries are coming up against a weekend deadline to find consensus on next steps to cut the world's fossil fuel emissions and otherwise combat climate change. Saudi Arabia’s participation in climate talks itself can seem incongruous — a kingdom that has become wealthy and powerful because of oil involved in negotiations where a core issue is reducing consumption of oil and other fossil fuels. While pledging to join emission-cutting efforts at home, Saudi leaders have made clear they intend to pump and sell their oil as long as demand lasts. Saudi Arabia’s team in Glasgow has introduced proposals ranging from a call to quit negotiations — they often stretch into early morning hours — at 6pm every day to what climate negotiation veterans allege are complex efforts to play country factions against one another with the aim of blocking agreement on tough steps to wrench the world away from coal, gas and oil. That is the “Saudis' proposal, by the way. They're like, let's just not work at nights and just accept that this is not going to be ambitious” when it comes to fast cuts in fossil fuel pollution that is wrecking the climate, said Jennifer Tollmann, an analyst at E3G, a European climate think tanks. And then “if other countries want to agree with Saudi, they can blame Saudi Arabia”, Tollmann said. Saudi Arabia long has been accused of playing a spoiler in the climate talks, and this year it is the main country singled out so far by negotiators, speaking privately, and observers, speaking publicly. Russia and Australia are also lumped in with Saudi Arabia at the talks as countries that see their futures as dependent on coal, natural gas or oil, and as working for a Glasgow climate deal that doesn't threaten that. Despite efforts to diversify the economy, oil accounts for more than half of Saudi Arabia's revenue, keeping the kingdom and royal family afloat and stable. About half of Saudi employees still work for the public sector, their salary paid in large part by oil. And there's China, whose dependence on coal makes it the world's current biggest climate polluter. It argues it can't switch to cleaner energy as fast as the West says it must, although the United States and China did jointly pledge to speed up their efforts to cut emissions. A core issue in the talks: Scientists and the United Nations say the world has less than a decade to cut its fossil fuel and agricultural emissions roughly in half if it wants to avoid more catastrophic scenarios of global warming. Not surprisingly, island nations that would disappear under the rising oceans at a higher level of warming are the bloc at Glasgow pushing hardest for the most stringent deal out of this summit. Meanwhile, climate advocates accuse the United States and European Union of so far failing to throw their weight behind the demands of the island nations, although the US and EU often wait until the last few days of climate talks to take hard stands on debated points. The United States — the world's worst climate polluter historically and a major oil and gas producer — gets plenty of criticism in its own right. The Climate Action Network dishonored the Biden administration with its “Fossil of the Day” award to President Joe Biden for coming to Glasgow last week with ambitious climate talk — but failing to join a pledge to wean his nation off coal, or to rein in US oil production. Jennifer Morgan, executive director of the Greenpeace environmental group, said other governments need “to isolate the Saudi delegation” if they want the climate conference to succeed. Saudi Arabia was fine with joining in governments' climate-pledge fever before the talks. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced in the runup to Glasgow that the kingdom would zero out its carbon emissions by 2060. But Saudi leaders for years have vowed to pump the last molecule of oil from their kingdom before world demand ends — an objective that a fast global switch from fossil fuels would frustrate. “Naked and cynical,” says Alden Meyer, a senior associate at the E3G climate research group, of Saudi Arabia's role in global climate discussions."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/cop26-climate-change-un-sustainability-greta-glasgow-2302851,Commentary: Are we finally taking a step in the right direction toward solving the climate crisis?,"SOMERVILLE, Massachusetts: Young people poured into the streets of Glasgow last Friday (Nov 5), angry and impatient as the first week of the United Nations climate summit ended. Their anger is matched by anxiety in the conference halls as the enormity of what has to be achieved in such a short period of time hovers over a complex process that can become sclerotic. Having been involved in climate negotiations as a former senior UN official, at the start of the second week, here’s what I’m seeing and hearing in Glasgow, both inside the negotiations and outside. To slow climate change, every part of our economies will transform. And that is reflected in conference sessions running in parallel to formal negotiations and in constituencies that turned out in real strength the first week – executives from central banks, CEOs of global banks and institutional investors, young people, indigenous peoples leaders, faith communities, advocacy groups and the world’s media. There has been a shift at this year’s summit, from making pledges to reach net zero emissions by 2050 to a focus on actions to cut emissions by 2030. Research shows the world needs to cut global emissions 45 per cent by 2030 to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial times, an aim of the Paris climate agreement. The Energy Transitions Commission, a coalition of businesses and nongovernmental organisations, calculated that if the commitments made at COP26 are delivered, it will cut the gap between today and the 1.5 degrees Celsius trajectory in half for carbon dioxide emissions and by almost 40 per cent for methane. In total, the world would be about 9 gigatonnes closer to the 22 gigatonnes of emissions reductions needed. That’s a start. The first week of COP26 was about building momentum – big deals and big claims outside the negotiations, with different coalitions of countries, companies and others, pushing action forward. Some of those pledges will likely collapse like a souffle in the weeks and months that follow, when a company’s board balks at some of the details or when they rerun the numbers under greater scrutiny. But there were notable coalitions announcing pledges on cutting methane, ending deforestation and diverting international public finance away from fossil fuels and into clean energy. The international financial community formed a broad alliance of firms committed to net zero, attracting accusations of greenwashing. The UN secretary-general announced an expert group to propose clear standards for companies and others making net zero commitments. At this point in the negotiations, the United Kingdom – which holds the COP26 presidency – will drive efforts to wrap up some remaining parts of the rulebook for implementing the Paris climate agreement. It will also be pushing for agreement on a cover statement, which will include a whole raft of issues. At this point, it is a long list of issues ranging from human rights, youth engagement and a just transition to more technical and procedural issues, such as how to recalibrate countries’ climate commitments and actions each year and how to ensure finance flows to adaptation, not just mitigation. A “High Ambition Coalition” is emerging, led by the Climate Vulnerability Forum, a group of around 20 countries facing high risks and sometimes existential threats from climate change. They have called for a Climate Emergency Pact that would include: A plan to deliver finance to help them adapt to climate change over the next few years, an agreement to increase those funds beyond that period, progress on finance involving loss and damage from climate change, an agreement on carbon markets and a process for raising countries’ commitments each year until the world is on track. Now, in the second week, government ministers from around the world are becoming personally involved in loosening log jams and taking over from their negotiators. The gulf between what’s happening inside the negotiations and what press releases from events outside the negotiating rooms are saying could widen. Inside, negotiators cannot agree on billions of dollars in climate finance expected to flow from wealthy countries to help poorer countries. Yet on the outside, press releases discussing trillions of dollars in private investment committed to net zero emissions imply the problem is fixed. And on the outside, while some analysts tally commitments to see if each gets the world closer to a trajectory that keeps warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius, inside discussions on transparency and reporting on climate progress are stalled. But the atmosphere is not all bleak. There is optimism that agreement on carbon markets may be found after painfully elongated talks at the summits two years ago in Madrid and three years ago in Katowice. Ultimately, the Glasgow conference can only be called a success when emissions start to slow and reverse and wealthy nations are able to put finance and real support behind poorer communities’ adaptation so they can become more resilient to the climate-driven crises still to come. While all of this is resolved, think about this: In every meeting I have been in – with green banks in developing countries and their micro-entrepreneurs, Silicon Valley CEOs, finance chiefs, management consultancies and mayors – there is an additional concern that goes beyond the need for better policy, new regulation and a braver political class. Their concern is about the talent pipeline, or its absence.  As every country, company, fund and bank shifts to a net zero pathway, the world will need engineers, data analysts, policy experts and planners to plot the course and lead. The transition is underway, Glasgow needs to deliver and the world needs to train and prepare for the sprint to 2030 in a race to zero emissions.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/singles-day-sales-1111-online-shopping-carbon-emissions-climate-change-environment-2303021,Commentary: 11.11 sales are a symptom of the greater disease of mindless consumerism,"SINGAPORE: There is a little-known tracker called Earth Overshoot Day, and it gives us a sense of resources humans use.  Data is calculated based on how fast people consume resources such as energy, timber and paper, and food and fibre. Consumption and waste products generated are then compared with how fast nature can absorb our waste and generate new resources.  Based on this, it gives a date where we’ve gone over the threshold – and used up the entire year’s worth of resources.  In a way it tells us when we’ve used up all the rice in the larder which were meant to last a year.  In 1970, Earth Overshoot Day was on December 30. This year, it happened on Jul 29. The date has been trending earlier ever since. It also tracks individual countries and Singapore’s resource consumption per capita ranks at 24 in the world, with our 2021 Overshoot Day falling on Apr 10.  It ranks second in ASEAN, just behind Brunei whose Earth Overshoot Day falls two days earlier. In comparison, Malaysia’s is more than a month after Singapore’s, on May 30, while Indonesia’s is Dec 18.  What this shows is there’s huge room for reducing Singapore’s resource consumption, and to me, online shopping platforms are a good place to start.  Unlike most other business activities needed for essential living (driving, eating, using energy), retail shopping can encourage mindless consumerism because there’s a possibility, we buy things we don’t need. Over the years, the 11.11 sales in Singapore have been doing better year on year. Even in 2020, when COVID-19 hit hard. Shopee for example saw 200 million items sold on 11.11 last year compared to 70 million items in 2019.  Alibaba’s gross merchandise volume on 11.11 from 2011 to 2020 has been exponential, from US$0.82 billion (S$1.1 billion) in 2011 to US$74.1 billion in 2020. Aside from these big events, flash sales happen every month – new jingles from various online shopping platforms appear regularly, enticing consumers to “shop now” and “add to cart”.  There are attractive lucky draws. Some involve million-dollar condominiums and social media influencers go all out to get their followers to play games so they can win prizes. Of course, the market works as it does – the aim of business is to make money and online shopping platforms will do whatever they can to drive up sales and increase market share.  It is good for the bottom line and it pays for hundreds of thousands of jobs. But this exponential growth on the back of a new age of mindless buying comes at a huge expense to the planet and unfortunately, we have started paying for it. Some platforms attempt to reduce their environmental impacts through “green packaging” options, but “green packaging” can differ according to each country’s context.  In Singapore, where all waste is sent for incineration, biodegradable packaging or other “eco-friendly” packaging in place of plastic packaging for online purchases is not necessarily more environmentally friendly.  A study commissioned by NEA showed that the lifecycle costs of plastic bags and other biodegradable bags have different impacts, and one is not better than the other in Singapore’s context.  Here, when waste is incinerated first before landfilling, the benefits of biodegradable items literally go up in smoke, and it’s the upstream impacts in the item’s lifecycle that determines how environmentally damaging it is.   The other issue is many online shopping platforms do not have a sustainability policy or a sustainable procurement policy, and do not track and report on their carbon emissions and environmental footprint.  When you buy a mass-produced piece of jewellery or a blouse which costs S$20 or less, it is a bargain because of the price. But consider all the other things that we don’t see. The plastic and paper packaging it comes in is one.  Then calculate the route a typical item like that takes to reach you. Likely produced in an Asian factory, it sits on a ship for weeks which requires fuel which in turn releases harmful pollutants and greenhouse gases. Then it goes into a distribution centre to be sorted, then into a delivery vehicle, to be sent to your home.  In other words, each item has an environmental impact, including water and chemicals used to create the raw material, carbon emissions from energy to create and transport it, and land use impacts from mining or growing the raw material, and from disposal of the item.  Granted, these apply to other goods and services we consume too – but here, it is the sheer volume of items produced, sold and shipped that adds emissions to an already stressed planet. Most online platforms also have a generous return policy and this can compound wastefulness – you can buy 10 things and return nine of them for low or no cost.  Typical e-commerce return rates are about 20 to 30 per cent, and in the US, an estimated 20 to 30 per cent of that is dumped. In Singapore, these numbers aren’t available, but it is difficult to imagine the items being returned to their overseas sources and being resold again.  There is a phrase that goes “You can’t manage what you don’t measure”, and it applies to online shopping platforms.  Without a clear sustainability policy, companies can’t measure their environmental impacts and consequently cannot reduce them although many are now seeing the need to change practices where they can.  But people are also a contributing factor to this. Many of the products are bought for novelty or in the spur of the moment but quickly discarded or set aside. Or things are poorly manufactured and of low-quality, which means they stop functioning as intended and eventually end up in the bin. In Singapore, once thrown out, these items are incinerated, and their ashes are sent to Semakau landfill. According to the Singapore Green Plan 2030, Singapore aims to reduce the per capita waste to landfill by 30 per cent by 2030. Increasing recycling rates will help but reducing the amount of waste generated in the first place is even more important in reaching this goal, especially as Semakau Landfill is expected to be full by 2035.  It may be an impossible idea, but perhaps limiting the amount of advertising from online shopping platforms may help. In addition to offering greater recycling options, making returns less convenient could be another way to discourage excessive purchases.  One company worth considering is Patagonia. Instead of encouraging consumers to buy more on Black Friday in 2013, it encouraged customers to repair its products instead, and has previously run advertisements saying: “Don’t buy this jacket”.   When it comes to a capitalist economy, it is wishful thinking to hope businesses will change their practices if it means less revenue. So, regulation could be key to reducing the impacts from online shopping platforms.  Higher carbon taxes in places where the items are manufactured could lead to increased costs even though it is possible that factories would be relocated to more affordable places unless a global agreement on carbon taxes is made.  But if businesses are taxed based on their emissions and footprint – and costs cascade down to consumers, then people may think twice before buying.  The concept of Extended Producer Responsibility could also be another way to curb excessive sales. If companies were responsible for collecting and ensuring proper recycling of products, the items listed and promoted on the platforms would quickly shift to those that are easier to recycle.  Unfortunately, the current Extended Producer Responsibility framework in Singapore is only limited to e-waste now and packaging waste by 2025, though that may change in the future. For now, we can do our part to scale back resource consumption and push our Earth Overshoot Day to Dec 31 or beyond, and to extend Semakau’s lifespan to beyond 2035.  But societal mindsets about our consumerist culture must shift and online shopping platforms can play a role by not encouraging this mindless consumption too.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/indonesia-coal-energy-renewables-laws-expensive-solar-wind-2300921,Commentary: Renewables are an expensive substitute for Indonesia’s coal dependence,"SINGAPORE: Fossil fuels came under renewed scrutiny at the 26th Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC (COP26) in Glasgow last week.  Indonesia has come under increasing pressure to tackle its significant reliance on coal. Economic development and poverty reduction remain the Indonesian government’s primary goals. A stable democracy of 270 million people with consistent economic growth, the country still has a significant portion of its population living in poverty. Maintaining growth will likely require ongoing reliance on coal for power. According to the International Energy Agency, 63 per cent of Indonesia’s electricity generated in 2020 came from coal-fired power. A mere 0.2 per cent came from solar, wind and waste. Indonesia, the world’s largest thermal coal exporter, is also expanding coal mining and exports. In fact, coal production surged 320 per cent from 2005 to 2019. Given high global coal prices and the influence of the Indonesian Coal Mining Association, it seems unlikely Indonesian mining and coal exports will diminish soon. Following the recent recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, most nations have been setting higher nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to the reduction of carbon dioxide or equivalent greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Yet, while Indonesia is playing its part by updating its NDCs under the Paris Agreement to increase its emission reduction targets, and by initiating steps to reduce its reliance on coal in recent months, important questions remain about how realistic these plans are. The government has ramped up its plans to reduce Indonesia’s reliance on coal in the lead-up to COP26. In May, state-owned power utility Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) announced plans to halt all new coal-fired power plants after 2023 and to decommission all coal-fired power plants by 2056. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) announced it will not approve new coal projects unless already under construction or financed. In July, the government submitted an updated NDC, setting out renewed commitments to reduce GHG emissions and details of how it will do so. Various government representatives referred to Indonesia achieving “net-zero” by 2060. In October, authorities released a new National Electricity Business Supply Plan for 2021 to 2030 (known as a RUPTL) that aims to achieve these commitments. That same month, the government passed a new carbon tax to be applied to excessive GHG emissions from coal-fired power plants from April 2022, although at a relatively low rate of IDR30,000 (US$2.10) per tonne of CO2. Indonesia plans to finalise a presidential decree on the economic value of carbon and develop a carbon trading mechanism by 2025. Under Indonesia’s NDC submitted to the United Nations in July, Indonesia’s main commitment is to achieve a 29 per cent to 41 per cent reduction in GHG emissions by 2030, compared to likely GHG emissions under a “business as usual” scenario with no countermeasures, with the upper bound conditional on receiving international support. A significant portion of the proposed emission reductions (58 per cent) will come from changes in land and forest use, with a pledge that forestry and land use will reach peak emissions by 2030. The next biggest contributor is the “energy sector” (38 per cent). But the reality is that cheap power remains very important to Indonesia’s ongoing growth and coal remains a relatively cheap fuel, difficult to abandon. The latest RUPTL, which sets out MEMR and PLN’s blueprint for new electricity-generating capacity in Indonesia, has inconsistencies with the updated NDC and earlier coal phase-out commitments. PLN plans to add 40.6 GW of new generating capacity by 2030.  The majority of the new capacity (51.6 per cent) is intended to come from renewable energy - a welcome increase from 29.6 per cent renewables in the previous RUPTL. However, while the RUPTL appears to support plans to cease coal-fired power development, stating “there is no plan for the development of new coal-fired power plants in this RUPTL except for those that have achieved financial close or commenced construction”, the new plan nevertheless provides for 13.8GW of new coal-fired power (34 per cent of the total) with the last new plant coming online in 2027. PLN intends to procure a substantial majority of new coal-fired power as privately funded independent power producer projects but it’s hard to see how that will materialise given that sources of international funding for coal-fired power projects have all but evaporated. Many international financiers have said they will no longer support coal. President Xi Jinping announced in September that China would not build any new coal-fired power projects abroad. Coal projects without a signed power purchase agreement and committed financing might never be built by the private sector Indonesia faces five big challenges to moving away from coal. First, Indonesia’s proposed reductions in energy sector emissions appear to rely largely on the application of clean coal technologies, including co-firing of coal plants with biomass and the use of carbon capture and storage and integrated gasification combined cycle technologies. But many commentators, including the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, have expressed doubt over whether such novel technologies will be viable soon. Second, Indonesia’s plan to decommission all coal-fired power means that electricity supply will need to come from other sources, especially renewable energy to replace coal, as laid out in the RUTPL.  However, despite substantial declines in renewable energy costs over the last decade, shifting towards renewables remains a challenge for PLN because “the price of environmentally friendly power generation technology is still high”.  The high cost of grid and power plant upgrades and battery storage solutions to allow variable renewable energy exacerbate this issue. In the RUPTL, PLN flags the need for additional government support and private sector funding for transmission upgrades and expansion. Third, the lack of a clear and conducive regulatory environment, along with missing clarity on renewable energy tariffs and governmental support, are also restricting the development of renewable energy. The MEMR has just released new regulations on rooftop solar as it recognises that only a meagre 31.8 MW out of 32.5 GW of potential rooftop solar power has been installed, far behind neighbouring countries. Fourth, the present renewable energy pricing regime provides for tariffs at or below the average cost of power in relevant regions, restricting the viability of many renewable energy projects in Indonesia, particularly in major electricity demand locations where average costs are lower.   The market is waiting for the MEMR to enact a more favourable regime. A pricing regime that attracts foreign investors will be necessary to realise the latest renewable energy plans, whether through fiscal incentives, capital costs subsidies or higher tariffs. Last, Indonesia also has relatively limited viable energy resources. Enveloping the equatorial zone, only a few locations have good offshore wind potential. A World Bank report on solar potential shows some decent irradiation data, particularly in the heavily populated Java-Bali and West and East Nusa Tenggara regions. However, the higher population density means land scarcity, which makes large scale solar development costlier. Given fiscal constraints and renewable resource restrictions, there are limits to how much Indonesia can achieve on decarbonisation. In that context, its declared commitments should be applauded and encouraged. The success of Indonesia’s higher NDC objectives and decarbonisation plans depends heavily on two key factors. First, it will require the imminent implementation of a regulatory and fiscal environment that is substantially more conducive to the development of renewable energy and stable transmission systems.  Second, it will need substantial financial and technological assistance from the international community. Indonesia acknowledged the need for outside help. Last week at COP26, President Jokowi asked  developed economies to contribute more funds and share technology in order for Indonesia to be able to ramp up its climate change efforts. To tackle the climate change challenge facing us all, the international financial and technological communities must respond to Indonesia’s call for assistance to meet its goals.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sustainability/kubeko-box-ivory-coast-biowaste-biogas-fertiliser-sustainability-2303821,Small box turns waste into treasure for Ivory Coast farmers,"NANDIBO, Ivory Coast: Award-winning waste converters are helping farmers in Ivory Coast turn mountains of agricultural by-products into compost for their fields or gas for their cooking stoves. The small green KubeKo box was dreamt up by chemical engineer Noel N'guessan to make use of the 30 million tonnes of waste generated by crop production in the West African country each year and other biowaste like animal dung. Farmers like palm oil producer Michel Ahouri simply throw in organic matter and wait four weeks. One box can create 150kg of compost per month. ""It's natural, it's organic, it's appropriate for our soil, for our fields - we will triple our production,"" Ahouri said after scattering the compost at the roots of his rustling palms. In July, the invention netted N'guessan an innovation award worth more than US$33,700 from the United Kingdom's Royal Academy of Engineering. By then, the team had already sold 50 composters to Ivorian cocoa, palm oil and mango farms. The boxes cost US$700 to produce, according to the academy. The team also produces biodigesters - similar metal box-like contraptions that can fuel two hours of cooking on the gas generated from 5kg of waste per day, while producing litres of liquid compost. This kind of gas production could be a sustainable alternative source of cleaner energy in rural areas in West Africa, according to a 2018 report by the European Commission. Every cubic metre of biogas, a mixture primarily of methane and carbon dioxide, is estimated to replace the equivalent of 5kg of wood or 3kg of coal, it said. ""Instead of throwing our waste on the streets, we collect it,"" said farmer Ahouri. ""We are protecting the environment because instead of leaving it there, we use it."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/australia-set-us740-million-fund-develop-low-emissions-technology-2302376,Australia to set up US$740 million fund to develop low-emissions technology,"SYDNEY: Australia will establish a A$1 billion (US$740 million) fund to invest in companies that develop low-emissions technology, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Wednesday (Nov 10), as Canberra seeks to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. Under the plan, the federal government will commit A$500 million to the fund, matched by private investors, which will be used to support nascent companies in developing technologies including carbon capture and storage. ""Our plan to reach net zero by 2050 is an Australian one that's focused on technology not taxes and this fund backs Australian companies to find new solutions,"" Morrison said in a statement. The proposal comes just months out from a national election, where climate policies are expected to be a battleground issue, with broad support in the electorate for reducing emissions despite concern about the cost to the economy. The federal government will need to pass new legislation in order to allow the Clean Energy Finance, the government-owned green bank, to fund carbon capture and storage, which is not allowed under its existing rules. The opposition Labor party, which opposes diversion of renewable energy funding to carbon capture and storage (CCS), said it would consider the proposal. However, industry body, the Smart Energy Council, said the government was trying to ""kill (Clean Energy Finance)"" by forcing it to fund ""unproven, uneconomic carbon capture and storage projects"". CCS traps emissions and buries them underground. Advocates of the technology see it a key to unlock large-scale economic hydrogen production, while critics say it will extend the life of dirty fossil fuels. ""The coalition has realised to retain office they need a better suite of policies around the climate,"" said Haydon Manning, a political science professor at Flinders University in South Australia. Morrison last month pledged Australia to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, but said Canberra would not legislate to force emitters to reduce their carbon output, easing fears in regions about a loss of jobs. Australia is heavily reliant on exports of coal and gas, and efforts by previous governments to legislate to reduce carbon emissions have foundered, with two prime ministers ousted by their own parties."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sustainability/glasgow-braces-climate-protests-global-day-action-2295341,Glasgow braces for climate protests on global day of action,"GLASGOW: Glasgow was on Saturday (Nov 6) bracing for a second day of protests against what campaigners say is a lack of urgency to address global warming after Greta Thunberg labelled the crunch UN climate summit there a ""failure"". Organisers and police said they expected up to 50,000 people in the streets of the Scottish city as part of about 200 protests worldwide demanding immediate action for communities already hit by the fallout of our heating planet. Delegates from nearly 200 countries are in Glasgow to hammer out how to meet the Paris Agreement goals of limiting temperature rises to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius. At the halfway stage of the COP26 negotiations, some countries have signed up to pledges to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, with separate deals on phasing out coal, ending foreign fossil fuel funding and slashing methane. The promises followed a major assessment that showed global CO2 emissions are set to rebound in 2021 to pre-pandemic levels. Activists were unimpressed during Friday's march. ""They cannot ignore the scientific consensus and they cannot ignore us,"" said Thunberg. ""This is no longer a climate conference. This is now a global greenwashing festival."" Security has been boosted around Glasgow's locked down city centre ahead of Saturday's march, which is expected to draw a variety of groups including Extinction Rebellion. ""Many thousands of us are marching right across the world today to demand immediate and serious action,"" said Scottish activist Mikaela Loach. ""We're clear that warm words are not good enough - and that the next week of talks must see a serious ramping up of concrete plans."" COP26 negotiations will continue on Saturday before taking a pause on Sunday ahead of what is shaping up to be a frantic week of shuttle diplomacy, as ministers arrive to push through hard-fought compromises on a number of issues. Countries still need to flesh out how pledges made in the Paris deal work in practice, including rules governing carbon markets, common reporting timeframes and transparency. Countries came into COP26 with national climate plans that, when brought together, put Earth on course to warm 2.7 degrees Celsius this century, according to the UN. With just 1.1 degrees Celsius of warming so far, communities across the world are already facing ever more intense fire and drought, displacement and economic ruin wrought by global heating. Brianna Fruean, a Samoan member of the Pacific Climate Warriors, who addressed a world leaders' summit at the start of COP26, said it was time for leaders to take note of protesters' demands. ""It can't go on like this,"" she said. ""We refuse to be just victims to this crisis. We are not drowning, we are fighting and on Saturday the world will hear us."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/water-usage-data-centres-climate-change-sustainability-cost-2293301,Commentary: Data centres are massive water guzzlers,"OXFORD, London: The 1960s ushered in a new age of processing digital information, driven by the intelligence needs of the Cold War. Moore’s law meant microchips doubled in speed every two years, shrinking costs and miniaturising machines that once filled entire rooms.  Today, the smartphone probably being used to read this article is millions of times more powerful than the computer that landed the Apollo missions on the moon. While those huge supercomputers have disappeared, the proliferation of the cloud and the Internet of things, with everything down to our socks being able to connect to the internet, means more and more computer processors that need to communicate with data centres around the world.  Even something as simple as scrolling down on this article triggers communications that may eventually pass through a distant data centre. Data centres can range in size from small cabinets through to vast “hyperscale” warehouses the size of stadiums. Inside, are computers called servers which support the software, apps and websites we use every day. As of the end of 2020, 597 hyperscale data centres were in operation (39 per cent in the US, 10 per cent in China, 6 per cent Japan), up by almost 50 per cent since 2015. Amazon, Google and Microsoft account for more than half of these and a further 219 are in various stages of planning. Data centres accounted for around 1 per cent or 2 per cent of global electricity demand in 2020. All that processing power generates lots of heat, so data centres must keep cool to prevent damage.  While some companies are using cool air on mountain sites and Microsoft has used the cold waters of Scotland to experiment with underwater data centres, up to 43 per cent of data centre electricity in the US is used for cooling. This energy goes into cooling water which is either sprayed into air flowing past the servers or evaporated to transfer heat away from the servers. Not only is energy required to cool the water (unless the system is specifically designed as a closed loop) but that water is lost as it evapourates.  In a relatively small 1-megawatt data centre (that uses enough electricity to power 1,000 houses), these traditional types of cooling would use 26 million litres of water per year. Water directly used for cooling is what most data centre operators focus on, but the largest source of water usage is actually electricity generation. This comes from how water is heated to generate steam which turns a turbine and generates electricity.  Fossil fuels and nuclear power all consume water in this way, and even hydroelectric power involves some water loss from reservoirs. The transition to renewables is therefore important to reduce both water and carbon footprints. By 2030, wind and solar energy could reduce water withdrawals related to power generation by 50 per cent in the UK, 25 per cent in the US, Germany and Australia, and 10 per cent in India. Data centre water demand is more complicated than the carbon footprint. Reaching zero carbon is a reasonable goal, but zero-water is not necessarily the right choice. Consumption goals need more context. Some data centres are in regions with abundant water, easily accessible without competing with other potential users. However, others may be built in areas of drought with degrading infrastructure. Regional water stress must be considered for each data centre, not just in relation to the water used for on-site cooling, but also linked to the power plants that generate the electricity that power the centre. For example, a recent US study showed that the western US has more water stress compared to the eastern US, and that electricity generated in the south west is more water intensive due to the use of more hydropower. Despite this, the west and south west have more data centres. Opposition is starting to grow even as new projects are being approved. The US has seen local communities protest against new data centres, which may be why in the past Google has considered its usage of water to be a trade secret.  Similar concerns led to a temporary ban on new data centres in The Netherlands, and France is in the process of passing new laws to require more transparency. Companies are not pricing water risk into their calculations when picking locations for data centres. A lower price does not necessarily mean lower risk. When Microsoft assessed its water footprint at a data centre in San Antonio, Texas, it found the true cost of water was 11 times more than it was paying. This is similar to carbon footprints. We undervalue or ignore abatement costs associated with greenhouse emissions, and the impacts are hardly marginal. Carbon dioxide and water are inextricably linked, and climate change is already stressing drought-prone areas around the world. The first step is transparency.  Some companies like Microsoft and Facebook already publish aggregated water data, but others need to do the same. Every operator needs to publish their water efficiency plan and back it up with the relevant regional numbers. Most data centre owners have received the message about reducing their carbon footprint and the transition to renewable energy. We regularly see new projects announced with net-zero carbon goals. They now need to do something similar for water.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/advertorial/better-future-humanity-needs-forward-thinking-solutions-2267016,A better future for humanity needs forward-thinking solutions,"Climate change is a growing problem across the world, and in Southeast Asia where many countries are surrounded by vast water bodies, people’s livelihoods are being affected due to rising sea levels and natural disasters.  As it sits close to the equatorial line, Southeast Asia is projected to warm slightly less than the global average, but its sea levels are rising faster than elsewhere, and shorelines are retreating in coastal areas where 450 million people live. Rising waters are projected to cost Asia’s major cities billions in damage this decade, according to a recent study. Against this grim backdrop, the urgency to build a sustainable, decarbonised society has never been greater. In response, Southeast Asian countries have set themselves the long-term goal of increasing the share of renewable energy in their energy portfolio.  Singapore, for instance, is racing to meet its decarbonisation target of halving its 2030 peak greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The country also aims to achieve net zero emissions as soon as viable in the second half of the century. In order to fulfil this, Singapore’s Energy Market Authority recently announced two partnerships, totalling S$10 million, to accelerate the deployment of clean energy in Singapore and boost local capabilities, as well as an intent to import 30 per cent of its electricity supply from low-carbon suppliers by 2035.  A SHIFT TO RENEWABLE ENERGY Like Singapore, other governments in the region understand the importance of adopting renewable energy sources that are adapted to the country’s landscape and climate. Singapore’s limited land area makes solar power an attractive choice but in a country such as Indonesia, renewable sources such as geothermal power and hydropower are feasible options due to the country’s volcanic activity and mountainous terrain.  However, the widespread adoption of clean energy is hampered by problems such as unstable supply and the cost of power transmission and transformation. Indonesia, for one, faces hurdles in establishing a stable power grid and transmission as it is made up of thousands of islands. A stable supply of energy that promotes decarbonisation is essential to support people’s lives and society. Until better options are found to address the energy supply and demand fluctuations associated with renewable energy, countries in the region will struggle to adopt renewables at scale. To help meet the diverse energy-transition challenges faced by Southeast Asian nations, Toshiba offers a wide range of solutions that leverage carbon capture and utilisation technologies. Backed by years of research and technology, these solutions cover energy production, delivery, storage and management, and are designed to support the region’s journey towards a net-zero future. ENERGY STORAGE SOLUTIONS One exciting renewable energy solution that has emerged in recent years is hydrogen, which will enable clean ""power storage"" by converting surplus renewable energy. Significantly, this form of storage can help to achieve a stable clean energy supply throughout the year. Excess power generated by wind or solar sources can be converted into hydrogen, with the gas acting as a medium for temporary energy storage that users can fall back on when renewable energy supply is low, or demand is higher than usual. Hydrogen can be produced and used in this manner without toxic pollution or carbon dioxide emissions.  The conversion of surplus renewable energy into hydrogen, which is conducted through a process known as Power-to-Gas (P2G), has multiple applications. For instance, hydrogen that is produced through P2G can be used as fuel for transportation, as feedstock for industry, or as fuel to generate power through gas turbines or fuel cell. As part of its goal to build a next-generation ""hydrogen society"" in which renewable energy is used to produce carbon dioxide-free hydrogen, Toshiba is developing products and technologies for producing, storing and using the gas.  One such solution is Toshiba’s pure hydrogen fuel cell system that uses a renewable energy source to electrolyze hydrogen from water, and stores and uses the hydrogen in fuel cells to provide a stable delivery of carbon dioxide-free electricity and hot water. Besides Singapore, the governments of Indonesia and the Philippines are working with Toshiba to provide green hydrogen as an off-grid energy source to power their remote islands. NEXT-GENERATION BATTERIES Another effective way to store energy without generating emissions is using power batteries. Toshiba has been contributing to the advancement of this technology with its range of rechargeable Super Charge ion Batteries (SCiB). SCiBs can safely store large amounts of electricity for long periods of time, and can also be recharged quickly, making it suitable for numerous applications. Among other uses, it can be used in transportation such as automobiles, buses and railroad cars, as well as elevators and power plants. In particular, SCiBs are ideally suited for storing electricity regenerated by hybrid vehicles and stabilising the energy supply of power grids and facilities. These batteries help to increase fuel and electricity efficiency, reduce carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission, and cut costs such as the expenses related to battery replacement. SCiBs can help countries that are looking to transition to more efficient and eco-friendly transportation. Singapore’s Green Plan 2030, for instance, aims to increase the use of greener transport options such as MRTs and buses, and can make use of SCiBs for this purpose.  HARNESSING VIRTUAL TECHNOLOGY Another solution that aims to offer a stable supply of clean energy are Virtual Power Plants (VPPs). By enabling scattered renewable energy sources to be remotely controlled by the Internet of Things technology, VPPS can operate as if they were one power plant. VPPs make it possible to supply the optimal amount of power to a particular location, and offer advantages such as flexibility, scalability and enhanced power grid resilience. New energy sources can also be easily connected to a VPP, and a failure at any one source can be quickly dealt with, limiting loss of power to users.  When energy sources such as power plants, batteries, storage systems, as well as homes and workplaces are included in the network, VPPs can become a platform for supplying power as well as selling excess power. This helps operators to better manage peaks in electricity demand and allows participating homes and businesses to get paid for selling their excess power. Furthermore, VPPs can employ data analytics to predict electricity demand to help ensure a stable supply of power. For instance, if a forecast indicates cloud coverage over a solar farm, the operator can increase power output from other sources to make up for the shortfall. By adjusting the balance between supply and demand with VPPs, renewable energy power can be used stably. VPPs are expected to promote the introduction and expansion of renewable energy and contribute to a decarbonised society. “Harnessing the benefits of smart integrated clean energy systems shows us a path forward to a future where economies can grow while being sustainable in the long term,” shared Mr Hiroshi Fukuchi.  “With a strong foundation forged by more than 140 years of experience, together with our partners, we are confident we are making progress and delivering holistic and sustainable solutions to address our most pressing challenges today,” he added.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/cop26-coalition-worth-us130-trillion-vows-put-climate-heart-finance-2289021,COP26 coalition worth US$130 trillion vows to put climate at heart of finance,"GLASGOW: Banks, insurers and investors with US$130 trillion at their disposal pledged on Wednesday (Nov 3) to put combating climate change at the centre of their work, and gained support in the form of efforts to put green investing on a firmer footing. And in another development at the COP26 UN climate conference, at least 19 countries are expected to commit on Thursday to ending public financing for fossil fuel projects abroad by the end of 2022, two sources said. In an earlier announcement at the meeting in Scotland, financial institutions accounting for around 40% of the world's capital committed to assuming a ""fair share"" of the effort to wean the world off fossil fuels. A main aim of the COP26 talks is to secure enough national promises to cut greenhouse gas emissions - mostly from coal, oil and gas - to keep the rise in the average global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius. But how to meet those pledges, particularly in the developing world, is still being worked out, and it will require a lot of money. UN climate envoy Mark Carney, who assembled the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), put the figure at US$100 trillion over the next three decades, and said the finance industry must find ways to raise private money to take the effort far beyond what states alone can do. ""The money is here - but that money needs net zero-aligned projects and (then) there's a way to turn this into a very, very powerful virtuous circle - and that's the challenge,"" the former Bank of England governor told the summit. Carney's comments reflect a problem often cited by investors who, in the face of a myriad of climate-related risks, need to be sure that they are being accounted for in a transparent and preferably standardised way globally. ""Some of the key interlocking pieces of the finance puzzle are now coming together,"" said Nick Robins of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. Another piece of the jigsaw is where the public money to assist the transition from carbon intensive energy and industry will come from, and on Wednesday the United States said it would support a mechanism to raise new finance for clean energy and sustainable infrastructure in emerging markets. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the United States would join Britain in backing the Climate Investment Funds' (CIF) new Capital Market Mechanism, which would help attract significant new private climate funds and provide US$500 million per year for the CIF's Clean Technology Fund, as well as its new Accelerating Coal Transition investment program. ""The reason I am here is because climate change is not just an environmental issue. It is not just an energy issue. It is an economic, development and market-destabilising issue, and I would not be doing my job if I did not treat it with the seriousness warranted,"" Yellen said. However, others were not convinced by progress at COP26. ""These happy headlines conceal a wealth of loopholes and opportunities for backsliding that we cannot afford if we are to avoid climate breakdown,"" the Environmental Justice Foundation said in a statement. ""Net zero pledges mean nothing without fossil fuel divestment. Time for financial institutions to put their money where their mouth is and stop funding climate-destroying fossil fuels,"" the NGO's CEO Steve Trent added. Carney has led an effort to ensure that financial institutions account for and disclose the full climate risks of their lending or investments, forcing the wider economy to price in costs that until now been largely concealed. These include not only the direct effects of extreme weather events, but also any loss of government subsidies for fossil fuels, or the health and environmental costs of greenhouse gas emissions. Kristalina Georgieva, head of the International Monetary Fund, said it was crucial to incorporate climate data into everyday macroeconomic reporting. The vice chair of the global Financial Stability Board, Dutch central banker Klaas Knot, said a mandatory global minimum standard for disclosure of climate risks was now needed for financial stability and the provision of sustainable finance. The change in private sector financial institutions was praised by British COP26 President Alok Sharma who said: ""What we have seen over the last few years is a big move in the private sector and financial services sector to go green ... in the 1990s, clearly (then) climate finance, investing in green, was not mainstream. I do believe it is now mainstream."" China's central bank governor, Yi Gang, said Beijing was working on a new monetary policy facility to provide cheap funds for financial institutions to support green projects. Jane Fraser, CEO of Citigroup, a GFANZ member, said the initiative needed scale in order to work. ""If you don't work together, you're going to come up with a lot of nice really speeches, but you're ... in danger of being divorced from reality,"" she said. Investors will welcome the launch of a global standards body to prevent companies giving a flattering picture of their climate policies and business practices in what is already a multitrillion-dollar global market for environment, social and governance targeted funds. ""If you don't have basic information on a globally comparable basis ... you increase the risks of greenwashing enormously,"" said Ashley Alder, chair of IOSCO, the global umbrella body for securities regulators. Private sector enthusiasm for mobilising climate-friendly investment also requires the assurance that governments are setting emission reduction goals that are ambitious enough to meet the 1.5 Celsius goal - by no means certain to happen by the end of COP26 on Nov 12."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/style-beauty/how-reduce-beauty-cosmetic-product-waste-2230591,Reusable wipes and skincare samples: 9 ways to reduce cosmetics waste,"I’ve often felt troubled by the amount of packaging in beauty products. Take, for example, skincare serum. It can be encased in an ornate bottle, which sits inside an elaborate box (and sometimes a box within a box), which is then wrapped in plastic.  The tiny amount of product versus the swathes of packaging it comes in is sometimes mind-boggling. Some may argue that beauty products are designed to pamper and make us feel a certain way, and hence packaging is important, but this comes at a cost to the environment.  I try to assuage my feelings of guilt by making sure I recycle all paper, plastic and glass packaging, but I’ve just learned, to my consternation, that very little beauty packaging is actually recycled. According to clean and sustainable New Zealand skincare brand Emma Lewisham, the beauty industry is responsible for 120 billion units of waste each year, with single use packaging being the industry's largest contributor to carbon emissions. Emma Lewisham, the brand’s founder, told CNA Lifestyle, “The biggest myth is that beauty packaging is recycled. Sadly, this is not the case. In fact, only 4 per cent of all global plastics are recycled annually. Despite most beauty packaging being ‘technically recyclable’, it requires specialised systems – it is not recycled through local kerbside recycling. Unless someone is prepared to cover the cost of having it recycled, it ends up either in landfills, scattered through our oceans or burnt into greenhouse gases."" She added: ""I encourage consumers to be wary of brands who rely on the recyclability of their packaging and look into whether they have take-back programmes and partnerships with specialised recyclers in place – this is how you know they are actually walking the recycling talk.” Airin Lee, a makeup artist and co-founder of ARLY, a beauty and wellness consultancy which educates consumers on skincare and make-up, and who has a passion for helping customers make more sustainable choices, told CNA Lifestyle: “I’d say most of us don’t know exactly what ‘sustainable beauty’ means, or how beauty impacts the environment. It is both a knowledge and awareness gap."" She added: ""For starters, I suggest looking towards sustainably-sourced ingredients and more environmentally-friendly packaging, such as product labels printed with soy ink, reduced packaging, and recycled packaging materials. The key is the use of recycled materials, because while virgin materials can be recyclable, this doesn’t mean they always get recycled.” It seems many of us have much to learn about how the beauty industry affects the environment. But the willingness to know more is a great start. Here are some tips on how we can stop turning a blind eye to cosmetic waste and begin living more sustainably. 1. LOOK FOR BEAUTY BRANDS OR PRODUCTS THAT ALLOW REFILLS  Imagine finding a beauty product or brand that works for you, and then just buy refills of products while using the same jar or bottle. This is the reality at Emma Lewisham, whose products are refillable and 100 per cent designed to fit within a circular system, which means designing out waste, keeping materials in use through reuse, repair and recycling, and regenerating the environment. It is the world’s first carbon positive beauty brand, with 100 per cent circular-designed product range. “The industry seems to have become so focused on recycling,” said Lewisham. “However, a solution that has a significantly lighter environmental impact is to reuse – and in our case, refill. The largest impact we can have on reducing carbon emissions is to focus on refillable packaging as part of a circular model of beauty.” Their popular and award-winning Skin Reset serum (S$141 for 30ml) evens out skin tone and refines texture. The Skin Reset refill pod is S$138 for 30ml and helps reduce your carbon footprint by 71 per cent, compared to if you were to buy a full packaging set. Customers are also encouraged to send empty pods back to the company by using their free returns label, where it will be sterilised and refilled through their circularity initiative. 2. OPT FOR PACKING-FREE OR MINIMAL PACKAGING  We think we understand by now – excess packaging is bad and unnecessary. And a company that really walks the talk with that is Lush Cosmetics, with their Naked product range. We’re talking body soap, shampoo and even skincare with no bottles, jars or packaging – just bars of products that you rub directly on yourself. Of course, they’re put in recycled paper bags when you buy them from the store, but you can always bring your own bag for 100 per cent zero packaging.  3. PARTICIPATE IN TAKE-BACK PROGRAMMES FOR RECYCLING OR REFILLING EMPTIES This means bringing your empties back directly to the brand for recycling or for reuse, instead of putting them into your local recycling bin and hoping that they will get recycled. Examples of brands who take back empties include Kiehl’s, The Body Shop, Innisfree, L’Occitane, MAC Cosmetics and Lush Cosmetics.4. KNOW YOUR SKINCARE AND BEAUTY NEEDS Said Lee, “Many of us don’t know our skin well enough to know which products are actually suitable for us. So the subsequent ‘skincare exploration journey’ often results in mental stress, money and time wasted, and almost full bottles of products going into the bin.”  She added, “I’ve noticed that most of my clients buy and switch around at least three or four products before finding the ‘right one’. But even after finding the right skincare product, they often have no idea what their skin type really is. It feels like we are blindfolded when choosing our skincare and are making decisions based on packaging or the latest trends.” Lee urged people to learn about their skin, skincare and to find out what really works for them. Supporting brands that are making conscious efforts to reduce waste or have adopted cleaner beauty solutions is also encouraged. 5. DON’T BE FOOLED BY FANCY PACKAGING AND GREENWASHING  “With an abundance of products to choose from, we sometimes prioritise fancy packaging more than the product,” said Lee. “There are many products that are deliberately packaged to give the illusion of more volume. But there are also some brands who have started reducing cosmetic waste by downsizing the thickness of their bottles and/or using more recycled material.”  Misrepresentation and greenwashing – where products are marketed with green or botanical backgrounds, ‘nature-inspired’ scents, and advertisements that imply eco-consciousness, is commonplace. “Words like ‘all-natural’ may jump at you off a product’s packaging, and consumers may be sold without actually checking the ingredient lists. If you research some of these 'all-natural' products, you will realise they contain all kinds of allergens, irritants, hormone disruptors and carcinogens that are both harmful for your skin and the environment,"" said Lee. 6. USE FEWER DISPOSABLES – SWITCH TO REUSABLE WIPES Lee Peilin, a marketing manager and sustainability advocate who was part of a citizen project with the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, had tips on how to be more sustainable when it comes to beauty.  “A major game changer was when I switched from disposable cotton pads or wipes to reusable cloth wipes. I use those for toner and make-up removal. Also, cotton buds are an extremely painful use of plastic. You use them once and toss them. I’ve switched to bamboo cotton buds. Often, it’s about the choices you make, and you can choose more sustainable products,"" she said. 7. FINISH YOUR PRODUCTS “For products, I make sure I use everything up,” said Peilin. “I would cut up the tubes for masks and moisturisers and use up every last bit. There are often little nooks and crannies in jars and bottles, so make sure you dig into those. Otherwise, it’s a huge waste of resources, and also, these chemicals will go down the drain. I also try to pick products with minimal packaging. Items that come in boxes, I try not to buy those any more. I’ve given feedback to brands not to put products in boxes.” 8. USE UP TRAVEL MINIATURES AND SAMPLES “I’ve been using all my miniatures and travel-sized products before going out to buy new products, as many of them are reaching their expiry dates,” said Peilin. “Especially since it doesn't look like we’ll be travelling that soon.” 9. TAKE SMALL STEPS IN YOUR DAILY ROUTINE TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY  “Each and every one of us has the potential to bring about change,” said Lewisham. “Think about the consequences of all the small choices you make every day. Where did it come from? Did it harm the environment? Was it cruel to animals? Is it cheap because someone in the supply chain paid the true cost? Being a sustainable and conscious consumer is simply the accumulation of all these little choices. Choose to make ethical choices daily and teach people around you to do so too. We all have the ability to bring about change in the world. Don’t give up – we need you!” Lee agreed: “We can take small steps in our daily routine – you can be more conscious starting from the basics in your routine. Sunscreen is essential – it's the cheapest anti-ageing product, but it can also be very environmentally-unfriendly. Since we need to use SPF all the time, consider switching to more eco-friendly, marine life-friendly and reef-friendly sunscreens."" She added: ""You don't have to only buy sustainable beauty products – research before you buy to make an informed choice, so you know you're getting a product you will finish using. And if a product doesn't work for you, consider giving it away instead of throwing it out.”"

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/dbs-united-nations-net-zero-carbon-emissions-2276971,DBS joins United Nations' Net-Zero Banking Alliance,"SINGAPORE: Singapore’s DBS Bank has joined the United Nations’ Net-Zero Banking Alliance, as part of its ongoing efforts to tackle climate change, it said on Friday (Oct 29). As a signatory of the alliance, DBS will commit to transitioning greenhouse gas emissions from its portfolios to align with the goals to net zero by 2050 or sooner. It also commits to annually publishing absolute emissions and emissions intensity in line with best practice as well as within a year of setting targets. DBS added that it will take a ""robust approach"" to the role of carbon credits in transition plans.  The banking alliance is part of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) and is hosted by the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative. Launched in April this year, the alliance currently includes 87 banks across 36 countries, representing more than 40 per cent of global banking assets amounting to around US$65 trillion. “Fantastic that DBS will be the first Singaporean bank to join the Net-Zero Banking Alliance and GFANZ, the gold standard for net zero commitments and action,” said Mr Mark Carney, UN special envoy for climate action and finance. “DBS’ commitment, expertise and leadership will make powerful contributions, particularly in the ASEAN region which is crucial for global decarbonisation, to driving the transition to a net zero economy,” he added. Earlier in April, DBS committed to zero thermal coal exposure by 2039. To achieve this goal, the bank said that it will cease the onboarding of new customers who derive more than 25 per cent of their revenue from thermal coal. It also issued a statement in 2018 to restrict financing to only coal-fired power projects that adopt more advanced technologies which emit lower carbon emissions, and to stop financing new thermal coal mining projects. This was followed by a blanket cease in financing any new coal power assets in April 2019. DBS recently committed to ensuring net-zero operational carbon emissions across the bank by 2022. It has also committed to using 100 per cent renewable energy for its Singapore operations by 2030. “Joining the GFANZ alliance and making a commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 is not something that we take lightly,” said Mr Piyush Gupta, chief executive officer of DBS. “Determining suitable transition pathways for our customers in different industries, and creating realistic medium-term milestones in the journey is challenging, given the starting position in many countries in our part of the world. “Nevertheless, we firmly believe that collective action is essential to achieving a net-zero future, and now have some line of sight towards a viable course of action that is constructive and impactful.” This year, DBS raised its sustainable finance target to S$50 billion by 2024 to help customers incorporate sustainable business practices into their overall business strategy. As of end of Oct 2021, DBS has concluded more than S$30 billion of sustainable financing, the bank said. "

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/how-invest-esg-green-funds-stock-market-climate-change-2236691,Commentary: Why investing in green funds isn’t so simple,"SINGAPORE: As the climate crisis grows in urgency, many investors want to use their money to make a positive change in the world.  The predominant approach to sustainable investing is ESG, which uses environmental, social and corporate governance criteria for judging a firm’s behaviour. It promises to combine ethical or environmental considerations with financial reward, a win-win solution for investors. ESG investing is especially important to younger investors. According to United States finance company MSCI’s report in 2020, 89 per cent of millennials expect financial planners to consider a company's ESG credentials and impact before making recommendations. In Singapore, an HSBC survey found that 80 per cent of investors consider sustainable, environmental and ethical issues to be central to managing their investments. In reality, only a quarter of their investments consider ESG metrics. If the environmental and social outcomes of their choices mattered so much to retail investors, why aren’t they walking the talk? HSBC suggested this gap arises from a lack of investor awareness. 66 per cent of respondents don’t want to lose out financially when they make an ESG investment, while 58 per cent don’t know how to embark on ESG investing, even though they would like to. There are many doubts that hold retail investors back from trying a new financial product. They want an adequate rate of return and young working adults in particular can only bear so much risk. For many of them, they are putting their life savings on the line. Against the backdrop of growing financial obligations, higher living costs and less predictable employment prospects, a 2017 BlackRock survey found that 2 in 5 Singaporeans believe they will run out of money during retirement. To factor in positive change into their portfolios is a tall order.  But advocates for ESG investing might cite funds’ robust performances to coax those on the fence. As the world was ravaged by COVID-19 in 2020, ESG stocks outperformed market benchmarks by up to 3.8 per cent. This trend extends over the long term too. Financial services company Morningstar found that six out of 10 Europe-based ESG funds yielded higher returns than traditional ones over the past decade. The gap between investors’ ideals and actions can partly be chalked up to a lack of awareness. However, could more fundamental flaws of ESG investment be the culprit? Sustainable investing isn’t without its sceptics, who say the correlation between ESG and financial performance doesn't mean that higher returns were caused by ESG factors. Studies have shown that in most cases, they were simply the result of ESG funds’ exposure to higher quality stocks and better performing sectors. In fact, an ESG fund doesn’t guarantee market-beating returns at all. We have seen friends put their money in green investments and get burned. One invested in a US clean energy ETF (exchange traded fund) following the presidential inauguration of Joe Biden at the start of 2021. Many others worldwide did as well, expecting windfalls from an America taking climate change seriously again. But this wave of inflows in January 2021 formed a mini-bubble and the resulting correction in the following weeks wiped out a quarter of the stock price.   This underscores how the workings of financial markets don’t always lead to better outcomes for the environment. As more money flows into ESG stocks, they become more expensive, reducing their relative returns. This makes “dirty”, non-ESG-compliant stocks cheaper, and therefore better value for investors. For every investor who wants to support a transition to a green economy, there are those betting against the performance of green assets. Even the most eco-conscious of investors cannot always act like activists fighting for change. They are still subject to the ebbs and flows of financial markets. Environmentalists often wonder whether investors can be regarded as allies. The more pertinent question then is whether ESG investing meets its objective of slowing down environmental destruction. On that front, the case for it is even weaker.  For one, ESG scores are often highly abstracted. How much does an “AAA” ESG rating tell an individual investor about a company’s environmental actions? Is it enough for an investor to buy a stock just because they know that it has a high ESG score?  This is compounded by the fact that the ESG landscape is highly fragmented, often providing divergent, contradictory ESG scores. For investors, it can be nearly impossible to come to an informed decision.  The absence of consistent standards enables greenwashing over ESG. The August 2021 controversy involving German investment fund DWS, whose former chief sustainability officer alleged that it misrepresented the environmental credentials of its ESG-labelled products, is one of many. Despite these shortcomings, investors who want to make a difference don’t have to turn their back entirely on ESG funds. But they must go in with their eyes wide open. The first step would be to ask the right questions: Whether a fund was built for achieving ESG outcomes, or just a conventional fund repackaged to attain as high an ESG score as possible; what a firm’s ESG engagement capabilities and engagement history are. These go a long way in making informed choices. Regulators can also help by implementing uniform frameworks and standards. The last thing investors would want is to sink their funds in ESG products, only to realise down the road that such ESG claims were fabricated, as was the case with DWS. This will necessitate an active role played by governments. Beyond small steps such as climate risk disclosures, which are soon being implemented in Singapore, more needs to be done to penalise polluting economic behaviour.  This may include measures like a rigorous, well-enforced green taxonomy, which classifies assets as clean or dirty. For example, fossil fuels, even the lowest emitting types like natural gas, must not be counted as clean. Such regulations will help sort the wheat from the chaff of ESG ratings.  The issue is ultimately one of scale. As is the case with emissions, the greening of finance will be determined by the actions of governments, corporates and financial institutions, all of whom wield far more power and influence than consumers or retail investors.  As interest in ESG investing grows, all this will determine whether it’s just a moneymaking fad or if it can rise up to the demands faced by a planet in peril.

The new action plan repeats China's targets to bring wind and solar capacity to 1,200 gigawatts by the end of the decade, to build more hydropower and nuclear plants, and further develop natural gas resources. The document was published just five days before talks get under way in Glasgow to strengthen the global fight against climate change. China is set to announce its updated ""nationally determined contributions"" before the meeting begins. Climate watchers have been looking closely for signs that China, the world's biggest source of climate-warming greenhouse gases, might make more ambitious pledges ahead of the Glasgow talks. Tuesday's document offered few advances. As the country grapples with power shortages and ramps up coal production in order to guarantee winter supplies, the State Council said that China would accelerate efforts to build a new and more flexible power system that allows new energy sources to be steadily increased. As well as new solar and wind farms, new hydroelectric dams would also be built on the upper reaches of the Yangtze, Mekong and Yellow rivers, and China will also make more use of new-generation nuclear technology, including small-scale offshore reactors, it said. China will also take action to ensure that energy-intensive industrial sectors such as steel, non-ferrous metals and building materials improve energy efficiency and recycling rates, and make full use of new technologies to bring their own emissions to a peak."

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/un-cop15-kunming-biodiversity-cop26-climate-talks-target-wildlife-2253591,Commentary: Will new UN biodiversity targets stop the decline of wildlife?,"READING, United Kingdom: “Putting biodiversity on a path to recovery is a defining challenge of this decade.” So begins the Kunming Declaration on biodiversity, adopted at the 15th United Nations Biodiversity Conference on Oct 13, otherwise known as COP15. The purpose of the online gathering was to get governments from around the world to agree a new set of goals for nature over the next decade, replacing the unsuccessful Aichi targets which ran up to 2020. This online event will be followed by an in-person one in Geneva in January 2022 and negotiations will formally end in April 2022 in Kunming, China, where the world will agree a post-2020 global biodiversity framework with targets for the next decade. Most countries - 196 in total, with the United States being one notable exception - help fund the Convention on Biological Diversity, a set of agreements designed to protect the variety of life on Earth, from genes and species all the way up to entire ecosystems. Scientists are confident that this biodiversity is now in severe decline, with a 2019 report estimating that one million of the nearly nine million species on Earth could go extinct this century. Global crises are often discussed independently. There’s the biodiversity crisis, the climate crisis and the air pollution crisis. But in truth, these issues are all interlinked. Treating them as separate overlooks their combined effect on species and ultimately, humanity. It’s increasingly urgent to set ambitious targets for addressing biodiversity decline, alongside other issues, and to develop credible plans for meeting them. The world missed a target to curb the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010 and then set 20 targets for 2020. Although there has been some progress - for example, in increasing the extent of protected areas to 17 per cent of the world’s land and 10 per cent of the ocean - most of the 20 targets were not met. This is because countries have failed to address the drivers of biodiversity loss, which include the proliferation of harmful chemicals and demand for energy and resources that outstrips renewable supplies. One consequence of this is the destruction of tropical forests to grow palm oil and soya, which is used in many different products. These systemic challenges demand transforming economies, regulatory systems and the way some people live – from how we travel to the food we eat – particularly in rich countries like the United Kingdom. Here’s how leaders at COP15 tried to make progress on this complex problem. The convention once expected national governments to implement reforms to meet global targets. But countries have struggled to address problems which transcend borders, such as invasive species and pollution in the atmosphere and ocean. Planning within countries to meet these global targets has depended on working with civil society groups, businesses and local government, which is often difficult. In an effort to address these problems, governments have consulted with leaders in business and finance, as well as indigenous peoples, youth and women’s groups, at COP15. Countries spent three to four years following the 2010 conference developing national strategies to meet their targets, with not enough time to actually implement them before the 2020 milestone. Now, 192 countries have national biodiversity strategies and action plans in place, and that should allow them to hit the ground running. Chinese President Xi Jinping announced a new Kunming biodiversity fund of 1.5 billion yuan (US$233 million) to support projects for protecting biodiversity in developing countries, while Japan extended its own biodiversity fund by 1.8 billion yen (US$17 million). There have been other pledges, including that of the European Commission which plans to double funding for biodiversity. These are relatively small amounts compared to funds coordinated by the United Nations Development Programme, which has a US$3.2 billion portfolio in 138 countries, invested in managing invasive species, combating poaching, restoring coral reefs and maintaining protected areas. In September, nine philanthropic organisations pledged US$5 billion to protect nature. Another major funding boost could come from diverting subsidies which currently harm biodiversity, such as those supporting intensive food production and fossil fuel extraction, estimated to be worth more than $US5 billion a year, to renewable energy and nature-friendly farming. Conference organisers urged countries to integrate biodiversity restoration into all sectors of their economies by, for example, developing farming and forestry policies which restore, rather than degrade, nature. Encouragingly, a coalition of financial institutions with assets equivalent to US$13.9 trillion committed to protecting and restoring biodiversity through their investments at the conference. Protecting biodiversity will be a big part of the COP26 climate negotiations in Glasgow. It’s important that both climate change and biodiversity loss are treated as two connected problems. That’s because action on climate change can actually damage biodiversity. Growing bioenergy crops or managing forests with the single aim of sequestering carbon can mean replacing biodiverse habitats. Alternatively, nature-based solutions like rewetting peatlands (by raising the water table) to absorb carbon and protecting coastal habitats to reduce flooding can also restore biodiversity. President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prince Charles from the UK proposed devoting 30 per cent of the climate funds that will be leveraged from countries and businesses through the COP26 negotiations to contribute directly to restoring biodiversity. National leaders are more informed of the solutions than ever before. But do they have the political courage to make the necessary changes?

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/advertorial/sustainable-motoring-done-stylishly-2207156,"Sustainable motoring, done stylishly","There’s a new way to enter the all-electric world of Mercedes EQ, the German manufacturer’s sub-brand of electric vehicles. The EQA is the first pure-electric compact sport utility vehicle (SUV) from Mercedes-Benz available in Singapore and is the most affordable way to step into the world of sustainable mobility, with the three-pointed star leading the way. A battery-powered counterpart to the successful GLA (which is powered by an internal-combustion engine), the new electric SUV’s dynamic looks hint at the exciting driving experience it offers. The EQA offers four design lines, each with its unique take on electrifying style. FOUR APPROACHES TO STYLISH SUSTAINABILITY  From the sharp-suited Progressive Line and the more sustainable Electric Art to the sporty AMG Line and the exclusive Edition 1, there is an EQA for all tastes. Available only for a limited period, Edition 1 combines the exterior elements of the Night Package with AMG body styling, and features 20-inch multi-spoke rose gold wheels to round off its sporty appearance. Inside, the backlit trim and blue topstitching on the seats and doors create clear highlights meant to visually represent electric mobility. An upholstery combination of Artico man-made leather with Cupertino fabric in rose gold or titanium grey pearl — made from recycled plastic bottles — is available in the Electric Art version of the EQA. In line with the manufacturer’s goal of creating a carbon-neutral supply chain, environmentally friendly materials like hemp, kenaf, wool, paper and natural rubber are used in more than 100 components in the EQA. The Black Panel radiator grille and the continuous light strips at the front and rear give the EQA its distinctive looks. The car’s smooth, almost completely enclosed underbody, optimised Aero wheels and specifically adapted front and rear wheel spoilers contribute to its sculpted, athletic appearance. These offer a captivating glimpse of what Mercedes-EQ has to offer. DOING MORE WITH LESS By 2025, Mercedes-Benz will have battery electric vehicles (BEV) in every market segment where the brand is currently present, and each will be a showcase of technology, design and efficiency that you see in the EQA. The EQA 250 has a 140kW electric motor that offers smooth and instantaneous acceleration. The car’s battery, with its 66.5kWh capacity, isn’t unnecessarily large, while its ability to maximise efficiency means it can travel up to 426km on a fully charged battery. One example of how the EQA does more with less is the radar-based recuperation with D Auto feature. With sensors to monitor the traffic ahead, the system can show the driver when to take their foot off the accelerator pedal and let the car glide, via an icon on the instrument cluster. If conditions make it more efficient to slow the car with regenerative braking instead, the EQA can continually adjust the ideal recuperation level automatically. Whether it’s more efficient to coast or to recuperate energy, the D Auto system lets the EQA decide for you. SMALL STEPS TO BIG GAINS The EQA requires less energy to move through the air, thanks in part to it being the first Mercedes-Benz to have its aerodynamics completely digitally optimised. This is only a small step towards a big goal. In its Ambition 2039 roadmap to a sustainable future for mobility, Daimler is committed to transforming itself. By 2039, it aims to produce a completely new, carbon-neutral car fleet and ensure that the entire supply chain is carbon-neutral as well. Such major changes will require a wholesale shift to the way Mercedes-Benz designs and builds its future cars, while the cars themselves evolve simultaneously. But with the switch to full-electric cars gathering pace, the floodgates to more cars like the new EQA, EQS, EQB and EQE are set to open. From 2025, all newly launched vehicle architectures from Mercedes-Benz will be electric-only. Is the sustainable future of mobility envisioned by Mercedes-Benz in 2039 out of reach? The EQA could potentially prove that it is inevitable. Find out how the new EQA by Mercedes EQ is spearheading the brand’s push to carbon-neutral motoring."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/building-greener-sustainability-payoff-real-estate-2251211,Building greener: The sustainability payoff in real estate,"SINGAPORE: The real estate sector has one of the highest carbon footprints of any industry. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, the building sector consumes around 40 per cent of the world’s energy. Building construction and operations also make up 38 per cent of global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. Worldwide, the built environment sector employs 300 million people. In Singapore, about 11 per cent of the labour force is in the construction sector. The sheer size of the sector means that its sustainability actions will have an impact on the fight against climate change. “It’s a very large asset class and so it obviously is a large contributor to people and planet issues. But it can therefore also play a very big opportunity and be part of the solution as well,"" said Mr Steve Melhuish, founder, PropertyGuru. ""That’s why I see the opportunities being there. All sectors need to decarbonise and become sustainable. The ones that don’t will probably die, the ones that do will thrive and survive,” he said. Even as property developers embark on this push to sustainability, the very definition of a green building has changed. “Traditionally, when you talk about green buildings, it is about the design and about putting in greenery,"" said Ms Lynette Leong, chief sustainability officer at CapitaLand. ""Now when we talk about sustainable buildings, it is not just design. Energy efficiency is definitely part of it. It is also about creating a very good indoor environment for your occupiers, enabling them to be healthy, and protecting the well-being of your occupiers. It’s a multi-stakeholder approach to real estate.” Sustainability also brings with it tangible payoffs. Industry watchers said that companies are increasingly basing their leasing decisions on sustainability, with some even willing to pay a premium for greener properties. Sustainable buildings that are more energy efficient also tend to have lower operating costs, with savings estimated at up to 20 per cent in the long term, said RHB analyst Vijay Natarajan. Developer CapitaLand said that future proofing its assets against climate change risks helps to make its portfolio more resilient.  ‘We have seen tangible results by being more efficient and since 2009, we have achieved cost avoidance of S$270 million,"" said Ms Leong. The other major reason for property players to move into sustainability is the huge amount of liquidity that is being invested in sustainable assets. According to the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance, the value of sustainable assets rose from US$30 trillion in 2018 to US$35 trillion in 2020. Such sums reflect a growing consensus among stakeholders that sustainability is crucial for business success. In a recent survey by Jones Lang LaSalle, 83 per cent of building occupiers and 78 per cent of investors agreed that climate risk poses a clear financial risk. “We are increasingly seeing environmental, social, governance (ESG) becoming one of the most critical factors in selection process for investing by many of the large institutional funds,"" said Mr Natarajan. ""From an investment community standpoint, we are seeing both a carrot and a stick approach to push for better sustainability standards. For example, companies that adopt better sustainability practices are able to access lower cost of debt, by accessing a wide range of green financing options in the market, which generally tend to be cheaper than a conventional loan. And they’re also able to secure better valuations due to a large institutional following as well as many passive funds tracking ESG-related indices. ""On the other hand, we are also seeing more active approach by institutional investors who are coming out and openly criticising as well as pushing back on the portfolio of companies who don’t pay sufficient attention to sustainability standards.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/electric-motorcycles-charging-singapore-ev-lta-2228326,"Electric motorcycles pick up speed in Singapore, but obstacles remain in mass adoption","SINGAPORE: Electric motorcycle numbers in Singapore look set to increase, though there are still hurdles in making their adoption here more widespread, observers say.  A decade ago, there were eight electric motorcycles on the roads here, according to data from the Land Transport Authority (LTA). By 2015, however, this number had dipped to two and remained stagnant for several years.  As the country looks set to phase out internal combustion engine vehicles by 2040, electric motorcycle numbers are slowly rising once again.  Latest LTA figures show that there are now five electric motorcycles registered here as of the end of August.  This comes a little over a year after regulations were amended to allow electric motorcycles with power ratings of more than 10kW on the roads. Motorbikes with a top speed of 50kmh and above will also be allowed on expressways.   One of the newly registered electric motorcycles is an Energica Eva EsseEsse 9+, which is being sold here by authorised distributor Ifnyi. The firm currently offers three models of Energica bikes, with prices between S$69,000 and S$84,000.  Ifyni’s co-founders are Mr Randall Lee, who heads a software firm, and Mr Eugene Mah, managing director of Mah, which distributes motorbike brands such as Triumph and Aprilia.   The novelty of the Energica is drawing a lot of interest from motorcycle enthusiasts, said Mr Lee, noting several have already come forward for test rides of the Eva EsseEsse 9+.  “Energica is one of the really cool brands on the market,” said Mr Lee, noting the company’s role as supplier for electric motorcycle racing competition MotoE.  “It’s like a Ferrari on the road, a brand new Ferrari. Everybody wants to ride it."" Mr Lee told CNA the firm has already sold three Energica motorbikes, and plans to bring in 10 of the Italian-made electric two-wheelers by the end of the year. The company also distributes IONA RAP, the three-wheeled electric motorcycles that Singapore Post is testing as part of its shift towards electric vehicles.  Separately, Singapore-based brand Scorpio Electric has announced plans to produce 8,000 electric motorbikes annually at its Teban Gardens facility.  And in April this year, Eurosports Technologies – the parent company of Scorpio Electric – announced a tie-up with SMRT subsidiary Strides Transportation to develop and supply smart electric motorcycles to commercial and corporate clients across Singapore and the Asia-Pacific region.  “Electric motorcycles offer the benefits of zero tailpipe emissions and are noiseless,” said Mr Satya Ramamurthy, global co-head of public transport at KPMG. Electric motorcycles generate about 10.7g of CO2 per kilometre, said Mr Ramamurthy, assuming the electricity used to charge the vehicles is generated from natural gas. In comparison, an internal combustion engine (ICE) counterpart would release four times the CO2, at 43.59g per kilometre.  A study by McKinsey in October last year valued the global market for electric motorcycles at US$97 billion, or about 4 per cent of global auto sales. The consultancy firm suggested this could reach US$150 billion by next year, with the largest growth expected in emerging markets. Electric motorcycles provide a very promising alternative in the larger two-wheeler markets in ASEAN such as Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia, said Mr Ramamurthy. In Singapore, however, there is less demand due to perceived safety concerns over the two-wheelers.  The number of electric motorcycles registered locally pales in comparison to that of electric cars.  As of end-August, there were 1,855 electric cars on the roads here. In comparison, there are just five electric motorcycles – making up just 0.004 per cent of the local motorcycle population.  One reason is cost, with an electric motorbike priced at more than double that of an ICE equivalent.  This is coupled with the relatively scarce number of charging points across the island, which could lead to a sense of “range anxiety” for potential buyers, said Mr Ramamurthy. “Furthermore, major producers in the motorcycle sector have not pushed hard enough on the electrification agenda to give rise to an ecosystem matching that of electric cars,” he said. “While key manufacturers have started producing electric motorbikes, the entire electric-bike ecosystem still lags behind the electric car market.” Though traditional motorcycle manufacturers such as Honda and Harley Davidson have ventured into producing electric alternatives, there has been no word as to whether these will be made available in Singapore.  Acknowledging that the Energica bikes are higher-end vehicles aimed at those who ride for leisure, Mr Lee said more mass market electric motorcycles could be introduced here with a review of Singapore’s electric vehicle charging standards. He is hopeful that a review of the existing standards – known as Technical Reference 25 (TR25) – to allow options such as swappable batteries would boost the supply of electric motorcycles here with those produced in China and Europe, which do not currently comply with local regulations. In July, Minister for Transport S Iswaran said the LTA is leading a ""comprehensive review"" of TR25 together with industry players and technical experts, including the potential introduction of high-powered chargers and swappable batteries for electric motorcycles. The review is expected to be completed by the end of this year.  “Impetus from the Government in the form of regulation or incentives will be critical for the wide adoption of electric vehicles across the board,” said Mr Ramamurthy. He acknowledged developments such as allowing more powerful electric motorbikes on the road, as well as aligning the road tax structure for electric motorbikes with that of their ICE equivalents, were positive steps forward.  “While a S$30 million budget was set for EV-related initiatives in 2021, specific initiatives to encourage conversion to electric motorcycles should be considered,” he said. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/us-envoy-kerry-says-climate-talks-may-miss-emission-targets-2243666,US envoy Kerry says climate talks may miss emission targets,"WASHINGTON: US climate envoy John Kerry is tempering expectations for a UN climate summit sometimes billed as make-or-break for the Earth's future, conceding next month's talks likely will end with nations still short of the target of cuts in coal and petroleum emissions that are needed to stave off increasingly devastating levels of global warming. But in an interview with The Associated Press, Kerry also credited efforts by the United States, European Union, Japan and other allies ahead of next month’s climate negotiations in Glasgow, Scotland with getting the world much closer to the scale of big, fast fossil fuel cuts needed. He expressed hope enough nations would join in over the next couple of years. ""By the time Glasgow’s over, we’re going to know who is doing their fair share, and who isn’t,” he said. Kerry also spoke of the impact if the US Congress – under a slim Democratic majority – fails to pass legislation for significant action on climate by the United States itself, as the Biden administration aims to regain leadership on climate action. ""It would be like President Trump pulling out of the Paris agreement, again,” Kerry said. Kerry spoke to the AP on Wednesday (Oct 13) in a conference room down the hall from his office at the State Department, its upper corridors still eerily shy of people in the coronavirus pandemic. Kerry's comments came after nine months of intensive climate diplomacy by plane, phone and computer screen aimed at nailing down the most global commitments of action on climate possible ahead of the UN climate summit, which opens Oct 31 in Scotland. Kerry plans final stops in Mexico, and in Saudi Arabia, where he expected new, last-minute climate pledges ahead of the summit, before settling in Glasgow for two weeks of talks. Kerry’s efforts abroad, along with President Joe Biden’s multibillion-dollar promises of legislation and support for cleaner-burning energy at home, come after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris climate accord. Kerry rejected a suggestion he was seeking to lower expectations for the summit, which became a deadline — but not a final one, leaders have begun stressing - for countries to announce how hard they will work to switch their economies from polluting to cleaner-burning. Kerry and others early on billed the Glasgow summit as “the last, best chance” to drum up momentum for the emissions cuts, investment in renewable energy, and aid to less-wealthy countries to allow them to switch from dirty-burning coal and petroleum in time to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The world has already warmed nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since nations of the world set that target in Paris in 2015. Scientists warn the damage is irreversible and headed to catastrophic levels absent major cuts in emissions. When it comes to closing the divide between cuts promised by countries and the cuts needed, “We will hopefully be moving very close to that ... though there will be a gap and ... we’ve got to be honest about the gap, and we have to use the gap as further motivation to continue to accelerate as fast as we can,” Kerry said Wednesday. In the meantime, money pouring into developing cleaner technology such as battery storage will be spurring the advances that will make it easier for laggard countries to catch up, he contended. A senior UN official separately briefing reporters Wednesday also spoke less stirringly than international leaders often have previously of the expected accomplishments of Glasgow. Speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter, the official left open the door that some work on getting to the international goal of a 45 per cent cut in emissions by 2030 may not be done by end of the Glasgow climate negotiations. The official stressed that the Paris accord allows countries to submit stronger pledges at any time. Critically, Kerry’s repeated trips to China and diplomatic efforts by other countries have failed so far to win public promises of faster emissions cuts from that key climate player. China’s enthusiasm for coal-fired power plants help make it the world’s biggest current climate polluter by far. China under President Xi Jinping shows no interest in being seen as following the US lead on climate or anything else. Kerry declined to single out China by name as one reason why Glasgow might not be as big a success as it could have been – although surprise announcements by China remain a possibility. “It would be wonderful if everybody came and everybody hit the 1.5 degrees mark now,” he said. “That would be terrific. But some countries just don’t have the energy mix yet that allows them to do that.” For Biden at home, it's the lawmaker mix that's the problem. Holdouts from the president's own party so far are blocking the administration's multibillion-dollar climate legislation of the kind needed to make good on US climate pledges of support for clean energy. Asked how the administration's troubles delivering on its own climate promises affect his work rallying climate action abroad, Kerry said, “Well, it hurts.” “I'm not going to pretend it's the best way to send the best message. I mean, we need to do these things,"" he said. Kerry added he was optimistic Congress would step up. “I don’t know what shape it’ll take ... or which piece of legislation, it’ll be in, but I believe we’re going to act responsibly” at home, he said. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/cop26-carbon-market-paris-agreement-offset-credits-trade-net-zero-emissions-2241446,Commentary: Carbon markets can make responsible firms bear costs of climate change,"BERLIN: With just weeks to the crucial COP26 UN climate conference in the UK, there is a rising tide of interest in a final, unfinished piece of the Paris Climate Agreement – the rules of the game for a new generation of voluntary carbon markets. Many nations, companies, scientists and non-government organisations see these as an accelerant towards stepped-up climate action and a way to handle currently hard-to-cut emissions.  Malaysia just announced plans to develop a domestic emissions trading scheme with environment minister Tuan Ibrahim describing it “as a catalyst for the country’s socioeconomic growth in line with (its) low-carbon development aspirations”. After years in the doldrums, the momentum here is picking up. Voluntary carbon markets have posted a near-60 per cent increase in value over the first eight months of 2021 and are set to hit a record US$1 billion by year’s end, according to Ecosystem Marketplace. McKinsey now estimates this trade in carbon credits could be worth upward of US$50 billion in 2030. These market mechanisms could hold the key to bringing down the costs of highly expensive technologies that promise to capture pollution directly from the air or harvest electricity from the oceans and seas. Voluntary carbon markets also have the potential to generate much needed funding to protect precious forests and hasten smarter and more sustainable agriculture. But such efforts have critics who view compensating emissions or offsets as bywords for greenwashing benefitting polluters rather than the climate or communities. Environmental group Greenpeace is among the harshest, likening the use of offsets to a “get-out-of-jail-free card” for oil, aviation and coal firms.  Formal carbon markets emerged from the 1997 Kyoto protocol, the second UN emission reduction treaty.  Rich countries could offset emissions at lower costs by investing in clean energy, forestry projects and other green initiatives in developing countries. Voluntary carbon markets allow companies to do the same thing, broadly speaking, with carbon credits tradable on exchanges like the one in Singapore. Formal markets are subject to government rules, such as the Californian compliance markets, whereas voluntary ones are generally managed with rules set by third-party certification bodies such as the Gold Standard and used by project developers like South Pole. In an ideal world, we would already have decarbonised our economies, the threat of irrevocable and dangerous climate change would no longer exist, and there would be no need for offset mechanisms in the first place.  But we are not there yet. No matter how hard everyone tries, there will still be some level of pollution to be addressed in positive, creative and above all transparent ways. Indeed, without the option of offsetting now, many experts fear it will be harder and costlier to reach net zero by 2050 and avoid emissions soaring well above 1.5 degrees Celsius safety limit. There are many examples where high-quality carbon offset projects are showing promise as forces for good. Take Rimba Raya, a US$5 million investment in an area of forest and peatlands in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia the size of Singapore.  By some estimates, the project has over the last 10 years avoided 130 million tonnes of carbon emissions – the equivalent of taking 13 million cars off the road – while helping to meet several UN Sustainable Development Goals around jobs and education. But there are many examples where offsetting has, it is claimed, not delivered on its promises. Indeed, environmental groups often cite a famous project in Thailand where a power company burns waste rice husks generating carbon credits sold to companies in Japan to offset their emissions. According to Carbon Trade Watch, rice husks are a source of fertiliser for local farmers who now have to buy expensive, petroleum-based chemical fertilisers, generating more carbon pollution overall. There have also been renewable energy projects that would have happened anyway, programmes to conserve forests too full of loopholes to be credible and others where local communities have been shortchanged. With the right rules, market mechanisms can achieve high levels of integrity that can help big and small companies get onto the low-carbon, net-zero pathway at speed and at scale. Two new bodies – the private-sector led Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets and its new governance body and the associated Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative – have been charged with boosting the benefits and managing the flaws. With smart guardrails and a few more things to do, the benefits of this race-to-zero can flow not only to investors taking the risk, but also to more developing countries and communities on the ground. First, companies must adopt science-based targets and publish plans aimed at halving emissions by 2030 and reaching net zero no later than 2050. They must decarbonise first, offset second, with a timeline for the use of fewer offsets.  Second, regulators must ensure rules on offsets are integrated with those governing reporting standards.  Third, governments must work towards a regulated, prudent price on carbon rewarding real action. We should not do this on the cheap.  Finally, markets must be transparent, liquid and global - offering the possibility of everyone, including indigenous people and the rural poor living in and working on these projects, reaping gains. We need all hands on deck to meet the safety limits of the Paris Climate Agreement. Today the global average temperature rise is around 1.1 degrees Celsius and emissions into the atmosphere continue to rise. No one is immune. Only a few months ago devastating floods ripped through homes in Germany’s Nord Rhine Westfalen region. Over 2 million in Kenya are facing drought because the rains have failed again. And in mid-July, China’s Henan province, one of the country’s most populous regions, was hit by a year’s worth of rain – 640mm – in just three days. The frequency and scale of climate impacts are now outstripping the ability of the world’s poorest countries to cope. We must take every action possible and quickly. If we are handed a mechanism by which the companies most responsible for causing climate change pay a share of the costs for solving it to those on the frontline, then it would be folly to ignore it.  Voluntary carbon markets are not a silver bullet, but they must be part of the suite of measures and stepped-up financial flows that help achieve the goals of the landmark Paris Climate Agreement. Carbon markets have been part of the climate action story for over 20 years and, like Sergio Leone’s famous wild west film, littered with the good, the bad and the ugly.  As we look to November’s COP26, let’s work together with those shaping the ground rules to ensure the “bad and the ugly” of offsetting are consigned to history books in favour of those helping to deliver a climate safe world now and over the decades to come.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/retail-therapy-online-shopping-environment-2229966,Commentary: Why we feel a rush when we ‘Add to Cart’ and what we can do about it,"SINGAPORE: In the last three months, have you bought something that you do not need but you bought on impulse anyway? Perhaps it was a beautiful bag or the cute looking household item? COVID-19 has increased our spending online. A Visa poll published in March this year showed that nearly three in four consumers in Singapore are shopping more frequently online. Forty-five per cent went to large marketplaces such as Lazada or Amazon. This isn’t surprising - we are stuck at home and feeling really bored. People I have met said they bought something online on impulse recently simply to make themselves feel better. Retail therapy is even more compelling now.  The world economy is structured in such a way that companies and countries thrive the more consumers purchase.  With the rise of intelligent algorithms, special attention is placed on how products “speak” to the consumers. This is why designers put in a lot of thought to things like how a new phone feels in your hand or why a beautifully designed home appliance is so compelling. The look and feel of products are carefully researched and refined. The more they can trigger your emotional reaction, the more likely you would be willing to part with your money for it. Why do these tactics work?  This is because most of our consumption decisions are guided by our emotions. Research has shown that we like to think we are rational beings but our “heart” frequently overrides our “head”.  Research in academic literature has shown that people consume to fulfill three major needs – functional needs, social needs and psychological needs.  Functional need is self-explanatory. You need a hairdryer to dry your hair after shower.  Yet, functional needs do not drive our buying decisions. There are so many different types of hair dryers out there. Some hair dryers cost as little as S$25 whereas others cost as much as S$500. What differentiates these products?  In a 2021 paper in the Journal of Marketing, Jennifer J Sun, Silvia Bellezza, and Neeru Paharia showed that high-end products tend to be more durable and have longer product life cycles than mid-range products.  But this isn’t always the case and the relationship between price and quality can vary, depending on the product. Quite often, the expensive product tends to look nicer and can be used to define who we are.  For example, if someone forked out five to 10 times more for a high-end hair dryer, they want to share it on social media which invites comments. Such behaviours speak to our social and psychological needs.  Socially, humans have an innate need to communicate our personality, identity or our success to others. Since these are inherently “invisible” attributes, consumption is one way for us to convey such messages clearly.  A common observation of buying behaviour shows when our status in life changes, the type of products we consume change as well. There is always the more luxurious car, the newest phone, the latest laptop we acquire. Owning these products signal our status to others.  So even though your “head” tells you that you do not need the latest phone (which often is only slightly different from the older version you own), you may still gravitate towards it because it’s cool to own the latest gadget.  A 2005 study conducted in Canada by Katherine White and Darrin Lehman, and published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, showed that Asians tend to compare upwards with those who did better than them. So the mindset we need to “keep up with the Joneses” is common among Asians.  Psychologically, studies show we also consume to make ourselves feel better. Have you had a really bad day and retail therapy made you feel instantly better? This is because when we buy something, we feel a sense of control over our circumstances. Losing control make people feel bad and buying helps us regain this.  Seeing something aesthetically appealing may also lead to heightened arousal (like when you see a 90 per cent discount off a brand you really love), and a greater impulse purchase to satisfy it. During this pandemic, anecdotal evidence indicates more impulse purchases. The ease and prevalence of online platforms also make it easier for us to give in to these urges.  Making many small low value purchases which you can easily find on e-commerce platforms also allow us to mentally justify the consumption.  Yet, there is a deep impact of letting emotions drive our purchase decisions. We may end up buying more than we need thereby spending more than we should. But increased consumerism has broader and more insidious implications.  The more we buy, the more we tax the environment. This holds true even if you are buying products that are presumably produced in a more sustainable manner.  A Stanford Social Innovation Review article in 2016 argued that there is no such thing as a green product. Even though the environmental impact of green products is lower than that of regular products, they still exert a toll on the environment throughout their product life cycles.  This is because production of all products and services will require extraction of natural resources and the production process will also create waste. One example is electric cars. Car manufacturers are promoting electric cars as the car for the future. Yes, they are environmentally friendly, but these cars still need a massive supply of electricity to charge.  The battery packs still require a lot of raw materials to produce and needs to be disposed of subsequently. So just because we purchase electric cars does not mean there is no impact on the environment.  If car population increases simply because we thought electric cars are more environmentally friendly, Mother Earth will still be in trouble.  Clearly, reducing consumption is the best solution to environmental protection. But because these are driven by emotions, it’s a complex mechanism to undo and certainly hard to curb our desires.  But if we are aware of our behaviours we can take some steps to recalibrate. There are simple things we can do. First, before paying, look into your basket and ask yourself if you really need everything in it or anything in there is an emotional purchase you are likely to discard or not use often. Second, if you are online, after adding items to cart, don’t confirm the purchase immediately. Shut the app, leave the page, and come back a few hours later. More often than not, the items sitting the cart will appear less desirable once the arousal level has decreased.  Finally, there’s no shame in buying second-hand goods. The Marie Kondo craze sent thrift shops in the US bursting with donations from her followers who suddenly realised how many things they had which they didn’t need or use. Used-goods platforms are just as good, and no one needs to know. The truth is consumerism is deeply embedded in our society and is not going to go away, particularly in a pandemic. But if we are aware of emotional consumption, there is a way to slowly wean ourselves off. And the winners aren’t only us but our environment too.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/vatican-statement-signals-pope-wont-attend-cop26-climate-conference-2231161,Vatican statement signals pope won't attend COP26 climate conference,"VATICAN CITY: The Vatican said on Friday (Oct 8) its delegation to the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow will be headed by its secretary of state, meaning Pope Francis will not be going. Scotland's bishops had announced in July that the pope would, health permitting, attend the opening of the conference that runs from Oct 31 until Nov 12. The Vatican had never said that he would attend and a Vatican source said that Friday's announcement that the delegation would be headed by Cardinal Pietro Parolin meant the pope would not be going. Sources have said the Vatican was surprised by the Scottish bishops' announcement on Jul 12, when the pope was still in hospital recovering from intestinal surgery, though Francis told a Spanish radio network last month that he would like to go. The 84-year-old pope left hospital on Jul 14 and after a period of rest he resumed his full activities, including a gruelling trip to Budapest and Slovakia, and has appeared to be in very good condition. This week he presided at a major event with other religious leaders to bring attention to the environment and the dangers of climate change. A Vatican source said there was a possibility that the pope would address the conference by video or that Parolin would read a message on his behalf."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/advertorial/ready-go-electric-join-crowd-2144626,Ready to go electric? Join the crowd,"Have you thought about switching to an electric car? If so, you’re not alone. A survey commissioned by BMW Group Asia reveals that 46 per cent of respondents are ready to go electric, meaning they will consider purchasing either a full electric vehicle (EV) or a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV). For those new to the list of EV acronyms, a PHEV is a car that can be charged from a wall socket and has enough range for a day’s motoring, but it also has an internal-combustion engine for longer distances. The online survey of 1,000 Singaporeans also found that the majority of the respondents want to live in a more environmentally conscious world, with 87 per cent saying a key benefit of owning an EV was the reduction in carbon emissions. PRACTICAL BENEFITS But there are pragmatic reasons for wanting an EV, too. Electric cars are quiet, smooth, responsive to drive, and relatively easy to maintain as they have fewer mechanical components. For instance, the fully-electric BMW iX3 has a comprehensive 5-year/100,000km warranty and it also comes with six years of free servicing. Its battery is covered by an 8-year/160,000km guarantee, ensuring peace of mind for the years ahead. According to BMW, since sales of the BMW i3 began in Singapore in 2014, fewer than 3 per cent of customers have made a warranty claim for a battery problem. “As high-voltage battery technology continues to improve and we gain more experience from the growing number of EVs on the road, we expect the claim ratio to decrease,” said Ms Preeti Gupta, corporate affairs director and sustainability lead, BMW Group Asia. And the improvements don’t stop there. “Consistent R&D has enabled the BMW Group to produce batteries with better performance, improved quality, longer lifetime, less weight and an increased vehicle range,” Ms Gupta said. “For example, the storage capacity of the high-voltage battery for the BMW i3 has doubled since the model launched in 2014, thanks to a higher battery density.” REDUCED COSTS, ENHANCED INCENTIVES As batteries continue to improve, they also become cheaper to manufacture, so EVs could be cost-competitive with combustion cars within a few years. Until that happens, there are incentives and rebates today to help lower the cost of EVs. Clean air tax rebates of up to S$25,000, plus an additional early EV adoption incentive of S$20,000, mean that the most eco-friendly EVs could offer buyers up to S$45,000 of savings. “In a bid to support sustainable mobility, the Singapore Government has announced rebates and incentives to encourage more drivers to make the switch,” Ms Gupta said. “This has enabled BMW Group Asia to price the BMW iX3 at a similar price point than its combustion-engined variant, the BMW X3.” The incentives, which kicked in this year, could be one major reason why more Singaporeans are taking to EVs. The car industry sold just 97 electric cars last year, but EV sales in the first half of 2021 alone hit 123 units TACKLING THE PUBLIC CHARGING PUZZLE But what would spur EV adoption even more? According to the BMW Group Asia survey, Singaporean drivers remain pragmatic when it comes to cars. Some 72 per cent of respondents cited government incentives and access to public charging facilities as the most important factors in driving EV adoption, with access to home charging following closely at 70 per cent. The public charging issue is something time will solve. In only four years, all Housing and Development Board (HDB) car parks in at least eight towns will be fitted with EV chargers. BMW Group Asia and Greenlots, its appointed charging service provider, will also work with condominium management councils to install chargers. For residents of private apartments and condominiums, the Electric Vehicle Common Charger Grant was recently announced. It will co-fund the installation costs of 2,000 chargers to encourage the early adoption of EVs. The results of the first pilot tender for charging points were also recently announced. The winners are expected to have 620 charging points installed and operational across Singapore by the third quarter of 2022. Manufacturers also have solutions for drivers who are able to charge their cars at home. For example, BMW iX3 owners who live in landed properties have the option of having a charging point installed in their homes. Owners only have to think about the perfect spot for their BMW Wallbox, which supplies up to 11kW of electricity for overnight charging. All that is in addition to the Government’s aim to have 60,000 charging points around the island by 2030. Given the BMW iX3’s range of almost 460km on a full battery, this means it will only need to be charged once a week or less. Improved charging technology is making the process more convenient. Speedy 50kW chargers available on public charging networks can easily add 100km of range to a BMW iX3 in a little over 20 minutes. When high-speed charging is eventually available, the BMW iX3’s battery can be taken from 0 to 80 per cent of its capacity in just 34 minutes at the maximum 150kW rate. PHEV OPTIONS For all that, one ready way for drivers to experience the benefits of an electric drive without making the jump to pure-electric propulsion would be to drive a PHEV. With five plug-in models across various vehicle segments on offer, BMW has a wide range of such cars to meet various needs. And with two full EVs in its line-up, along with the MINI Electric under the overall BMW Group brand, BMW is well-positioned to serve e-mobility’s growing fanbase. Want to know what your electric future could look like? Here’s what BMW’s range of electromobility solutions has to offer."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sustainability/uae-plan-net-zero-emissions-2050-2228946,UAE launches plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2050,"DUBAI: The United Arab Emirates on Thursday (Oct 7) announced a plan for net-zero emissions by 2050, and would oversee 600 billion dirhams (US$163 billion) in investment in renewable energy. This makes it the first country in the Middle East and North Africa region to launch a concrete initiative to achieve that climate commitment. The Gulf state has launched several measures over the past year - coinciding with 50 years since the country's founding - to attract investment and foreigners to help the economy recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The economic initiatives also come amid a growing economic rivalry with Gulf neighbour Saudi Arabia to be the region's trade and business hub. ""We are committed to seize the opportunity to cement our leadership on climate change within our region and take this key economic opportunity to drive development, growth and new jobs as we pivot our economy and nation to net zero,"" said Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates and ruler of Dubai. The UAE, an OPEC member, has in the past 15 years invested $40 billion in clean energy, the government said. Its first nuclear power plant, Barakah, has been connected to the national grid and the UAE aims to produce 14GW of clean energy by 2030, up from about 100MW in 2015, it said. No further details on the 600 billion dirhams of investment were given. The UAE will use the path to net zero as a way to create economic value, increase industrial competitiveness and enhance investment, said Sultan Al Jaber, minister of industry and advanced technology and special envoy for climate change. The UAE is bidding to host the COP28 global climate talks in 2023."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sustainability/us-states-push-surpass-world-emissions-norms-aviation-2225961,US states push to surpass world emissions norms on aviation,"WASHINGTON/MONTREAL: US President Joe Biden's administration should exceed global standards designed to curb emissions from flights, as pressure mounts to limit the sector's greenhouse gases, five states told the White House in a letter seen by Reuters. Major plane and engine makers joined airlines this week in committing to a non-binding net zero emissions target by 2050, but environmentalists say governments must step up regulatory efforts for such goals to be effective. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should apply global aircraft emissions standards to planes at domestic US airports, said a letter from the states seen by Reuters to White House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy, the EPA and the Federal Aviation Administration. The Biden administration did not immediately comment. The EPA should move ahead of the UN's aviation agency in approving standards to curb greenhouse gases and air pollution from new aircraft engines entering into service after 2030, said the letter from Illinois, Massachusetts, Oregon, California and Minnesota and International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT). The latest US policy ""favours aspirational goals and (sustainable aviation fuel) tax credits over legally binding GHG targets"", the letter said. Last month, the White House announced it was aiming for 20 per cent lower aviation emissions by 2030. But by seeking to go it alone on aviation standards, the US would diverge from the system of global standards developed through the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The UN agency sets global standards on everything from runway markings to crash investigations. ""The US should stop outsourcing aircraft emissions policy to ICAO,"" said the letter from the California Air Resource Board and attorneys' general from the other states. “Airlines have aspirations to zero out their greenhouse gas emissions, but the US doesn’t yet have policies to support that goal,"" said Andrei Kodjak, executive director of the Washington-based ICCT. ""It’s high time for the Biden administration to adopt standards to accelerate the development of low carbon aircraft and engines."" In its final days in office, the Trump administration finalized emissions standards for new airplanes that a dozen US states have challenged as too lenient. The states and ICCT propose EPA begin work to set new emissions rules for new aircraft engines entering into service in or after 2030."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sustainability/google-search-flights-hotel-carbon-emissions-sustainability-2225136,Google includes carbon emissions for flight search results as part of sustainability efforts,"SINGAPORE: Travellers using Google to search for flights will now be able to make their choices based not just on price and departure times, but also on the carbon footprint of each flight.  CO2 emissions will be in the search results on Google Flights, the tech giant announced on Wednesday (Oct 6) as part of a slew of sustainability initiatives. Flights will be labelled as higher, typical, lower or unknown emissions, with those with significantly lower emissions indicated by a green badge.  On its website, Google noted that carbon emission estimates are based on data provided by third parties, taking into account factors such as the distance to the destination as well as the aircraft model and configuration. ""These CO2 metrics are not just flight-specific, they're also seat-specific,"" said Google Commerce marketing director Stephanie Horton in a live-streamed presentation to the media. Business or first-class seats occupy more space and therefore make up a larger share of total emissions, said Ms Horton.  The new feature will allow travellers to make better-informed decisions, she added. In addition, those searching for accommodation will also be able to see if hotels have made ""meaningful commitments to sustainability"", such as whether they have made efforts towards reducing waste, improving energy efficiency and water conservation.  In the United States, the Silicon Valley-based firm is introducing ""eco-friendly routing"" to its Google Maps platform, allowing motorists to see not just the fastest route but also the most fuel-efficient one, based on information from the US National Renewable Energy Lab.  In a blog post, Sundar Pichar, the chief executive of Google and its parent company Alphabet, said the tech giant estimates this could reduce as much as one million tonnes of carbon emissions per year.  Google users in the US will also be able to view more cost-effective options for household appliances such as dishwashers and water heaters. There will be information related to electric vehicles as well - such as compatible charging stations nearby and typical charging times. This feature will be available in the US early next year, with plans to expand it globally in the future, said Google.  The company is also researching the use of artificial intelligence to optimise the efficiency of traffic lights at four locations in Israel, saying it has noted a 10 to 20 per cent reduction in fuel and intersection delay time in its trials.  It will soon conduct trials in Rio de Janeiro and is in discussions with other major cities around the world.  Google chief sustainability officer Kate Brandt noted that its data centres worldwide are now operating with 67 per cent locally-sourced carbon-free energy, up from 61 per cent two years ago.  Five data centres are now operating on 90 per cent carbon-free energy, she added.  This is in line with its goal to have its data centres operate entirely on carbon-free energy 2030.  ""In all these efforts, our goal is to make the sustainable choice an easier choice,"" said Mr Pichai ""At the individual level, these choices may seem small, but when people have the tools to make them at scale, they equal big improvements."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/can-singapore-become-hub-sustainable-cruise-ships-2184716,Can Singapore become a hub for sustainable cruise ships?,"SINGAPORE: Badly hit by the COVID-19 crisis, the cruise line industry is bracing for a comeback – but in a more environmentally sustainable way.  Prior to the pandemic, the global cruise sector was worth US$150 billion (S$200 billion), according to the Cruise Lines International Association. But as cruise traffic plunged, it estimated that the industry lost US$50 billion in six months between March and September 2020.  Singapore now accounts for one-third of the world’s cruises, the Singapore Tourism Board said in April, owing to the rising popularity of ""cruises to nowhere"" at a time of international travel restrictions. Under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, an environmental blueprint laying out green targets over the next decade, the country aims to become a sustainable tourism destination. But the popularity of cruises in Singapore – with 1.8 million passengers in 2019 – does not square with the country’s eco-friendly tourism ambitions.  A 2017 report by German environmental organisation Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union suggested that a single cruise ship uses as much as 150 tons of fuel a day, releasing as much particulate matter as 1 million cars.  And a 2014 study by non-governmental organisation Friends of the Earth estimated that the cruise industry was responsible for dumping more than 1 billion gallons of sewage annually.  Still, cruise line operators say they are making efforts to become more environmentally friendly.  Royal Caribbean, which has a fleet of 24 cruise ships, said its ships are built and retrofitted to improve energy efficiency and minimise their environmental footprint. Quantum of the Seas, which sails from Singapore and is able to carry almost 5,000 passengers, is Royal Caribbean's first ship with a “full air lubrication system”. The system boosts fuel efficiency by using air bubbles to reduce the resistance between the ship’s hull and the ocean.  “The new system, along with its newly designed podded propulsion system, bow thrusters and fin stabiliser pockets, helps reduce resistance to the hull, increasing its fuel efficiency,” said a spokesperson for the cruise operator.  About 60 per cent of Royal Caribbean's fleet is now equipped with “advanced emission purification” systems – commonly known as scrubbers – which treat exhaust gases by injecting water into the exhaust stream.  This removes approximately 98 per cent of sulfur dioxide emissions as well as between 60 and 80 per cent of particulate matter and “some” nitrogen oxides, Royal Caribbean said.  Princess Cruises, which operates a fleet of 14 vessels, said it has two new dual-fuel cruise ships being built that will be “powered primarily” by liquefied natural gas (LNG).  Dual-fuel vessels are able to run on either diesel or LNG.  Though it is also a fossil fuel, LNG has been touted as a cleaner alternative to traditional marine fuels as it emits less carbon dioxide and almost no particulate matter as well as nitrogen and sulphur oxides. “Since 2002, Princess has invested significant resources in new technology, equipment and training, and we’ve made tremendous progress in reducing emissions, fuel consumption, water and energy usage,” said a spokesperson for the cruise operator.  Genting Cruise Lines, which operates Dream Cruises, said it is committed to ""sound environment practices"". These include increasing energy efficiency, conserving fuel and water, protecting marine life and preventing oil pollution, the company said. “On Dream Cruises’ Genting Dream and World Dream, the exterior hull coating system incorporates the most advanced silicone-based paint to decrease drag in the water,” said Mr Michael Goh, president of Dream Cruises and head of international sales for Genting Cruise Lines.  Some of its ships also have an ""optimisation system"" that suggests the most fuel-efficient way of utilising the engines, including the effects of weather and sea currents, he said.  The company also follows the “highest marine industry standards” for waste management systems, he adds, noting scrubbers are also installed “in compliance with regulations”.  All three companies also noted their efforts in reducing waste, such as by minimising or eliminating single-use plastic items such as disposable cutlery, straws and shampoo bottles.  Royal Caribbean pointed to its 29-year-old Save the Waves programme, which aims to ensure that “almost everything is recycled”.  “We also repurpose or find other uses for 100 per cent of all cargo-associated and operational waste, and our wastewater purification levels on many of our ships exceed national and international standards,” said a Royal Caribbean spokesperson.  “In fact, while Singapore continues its journey to reduce landfill per capita by 20 per cent by 2026, Royal Caribbean has equipped all its ships to be landfill-free and has already diverted 85 per cent of its waste from landfills, ahead of its 2020 goal.” Yet these initiatives are not without their flaws. Environmental groups have criticised the use of certain types of scrubbers, which release pollutants back into the sea after turning the sulphur dioxide into sulphuric acid. Singapore’s Maritime and Port Authority has banned the use of such “open-loop” scrubbers within the country’s waters, and their residue is deemed toxic industrial waste.  Questions have also been raised about how clean LNG really is, with a study by the International Maritime Organization released last year finding a 150 per cent increase in methane emissions between 2012 and 2018, attributed to leaky engines on an increasing number of LNG-driven vessels.  Still, LNG remains the “most competitive option” for maritime vessels in terms of price and environmental impact, sustainability experts previously told CNA.  Ngee Ann Polytechnic senior lecturer Michael Chiam said making cruise ships more environmentally friendly could help attract tourists interested in eco-friendly holidays.  “When more people understand the effects of global warming and the importance of sustainability, they will make a conscious effort to switch to purchasing from companies that are more environmentally sustainable, and these include cruise companies,” said Dr Chiam.  Singapore could become a sustainable cruise hub and attract cruise liners from such environmentally minded companies, he added. “By collaborating with companies with the best sustainability practices, it provides us with an opportunity to learn and better position Singapore as a top sustainable destination.” Still, Dr Chiam notes Singapore may face competition from others in the region in this regard.  “The countries in the region – and their cruise ships that call at our port – are all at different levels of embracing sustainability and that could pose a challenge to Singapore,” he said.  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/asean-clean-energy-indonesia-thailand-vietnam-solar-wind-coal-fossil-fuel-2176221,Commentary: Why the shift to renewable energy in Southeast Asia is patchy,"SINGAPORE: Southeast Asia is one of the most vulnerable regions in the world to global climate change.  As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found in its latest report, Southeast Asia faces rising sea levels, heat waves, violent storms and reduced river flows due to reservoir construction and water extraction. Yet, the urgency displayed by national governments, both individually and collectively through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), lies in stark contrast to this emerging threat.  National plans to constrain the rise of carbon emissions from energy use lack ambition, and in some cases are not even treated as self-binding. The latest ASEAN Energy Outlook, produced by the ASEAN Centre for Energy in November 2020, projects that energy consumption in the region may double between now and 2040. This could involve a doubling of fossil fuel use unless radical action is taken. Just this week however, Malaysia's prime minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced plans for the country to “become a carbon neutral country by 2050 at the earliest.” Whilst the path to energy decarbonisation involves many different technologies, renewable energy has become one of the most important in recent years as costs have declined over the last decade – by 80 per cent for large-scale solar photovoltaic installations and 40 per cent for onshore wind farms.  However, many Southeast Asian countries have been slow to install new renewable energy capacity and are heavily reliant on fossil fuels. Coal and natural gas supply almost 75 per cent of the region’s electricity. Hydroelectricity accounts for another 20 per cent and other forms of renewable energy provide just 5 per cent. Since 2011, the installed capacity of hydroelectricity has risen by 70 per cent, mainly in the Mekong River Basin. However, future growth may be limited by factors such as the need to displace communities, the destruction of fisheries in the Mekong Delta and changing weather patterns. In contrast, other forms of renewable energy have great potential. Solar and wind energy are the most mature of these technologies. However, despite their sharp decline, costs remain higher in Southeast Asia than in many other regions due to constraints on project development, weak supply chains and project risks.  Geothermal energy technologies are mature, but costs vary greatly with location, even in areas of high potential such as Indonesia and the Philippines.  Bioenergy is another promising technology, given the ample supply of sustainable biomass such as crop residues in Southeast Asia. Thailand is the regional leader in biomass for electricity generation, whilst Indonesia leads the production of liquid biofuels.  All these forms of energy can provide off-grid solutions to islands and other remote communities. Given the availability of these renewable energy resources across Southeast Asia, the installed capacity of non-hydro renewable electricity generation in the region has risen nearly five-fold since 2011. Yet, more than 50 per cent of this growth has been in Vietnam, mainly in solar, and another 25 per cent in Thailand, in solar and bioenergy, due to their respective governments’ concerted efforts at developing renewable energy. The other eight Member States have done relatively little. To understand why, we need to look first at the variation of availability of renewable energy resources across the region. Whilst Southeast Asia has a relatively hot climate for much or all of the year, the intensity of solar radiation does not match that of the deserts of the Middle East, North Africa or western China. In general, the solar energy potential of the region is similar to parts of southern Europe, such as Italy and southern France, but much better than in Germany, a country with a lot of installed solar power. Solar accounts for about 60 per cent of Southeast Asia’s installed capacity of non-hydro renewable electricity, but the areas that receive the strongest solar intensity are concentrated in the Mekong region: Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, and southern Vietnam.  Until it was recently overtaken by Vietnam, Thailand hosted the largest installed capacity of solar power in the region. By the end of 2020, Vietnam had 16,000 MW of installed solar capacity, dwarfing that of Thailand at 3,000 MW. But solar energy only makes up a fraction of these countries’ energy mix: Solar photovoltaics contributed only 4 per cent of electricity generation in Vietnam and 2.6 per cent in Thailand. Tropical and equatorial regions across the world tend to have relatively low potential for wind energy on land. As a result, wind energy provides relatively little electricity in Southeast Asia. Most of this is in Thailand and, to a lesser extent, in Vietnam and the Philippines. However, the future lies offshore. Coastal areas of the South China Sea, areas off Vietnam, the Philippines and eastern Malaysia, have potential equivalent to that in parts of northern China, where wind is a major source of energy. The potential for geothermal energy is greatest where there are volcanoes, in the Philippines and Indonesia. Bioenergy is playing a significant role in electricity generation, especially in Thailand, but also in Indonesia and Malaysia.  While most Southeast Asian countries have the potential to develop one or more sources of non-hydro renewable energy, besides Vietnam and Thailand, many have failed to put in place stable policies to encourage investment by private actors. Where such policies are in place, detailed regulations and rules are absent or weakly implemented. Neither have governments obliged their state-owned power companies to invest in renewable energy capacity. Instead, they have continued to subsidise the construction of power generating capacity based on fossil fuels. This preference arises from the longstanding role of fossil fuels in the economy and the resultant powerful industrial interest groups.  Indonesia, for example, is rich in coal, oil and gas. Companies active in these industries are deeply invested, financially and politically, in mining, burning and exporting these resources. Moreover, coal is still seen as being cheaper than renewable energy, despite the sharp cost declines of the latter. Building a political consensus to promote renewable energy faces strong opposition. In contrast, the development of renewable energy is an attractive option for countries that lack abundant fossil fuel resources, such as Thailand and Vietnam.  Unless investment in renewable energy is accelerated, individual ASEAN Member States may fail to meet their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions to constrain rising carbon emissions. In addition, ASEAN as a group will fail to reach its short-term target of having renewable energy, including hydroelectricity, account for 23 per cent of primary energy consumption by 2025. The main economic risk of delaying investment in renewable energy is that the ongoing investments in fossil fuel generating capacity will become “stranded” and the investment capital wasted as the cost of renewable energy continues to decline. The environmental cost of inaction is two-fold. First, the region’s contribution to greenhouse gas emissions will continue to rise. Second, local air pollution from fossil fuel combustion will intensify. Though critical to the low-carbon transition, enhanced investment in renewable energy by itself will not be sufficient. Robust and flexible grid systems backed by energy storage are needed to balance intermittent renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. A regional power transmission grid with a supporting trading system could move clean energy from areas of surplus, such as Laos, to areas of deficit, such as Malaysia and Singapore. In a few years, solar power from Australia may add to supplies in Southeast Asia. In the longer-term, carbon capture and nuclear power may also start to make a significant contribution to the region’s decarbonisation. The final, and arguably, most potent tool is energy efficiency and conservation. Philip Andrews-Speed is Senior Principal Fellow at the Energy Studies Institute, National University of Singapore."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/enterprise-sustainability-programme-help-singapore-businesses-tap-green-economy-2214601,"New S$180 million scheme to help at least 6,000 Singapore firms tap green economy opportunities","SINGAPORE: A new programme to help local businesses build up capabilities in the area of sustainability and seize opportunities in the green economy was launched on Friday (Oct 1). Enterprise Singapore will set aside up to S$180 million for the Enterprise Sustainability Programme, which was first announced in Budget 2021. At least 6,000 firms are set to benefit from the new initiative over the next four years. Announcing the launch on Friday, Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong said concerns about climate change have driven governments, corporates and consumers to place a greater emphasis on reducing carbon footprint and establishing more sustainable practices. Singapore has since announced the Singapore Green Plan 2030, a national roadmap to ensure Singapore remains a green and liveable home, and tap sustainability as a new avenue of growth. Mr Gan noted that more companies are now keen to incorporate sustainability into their business strategy and practices. “Enterprise Singapore has seen companies ranging from the maritime to lifestyle and services sectors, looking for support to embark on various sustainability efforts,” he told reporters at an online press conference. “Indeed, more can be done to build up and strengthen Singapore’s sustainability ecosystem. In particular, we need to help enterprises to build knowledge and capabilities in sustainability.” In this area, the new Enterprise Sustainability Programme will provide support for companies at different stages of the sustainability journey. For those that are just starting out, there will be subsidised training workshops to help them build awareness and basic knowledge, access relevant tools and resources, as well as develop a capability building plan for the long run. Enterprise Singapore will work with partners, such as PwC Singapore and the Singapore Environment Council, to develop these workshops which are expected to start from the first quarter of next year, said Mr Gan. For firms that wish to go further, the new scheme will support projects in strategy development, resource optimisation and standards adoption. Enterprises will also get help in developing innovative sustainable products, as well as services and solutions to capture opportunities in the green economy. On a sectoral level, there will be “customised approaches” under the new Enterprise Sustainability Programme to help each sector with their unique needs. Mr Gan said Enterprise Singapore will be joining hands with the Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs), such as the Singapore Furniture Industry Council and the Singapore Contractors Association. The Singapore Business Federation is also looking to facilitate cross-sector collaboration with Enterprise Singapore. “I encourage companies who are interested in exploring sustainability initiatives to work closely with their TACs,” he added. Lastly, the new programme aims to create “a vibrant and conducive” sustainability ecosystem, the minister said. A new Enterprise Financing Scheme - Green will be launched to improve access to green financing and more details will be announced soon. Enterprise Singapore will also work with the Singapore Standards Council and Singapore Accreditation Council to develop green standards and accreditation programmes in areas such as low carbon technologies and sustainable food production. Separately, the Enterprise Development Grant, which offsets costs for projects that help businesses grow and transform by up to 80 per cent, will also be enhanced to support new areas in sustainability, Enterprise Singapore said in a press release. Speaking at the same virtual press conference, Minister of State for Trade and Industry Low Yen Ling said authorities recognise that firms already face intense pressure from the COVID-19 pandemic. “Pressure in terms of growing their top line and bottom line. In some sectors, they could be facing some rising costs due to supply chain issues … so we want to support our local companies as they come on board the sustainability journey.” Being sustainable can give companies a competitive advantage, said Ms Low, while pointing to studies that showed such enterprises benefiting in “very tangible ways” like improved reputation, better sales and profitability, as well as better employee engagement. “Many of our local companies serve many big global players, especially in developed markets like US and Europe,” added Ms Low. “Increasingly, such global players in the developed economies will impose sustainability requirements so being sustainable will provide our local companies with the competitive edge … to capture new consumers and markets not just locally, but also globally.” The push towards sustainability will also create new job opportunities for Singaporeans, she said. Home-grown furniture maker Koda is an early-mover when it comes to incorporating sustainability into its business, noted Ms Low who visited the company on Friday morning. Koda purchases its materials from sustainable sources to ensure that its furniture has the least negative impact on the environment. It also uses green packaging by replacing foam with cardboard, and adopts the approach of reduce, reuse and recycling of waste generated in its factories. The company’s sustainability efforts, which started around a decade ago, have been “market and consumer-driven”, said executive director Ernie Koh. Certain markets that the company exports its furniture to, such as the US and Europe, have sustainability-related regulatory policies and consumers that are “more savvy”, he added. “So when we sell to them, they need us to accommodate to what they need. It is demand-driven. As a result, it makes sense for us to embrace sustainability as part of our business. Koda plans to do more, such as using solar panels to harvest electricity for its factories and adopt Industry 4.0 for a more sustainable manufacturing process. “At the moment, we use material as one of our sustainability (efforts) but eventually we will have to (concentrate) on our processes … The value chain becomes very important,” Mr Koh told CNA. “We not only concentrate on what we do, but we concentrate on our partners, be it material suppliers and sub-contractors … (when) the entire ecosystem and value chain is involved, then the dynamics of sustainability will be achieved.” Mr Koh said the new Government initiative will be useful in promoting the local ecosystem and more importantly, generate consumer awareness. “In the context of Singapore, I think today’s sustainable journey is still not consumer-led. We need a little bit of legislation from the Government (and) we need a lot of education (for consumers) with regards to this sustainability topic,” he added. “We want SMEs to embrace (sustainability) and the only way to do so is to get market awareness up. The Enterprise Sustainability Programme will create this environment to be able to create a demand.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/indonesia-oil-palm-moratorium-expires-environmentalists-extension-2210471,Scrapping oil palm moratorium raises doubt over Indonesia's green commitments: Environmentalists,"JAKARTA: Indonesia’s moratorium on new permits for palm plantations ended on Sep 19 and the government has yet to make an announcement on whether it would be extended.  The three-year moratorium came into effect in September 2018, two years after President Joko Widodo pledged to halt the issuance of new permits following forest fires in 2015 that burned 2.6 million ha of land.   For decades, Indonesia has suffered from forest and land fires which have claimed lives, damaged people’s health and led to economic loss as well as transboundary haze affecting neighbouring countries such as Singapore and Malaysia.  Exacerbated by dry weather, the seasonal fires on the country’s tropical rainforests and peatlands are mostly caused by the practice to clear forests cheaply in order to make way for plantations in particular oil palm and timber. Palm oil, widely used as a cooking oil, is a common ingredient in food and personal care products. It is also used to produce biofuel.  Environmentalists were hoping for an extension of the moratorium as they believed it has helped to stop deforestation in Indonesia.  They also believed that the absence of a moratorium could raise questions about Indonesia’s commitment to combat climate change and tarnish its reputation internationally.  Indonesia is the world’s biggest palm oil producer and when Mr Widodo declared in 2016 to halt the issuance of new permits for oil palm plantations during an event to commemorate World Forest Day, he believed the existing plantations were sufficient. Jokowi, as the president is popularly known, said at that time that the production capacity could be increased by maximising the existing plantations.  He added that Indonesia is known as a country rich in biodiversity and as the lungs of the world, it is important to preserve its nature since the world depends on it.  While the moratorium’s bigger aim is to stop deforestation, it is specifically targeted to improve governance of sustainable palm plantation, provide legal certainty and protect environmental preservation.   Mr Adrianus Eryan, head of forest and land division of the Indonesian Centre for Environmental Law (ICEL), said the moratorium covered three main points namely data consolidation, reviewing permits and increasing oil palm productivity.  He said that for the last three years, the government has managed to consolidate data and concluded that the total area of oil palm plantations is about 16.8 million ha, around 3.47 million ha of which have been cultivated inside forest areas.   “That 3.4 million ha is problematic because by law it cannot be in the forest, it must have a permit to ‘release’ forest areas,” he said, referring to a permit that allows a forest area to be converted for non-forestry uses.  “The moratorium has postponed the permit issuance so that the government has enough time to evaluate it,” said Mr Eryan.  However, he claimed that there has been no official information on permit reviews and what officials have achieved to increase oil palm productivity.  He noted though that some local governments such as in West Papua have taken the initiative to do their own evaluation and revoke permits. Since the moratorium has not fully accomplished what it set out to do, Mr Eryan said it should be extended as it prevents deforestation.  “Even though it only withholds or delays granting permits, it means that the forests cannot be encroached and they will remain intact.  “It (the moratorium) has an impact because the regulations are targeted.” Mr Eryan pointed out that the government said that deforestation has decreased from about 460,000 ha in 2019 to 115,000 ha in 2020, a drop of 75 per cent, and it admitted that the moratorium is an effective instrument to reduce emission.  “This is one of the reasons why the presidential instruction should be maintained,” he added.  Not extending the moratorium would also lead to a loss of state revenue, said Mr Trias Fetra, programme officer of palm oil governance at non-governmental organisation (NGO) Madani Berkelanjutan, which focuses on forest and land sustainability. He claimed that some palm oil companies have already started planting illegally. Based on his calculation in two provinces that are central to palm oil, namely Riau and West Kalimantan, the state could lose an income of 191 billion rupiah (US$13.3 billion) and 660 billion rupiah respectively. Greenpeace Southeast Asia’s global head of forest campaign Kiki Taufik has similar views and added that in the absence of the moratorium, the controversial Job Creation Law which was passed last year would be used to resolve problems with oil palm plantations inside forest areas.  The Job Creation Law, also known as the Omnibus Law, would pave the way for parties that have been in forest areas prior to the enforcement of the oil palm moratorium in 2018 to be given an amnesty.  “And this is what we (environmentalists) are concerned about because the moratorium was positive. For example, it was found that about 500,000 ha of plantations had problems with their licences,” Mr Taufik told CNA. This raises the question of how serious the authorities are in tackling climate change, said Mr Taufik.  “If the government has big ambitions to tackle climate change, its commitment to the Paris Agreement, they should have continued the moratorium because the implementation of it is not fully done yet,” he said. Indonesia has ratified the Paris Agreement and targets to reduce 29 per cent of its carbon emission by 2030 or 41 per cent with international support.  It also aims to limit annual deforestation to 325,000 ha and 450,000 ha between 2020 and 2030. The government has also pledged to achieve net zero emissions by 2060. “The moratorium is the main way for the improvement of the palm oil industry,” said Mr Taufik. “It ensures that forests in Indonesia are not arbitrarily converted without heeding climate commitments.”  Professor Bambang Hero Saharjo, a forest protection lecturer at IPB University, an agricultural university in Bogor, said he was a bit shocked that the moratorium has ended since it helped in reducing deforestation.  “The oil palm moratorium is actually not only preventing excessive and inappropriate oil palm expansion, but it also shows our commitment to the outside world how we protect the remaining forests from the possible threat of illegal oil palm expansion.  “The public also knows that currently millions of hectares of oil palm are in forest areas and various parties are trying to legalise it with various options and statements such as stating that the forest has no economic value so it does not need to be maintained,” said the professor who has for numerous times been an expert witness in environmental crime cases.  He also opined it is unfortunate that the REDD+ deal has ended but he applauded the government’s move to end the cooperation with Norway if promises have not been kept. REDD+ refers to the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation scheme, a deal between Indonesia and Norway to reduce carbon emissions from deforestation.  When announcing the end of the 11-year partnership, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had cited lack of payment as the reason but asserted that it would remain committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.   “I'm sure the government must have a plan so that it dares to take these two actions because it is closely related to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 29 per cent by 2030,” he said. Mr Ruandha Agung Sugardiman, the director general of forestry planning and environmental management with the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, said on Sep 24 that Indonesia would not approve new permits even after the oil palm moratorium ended. “Even without (the moratorium), the policy laid down by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry is to continue the ban on new permits for clearing forest for oil palm plantations,” he said during an online press conference. Speaking virtually at the United Nations General Assembly last week, Mr Widodo also stressed that a “green and sustainable economy” would be prioritised due to Indonesia’s strategic place on climate change. He said Indonesia has succeeded in reducing forest fires by 82 per cent last year, compared to the previous year.  “Deforestation rates have dropped significantly, the lowest in 20 years,” he said.  Meanwhile, head of the Indonesian Palm Oil Farmers Association Gulat Manurung said that what is most important now is to increase productivity and the moratorium has helped to maintain the price of crude palm oil, so it is still needed. Despite the current uncertainties, Prof Saharjo opined that everyone plays a role in mitigating deforestation.  “Efforts to reduce the rate of deforestation are actually the responsibility of all of us and not solely the government.” CNA has approached the environment ministry and the presidential spokesperson for comments on whether the moratorium would be renewed."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sustainability/spider-researcher-edible-garden-city-among-5-winners-presidents-award-environment-2210121,"Spider researcher, Edible Garden City among 5 winners of President’s Award for the Environment","SINGAPORE: A researcher who has spent decades studying spiders, as well as urban farming group Edible Garden City, are among five recipients of the President’s Award for the Environment.  Presented by President Halimah Yacob at the Istana on Wednesday (Sep 29), the biennial award is Singapore’s top accolade for individuals, organisations and educational institutions that have made significant contributions towards environmental sustainability in the country. The other three recipients this year are Nanyang Girls’ High School, DBS Bank and PSA Corporation. They were chosen from 69 nominations in three categories, said the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) said in a media release.  “These five environmental champions are inspiring examples of how Singaporeans can contribute to sustainable development and help promote good environmental practices both within and beyond their organisations,” said MSE. Mr Joseph K H Koh was recognised in the individual category for his contributions to Singapore’s biodiversity programmes. Trained in zoology, he has spent decades studying spiders and made important contributions to the knowledge of Singapore and Borneo spiders, said MSE. “Together with a team of budding arachnologists that he has nurtured, Mr Koh has recorded more than 800 species of spiders in Singapore,” it added. He has also pledged his collection of more than 12,000 specimens to the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum.  Mr Koh also contributed to the Comprehensive Biodiversity Survey of the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve from 2014 to 2018 and is chairman of the Friends of Bukit Timah Forest community group.  MSE noted that the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)-Singapore, under Mr Koh’s leadership, worked on several projects with the National Parks Board to combat illegal wildlife trade and garner support for NParks’ species recovery programme. “He has also made significant contributions in various dialogues between the government and the community on issues related to environmental conservation, and continues to play an active leadership role in rallying community support to transform Singapore from a little red dot into a bright green spark,” said the ministry. Edible Garden City, one of Singapore’s pioneers for urban farming, has been an advocate for local produce and greening of underutlised spaces. “To date, Edible Garden City has groomed 80 urban farmers, contributed to academic publications and successfully cultivated new plant variants that are supplied to local restaurants and consumers,” the ministry added.  As part of the Grow Your Own Food movement since 2012, Edible Garden City has created 260 food gardens out of underutilised spaces.  Mr Bjorn Low, co-founder and executive director of Edible Garden City, said winning the award “encourages us to look into the future”.  “There's a long road ahead for food resilience, and we want to grow this movement together with the different communities in Singapore,” he added.  Edible Garden City will also represent Singapore at the upcoming Dubai World Expo. It has been invited to showcase its closed loop farm solution under the Expo Global Best Practice initiative, which highlights projects that have provided impactful and sustainable interventions that can be scaled up and replicated in other parts of the world.  Nanyang Girls’ High School, a recipient in the educational institutions category, “has actively encouraged its students to embrace sustainable living”, MSE said.  “The school has an environmental education council in which the teachers work together to incorporate environmental education in the curriculum and other areas where possible,” it added. Principal Ng Chuen-Yin said she hopes students can serve as “agents of change” in promoting sustainable practices.  “Climate change is a very urgent issue which affects all of us. Thus, protecting the environment is everyone's responsibility,” she said. “Apart from integrating environmental education into our curriculum, we focus on building a school culture which focuses on reducing waste and encouraging recycling.” As for DBS Bank, it has “demonstrated leadership” in the sustainable finance sector, MSE said.  The bank has committed to progressively phase out funding for sectors that are carbon-intensive and is actively pursuing financing opportunities in the sustainable and renewable energy sectors, the ministry added.  The fifth recipient, PSA Corporation, “has made significant efforts to reduce carbon emissions in its operations, improve energy management and contribute to the maritime industry’s decarbonisation efforts”, MSE said.  It noted that the company has invested in innovation. Projects include developing an AI-based smart grid management system and a battery energy storage system to optimise energy use. Congratulating the winners, President Halimah said: “It is encouraging to see the passion and commitment from various facets of our community protecting and conserving our natural and living environment.  “With their efforts, we are taking steps forward in Singapore’s journey in sustainable development. Everyone has a part to play as we tackle the growing threat of climate change, and I hope more individuals and organisations will be inspired by the winners to also contribute towards a more sustainable and climate-resilient Singapore for future generations.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mandai-carbon-neutral-precinct-solar-panels-zoo-safari-2209341,Mandai set to become first carbon-neutral precinct in Singapore by 2024,"SINGAPORE: Mandai Park Holdings on Wednesday (Sep 29) announced its commitment for Mandai to be carbon neutral by 2024, through a comprehensive sustainability strategy for the area. That would make Mandai – home to the Singapore Zoo, River Safari and Night Safari – the ""first precinct in Singapore to be carbon neutral"", the group said. The company has set itself an ""aggressive target"" to achieve carbon neutrality, paving the way for it to reach net-zero emissions sooner, said Mandai Park Holdings group CEO Mike Barclay. ""As an organisation that is deeply involved in wildlife conservation efforts, we see first-hand how human-induced climate change is directly contributing to biodiversity loss,"" said Mr Barclay. ""It is our responsibility to ensure we optimise our operations, in line with our commitment to adopt and showcase sustainable best practices,"" he added. The strategy will focus on reducing consumption of energy and water, maximising opportunities to generate renewable energy, and exploring ways to reduce, recycle and upcycle waste, he said. ""We also seek to drive behavioural change by integrating messaging on living sustainably into our education and outreach programmes,"" he said. Mandai Park Holdings drives the precinct's rejuvenation through its Mandai Park Development arm and also oversees Wildlife Reserves Singapore, which operates the Singapore Zoo, River Safari, Night Safari and Jurong Bird Park. The group has pledged to get 100 per cent of its energy from renewable sources by 2030, noting that electricity use accounts for more than half its carbon emissions profile. As part of this push, it will implement on-site solar panels at ""all available and permissible"" rooftops across new and existing parks in phases. It will start with the roof of a newly constructed animal quarantine building this year, by installing a system that consists of 77 solar panel modules that will generate about 50 megawatt hours (MWh) of energy annually. The next installation will be at an existing multi-storey carpark in October, with 694 solar panel modules able to generate about 450MWh of energy a year. The group said its carbon strategy focuses on developing a carbon accounting framework, reducing emissions by optimising operations and upgrading infrastructure, and maximising renewable resources while investing in nature-based solutions for carbon reduction. The carbon accounting framework involves a quarterly review of its carbon inventory and footprint, helping it to locate hotspots in its operations and set reasonable targets, said the company. The developer has identified improving energy efficiency and diversifying renewable energy sources as priorities. In addition to the renewable energy target, Mandai Park Holdings is aiming for a 1 per cent year-on-year reduction in energy use for its existing parks from 2021, and is developing energy-efficient operations to this end. Energy efficiency measures are being implemented, such as the installation of an energy monitoring system and motion sensors in its zoological parks. The company is also upgrading ageing infrastructure, such as pump systems in the River Safari's manatee exhibit and the Singapore Zoo's Primate Kingdom, to more energy-efficient alternatives. These initiatives are expected to save about 712 MWh of energy a year, equivalent to the energy needed to power about 165 four-room flats annually, said Mandai Park Holdings. New developments under the Mandai Rejuvenation Project are also getting energy-efficient technology and infrastructure to achieve a site-wide target of cutting more than 20 per cent in energy consumption, the company said. The rejuvenation project will see the relocation of Jurong Bird Park and the development of a new Rainforest Park in the area. Mandai Wildlife Bridge, the first feature to be completed under the project, opened in end-2019. An eco-resort is also slated to open in Mandai in 2023. To minimise the carbon emissions that would come from clearing trees in a ""typical"" development project, Mandai Park Holdings said it pursues a strategy of retaining, repurposing and recycling local flora. Trees, saplings and shrubs are retained or transplanted where possible, it said. ""When trees have to be felled as part of the development work, suitable materials are repurposed for habitat enhancement,"" said the group. It cited the decomposing logs and root balls salvaged for use on the Mandai Wildlife Bridge and in the project's buffer zones. Felled tree materials are also recycled for use in animal exhibits, for landscaping and for making furniture and retail items. An additional 15,000 new trees will also be planted across the project, said Mandai Park Holdings. To offset last-mile emissions that cannot be reduced completely, the group said it is working with Mandai Nature – its conservation arm and a non-governmental organisation – to explore generating carbon credits from nature conservation projects it supports in the region. ""Benchmarked against rigorous industry standards, the Mandai Environmental Sustainability Strategy will be driven by four strategic thrusts: Resource optimisation, biodiversity protection and conservation, integration with surroundings, and sustainability advocacy,"" said Mandai Park Holdings. More details on the sustainability strategy will be released later this year, it added."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/advertorial/saving-world-one-bite-time-going-green-your-diet-2181701,Saving the world one bite at a time: Going green with your diet,"Singaporeans love to eat, and so the word diet may ruffle some feathers, but there are types of eating habits that are less about losing weight and more about reducing one’s carbon footprint. Adopting a pescatarian, vegetarian or vegan diet has a tremendous impact on sustainability, primarily because farming fish and seafood is more land-efficient and lessens use of precious resources.  But even if you’re not a full convert, there are plenty of ways you can attempt a greener diet. RETHINKING THE FOOD CHAIN Existing farming systems have proven to be resource guzzlers, with rampant over-farming and unchecked demand turning it into the antithesis of what it once was. The agriculture industry is tipped to contribute up to 70 per cent of the world’s emissions by 2050. Industrial livestock farming, in particular, has made a bigger impact with issues from heat-trapping gases 80 times that of carbon dioxide emitted from methane-producing cows, to heavy water consumption for rearing poultry. It also turns out to be an immensely inefficient use of land, and turns fertile land useless for future farming, costing environmental damage of up to US$3 trillion (S$4.04 trillion) every year. While far from a solution, adopting a “leafier” diet can help to alleviate the impact that the farming industry has on the environment. Plant agriculture is far more efficient and feeds more, and uses less land and water while emitting less pollution.  It’s also healthier for you. Harvard’s School of Public Health states that “a diet rich in vegetables and fruits can lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke, prevent some types of cancer, lower risk of eye and digestive problems, and have a positive effect upon blood sugar, which can reduce appetite”.  But adopting such a diet need not be an all or nothing effort. If you're interested in making a change, start with a flexitarian diet by reducing meats such as red meat and poultry, and taking only fish, before giving a completely plant-based diet a try. With our diets amounting to 40 per cent of our carbon footprint, every little bit matters.  If you’re looking for a place to start, Farmz has detox juices, breads, soups and sauces to kickstart your journey, and with the promo code HSBCFARMZ10, enjoy 10 per cent off its juice collection and free delivery with orders from S$80 onwards.
  LEVEL UP YOUR PLATE If you think a sustainable diet is boring, think again. Changing this mindset is One Planet Plate – an association that’s championing mindful produce decisions with its resources and delicious recipes. And yes, sustainable meat options are available too. Because it makes sense to cultivate better food habits at its root, making small conscious decisions from the kitchen can have a big impact. For example, buying from locally-farmed produce cuts back extensively on carbon footprint from imports, and in Singapore, one can find them conveniently labelled with a red SG Fresh sticker at major supermarkets. Food wastage is also a huge problem here. 665,000 tonnes of food waste was generated in 2020, accounting for 11 per cent of the waste stream. Other than heading out less for buffets, one can also include “ugly produce”. With hypermarts, visual merchandising glorifies unblemished produce, which is why businesses like Ugly Food is reclaiming the idea that fruits and vegetables with some marks are just as safe – and sometimes even tastier – to eat.

A BETTER GROCER If you’re inspired to go even further, delve a little more into the supply chain itself. Sasha's Fine Foods makes it easy to shop ethically. The brand is the purveyor of produce by growers who are mindful of their environmental impact. “I started this business because I found it very difficult to buy food staples I could trust,” explained Ms Sasha Conlan, founder and director of the grocer. “From day one, I made the decision that I would only sell products from suppliers I have personally met and vetted, and who share my vision to provide customers with the purest food on the planet. In the past 10 years, we’ve grown to working with over 50 producers and suppliers I trust, people who do the right thing and have a genuine care for the animals and the environment.” The company is Singapore’s first online grocer to have a carbon-neutral delivery fleet. Currently, it has also reduced 88 per cent of its carbon emissions from New Zealand shipments that are transported via sea freight. As an advocate for environmental issues, the company has also recently joined Singapore’s F&B Sustainability Council, an organisation of like-minded F&B players dedicated to tackling environmental issues in the industry.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/ship-carbon-emissions-net-zero-fuel-un-imo-2199146,Commentary: Ships are sailing into climate catastrophe. Here’s how they can change course,"MANCHESTER, England: In the middle of this summer’s shocking fires and floods came the grimmest climate science report yet from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, warning of a “code red for humanity” as our use of fossil fuels continues to drive up global temperatures. To keep below the threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming – the goal of the Paris climate agreement – immediate reductions in carbon emissions are needed. One of the sectors doing the most damage is international shipping, the emissions of which are almost equivalent to those of an industrial country like Germany. The International Maritime Organization (IMO), the UN shipping regulator, has put issues surrounding shipping and climate change high on its agenda. Shipping emissions can be calculated using four principal factors: The weight of products transported, the distance they’re sent, the amount of fuel it takes to move one tonne of products one kilometre, and the amount of carbon released by making and using that fuel – known as the fuel’s carbon-intensity. The overwhelming focus of political attention is mainly on that last point – which fuel is used, and how carbon intensive it is. But it will be beyond 2030 before low-carbon fuels, like hydrogen or ammonia, grow past a single-digit percentage of all shipping fuel used. This is a problem: If we are to meet the Paris Climate Agreement goals, emissions need to see dramatic reductions in the short term. That means we need to think about the wide range of other ways to cut shipping emissions in the coming decade. Here are a few areas to look at: In a world of finite resources, we need to think critically about consuming less – for example, whether we need to import containers of garden gnomes from China to the UK, or whether high street clothes retailers should continue to prioritise fast fashion models where clothes are shipped halfway around the world yet only designed to last for several uses. It’s possible that long distance transport might become less necessary in the future, as the rise of 3D printing could see goods printed locally and on demand. The new generation of shipping fuels could also be produced nearer to where they’re needed, so they only have to be transported by ship over hundreds, rather than thousands of miles. The faster ships move, the more energy they need. The bottom line is that going slower is one of the most effective and immediate ways to cut ships’ fuel use. This can happen naturally due to high fuel prices, but locking in these benefits needs action from the IMO, such as regulation on ship speed limits. There are multiple ways to retrofit ships so they use less fuel, like adding protruding “bulbous bows” to reduce resistance from waves and upgrading ship propellers and hulls to improve fuel efficiency. Spinning cylinders called Flettner rotors and huge kite sails are just two technologies that harness the power of the wind to help propel vessels. This can cut fuel consumption by 10 per cent. Coupling this with computer programs that model wind speed and direction allows ships to optimise their routes, saving ships a further 10 per cent of fuel. Ships can use less fuel when in port by switching off their engines and connecting to local electricity grids instead. This technique, which also reduces air pollution in coastal cities, is called “shore-power”.  Norway, the USA and China lead in implementing shore-power thanks to government support, but it’s less common in the UK – solutions to this are set out in this Tyndall Manchester research paper. Many alternative fuels produce low levels of carbon dioxide when burned. But the emissions arising from their production need to be properly accounted for, or we’ll just be shifting pollution from one source to another. Hydrogen can, for example, be produced in different ways that lead to very high or very low carbon emissions. Attempts to cut carbon in the shipping industry tend to flounder because standard marine fuels like diesel are globally untaxed and therefore cheap. It’s time for the IMO to levy charges on carbon pollution, to allow alternative fuels to compete with traditional carbon-based ones. Revenues from this can fund research and development into new fuels, and support developing nations to decarbonise their shipping sectors. The UK could prioritise building zero-emission vessels in its forthcoming National Shipbuilding Strategy, and run more innovative contests like the already oversubscribed Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition to provide greater support for greener shipping tech. All of the above methods need to operate within a clear framework for reducing overall shipping emissions if the sector is to play its part in meeting the goals of the Paris climate agreement. The IMO needs to commit to more stringent climate targets to deliver major reductions in the coming decades. In shipping, as in every sector, we need to use every way we can to cut emissions as fast as possible. Simon Bullock is a PhD candidate in Shipping and Climate Change at the University of Manchester.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/indonesia-retno-marsudi-covc-19-covax-vaccine-inequality-2199421,‘Very wide’ vaccine inequality gap between developed and developing nations must be narrowed: Retno Marsudi,"JAKARTA: Indonesia’s Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said on Friday (Sep 24) that the “very wide” COVID-19 vaccine inequality gap between developed and developing countries has been a common topic at the 76th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York this week. “Essentially, the vaccine inequality between developed and developing countries is very big, very wide. Therefore, this gap must be narrowed,” she told CNA in an exclusive interview at the sidelines of the UNGA. “First of all, the problem is there are not enough vaccines. They are also not evenly distributed. ""Therefore, we ask developed countries that have a lot of vaccines or more than needed to share them.” According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 6 billion COVID-19 vaccines have been administered worldwide but 80 per cent of them are in developed countries, the minister noted. Thus, developed countries could share their supply through bilateral mechanisms or via the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility which is a programme aiming to share vaccines among countries, she added. Mdm Marsudi, who is also one of the co-chairs of the COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC) Engagement Group (EG), said that the initial target was to distribute 2 billion vaccines by the end of this year. “Due to several obstacles such as restrictions, export ban … COVAX facility can only secure 1.4 billion (doses) by the end of this year.  “So this means, there is a 30 per cent gap from its target. Therefore, to countries that have excess vaccines, we really hope they share them,” she said. Indonesia’s top diplomat also said the Southeast Asia nation, where 47 million of its people have been fully vaccinated out of its 270 million population, is co-sponsoring in the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) waiver related to vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics purposes. The agreement plays an important role in facilitating trade in knowledge and creativity and resolving trade disputes over intellectual property. This is in line with Indonesia’s priority to focus on inclusiveness and sustainability when it assumes the G20 presidency for a year starting Dec 1, as announced by President Joko Widodo during his speech at UNGA early Thursday. In his speech, Mr Widodo also mentioned that global economic recovery can only be attained if the pandemic is under control and countries join hands in helping one another. He also said that Indonesia is committed to climate resilience, low carbon development and green technology. He also expressed concern over the political crisis in Myanmar and the marginalisation of women and violence in Afghanistan, among other issues.  Commenting on the situation in Afghanistan, Mdm Marsudi who met with Taliban representatives in Doha last month, said that Indonesia will continue to monitor the situation there. “Of course for the Taliban, they understand very well what the world wants, what the world expects,” she said on Friday.  “Actually if we look at the statements of the Taliban so far, sentences regarding the issues of inclusive governance, not making Afghanistan a breeding and training ground for terrorists, and also respecting women's rights, these are actually the words the Taliban had said a while ago.” She added: “This is actually what we are waiting for when these commitments will be implemented.” The minister said that for the moment, “what is important is to put humanitarian aid forward because the humanitarian crisis cannot wait, while from a political perspective we will see how far the Taliban will fulfil the commitments they have conveyed to the world”. Asked when the leaders’ retreat between Singapore and Indonesia is expected to take place, Mdm Marsudi said the matter is still being discussed. In March, it was announced that both leaders will meet in person later this year, with Bintan being a possible venue for the event. Mdm Marsudi said: “At that time, we talked about mid-year plans. Then Indonesia experienced an extremely high increase in (COVID-19) cases in July and we closed all of our borders. I think it is not good in the midst of such a situation to continue the meeting.” “So my conversation with Singapore's foreign minister is, we continue to prepare while looking at the pandemic situation.” She noted that Indonesia is currently experiencing a decrease in COVID-19 cases with a positivity rate of less than 5 per cent. However, Singapore is now seeing a spike in infections.  “That's the world we have to face right now. At one point, a country is seeing a decline (in cases). On the other end, other countries are seeing a rise.  “So we continue to make preparations, but everything will really depend on the COVID-19 situation,” she said. “But that doesn't mean our cooperation with Singapore will stop if there is no Leaders' Retreat Meeting.” The last time the leaders of the two countries met for the annual meeting was two years ago in Singapore before COVID-19 disrupted plans. Last year, Indonesia was supposed to host the retreat but it was postponed to this year due to the pandemic.  "

It explained that the ""globally agreed"" agreement has the aim of ""holding warming well below 2°C, and pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C"".  NCCS addressed the unique challenges that Singapore faces in a statement to CNA.  ""We are reviewing their methodology. Our preliminary sense is that the CAT may not have fully accounted for our unique challenges as a small city-state with limited access to alternative energy sources,"" said NCCS. ""Singapore's population density is more than 10 times higher than the next densest country in the CAT list, South Korea. Given our lack of land, Singapore is unable to pursue the same types of solutions as the other countries on CAT’s list, for example hydro or nuclear power. ""Within our constraints, we manage our carbon emissions carefully, and strive to overcome our natural limitations through careful long-term planning and innovations in policy and technology. We also have to make well-considered, real trade-offs."" In line with the Singapore Green Plan 2030, NCCS added that while Singapore does not have access to renewable energy sources at scale, the country is committed to the ""cleanest form of fossil fuels"" even as it explores ""greener options"".  ""At 1.2 per cent of fuel mix for energy generation, Singapore's coal share remains markedly lower in comparison to other countries in CAT’s list, such as Japan (29.8 per cent) and Germany (29.2 per cent),"" said NCCS, citing figures from Bloomberg.  Under the initiatives as part of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, NCCS is also ""exploring ways to diversify our energy mix by harnessing greener options such as solar energy, clean energy imports, and low-carbon alternatives"".  In July this year, Singapore completed a construction of a floating solar photovoltaic (PV) system on Tengeh Reservoir, making it one of the world’s largest inland floating solar PV systems, added NCCS. NCCS is also ""reviewing the trajectory and level of the carbon tax, post-2023, in consultation with industry and expert groups"".  ""The carbon tax is a key economy-wide lever to spur the reduction of our carbon footprint, and promote industry innovation and green growth,"" it said.  NCCS noted that the Singapore Green Plan is ""not static"".  ""Even as we implement existing initiatives, we also look to enhancing our sustainability goals and actions. Singapore is committed to doing our part to contribute to the global fight against climate change through tangible action,"" it added.  The report elaborated on the ""critically insufficient"" rating, stating that ""Singapore's NDC (nationally determined contribution) target is weak and will be achieved under current policies"". A stronger target was not put forward in the country’s March 2020 NDC update, the report said. As a result, CAT rated Singapore's target as ""criticically insufficient"", in comparison to both ""modelled domestic pathways and what a fair contribution for Singapore would be"". If fully implemented, it added, ""Singapore’s current policies would result in emissions reductions beyond its targets, but still only in line with 3°C warming"". To improve its CAT ratings, the report stated that Singapore would need to set a ""more ambitious target"" for emissions reductions and ""establish associated policies"". The CAT is a collaboration between two German-based research institutes: Climate Analytics and NewClimate Institute. "

Both programmes ended this month.  In his speech, Mr Widodo reiterated Indonesia’s commitment toward climate resilience, low carbon development and green technology, adding that developing countries must be included in the energy and technology transformation process. Mr Widodo noted that the countries’ capacity and pace in tackling the pandemic differed widely. Thus, the global health security system must be reorganised and new mechanisms were required to mobilise global health resources quickly and fairly, he said.  “We need to establish a standardised global health protocol in cross-border activities, such as vaccine criteria, test results and other medical conditions,” he said. Mr Widodo also took the opportunity to highlight that countries must be stern in fighting intolerance, conflicts, terrorism and war.  Marginalisation of women and violence in Afghanistan, Palestine’s independence and the political crisis in Myanmar must be the world’s “common agenda”, he said.  “The leaders of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) met in Jakarta and agreed on the Five Points Consensus, of which its implementation requires the full commitment of the Myanmar military,” he said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/cotton-tote-bag-plastic-single-use-waste-recycle-reuse-climate-change-2194151,Commentary: A tote bag sounds like the eco-friendly option – but it isn’t always,"SINGAPORE: How many times have you been offered a cotton tote bag, only for you to have no choice but to begrudgingly accept? There’s a high chance every household will have several of these tote bags sitting around, collecting dust. The reusable tote started life as an antidote to heavy plastic use, as awareness on sustainability and how we use resources rose over the years. But event organisers have been handing out tote bags en masse, and they are readily available at supermarkets and clothing chains. Even this year’s National Day Parade pack incorporated reusable and recyclable backpacks. If we’re collecting tote bags by the dozens, are they really eliminating waste and encouraging reuse? After all, the production of tote bags comes at a cost to the earth as well, a cost that sometimes exceeds that of plastic bags. A NTU study in 2020 found that in Singapore’s context, reusable cotton bags, compared to reusable plastic bags (when both are reused 50 times), have over 10 times more global warming potential. Researchers said that we’d have to use these reusable cotton bags hundreds of times before they become the better choice over single-use alternatives. In order to understand cotton totes’ massive environmental footprint, we need to look at how they are produced. First, cotton is a resource-intensive crop. A 2018 study showed that even an organic cotton tote needs to be used a whopping 20,000 times to offset the impact of its production, specifically, high water and land use because cotton is a “thirsty” crop. It takes 900 days of a human’s drinking water use to make enough fibre for a single t-shirt.  Yet organic cotton has a better environmental track record compared to regular cotton. It contributes 46 per cent less to global warming, involves 70 per cent less land and water acidification, 91 per cent less surface and groundwater use and 62 per cent less energy demand, according to Textile Exchange’s life-cycle assessment. Second, cotton totes usually have prints on them. These use PVC dyes which are not easily biodegradable, rendering them effectively unrecyclable. When anything is made by mass production, tagging “sustainable” onto it is a meaningless add-on. As these bags are made in huge batches and provided at a low cost, they are quite likely churned out in a factory that pays minimal wages and little heed to the environment. Currently, there’s no regulation in the fashion industry that requires companies to break down their “organic” labels. Without that accountability, you never really know if an organic cotton tote is 100 per cent organic or not. Brands may very well be greenwashing. Having said that, do tote bags absolve us of our plastic bag sins? Certainly, using a reusable bag and avoiding plastic has its environmental merits. We should be shifting away from throwaway culture as much as possible. After all, 91 per cent of all plastic isn’t recycled. With the bulk of plastic being incinerated or left to “decompose” in landfills, they end up polluting our air, land, and water.  And even when plastic is “recycled”, it often means that the toxic waste is exported to poorer countries that don’t have the proper infrastructure to manage it, but who buy it anyway to bring in more income.  In fact, since China’s ban on imported plastic waste, many Chinese recyclers have illegally relocated to other Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia.  This entire process of waste being exported from richer countries to poorer ones is known as waste colonialism, in the field of discard studies. So we need to ask ourselves if our sustainable solution has become another problem in itself. With the feel-good “I’m not a plastic bag” messaging emblazoned across reusable bags sold at fast fashion outlets, neighbourhood supermarkets, and even IKEA, one wonders if actual sustainability isn’t the end goal of the push for tote bags, but rather the performance of sustainability.  It is an easy tick in the sustainability box without having to substantively change operations and product lines to actually reduce waste. In 2019, H&M joined other major retailers in charging 10 cents for each shopping bag across Singapore stores, to encourage customers to bring their own reusable bags – or buy one at check-out if they don't have any. H&M said it reached its 2020 goal of using 100 per cent sustainably sourced cotton, defined as organic, recycled or sourced through global non-profit Better Cotton Initiative. But fast fashion giants still maintain a take-make-waste business model – one that racks up emissions and pollution. Let’s be clear that avoiding single-use plastics is important. Governments and businesses need to address the issue of its overproduction. But it’s also important to remember too many tote bags  end up as shelf display pieces – or more likely, shoved in kitchen cupboards. It’s not always the more sustainable option to own yet another reusable bag. What do we do about the onslaught of these bags? The next time you get offered one, just say no. Instead, ask why the company needs to keep making more. Many of us work in companies or go to schools that do make unwanted tote bags. Tell whichever department or group that’s making them to do something else with their budget instead. Perhaps they could donate the money budgeted for the bags to a climate justice organisation in Singapore or Southeast Asia. Or they could gift people something sustainable and practical instead, like a voucher to a plant-based eatery, or maybe even to offset their electricity bill if they’ve switched to renewable options. This tote bag problem reveals how deeply entrenched our single-use habits are: We just replaced the bag with a different material without fixing the problem. What we need to fix is our consumerist, throw-away culture. We simply need to stop buying less because we don’t need more stuff and we can share the stuff we already have.  If organisations are so intent on us using less bags, then maybe they should implement bag-sharing initiatives instead.  After all, we have enough bags to go around – probably for the rest of our lives. Whatever the answer is: Another cotton tote bag certainly isn’t it.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/food-waste-lockers-hdb-ang-mo-kio-toa-payoh-2193986,Food waste lockers to be installed at selected HDB blocks in Ang Mo Kio-Toa Payoh sector,"SINGAPORE: A one-year trial to collect food waste from residents will be launched in the Ang Mo Kio-Toa Payoh sector in November, with 10 “smart lockers” placed at selected Housing & Development Board (HDB) blocks in the area, the National Environment Agency (NEA) said on Wednesday (Sep 22). The trial will be conducted by 800 Super Waste Management, which was on Wednesday awarded a new public waste collection contract for the sector. The sector covers the planning areas of Ang Mo Kio, Bishan, Serangoon and Toa Payoh. “These smart lockers will be installed with an Internet of Things remote access smart system, a QR code scanner and a load cell weighing scale,” NEA said in a media release. “Participating households will be issued a unique QR code and air-tight reusable plastic containers to store their food waste. “Participating households can then do a one-to-one exchange of the reusable plastic containers when they drop off their food waste-filled containers into the smart lockers.” Participants will receive reward points via the 800 Super mobile app for depositing their food waste. These points can be exchanged for grocery vouchers. “If the trial is successful, 800 Super will deploy another 83 smart lockers to other HDB blocks in the sector,” NEA said. 800 Super was awarded the new contract for the Ang Mo Kio-Toa Payoh sector by NEA after an open competitive tender which saw five bidders submit offers. The company plans to implement “innovative technologies” to improve productivity and sustainability, and will introduce a new fleet of vehicles which includes electric vehicles, a dual-compartment collection truck and a side-loader recycling truck that can be operated by a one-man crew.  800 Super is the current waste collector for the sector, and will therefore continue to provide services when its current contract expires at the end of this month. The new contract runs from Oct 1 this year until Sep 30, 2028. “As part of transformation efforts in the waste management industry, NEA encourages the use of innovative concepts and technologies to improve productivity and sustainability in the collection of refuse and recyclables in our public tenders for the public waste collectors,” NEA said. “Innovative technologies that will be implemented by 800 Super in the Ang Mo Kio-Toa Payoh sector to improve productivity and sustainability include the use of recycling trucks fitted with side-loaders which enables higher capacity recyclables collection with a one-man collection crew, and the replacement of 32 units of mobile compactors at the bin centres with stationary compactors.” Mobile compactors need to be individually hauled to incineration plants, while waste from stationary compactors can be consolidated by the same refuse collection truck for disposal, NEA explained. The implementation of such technologies is expected to reduce the number of collection routes by about 11 per cent. “These efforts will reduce the number of collection trucks on the road (and) improve productivity and service efficiency, thereby reducing the overall carbon footprint of waste collection services,” NEA said. 800 Super's new fleet of trucks for the collection of refuse, recyclables and garden waste in the sector includes 14 electric vehicles (EVs). The EVs will make up about 45 per cent of this fleet. One recycling truck will also be fitted with side-loaders. “800 Super will also introduce a dual-compartment collection truck for the collection of recyclables and garden waste at landed premises,” NEA said. This truck will be able to collect recyclables and garden waste in separate compartments at the same time, thereby reducing the number of collection trips required. All vehicles deployed by 800 Super will also be fitted with a 360-degree camera monitoring system to reduce blind spots, NEA said. 800 Super will also introduce an initiative to improve recycling in the sector when its new contract begins. Sensors will be installed in recycling bins in HDB estates from November, which will enable the company to monitor bin capacity in real-time. This will allow for more responsive recyclables collection and reduce incidents of bin overflow, NEA said. Monthly household refuse collection fees remain unchanged at S$8.25 for those living in HDB flats and condominiums, and S$27.47 for those living in landed homes. ""800 Super will inform business owners of their new refuse collection fees, which will depend on their daily refuse output,"" NEA said.  The Ang Mo Kio-Toa Payoh sector consists of about 147,400 premises. Of these, 142,000 are homes, while 5,400 are trade premises such as hawker and market stalls, shops, places of worship and government buildings."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/advertorial/smart-buys-big-gains-deliver-big-impact-sustainability-right-purchases-2176126,"Smart buys, big gains: Deliver a big impact on sustainability with the right purchases","Singaporeans appear to be on the right track when it comes to embracing sustainable practices in their daily lives. A 2018 survey by the National Environmental Agency revealed six in 10 households recycle regularly. But what if there was more one could do, simply by shopping right? When it comes to change, it’s worth examining the first two prongs of “reduce, reuse, recycle”. If one makes smart purchases and transforms consumption at the source, we effectively adopt lasting sustainable habits that don’t even require recycling. And as consumers indicate their preferences through purchases, the producers of goods can only move towards greener measures. And the best way to begin, is with the essentials. A KITCHEN DETOX When it comes to the household, food waste is one of the biggest concerns in Singapore. Singapore’s Zero Waste Master Plan reports that in 2019, 744 million kg – or 51,000 double decker buses’ worth of food waste – is produced locally. A small piece of good news is that food recycling is up 1 per cent to 19 per cent in 2020. The movement to better food management has multiple impacts. From reducing resource strain to carbon footprint from the import, every household can contribute to effect positive, sustainable change at their level. And of course, there’s no better place to start than in the kitchen. Composting is a great way to fully extract utility from food waste, thereby reducing the load on a national level. The National Parks has some tips, but you can buy home a ready Composter Kit from The Green Collective for a fine-tuned approach. Under this community’s expertise, you’ll find composting a convenient, odour-free affair, returning you with rich soil that you can use for growing houseplants. To step up your efforts, there are also multiple eco-friendly options at The Green Collective you can include for your kitchen routines. The store sells Soap Berries that contain saponin as a natural detergent, and CocoKlean sheets that eradicate grimy floors using coconut enzymes.

CLEAN UP FOR GOOD Hygiene is truly a full-time endeavour, and along with it comes an army of chemical cleaning solutions housed in plastic. The Sustainability Project (TSP) believes that nature does it better and reclaims the cleaning culture with sustainable and effective finds. Bamboo, for example, is a choice material because it grows fast and requires less land. Having high-use items like bamboo toothbrushes and toilet rolls can save on resources, and are biodegradable to boot.  As for plastic bottles, swap them out for organic alternatives. TSP’s Soap Flakes become hand soap easily with just some hot water, and you can customise the scent with your own essential oils. For dishes, its Dish Washing Bar cleans without any of the usual palm oil or harsh chemicals such as sodium laureth sulfates and parabens that bear corrosive properties and are skin irritants. With TSP’s Cleaning Tablets, there’s 500ml worth of naturally-derived cleaning solution always ready for you to attack counter tops, bathroom tiles and mirrors and glass alike. “The main aim of TSP is pretty simple: We make sustainable living easy for Singaporeans, which encourages everyone to be a conscious consumer,” TSP’s founder Joline Tang shared. And it helps that with HSBC credit cards, one gets up to S$20 off with free shipping with a minimum spend of S$150 by quoting HSBC20. BRING YOUR OWN Plastic waste generated from food packaging has grown exponentially the past year with food delivery and takeaway on the rise. It currently makes up a third of domestic waste. Ditching single-use packaging helps, but you can take it one step further with sustainable offerings from Mamashop. Its eco-ware such as EcoHusk lunchboxes and Nubo reusable straws are upcycled from agricultural waste like rice husk and wheat fibres. Rice husk contributes to a staggering 100 million tonnes of waste and potential pollution just by rice consumption in Asia alone. These materials, combined with recycled plastics and plant starch, are given a new life.  The result is not only a sleek dining container to eat out from (because who enjoys eating out of styrofoam packs, right?) but one that is crafted with antibacterial properties and made to last. The kids will also love those sporting Disney-themed designs. HSBC helps out with 20 per cent off for regular products and 10 per cent off for the Disney collections. GREEN GIFTING WINS Want to make an impression with a gift?

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/indonesia-komodo-dragon-endangered-climate-change-infrastructure-projects-rinca-island-2192186,‘Endangered’ status puts spotlight on Komodo dragon protection as Indonesia government defends upgrade projects,"JAKARTA: Weighing up to 150kg and growing up to 3m long, the Komodo dragons are the world’s largest lizards only found in Indonesia’s Komodo National Park and neighbouring Flores Island. The cannibals eat deer and pigs, and are even capable of attacking humans with their shark-like teeth and poisonous venom. Despite that, the scaly-skinned animals attract many people to the World Heritage-listed Komodo National Park, which is known for its unique savannah landscape. “The Komodos are interesting because they have a character unlike any other animal,” tourist guide Yon Johannes in Labuan Bajo, Flores, told CNA, adding that they live on the edge of forests or savannahs. It is believed the Komodos have existed for millions of years, but they face increasing threats from climate change and infrastructure projects.  Earlier this month, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) changed the Komodo dragons’ status from a vulnerable animal to endangered in its Red List of Threatened Species, the first update for the monitor lizards in more than 20 years.  There are only about 3,000 Komodo dragons in the wild and the IUCN said the impacts of climate change are threats to the rare animal. Human activities such as cutting down forests to make way for infrastructure projects could also threaten the Komodos’ habitat and their existence, said researchers interviewed by CNA.  With IUCN’s reclassification of the monitor lizards, locals have called for the government to reconsider the ongoing projects and pay more attention to environmental protection.    The government, on the other hand, said the IUCN acknowledged that the lizards in the national park were well-protected. The infrastructure projects there were only meant to upgrade old facilities, a minister added.  The IUCN announcement came after a peer-reviewed paper stressed that global heating would affect the Komodo dragons. Thus, urgent conservation actions are needed to save them from extinction.   The organisation said rising global temperature and sea levels as a result of climate change were expected to reduce the Komodo dragons’ suitable habitat by at least 30 per cent in the next 45 years.  Herpetology curator Evy Arida, who has researched the Komodos extensively, said IUCN’s classification is justified given the number of the Komodos.  “This endangered status is a warning that Indonesia does not take its endemic animals seriously,” she said. “We also must bear in mind that climate change does not only threaten one species. It so happens that this one species (the Komodo) is endemic to Indonesia so it’s in the limelight, but there are also other animals (in the Komodo National Park),” Mdm Arida, who works at Bogor’s Zoology Museum, said.  Mr Wiratno, director general of natural resources and ecosystem conservation with the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, said he was aware of the findings. However, he pointed out that the IUCN said Komodo’s subpopulation in the national park was stable and well-protected.  He claimed that the problem was with the lizards in Flores, which is not part of the Komodo National Park. The giant lizards there are under the care of the local government. “We have been monitoring the Komodo’s population for 17 years in the national park. “And we protect them by holding patrols, as well as by ensuring their prey such as deer and buffaloes are not being hunted,” Mr Wiratno, who goes by one name, said. He claimed that the IUCN had never been to the Komodo National Park and he did not understand how the organisation came to its conclusion. Mr Wiratno opined that the IUCN should have consulted the Indonesian government.        “We have installed chips on about 1,200 Komodo dragons, under their skin. “We have something like a barcode and if we catch one, we know whether it is one which we have identified before or a new one. We have enough data,” Mr Wiratno told CNA.   Nonetheless, he said officials have yet to identify rising sea levels as a threat.  “We know the Komodos’ behaviours and habitats. It is dangerous for them to be near the beach.  “So we will need to predict the sea levels and how far the sea could reach,” said Mr Wiratno. Mdm Arida of Bogor’s Zoology Museum said many human activities in Flores endanger the Komodos. These include hunting, smuggling of the animal and burning of the savannah, which causes deer, the Komodos’ prey, to migrate. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is also concerned about infrastructure projects in the Komodo National Park. About two years ago, the Indonesian government started to develop the Komodo National Park as part of an integrated tourism master plan for the site and Labuan Bajo, a town west of Flores which is the gateway to the park. Some have dubbed the infrastructure project “Jurassic Park” after images of a Komodo believed to be on Rinca Island facing a truck went viral last year.  At the 44th session of UNESCO’S World Heritage Committee (WHC) in July, it requested, among others, the authorities to revise the environmental impact assessment for the tourism infrastructure projects on Rinca Island, one of the main islands in the national park, and to resubmit it to the World Heritage Centre for review by IUCN. It also urged the Indonesian government to halt all tourism infrastructure projects in and around the area that have the potential to impact on its Outstanding Universal Value (OUV), one of the main criteria used by the committee to decide whether a site should be granted a World Heritage status.  Speaking at a virtual press conference on Sep 6, Indonesia’s Tourism and Creative Economy Minister Sandiaga Uno said the current constructions did not violate any World Heritage rules and were meant to repair rundown facilities.  “What has been done, including in the Komodo National Park, was repairing rundown facilities which were fragile and needed renovation, such as shelters for the rangers and so on. And these were according to the needs. “And it is not like what people have been discussing, as if it is a massive development. We can guarantee it is not like that,” said Mr Uno.  The minister also said that the projects would be completed by October or November, in time for Indonesia’s G20 presidency as the park would be one of the meeting venues.  The new plan would entail certain restrictions to allow sustainable tourism, he added. Commenting on the infrastructure projects, Mr Wiratno of the Ministry of Environment and Forestry said they were mainly to renovate the old information centre and build an elevated deck for visitors’ safety. These do not affect the OUV, he added. “The Komodo dragons can walk under the elevated deck,” he said, adding that the infrastructure projects were meant to improve the World Heritage site and the affected area was just 1.3ha. The national park covers an area of 173,000ha, according to the Indonesian government.  “Yes, there are Komodo dragons there, but none of them have been a victim of the development,” he claimed, adding that the development projects were only on Rinca Island.  However, Mr Cypri Jehan Paju Dale, an anthropologist at Kyoto University’s Center for Southeast Asian Studies who researches on conservation, ecotourism and interspecies co-existence at Komodo, was not convinced.  “The Indonesian government and business communities should take the IUCN report and UNESCO’s reminder seriously.  “The central government should revise the whole master plan of tourism development inside Komodo National Park and annul all the business concessions,” he said. Commenting on the environment ministry’s claim that the development projects only affected 1.3ha of Rinca island, Mr Dale said the effects of such activities were far-reaching.  While the giant lizards only live on several plots in the coastal areas with water sources and forests, the rest of the terrestrial and marine areas are the supporting habitat, he said.  The visitor centres and resort concessions said to be taking place at the islands would harm the specific habitat of the Komodo dragons, he added. Mr Johannes, the tour guide in Labuan Bajo, confirmed many developments were taking place in the town and its surroundings. “There are a lot of developments here, from infrastructures to new properties, so the pollution levels here are unusually high,” said the Labuan Bajo native.  Another tour guide, Mr Ahmad Fadil, said he was concerned about the well-being of the Komodos. “That is why I always remind visitors not to take everything, except pictures. Don’t kill anything, except time, and don’t leave anything behind, except footsteps,” he said, adding that tourists should not take corals home or litter when visiting the national park. Labuan Bajo-based Muhammad Sunardi said he was also very worried about climate change and the developments in the area.  He pointed out that the developments on Rinca Island, currently closed for visitors, could be useful for tourists, but the animals could suffer.  “As a local, I hope the government would consider developments that do not disturb the Komodo dragons. The government should not just think about itself and the stakeholders in developing this Komodo tourist destination.” "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/electric-car-vehicle-battery-expensive-fire-risk-2189906,"Why an electric car battery is so expensive, for now","At Tesla’s ballyhooed Battery Day event last year, CEO Elon Musk set himself an ambitious target: To produce a US$25,000 electric vehicle (EV) by 2023. Hitting that sticker price - about US$15,000 cheaper than the company’s least expensive model today - is seen as critical to deliver a true, mass-market product. Getting there means finding new savings on technology - most critically the batteries that can make up a third of an EV’s cost - without compromising safety. Alongside Musk, traditional automaking giants including Toyota Motor and Volkswagen are pouring tens of billions of dollars into the race. Largely because of what goes in them. An EV uses the same rechargeable lithium-ion batteries that are in your laptop or mobile phone, they are just much bigger - cells grouped in packs resembling big suitcases - to enable them to deliver far more energy. The priciest component in each battery cell is the cathode, one of the two electrodes that store and release electricity. The materials needed in cathodes to pack in more energy are often expensive: Metals like cobalt, nickel, lithium and manganese. They need to be mined, processed and converted into high-purity chemical compounds. At current rates and pack sizes, the average battery cost for a typical EV works out to about US$6,300. Battery pack prices have come down a lot - 89 per cent over the past decade, according to BloombergNEF. But the industry average price of US$137 per kilowatt hour (from about US$1,191 in 2010) is still above the US$100 threshold at which the cost should match a car with an internal-combustion engine. Costs are not expected to keep falling as quickly, and rising raw materials prices have not helped. Still, lithium-ion packs are on track to drop to US$92 per kWh by 2024, according to BNEF forecasts, and US$58 per kWh by 2030. A major focus for manufacturers is on the priciest commodities, and particularly cobalt. One option is to substitute the metal with nickel, which is cheaper and holds more energy. Doing so requires safety adjustments, however, as cobalt’s advantage is that it does not overheat or catch fire easily. Another move has been to use alternatives that do not contain cobalt at all, like low-cost lithium iron phosphate cells, once derided for poorer performance but winning a revival as design changes deliver improvements. Simplifying battery pack design, and using a standard product for a range of vehicles - rather than a pack tailored to each model - will deliver additional savings. Lithium-ion batteries, whether used in grid-sized storage facilities, cars or devices like smartphones, can catch fire if they have been manufactured poorly, damaged in an accident, or the software that runs them has not been designed properly. Incidents remain rare, but garner huge scrutiny in what remains a developing sector. A decision in August by General Motors to carry out a US$1.8 billion recall of more than 100,000 Chevrolet Bolt models as a result of battery defects underscored the seriousness. Blazes or overheating incidents this year also impacted major energy storage projects in Australia and California. And the fires are not easy to extinguish; it took firefighters four hours and more than 113,560 liters of water to douse a Tesla Model S after a fatal crash in Texas. Tesla insists that incidents involving electric models garner undue attention. According to its 2020 Impact Report, cars with internal-combustion engines (ICE) catch fire at a “vastly” higher rate. From 2012 to 2020 there was about one Tesla fire for every 330 million kilometers travelled, compared to a fire every 31 million kilometers for ICE vehicles, the EV pioneer said. Asia dominates manufacturing of lithium-ion cells, accounting for more than 80 per cent of existing capacity. The Chinese company Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) shipped the highest volume in 2020, capturing almost a quarter of the market. By September this year it had extended its lead to 30 per cent, followed by South Korea-based LG Energy Solution and Japan’s Panasonic. Tesla and Panasonic’s joint venture is the biggest battery producer in the US. Emerging producers include Northvolt in Sweden, founded by former Tesla executives, and Gotion High-tech in China. They have the same basic components: Two electrodes - a cathode and an anode - and an electrolyte that helps shuttle the charge between them. But there are differences in the materials used, and that is key to the amount of energy they hold. Grid-storage systems or vehicles traveling short distances can use cheaper and less powerful cathode chemistry that combines lithium, iron and phosphate. For higher-performance vehicles, automakers favor more energy-dense materials, such as lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt oxide or lithium-nickel-cobalt-aluminum oxide. Further refinements are seeking to improve range - how far a vehicle can travel before recharging - as well as charging speed. Yes, in almost every aspect. China is responsible for about 80 per cent of the chemical refining that converts lithium, cobalt and other raw materials into battery ingredients, though the metals themselves are largely mined in Australia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Chile. China also dominates processing capacity across four key battery components (cathodes, anodes, electrolyte solutions and separators), with more than half of the world’s commissioned capacity for each, BNEF data shows. The nation faces a challenge when it comes to advanced semiconductor design and software, components that are increasingly important as cars become more intelligent. Less than 5 per cent of automotive chips are made in China, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. There is still an issue with driving range. While the most-expensive EVs can travel 644km or more before a top up, consumers considering mainstream models remain anxious about how often they will need to recharge. Automakers and governments have become directly involved in the roll-out of public recharging infrastructure for drivers on the road. However, most recharging is expected to take place at home, and that means another cost for consumers. While the average price of a home-charging kit has fallen 18 per cent since 2017 to about US$650, some top-of-the-line bi-directional chargers (which let you send energy from the vehicle to the home or grid), cost more than US$6,000. Installation costs in the US can run from as little as US$400 to more than US$3,300. Most keenly anticipated is the arrival of solid-state batteries, which promise a huge performance upgrade by replacing the flammable liquids that enable charging and discharging with ceramic, glass or polymers. QuantumScape says it has innovations in that field to increase a car’s range by as much as 50 per cent and the technology could be deployed in vehicles at dealerships as soon as 2026. Another industry focus is modifying anodes - typically made using graphite - to add more silicon, or by using lithium metal. That would likely make it viable to power smaller aircraft. Storing renewable power with utility-scale batteries for days or weeks, rather than hours at present, is also a key challenge. Form Energy is developing iron-air batteries that it says could enable entirely carbon-free grids. CATL and others are also working on plans to substitute lithium, or combine it with, far cheaper sodium-ion technology for some niche applications."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/transport-ministry-singapore-iswaran-vaccinated-travel-lane-vtl-2189881,"Reliability must be foundation of Singapore's transport system, says Iswaran","SINGAPORE: Reliability must be the foundation of Singapore’s transportation system and infrastructure, said Minister for Transport S Iswaran on Monday (Sep 20).  Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, Singapore’s land, air and sea transport workers had ensured reliable access to public transport and continued cross-border flows of people and goods, he said.  Mr Iswaran gave the example of the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, which had facilitated more than 160,000 crew changes using safe protocols it had developed together with its partners.  “It’s undoubted that COVID-19 will continue to challenge us,” said Mr Iswaran at an event marking the 20th anniversary of the Ministry of Transport. He pointed to how the country’s aviation hub partners had to respond to the Changi Airport cluster in May, while bus operators had to deal with a spike in infections among bus drivers in recent weeks.  Mr Iswaran said this “collaborative spirit” in tackling the challenges of COVID-19 - even among competing companies - gave him the confidence that future challenges could be overcome and reliability in Singapore’s transportation system could be sustained.  In laying out his vision for the ministry's priorities for the next 20 years, Mr Iswaran said the transport system needs to be resilient. He gave the example of how the maritime sector had adapted its processes to keep supply lines intact and ensure workers were kept safe. These efforts have paid off, he said, noting Singapore remained the world’s top transshipment port despite the pandemic.  In fact, container throughput between January and July this year had grown 3 percent compared to the same period in 2019, he noted.  “That means that we are now above the pre-pandemic level, which I think is a very notable achievement,” said Mr Iswaran.  Turning his attention to aviation, the minister said cargo volume through Changi Airport had recovered to pre-pandemic levels.  Still, he noted Changi Airport and national carrier Singapore Airlines (SIA) were operating at 3 per cent and 4 per cent of pre-pandemic levels respectively,  This is despite various schemes introduced to facilitate essential and business travel, as well as travel from very low-risk areas. Regarding the new vaccinated travel lane, Mr Iswaran said several countries and regions had expressed interest in opening such lanes with Singapore and the authorities are “actively working on expanding the scheme in the coming weeks and months”.  These countries and regions are being assessed based on criteria such as public health considerations - including the incidence rate of COVID-19 and vaccination rate of potential partner regions - as well as operational considerations such as the authentication of vaccination documents, he said.  Mr Iswaran said that more than 900 travellers had entered Singapore in the first two weeks of the scheme, which allows for vaccinated travellers from Brunei and Germany to take four COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests instead of serving stay-home notice.  This is out of the 2,500 who have applied to travel via the travel lane so far, he said.  This outcome is promising, Mr Iswaran said, noting that these travellers had ""fully complied"" with the COVID-19 testing regime. So far one person travelling via the vaccinated travel lane had tested positive for COVID-19, he told reporters on the sidelines of the event.  The case was detected upon arrival in Singapore and the traveller was placed in quarantine, he added.  This means the system is working, he said, adding that travellers are gaining confidence with the scheme.  Regarding travel arrangements with Malaysia, Mr Iswaran would only say that conversations were being held at various levels of government, describing it as a “an ongoing process”. “When both parties are ready, we will be prepared to make more comments about how we want to re-establish connectivity, and I think I will leave it at that.”, he said.  The revival of Singapore's air hub is critical to the country's economy and its reputation as a trusted international hub, Mr Iswaran said. ""It may take some time for global air travel to normalise. But we will do our utmost to make sure Changi and SIA soar again.” Singapore must also be ready for the future, he said, describing climate change as a “key long-term challenge”.  Singapore can play a “catalytic role” in reducing emissions from international aviation and maritime transport, said Mr Iswaran.  “As a hub, we are also well-placed to drive research, test-bedding and adoption of greener fuels for shipping and aviation,” he said, noting the Government was currently reviewing findings from a study on sustainable aviation fuels at Changi Airport.  “When green fuels are commercially viable, Singapore can help lower the emissions of every aircraft and ship that refuels in Singapore,” he said. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/big-read-rise-ethical-consumer-can-it-uplift-low-wage-workers-too-2187176,The Big Read: The rise of the ethical consumer – can it uplift low-wage workers too?,"SINGAPORE: In 2015, Ms Jasmine Hussain watched a documentary titled Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret, which showed how animal agriculture had become the leading cause of deforestation, water consumption and pollution, and an even greater emitter of greenhouse gases than the transportation industry. The film opened her eyes to the environmental impact of livestock production, and set her off on the journey towards becoming an ethical consumer.  “I kind of made the decision to go vegan overnight after watching it ... It was the least I could do since I was studying ecology and environmental science,” said Ms Hussain, who was then a 19-year-old undergraduate at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.   Changing her consumption habits even further after that became a “very natural transition” for her, she said. It was also made easier by the fact that such behaviour was seen as the norm among her like-minded classmates.  “If I was already being vegan and conscious about my eating habits, I was also going to be conscious about my spending habits as well, and be willing to spend a bit more on going to the zero-waste stores,” added Ms Hussain, who is now 25 and works in the green finance industry. Zero-waste stores operate in a similar fashion as regular grocery stores, but they do away with excessive packaging by encouraging patrons to bring their own containers and buy only the amounts they need.  Some also sell organic produce and products that are touted to be more environmentally friendly, though often at higher prices.  The ready availability of such stores in Edinburgh had made it easier on the wallet for Ms Hussain to sustain her lifestyle, as the “price range was more affordable” compared to what she found when she returned to Singapore in December last year. Nevertheless, Ms Hussain has continued with this lifestyle and is part of a nascent but growing group of ethical consumers in Singapore.  Ethical consumerism is broadly defined as buying products and services produced in a way that minimises social or environmental damage, or both. This could range from buying cosmetic products that are free of animal testing to buying only from companies which pay their workers decent wages.  While combining ethics and shopping can be a rewarding experience for some, there are those who are not ready to embrace it yet since the price tag attached to such purchases is often perceived to be higher than normal. Though the presence of stores selling sustainable alternatives in Singapore is not as widespread as what Ms Hussain had encountered in Scotland, various businesses in this sector said that they have witnessed a sharp growth in demand. Ms Florence Tay, the co-founder of Singapore’s first zero-waste grocery store UnPackt, said that when she and her business partner Jeff Lam started their business at Sembawang Hills Estate in 2018, knowledge about sustainable consumer practices was limited. “At that point of time, people were only aware about the problems caused by single-use straws and plastic bags,” she said. In the months prior to the store’s opening, a heartbreaking video of sea turtles with straws stuck up their nostrils had gone viral, sparking a global debate about the environmental problems caused by plastic products.  UnPackt has since seen its customer base grow by at least 30 per cent, estimates Ms Tay, who declined to provide specific numbers.  Likewise, bigger competitors such as Scoop Wholefoods – which originated from Sydney, Australia – has seen its number of outlets multiply since it set up shop here in 2019.  “The demand has grown significantly over the last two-and-a-half years with more and more people wanting to be a part of our zero-waste mission,” said Mr Vishesh Juneja, the chief executive officer of Shopping Bag, a company under the Singapore-based lifestyle group Gill Capital which manages Scoop. Scoop has expanded from its lone store at Tanglin Mall to six outlets now, with another two scheduled to be opened later this year. Conversations about sustainable living in Singapore have been ongoing for some time, though it was only around 2015 that community groups started forming, according to Mr Mayur Singh, the co-founder of the Green Collective, a store located at Funan mall that curates sustainable brands.    Meanwhile, developments around the world in recent years have given even greater impetus to such discussions.  For instance, Swedish teenager and environmental activist Greta Thunberg first came into the global spotlight in 2018 for walking out of class on Fridays to protest in front of the Swedish parliament about her government’s inaction over climate change. On Sep 20 the following year, Ms Thunberg led the Global Climate Strike, a worldwide movement to protest against what youths perceived as a lack of effort from their respective governments to tackle the climate crisis.  This, in turn, led to the inaugural Singapore Climate Rally at Hong Lim Park a day later, which was held in solidarity with Ms Thunberg’s movement.   The COVID-19 pandemic has also affected global awareness about environmental issues, based on a 2020 survey of about 3,000 people across eight countries.   The survey was conducted by the management consulting company Boston Consulting Group. It showed that about seven in 10 respondents were now more aware, compared with before the pandemic, that human activity threatens the climate, and that degradation of the environment, in turn, threatens humans. It also found that 40 per cent reported that they intend to adopt more sustainable behaviour in the future, which includes reducing household energy consumption, increasing recycling and composting, and buying locally produced goods. The Singapore Government, too, has also stepped up its efforts to promote a more liveable and sustainable future here, through initiatives such as its Zero Waste Masterplan unveiled in 2019, and the announcement of the Singapore Green Plan 2030 this year.   Pointing to the Climate Index published last month by OCBC Bank and digital media company Eco-Business, Mr Singh said he was happy to see discussions on the environment and sustainability “becoming more mainstream”. The index, which was based on a survey of 2,000 Singaporeans between the ages of 18 and 65, had asked the respondents, among other questions, to rank which of the five key areas unveiled under the Green Plan was the most important to them.  It found that eight in 10 respondents ranked “sustainable living” as the most important, followed by “energy reset” (61 per cent), “city in nature” (55 per cent), “green economy” (54 per cent) and “resilient future” (49 per cent). The index also gave Singaporeans a score of 8.3 out of 10 on sustainability awareness – that is, they were aware of almost all environmental issues. However, it also found that Singaporeans scored only 6.5 and 5.6 when it came to adopting green practices and advocating them, respectively. This meant they only did it some of the time, and advocated some of these issues and practices to their families and friends. While ethical consumption is growing in Singapore, it has yet to become a norm here, unlike in countries such as Australia, Canada and the United States. Dr Jimmy Wong, a senior lecturer at the School of Business at the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS), said that Asian cultures “tend to be more interdependent and collectivistic”. What this means, he said, is that Singaporean consumers tend to follow social norms, and at present, it is still not the norm for most to consider whether a product is sustainably or ethically sourced before making a purchase. Instead, consumers here are by and large pragmatic and cost-conscious when it comes to consumption, said Assistant Professor Stephanie Lin from the business school INSEAD.  “It is my impression that, in general, your average Singaporean is less concerned about ethical consumption than in other parts of the world, like the West,” she said. Still, Asst Prof Lin believes that younger consumers here are gradually becoming more ethically minded, and they want to connect more with the brands that they consume. “This is partially due to a global trend of brands becoming more socially responsible; they are using more sustainable materials, ensuring ethical labour sourcing, connecting with social issues like racial equality, and often contributing part of their sales to other good causes,” she said. The other factor is the role which social media plays in influencing younger shoppers, said the experts interviewed. Associate Professor Ang Swee Hoon, from the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Business School, said social media has helped to amplify consumers’ views of not only brands, but also ideas and movements, as well as accelerated the role of word-of-mouth communication.  Asst Prof Lin added that social media also gives brands a more direct connection to their consumers, and allows emotional relationships – instead of just functional ones – to be established.   During the course of her research, Asst Prof Lin found that consumers like to share content on social media that is in line with their personal values, so that they can display their “best selves” to the world.  “Consumers sharing about their support of ethical brands to each other further perpetuates ethical consumption as a growing norm,” she said.  Social media also gives consumers a voice to speak out against unethical practices of organisations, allowing them to informally police brands.  “For instance, when certain organisations in Singapore were found to be underpaying employees, people posted about it on social media, spreading the word about the brands’ unethical practices and affecting brand equity,” she said. While Asst Prof Lin did not single out any company, media reports of homegrown bakery chain Twelve Cupcakes underpaying their employees had resulted in widespread backlash online, with some calling for a boycott of the business.  “Firms are sensitive to optics right now. Sometimes, big campaigns backfire, with ads getting pulled for being insensitive or brands being criticised for greenwashing, causewashing or hypocritical behaviour,” said Asst Prof Lin. She added: “It seems like a lot of firms have learned the lessons of these pitfalls. That’s why you see firms engaging in responsible behaviour, like donating to good causes, without loudly advertising and seeking recognition for it – this can lead to greater brand loyalty.” Mr Melvin Yong, the president of the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE), pointed out that businesses which do not respond and adapt to consumer preference are likely to lose out in the long term. Noting the “dynamic” relationship between consumers and businesses, Mr Yong, who is also the Member of Parliament for Radin Mas, said: “Consumer behaviour can be shaped by what the marketplace is offering, and consumers can collectively effect change in the marketplace by exercising their right to choose.”   As a show of loyalty to their preferred brands that are aligned with their ideals, some consumers vote with their wallets, said NUS’ Assoc Prof Ang, even if the benefits are sometimes not evident until further down the road – such as in the case of climate change.    “So while it may appear not pragmatic (due to the higher pricing) in the immediate future, consumers, especially the Gen Zs, have longer-term ideals. Being younger, their actions today may well affect their life in the future,” she said.  Indeed, such an outlook was reflected in Ms Hussain and other younger consumers who are trying to make sustainable consumption part of their lifestyle. Ms Hussain’s friend, Ms Natalie Tan, 25, said her decision to embark on a sustainable lifestyle was partially influenced by Ms Hussain, and in part by what she had learnt while studying about global health and the environment. “I don't want to contribute to capitalism, and also harm the environment,” said Ms Tan, who recently graduated from the Global Studies programme at NUS.   Ms Tan said she would rather pay more for a certain product if she knows that it can fulfil her criteria. Apart from deciding whether she actually needs the product, she also researches whether a company pays its workers a living wage or if it practises greenwashing – that is, deceiving the public into believing it is helping the environment – and if the product is durable or not. “Of course, it can’t also be exorbitantly priced because I’m not super rich,” said Ms Tan. One example of a purchase she made with these factors in mind was a pair of durable slippers made of recycled tyres which cost her around S$60. While she could have gotten a cheaper pair, she said this would wear out quickly and she would have ended up contributing more waste by buying another pair of slippers to replace them. As for 26-year-old teacher Natasha Paul, she has been trying her best to reduce her meat intake due to the increasing amount of talk about ethical consumption and sustainability. She is doing so by substituting recipes that require meat with plant-based alternatives. This has led her to think further about how else she could do her part to help the environment as a consumer. One other way to do so would be to buy locally grown vegetable produce even though the prices might be higher than some imported ones. These local vegetables are not only fresher, but have a lower carbon footprint since they do not have to be transported over a long distance, said Ms Paul. However, not everyone shares the same consumer philosophy. Some of those who do not said that whether an item is ethically sourced or helps the environment is never a consideration in their purchasing decisions. “I have a young family to support, so I just go for items that are value for money, or things that are on offer,” said Mr Shaun Ho, a 35-year-old operations manager. An accountant, who is also 35 and wanted to be known only as Mr Chan, said he had just bought a house and is preparing to start a family, so he needs to be more prudent with his expenditure. He said that for example, he could not justify paying more for organic free-range eggs that “taste just like normal eggs and are of the same size”. However, advocates of ethical consumption said it is a misperception that shopping ethically is expensive. Ms Hussain said she typically buys her staple food such as fruits and vegetables from the wet market, which are not only priced affordably but come without packaging. She said she only visits a zero-waste store every one-and-a-half months to buy packaging-free soap and shampoo, or any other specialty products which she cannot get elsewhere. Such visits only set her back between S$20 and S$50 each time, she added. UnPackt’s Ms Tay said the idea is to buy only what one needs. As such, a customer may still end up paying less even if the price per weight for an item at a zero-waste store is more than its pre-packaged counterpart at a conventional store. Moreover, pre-packaged items could lead to both a waste of resources and money if they are not used up entirely, she added. Still, some consumers, such as Madam Audrey Lee, are not convinced. Mdm Lee is an administrator of the Facebook group Taobao Addicts, where members can get help with shopping on the Chinese e-commerce platform. As her days are busy, Mdm Lee, who is in her 50s and declined to reveal her occupation, said she “doesn’t want to waste her time window shopping”, let alone think about ethical consumption.  To her, it is all about convenience and pricing.   While the general perception is that younger shoppers are more aware of ethical consumption, not all from the older generation are indifferent.  For example, Madam Lee Lay Peng, 53, said she and her friends are discerning when it comes to making purchases.   Mdm Lee, who works in the information technology sector, said she is not against paying more for certain products if she knows for certain what the actual benefits of doing so are. “Personally, I wouldn’t mind paying more for food if it is homemade or prepared without preservatives, instead of being mass-produced,” she said. Mdm Lee pointed out that one reason why older consumers may be generally slower in adopting sustainable consumption habits is because many are not on social media and do not get the same amount of exposure as their younger counterparts on the importance of doing so. “So that may be the reason why we are not part of this wave, because of the lack of awareness,” she said. Several of the business owners spoken to highlighted the importance of creating awareness in order to change behaviour. Mr Laurent Stevenart, Singapore’s country manager at Impossible Foods, said one of the biggest barriers the firm faces is the perception by meat-eaters that plant-based meat just does not taste as good, or does not taste like the “real thing”. “In many of our product roll-outs and launches, we focus heavily on sampling, and we often say ‘tasting is believing’,” he said.  Ms Paul, who still describes herself as a meat-eater, said one of the hurdles she initially faced in trying to cut back on meat in her diet was that the alternatives, including the mock meat that is commonly found at vegetarian stalls, were not to her liking. She was “not drawn into the fold” until brands such as Impossible Food and Beyond Meat introduced their plant-based meat alternatives in Singapore which better suited her taste buds.   Meanwhile, both UnPackt’s Ms Tay and the Green Collective’s Mr Singh spoke about the importance of outreach efforts to show the public that adopting sustainable practices is not out of reach or burdensome.  “We are not working on getting people to buy a product, we are actually getting people to buy a lifestyle … and when they do, this causes a behaviour change,” said Mr Singh. For example, Ms Tay said: “Sometimes when I'm busy, I don't have a reusable cup with me, but I still make the effort to sit down for 10 minutes to drink my coffee (from a cafe’s refillable mugs) instead of having it as a take-away order.” Mr Singh said ultimately, these outreach efforts need to be relatable and the target audience must be made to understand why there is a need to do things in a certain way. Amid the growing awareness of responsible consumption, another facet of the issue has come to the fore recently: Will Singaporeans be willing to pay more for products or services to improve the wages of low-income workers, such as those in the retail, and food and beverage industries? In announcing several measures to uplift such workers during his National Day Rally on Aug 29, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted that the cost of higher wages for them will have to be shared, not just by workers and employers, but consumers as well.   “So all of us, as consumers, must also chip in. Pay a little bit more for some of our favourite things, like bubble tea or bak chor mee to help the shop cover higher cleaning and waste-collection costs,” he had said. Over the years, there have also been spirited public discussions on whether hawkers should charge higher prices to improve their lot.  Most consumers interviewed generally felt that they would only be prepared to pay more if they know for sure that the additional amount they pay goes directly to the workers. Others said they are concerned about how it will affect their cost of living. Among those who said they would pay more was Ms Tan, who said she has always wondered why hawkers price their food so cheaply.  ""They have to wake up early every day and put in so much effort to make that one dish,"" said Ms Tan, adding that they ought to be better compensated for their efforts. Nevertheless, she acknowledged that this would raise the cost of living especially for low-income families, and suggested that those who can afford it should sponsor meals for the needy.  SUSS’ Dr Wong said the idea of paying more to create an inclusive society is an abstract idea that will be hard for most people to connect to. “They will say, ‘You’re telling me if I pay 20 or 50 cents more for my bak chor mee, the uncle at the coffee shop downstairs will be better off?’” he said.  To gain the acceptance of consumers, CASE’s Mr Yong said businesses not only need to show that any additional premium paid by their customers goes towards supporting the welfare of these workers. There must also be discernible improvement in the services over time, he added.  “At CASE, my view is that businesses should not see this as an excuse to raise prices without justification. CASE will not hesitate to act against businesses who take this as an opportunity to profiteer,” said Mr Yong. Instead of passing on the cost to consumers, Dr Wong said that a better idea would be for companies to cut costs on unnecessary areas – overly elaborate packaging for example – and channel that difference towards the workers’ salaries instead. INSEAD’s Asst Prof Lin described Singaporean culture as very “communal”.  “On the one hand, Singaporeans are very concerned about doing their civic duties and being responsible members of the community,” she said. “On the other hand, it may be difficult to think about low-income workers as part of their immediate community that they have a responsibility to help.”  She added: “Humanising low-income workers and emphasising their part in a local or global community might be helpful in increasing empathy to low-income earners.” In any case, Associate Professor Hannah Chang, from the Lee Kong Chian School of Business at the Singapore Management University, said it generally takes “a lot of time and discussion” to result in any meaningful change in consumer attitudes and behaviour. “We can see that over the years, consumers have started caring more about the environment and social causes,” she said.  “Similar to how the importance of sustainability and green consumption have been highlighted … if people can be shown how they can play a part in (uplifting wages) by paying just a bit more with each purchase, it's more likely that people will start showing a buy-in.” For more news like this, visit todayonline.com."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/insect-food-cricket-flour-protein-bar-alternative-meat-climate-change-2169416,Commentary: Could edible insects and bugs be a key part of F&B menus in Singapore soon?,"SINGAPORE: After chickening out from a dare by my father to try a fried cockroach during a family trip in Cambodia, I finally mustered up the courage to sample brownies made with cricket flour during a corporate event in London.  It was also the first time I heard insect farming can be more sustainable than traditional animal agriculture in terms of land, water and energy use.  Since then, I’ve committed to minimising my meat and seafood consumption, mainly to reduce my carbon footprint. But I’ve felt conflicted about eating plant-based foods that are equally resource-intensive to produce such as avocado, almond or cashew.  As a regular runner, I have also struggled with getting sufficient protein intake from soy-based meat substitutes such as tempeh or tofu.  Most people associate alternative protein with cell- or plant-based meat substitutes such as Impossible Foods or Beyond Meat, overlooking the health and environmental benefits of eating insects.  Over 2,100 species of insects are consumed in 140 different countries across the Asia-Pacific, the Americas and Africa, according to a recent report by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Some of the most popular edible insects include beetles, caterpillars, ants, bees, wasps, grasshoppers, locusts and crickets.  Insects are a high-fibre, high-protein food source which are low in salt and rich in vitamins, minerals and fatty acids, although their nutritional value varies depending on the species. Crickets for instance are complete proteins, meaning they contain all nine essential amino acids which is not always the case with plant-based meat alternatives. 100g of crickets contains approximately 60g to 70g of protein – two to three times more compared to the equivalent amount of beef or chicken.  Insects require less feed, grow and reproduce quickly, are more efficient in turning their food into protein, produce less waste and emit fewer greenhouse gases compared to conventional livestock.  In land-scarce places such as Singapore, insect cultivation could help improve food security and advance the city-state’s 30 by 30 goal – increasing the proportion of locally produced food from 10 to 30 per cent by 2030.   Even though more than 2 billion people globally consume insects based on the latest FAO data, the idea of bugs as food or feed is still met with disgust and reluctance around the world.  For example, feeding farmed seafood insects, rather than fish, could help reverse overfishing and create more sustainable and cost-effective aquacultural practices.  Yet a survey conducted in January 2021 by Professor Shirley Ho at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) revealed mixed opinions on the use of insects as fish feed.  92 per cent of Singaporeans and permanent residents interviewed were open to using okara meal, a by-product from tofu and soy milk production, while only 46 per cent would endorse plastic-eating mealworm larvae as aquafeed, likely because of food safety concerns. Unlike other Southeast Asian countries such as Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam or Thailand, insects have never been part of Singaporean cuisine, but providing transparency over how insects are raised and what they are being fed could help dispel worries over food safety.   Singapore’s two edible insect start-ups Asia Insect Farms Solution (AIFS) and Altimate Nutrition currently partner with farms in Southeast Asia where insects are reared in a controlled, hygienic environment and live on a vegetable-based diet without any hormones, antibiotics or other chemicals.  Both companies aim to eventually set up their own production facility in Singapore.  In addition, upcycling food waste, agricultural by-products or manure from livestock agriculture offers a low-cost, high-nutrition feed for insects whilst creating a circular farming operation.  But rigorous and regular testing is required to mitigate potential food safety risks.  “General food waste tends to be more heterogenous in composition. It may contain toxic substances and be prone to microbial contamination, which could pass on to the animals and eventually consumers if we use general waste to feed insects”, warns Professor William Chen, Director of NTU’s Food Science and Technology Programme.  One solution is to feed insects more homogenous and cleaner pre-consumer food waste such as okara or spent grains, a by-product of the brewing industry, adds Chen.   The import or sale of insects for human consumption is not currently authorised by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA), although AIFS and Altimate Nutrition expect to receive regulatory approval to commercialise their products in the fourth quarter of 2021.  To overcome the “ick factor” typically associated with insects, instead of whole insects, the two companies use cricket flour in functional foods that consumers are already familiar with. Crickets are often considered “edible insects for beginners” because of their earthy, nutty flavour with little after-taste.   “During our sensory evaluation, not one participant complained about the taste being different because the protein bar was made with insect flour and most were open to buying it as a snack”, says Gavriel Tan, co-founder of Altimate Nutrition.  Tan plans to charge S$5 at launch and eventually reach a price point which is 10 to 20 per cent cheaper compared to an average protein bar.  Forward-looking restaurateurs are also embracing insects as an ingredient for more innovative menus. With the aim of promoting more sustainable sources of protein whilst preserving local food heritage, social entrepreneur Aaron Yeoh partnered with AIFS to trial cricket flour in some of the dishes for his soon-to-be-launched cafe. His team replaced plain flour with 20 per cent cricket flour in their blondie recipe, which has allowed the cake to maintain its moisture while increasing its protein content. They have also experimented with blending black soldier flies (BSF), primarily used as animal feed, into chili paste.  Although it was never marketed commercially, Insectta, Singapore’s first BSF farm and biotech company, had also tried making edible insect dishes including slider patties, pasta, cookies and sambal, and was even approached by brewery Red Dot to collaborate on an insect-infused beer. BSF has a faint taste of pork lard and smells like roasted peanuts, and is easy to eat when seasoned with familiar spices such as salted egg yolk, mala or pink salt, shares Insectta co-founder Kai-Ning Chua.  Perhaps the key to unlocking this entirely new area of food lies in the younger generation and customised workshops for children are already part of the plan in Chua’s case.  “The younger generation will be the fastest adopters of edible insects”, says Yuvanesh Tamil Selvan, co-founder of AIFS who found children to be the most receptive to trying insects during his outreach work with schools.  Alternative protein including insects could offer a viable solution to counter unsustainable agricultural practices, as well as excessive consumption and food waste in certain countries and continued hunger in others.  But as a novel food that wasn’t traditionally part of Singapore’s culinary history, it might take an entire generation to make the cultural shift of adopting insects as part of their everyday diet.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/zero-waste-singapore-fashion-swop-jasmine-tuan-2180466,How this Singaporean went from shopaholic hoarder to zero-waste champion,"Jasmine Tuan wasn’t taking very good care of herself. The former multi-media designer for Zouk, co-founder of Singapore fashion label FruFru & Tigerlily, and founder of design agency and Asian fashion boutique Blackmarket was partying from Tuesday to Sunday and generally “wasting (her) life away”. “Along with a series of failed relationships, missed business opportunities, cash flow problems and trying to make ends meet for my retail business back then, I woke up one day and just couldn't stop crying,” the now 43-year-old recalled, adding that she couldn't sleep for days. “I used to boldly say there's no such thing as depression. It is made-up, imaginary and the word should be removed from the dictionary. How arrogant and ignorant was I?” she told CNA Lifestyle.  She managed to overcome that period but shortly after, was hit by more emotional trauma – she nearly drowned on a ""cheer-myself-up"" trip to Krabi with her party friends. That was the moment she felt a “spiritual awakening”. “I literally woke up from my folly, and started cleaning up – my life, my spirit, my purpose.” Around the same time, Tuan’s grandmother passed away. On the same day as the wake, Tuan got news that Blackmarket was going to be forcibly closed because she couldn't keep up with the rent, which had doubled.  “The fighter in me then decided to stop fighting. Though I lost everything, I somehow felt a sense of peace and relief,” she shared. “I was so broke I only had seven dollars in my POSB bank account and I couldn't even withdraw it.” Thankfully, her family and friends rallied around and served as her support.   “Suddenly, I had a lot of time, and a lot of clothes. I remember squatting down at the lowest point of my life, staring at the wardrobe I've amassed up till my mid-thirties.  “Is this life? Why am I spending so much time, energy and money on stuff? Why do I put so much meaning to things that are temporary?” That was the start of a new beginning for Tuan. “It was then that I started detaching my identity from the things I bought, the stuff I owned or accumulated.” She started selling her possessions – “I wanted change,” she said. When she had the opportunity to live and work in Malaysia, the shopaholic, whose entire life previously revolved around fashion and new clothes, knew she had to “downsize” her life. She moved to Kuala Lumpur with a wardrobe on a single rack feeling light and free.  But the competitive Malaysian currency rate got her excited about shopping all over again. “Suddenly everything seemed so cheap and I was sucked right back into that vicious cycle I just got out of! I wanted change, location change, but I was the same old me,” she admitted. For Tuan, the real and actual change truly happened when she started getting involved with non-governmental organisation (NGO), Zero Waste Malaysia.  “It opened up my eyes to the world of ‘Rs’, to sustainable living other than recycling,” she said. “Inspired by the community, I took up the challenge to apply the 5R principal sequence: Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Rot or compost the rest – to my lifestyle, and also committed to zero shopping on new fashion items, especially fast fashion.” It was exactly the kind of change Tuan had been looking for and, in her words, “there was no turning back”. But it wasn’t easy to make a switch. She admitted that in the beginning, she was “overwhelmed”. “What should I do now that I don't wish to waste anything or throw anything away? What can I really do without, and what are my true needs and wants?” she shared.  “Hiking and packing light for hiking trips also helped me to assess what's essential and what's not. I was surprised at how little I actually needed."" According to Tuan, when she committed to zero shopping (as in not purchasing any new fashion items) in 2018, she was prepared to wear the same few clothes she had for the rest of her life. “I'm serious!” she said, with a laugh. “Then I got introduced to the concept of swapping in Malaysia. In my opinion, swapping is the best way to enjoy fashion, in the most sustainable way. Friendly to the planet, people and pockets. I was converted. Swapping became my new shopping."" Tuan confessed that she’s not sure if she would have seen a change in herself if she had stayed in Singapore. Life, she admitted, is very comfortable here. “There was no sense of urgency to change”. After four years in KL, she returned home to Singapore in early April, determined to downsize her life even more. She still had a lot of stuff – 20 years' worth – at her mum’s home. That was when Cloop.sg (short for “closing the fashion loop”) was born. “When I moved back to Singapore, I thought to myself why wait for someone to start a swapping event? I might as well do it,” she recalled. She didn’t want to do it herself, so she aligned with two other like-minded fashion lovers who were on a similar mission to reduce fashion overconsumption and waste in Singapore.  They joined forces and started Cloop Fashion Swap. “Timing was great because a lot of charity organisations ceased collection of donations. And during the pandemic, a lot of people had time to 'Marie Kondo' their wardrobe and had no place to drop them off.  ""These are good, fashionable clothes we stopped wearing since most of us now work from home, changed career paths, stopped partying, and going to events. At the same time, we want to make swapping so affordable and fun (that) there's no reason to buy new.” To say Tuan’s journey from partying shopaholic fashionista to zero-waste activist has impacted her life would be an understatement. And she is determined to keep walking the talk.  She recently came on board charity NGO Zero Waste SG as a marketing assistant director and also continues to share her zero-waste journey on the Smiles Like Green Spirit website. So where’s a good place to start for someone who is – pardon the expression – green to the cause? “Start by looking at your trash bin. Do a waste audit – see what you have been throwing away. Then find ways to avoid the waste production in the first place,” she advised.  “'Saving the planet' is really as easy as bringing your own everything, from bag, bottle, cup, container, cutlery. Switching all things disposable to reusable. I find the 5R principles especially helpful in my journey. I added one more ‘R’ in front, which is ‘Rethink’. By changing your mindset and rethinking your consumption habits – half the battle is won already.” According to Tuan, Singaporeans are “a little behind"" in the world of sustainability.  “But we are definitely stepping up,” she added. “The Green Plan 2030, and moving Singapore towards a Zero Waste Nation vision is definitely a possible future, since we are so small, it is easy to implement. If Singapore is successful in doing so, we can be an example for all other nations to follow. We can also learn what works in other countries.” She added: “We need to quit that disposable and 'throw away' mindset. Singapore is known as a 'throw away' nation. We throw away not just disposables, but things that are perfectly in good condition. Because when we throw something away, it doesn't go away. It goes somewhere. Either dumped in a landfill, dumped in the ocean, or in the environment as litter if it is not incinerated.” Thinking before buying and thinking before throwing anything away is a good habit, said Tuan. “Down to the finest thread, I’ll find a way to put something to good use,” she said. That said, it's sometimes easy to feel overwhelmed by the issue of waste. So what advice does she have? “Yes, eco-anxiety is real and I have come to experience it firsthand. Here I am saving one plastic bag and the person next to me just took 10! It can feel like whatever I do is futile sometimes. What's the whole point of me trying when the world doesn't even seem to care?” she said.  But it's all about focusing on what you can do within your means, she pointed out. “Although it's impossible to achieve the zero in zero waste, that doesn't mean we take zero action. Start by saying no to another disposable. Start small. The keyword is start and keep doing it till it becomes a habit, and start another one.” The next Cloop event, called #secondhandseptember – Cloop Fashion Swap!, will be held on Sep 25 and 26 at Sprout Hub, 102 Henderson Road.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sustainability/coal-asian-countries-un-climate-change-summit-cop26-2175391,"As climate talks near, pressure grows on Asia to cancel new coal projects","KUALA LUMPUR: With six nations accounting for more than 80 per cent of planned new coal projects globally, winning commitments to cancel those projects could help November's COP26 UN climate summit ""consign coal power to history"", a key goal of organisers, researchers said. Proposed new coal power capacity globally has plunged 76 per cent since the Paris Agreement in 2015, with 44 countries agreeing to end new projects, according to a report by think-tank E3G released on Tuesday (Sep 14). Asia however is still at the centre of the world's remaining pipeline, which means action by six countries alone - China, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Turkey and Bangladesh - could remove more than four-fifths of planned projects before construction. Ending the use of coal - the most polluting fossil fuel - for power production has been a key focus for climate change activists, leading to funding and insurance for new projects rapidly drying up. Swiftly ending coal use is seen as vital to global goals of capping global warming at ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius and ideally 1.5 degrees Celsius, and avoiding swiftly worsening climate threats such as harsher storms, floods, wildfires and crop failures. But coal remains a mainstay for power generation in Asia, which accounts for 75 per cent of global coal demand, according to the International Energy Agency. Countries with significant coal deposits or energy systems reliant on the fuel have been slow to abandon it, tied down in part by the costs of abandoning still-functioning plants and mines or reluctant to break commitments to new plants. China also remains a major funder of new coal energy, even as declining prices for solar and wind power make green energy more competitive than coal in most parts of the world. ""The economics of coal have become increasingly uncompetitive in comparison to renewable energy, while the risk of stranded assets has increased,"" said Chris Littlecott, the report author and an associate director at E3G. China alone is home to about 53 per cent of the new coal power capacity under construction globally, the report noted. That is despite a 74 per cent reduction in its project pipeline since the Paris climate accord, according to E3G. The Asian giant, however, is not only under scrutiny for its coal projects at home but also for funding projects abroad, after two other major financiers - South Korea and Japan - said this year they would end overseas coal financing. ""China is the last man standing in supporting coal projects abroad,"" Li Shuo, a Beijing-based policy advisor at Greenpeace East Asia, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""The Chinese government should get ahead of this trend by declaring an overseas coal moratorium. Doing so before COP26 will contribute momentum into the year-end global climate gathering,"" he said. Getting countries to commit to more ambitious emission-cutting plans and providing the necessary finance to put them into place are key themes at the COP26 summit, billed as the last chance to galvanise the action needed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Alok Sharma, the British official who will preside over the talks, has said the summit, scheduled to take place in Scotland in November, needs to ""consign coal power to history"". Countries from Indonesia to the Philippines have been part of a new wave of commitments across Asia to not approve new coal power projects - but projects already planned or under construction will still go ahead in most cases. With new plants needing to run for decades to pay back the costs of building them, failure to reverse those plans could doom climate goals, climate scientists and activists say. ""We have to talk about terminating 'under construction' projects, and cancelling the 'planned projects' when it comes to coal in Asia,"" said Sejong Youn, a director at Solutions for Our Climate, a Seoul-based non-profit on climate change. ""That is the real target we need to be pushing in COP26."" Youn said there is a ""high likelihood"" China will ""quietly, virtually"" end overseas coal finance at some point, but he expects the country will not announce such a move to avoid being seen as caving in to outside pressure. Any efforts to ditch coal should also take into account how that would impact impoverished communities and workers across Asia and potentially deepen inequalities, said Indonesian campaigner Arti Indallah Tjakranegara. Transitioning to cleaner energy in Indonesia could create millions of new green jobs in the country of 260 million but also lead to the unemployment of tens of thousands and threaten the economy of coal-producing regions. Indonesia, the world's top exporter of coal for power generation, currently sources 60 per cent of its own energy from coal. It plans to stop using coal, oil and gas by 2060 and aims to have 85 per cent of its energy needs from renewable sources then. ""Energy transition is like two sides of the same coin. There are also risks to be mitigated,"" said Tjakranegara, a manager at Yayasan Humanis dan Inovasi Sosial, an Indonesian non-profit working on climate change issues. ""A just energy transition needs to address the main challenges of unemployment, environmental degradation and inequality,"" she said by phone from Jakarta."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/living/creative-capital-dylan-eng-paperplain-market-paper-furniture-2161016,Creative Capital: They have stylish paper furniture that people can actually sit on,"My wife is an interior design junkie. If you follow her feed on Instagram, you would see that she posts inspiring images on her Stories feed constantly – pictures of living rooms, bathrooms, kitchens, hotel rooms, furniture and other lifestyle products that capture her eye.  Because she is constantly checking out interesting interior brands, she also keeps quite au courant on new manufacturers and makers. One local brand she mentioned to me a while back – saying that if we had the space (which we don’t), she’d love to shop from them – is PAPERplain Market, a two-year-old company specialising in paper furniture pieces. Yes, paper. The pieces that are sold by founders Dylan Eng and Fiona Foo, are made from paper, and yet nonetheless, have form, weight and can hold a pretty enormous amount of weight.  They are also classy and elegant. Even more impressive, most of the pieces can be folded up and put away, which makes them perfect for living in small spaces.  I caught up with 34-year-old co-founder Dylan Eng to chat about his unique company. HI DYLAN, TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF. WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP, WERE YOU ALREADY INTERESTED IN DESIGN? I came from a small village in Kuantan, Malaysia. Back in my younger days, I didn’t have a lot of opportunities to travel – my only “playground” would be my father's boat workshop where he built boats.  My father influenced me very much in having a heart for interiors. We made cute little stools and tables from leftover wooden planks. We even made doors sometimes.  HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN SINGAPORE AND WHAT BROUGHT YOU HERE?  Singapore has sheltered me for nine years. Not to be cliched, but it was love that brought me  here to Singapore. Needless to say, better work opportunities and higher salaries have also helped keep me here.   DID YOU STUDY DESIGN?         I went into engineering instead of interior design. Yet, I am now doing something in interiors. Expect the unexpected is one of my mantras. That said, I would love to go to a design school. I just have a heart and head for cool and current stuff. PAPERPLAIN IS A SIDE BUSINESS, YES?   Engineering is definitely my forte and I’m still at it. PAPERplain is more of a side project to fulfil something that has been circling in me for the longest time. It is kind of like an art project but also one that has commercial potential. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR BRAND?  I would love to say that PAPERplain is a design company, but we are not there yet. At present, we are more of a B2C platform for interesting art and living products. PAPERplain hunts down and discovers products with a tale to tell. WHAT WAS THE INSPIRATION FOR PAPERPLAIN?  My co-founder and I believe that true luxury lies in real comfort at home. PAPERplain yearns to create aesthetically pleasing, yet functional, home and living products. WHO IS YOUR CO-FOUNDER?  I started the business with my dear friend, Fiona Foo. PAPERplain is, in so many ways, the apple of her eye. We met each other ages back. She is actually so much more than just a good friend and a business partner, she is my family in Singapore.  In terms of the business, Fiona is responsible for all the “headache” accounting, purchasing and taking care of inventory. I handle the marketing and creative presentation parts, and running whatever random errands the business demands. HOW ARE YOU CREATING THESE PRODUCTS CURRENTLY?  We’re fortunate that we are currently able to tap on OEM (original equipment manufacturer) designs. The factory we work with designs and manufactures the products according to our requests.  But, in the long term, we definitely have plans to develop our own collection. We already have designs in the pipeline and are very much looking forward to sharing our very own collection soon. YOU GUYS LAUNCHED IN 2019? HOW HAS BUSINESS BEEN?  PAPERplain launched at the end of 2019 and it was initially great. We received an overwhelming response from a trade fair that we participated in. Unfortunately, the pandemic came right after all of those good things and business was badly affected.  Everything happens for a reason, I guess. We had to move to an online business as well as working via consignment projects with local furniture stores. We can now be found physically at Etch & Bolts in Singapore. I would say, business is coming back slowly. WHO IS YOUR CUSTOMER? AS IN, HAS THERE BEEN A SPECIFIC DEMOGRAPHIC THAT YOUR WORK APPEALS TO MORE THAN OTHERS?            So far, the customers are quite varied. We have got young to old couples who just got their new BTO flats or condos and have been cracking their heads on how to host more guests with limited storage space for furniture.  Some customers are also into collecting interesting art pieces. Our products are definitely eye-catching and have great appeal among design lovers. I do need to say that our customers, since our launch, have been very supportive and shown great trust in our work. For that, we are super grateful. WHAT HAS BEEN THE HARDEST PART OF THE ENTREPRENEURIAL JOURNEY SO FAR? The hardest part of the journey has to be the impact of COVID-19. Our products are pretty much reliant on users having a real interactive experience with them. It is when consumer can try, touch and feel the products, that they get sold the fastest.  Even though we have been selling our products online, the result is just not as great as compared to trade fairs, shows or markets.  Nonetheless, we have been very fortunate to have been able to consign our products to Etch & Bolts. We always encourage potential customers to drop by to try the product before purchase. AND WHAT HAS BEEN THE BEST PART? Definitely encouragement and positive feedback from our customers during our very first Christmas trade fair back in 2019. It was beyond words to see people dropping by, filled with curiosity and then coming away with smiling faces when they got to see how our products work. Those moments gave us the faith in what we are doing with PAPERplain. IS THERE A HERO PRODUCT? In the construction field, honeycomb sandwich walls are well-known for their lightweight yet durable functionality. Most of our paper furniture is constructed with this honeycomb structure.  As an engineer myself, I am thoroughly amazed by the honeycomb paper structure that is able to withstand 300kg of weight per square meter, as well as the accordion design that makes the pieces so space saving.  One of the top-selling products is our LOUNGE III. When closed, it is about the size of a dictionary but, when expanded, it can accommodate three adults. Amazing, isn't it? I AM ASSUMING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WONDER ABOUT THE DURABILITY OF YOUR PRODUCTS. JUST HOW DURABLE ARE THEY? This is probably one of the top questions that we get from our customers. We often tell our customers that it really depends on the usage of our product. If the product has been used with proper care, it can easily last at least five years or more. And it’s recyclable. HAS THERE BEEN A DESIGN THAT YOU REALLY WANTED TO CREATE BUT IT JUST WOULDN’T WORK PHYSICALLY? We have bold and imaginative ideas for our new collection. I would say everything is possible, it is just a matter of cost efficiency and development cost. We are slowly getting there though. WHAT WOULD BE YOUR DREAM PROJECT? A collaborated collection with talented people – that could be someone from fashion, fine arts, etc. WHAT IS YOUR VISION FOR PAPERPLAIN?    MUJI is a muse and inspiration for us. I hope that one day, PAPERplain comes to mind when people think of lifestyle. That would be amazing.  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/living/locomotiva-project-brazil-pvc-violins-music-2170196,From pipes to musical pieces: Brazilian project makes PVC violins for children,"An orchestra making music from pipes. This is the driving idea behind the Locomotiva Project which converts polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes into violins and cellos, and offers free music lessons to dozens of young musicians in Brazil's Sao Paulo state. ""It's a process that takes a bit of work to do, it's time-consuming,"" said Ivan da Silva Oliveira, a luthier who makes violins for the project. The production process consists of 42 steps from cutting and heating the pipe to framing and trimming the instrument. But the savings cannot be denied. A violin crafted by a luthier, who specialises in constructing and repairing string instruments, can cost up to 8,000 reais (US$1,540), depending on the wood, Ivan said. Even an average violin is valued at around 800 reais, but the PVC material means the cost drops to around 300 reais instead. After they started making the violins in 2018, this cheaper solution allowed the organisation to wipe out its long list of youths between seven and 17 years of age waiting to receive an instrument. ""It's a PVC pipe that becomes a violin, with which we make music, play, do a lot of cool stuff. This is magic,"" said conductor Rogerio Schuindt. In addition to violins, the project also produces cellos and has its own orchestra. The PVC pipes usually used in construction and hydraulic installations are donated by petrochemical company Braskem. ""It's a sensational thing, knowing that a pipe that carried water now brings music,"" said Gabriel Santos Espinoza, 11, one of the project's students, hugging his PVC violin."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/australia-wont-allow-un-climate-goals-uk-free-trade-deal-2166326,Australia won't allow UN climate goals in UK free trade deal,"CANBERRA: Australia's government confirmed Thursday (Sep 9) that it refused to allow climate change goals to be written into a proposed free trade deal with Britain, as pressure mounts on it to make more ambitious commitments to cut carbon emissions. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the trade deal under negotiation with Britain was not the document to include UN goals to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures, and preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius. “It wasn’t a climate agreement; it was a trade agreement,” Morrison said. “In trade agreements, I deal with trade issues. In climate agreements, I deal with climate issues,” he added. British ministers had agreed to bow to pressure from Australia to drop binding commitments to the Paris climate change agreement from the bilateral trade deal, Sky News reported citing an email from an unnamed British official sent last month. The report angered environmentalists who questioned Britain’s commitment to curbing greenhouse gas emissions ahead of hosting a UN climate summit, known as COP26, in Scotland in November. Trade Minister Dan Tehan said climate targets were “never part of free trade agreements that Australia enters into"".  “This agreement recognises we’re signed up to Paris and that we’ll meet our Paris targets, which we will do hands down,” Tehan told Radio 4BC. “We got a fantastic outcome both for Australia and the UK in that FTA, which we’re seeking to finalise at the moment,” Tehan added, referring to a free trade agreement. Reducing emissions is a politically fraught issue in Australia, which is one of the world's largest exporters of coal and liquified natural gas. The nation is also one of the world’s worst greenhouse gas emitters per capita because of its heavy reliance on coal-fired power. Resources Minister Keith Pitt said in a statement on Thursday that coal remained Australia’s largest export after iron ore and “that won’t be changing any time soon"". This followed UN Special Adviser on Climate Change Selwin Hart this week urging Australia to phase out coal. Australia has not budged from its 2015 pledge at the Paris climate conference to reduce emissions by 26 per cent to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 ahead of climate talks in Glasgow. The conservative government aims to reduce emissions to net-zero and preferably by 2050, but won’t commit to that target. Opposition leader Anthony Albanese accused Morrison of holding Australia back on renewable energy opportunities to create jobs and reduce energy prices. “The Paris commitments are something that Australia has signed up to, but which Australia continues to sit in the naughty corner with the rest of the world,” Albanese said. “The whole world has signed up to net-zero emissions by 2050. Scott Morrison continues to be a recalcitrant when it comes to climate change action,” Albanese added. Greenpeace executive David Ritter accused Australia of “diplomatic bullying to weaken the global climate effort"".  “The Morrison government is resorting to sleazy backroom deals and pressure tactics to shirk the commitments it has made to the world on climate change,” Ritter said in a statement. Jonathan Pershing, deputy to US presidential climate envoy John Kerry, told a climate forum last month it would be “really helpful” if Australia were more ambitious in reducing emissions."

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/advertorial/mercedes-benz-revs-sustainable-mobility-2138356,Mercedes-Benz revs up to sustainable mobility,"What kind of world do you envision two decades from now? Whatever comes to mind, whether we race into a future of sustainable development and harmony with the environment, or one that we come to rue, will be decided by what we do today. That applies to the individual, but it’s also up to corporations to take the lead in investing in the kind of tomorrow that we all want to see. For Mercedes Benz, its holistic environmental roadmap – Ambition 2039 – has guided its strategy and direction since 2019. The goal? Emissions-free mobility. By 2039, Mercedes-Benz has set itself the target of a completely carbon-neutral car fleet.  This means cleaning things right down the value chain: From the way tomorrow’s vehicles are driven to the way they are built, and even in the way suppliers do business with Mercedes-Benz to help ensure an ethical supply chain. To do this, the manufacturer holds its suppliers accountable to a variety of standards including working conditions, upholding human rights, environmental protection and safety. ACTING TODAY FOR A CLEANER TOMORROW The journey to 2039 is well under way. By 2022, for example, Mercedes-Benz factories worldwide will use only electricity from renewable sources thanks to a green power supply contract that obtains energy from solar, wind and hydro sources. This includes part of a solar park near Ingolstadt that has 24 wind farms and more than 200 wind turbines. According to Mercedes-Benz, the energy sourced from this plant alone is approximately equal to the amount of electricity consumed by 65,000 households annually. Also by 2039, the entire range of Mercedes-Benz cars will be electrified, meaning electric power will enhance combustion engines to wring maximum efficiency from them. The journey to sustainable mobility is succinctly summed up in two letters: EQ. With those letters representing the new technology at the core of Ambition 2039, Mercedes-Benz envisions a three-track approach to an emissions-free destination. This fits in nicely with the Singapore Green Plan 2030. Measures include the abolishment of the sale of new diesel cars and taxis from 2025, and to have eight electric vehicle (EV) ready towns with chargers at all HDB carparks by the same year. By 2030, the plan calls for all new car and taxi registrations to be cleaner-energy models by 2030, and to phase out vehicles with internal-combustion engines by 2040.  A THREE-PRONGED APPROACH TO ONE GOAL At Mercedes-Benz, the first track to a sustainable future involves electrified combustion engines, while the second track is all about plug-in hybrid EVs. The third, and possibly most exciting track, has all-electric vehicles and even fuel-cell models. Offering different pathways encourages cleaner mobility but doesn’t force it. Where combustion still rules, electrified engines improve efficiency. For drivers eager for a taste of electric mobility but who aren’t quite sure if they are ready, plug-in hybrids offer enough pure electric range for daily use, but with combustion power as a backup for longer journeys. And for drivers ready to embrace a new experience of sustainable mobility, the Mercedes-EQ family of pure electric cars shows just how exciting the future is. This three-track approach means the decision belongs to the Mercedes driver, while Mercedes itself is committed to flexibility. In Singapore, the manufacturer already offers mild hybrid and PHEV (plug-in hybrid electric vehicle) models and recently launched the EQC, its first full-production EV to be offered here. This SUV will soon be followed by the EQA compact crossover.  Available in four different equipment lines – Progressive, Electric Art, AMG line and Edition 1 – the EQA offers a stylish take on electric motoring.  The Progressive line includes two 10.25-inch displays that form a widescreen cockpit. The Electric Art interior offers back-lit trim as well as rose gold highlights in the air vents and upholstery, which uses partially recycled materials. The AMG Line has AMG-specific components like the front apron and black panel radiator grille. Inside, AMG Line cars have sports seats and a multi-function sports steering wheel. The Edition 1 is available for a limited period and combines elements of the Night Package with elements of AMG bodystyling like the 20-inch AMG wheels in a matt copper finish. Other EQ series models including the EQS (which will use the manufacturer’s newly developed EV platform), EQB and EQE are waiting in the wings.  Flexibility also means the ability to increase the pace of change if need be. “The EV shift is picking up speed – especially in the luxury segment, where Mercedes-Benz belongs,” said Mr Ola Kallenius, chairman and chief executive of Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler. ALL-ELECTRIC DREAMS With one eye firmly on Ambition 2039, Mercedes-Benz has another eye on becoming an all-electric brand by 2030.  “The tipping point is getting closer,” said Mr Kallenius. “We will be ready as markets switch to electric-only by the end of this decade.” That will involve heavy investment in new EVs, building battery plants and even having a foot in battery recycling centres.  For instance, the manufacturer is exploring reusing batteries from plug-in or electric vehicles in stationary energy storage systems, which are less demanding. Mercedes-Benz estimates that the batteries can be used for an additional 10 years, increasing their economic value while decreasing the use of resources. All told, Mercedes is committing €40 billion (S$64 billion) to reinventing itself for the future. “We need to move the debate away from when you build the last combustion engine because it's not relevant,"" Mr Kallenius said. ""The question is how quickly can you scale up to being close to 100 per cent electric – that is what we are focusing on.” By 2025, the company expects full-electric and hybrid-electric cars to make up 50 per cent of its sales, earlier than its previous forecast of 2030.
A world with emissions-free mobility might arrive sooner than we expect. Especially if we want it to. Find out more about Mercedes-Benz’s plans for a sustainable future."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/climate-change-singapore-green-plan-2030-desmond-lee-nus-forum-2140206,Youths urged to adopt sustainability as a 'core value' to help Singapore's green journey,"SINGAPORE: Minister for National Development Desmond Lee on Friday (Aug 27) urged youths to adopt sustainability as a core value, such that it becomes a part of “what it means to be Singaporean”. ""Wherever you go, you can help make sustainability a part of our lives,"" said Mr Lee at the Kent Ridge Ministerial Forum organised by the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) students’ political association.  ""We need all of you to come on board our sustainability drive,"" said Mr Lee said in his keynote address. Mr Lee called on youths to take action for sustainability, saying that sustainability commitments require resolve. “Above all, what we hope for is a deep shift in our culture, such that we adopt sustainability as a core value and a part of what it means to be Singaporean living in a city state,” said Mr Lee in his speech. Mr Lee's address was followed by a dialogue that was not for open for media coverage.  “Just as multiculturalism is one of our defining traits, so too should sustainability be so ingrained in us and our future generations that it informs our actions and decisions, and the kind of society that we strive to be,” said Mr Lee.  Adding that climate action will be the “defining fight of our times” and for future generations, the National Development Minister said the Government “cannot do this” on their own.  Everyone needs to play a part with diverse skills and perspectives, said Mr Lee.  As students graduate and enter the workforce, they can help to power many of Singapore's Green Plan initiatives, he added, addressing those in the audience.  “Some of you, as future engineers, could work to electrify our vehicles, upgrade our charging infrastructure, or enhance our green energy capability. As an ecologist or conservationist, you could help us to green Singapore further, protect our biodiversity for future generations,” he said.  “As architects, developers, engineers, builders, you could design and build super low energy or even net-zero energy buildings, or even positive energy buildings. As teachers, you can teach and groom future generations about sustainability, and many more. ”  The Green Plan 2030 was unveiled in February, unveiling Singapore’s green targets for the next 10 years. The plan positions Singapore to achieve its long-term net-zero emissions goal “as soon as viable”.  It also strengthens Singapore’s commitments under the United Nations' 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and Paris Agreement, said the Government at the time.  Among the Green Plan initiatives, Mr Lee touched on Singapore’s conservation measures. Singapore has reserved about 7,800ha of land for nature reserves, nature parks and other dedicated green spaces, he noted.  “That’s more than 10 per cent of our land area, and doesn’t include all the other pockets of greenery around our island, like trees planted along our roads, or our military training areas,” he added.  Singapore is already seeing positive results from its conservation efforts, said Mr Lee. For example, several local mammal species have had their conservation status downgraded compared to 2008, and are considered less endangered than before.  Singapore is also making headway in the public transport area, by building more MRT lines and testing new technologies such as driverless or electric buses, he added. The Government aims to phase out all internal combustion engine vehicles by 2040, or about 20 years from now.  ""The cars on the road that you're used to seeing and take for granted all these decades will no longer exist from 2040, which means that your children could grow up in a Singapore where all vehicles run on much cleaner energy sources,” said Mr Lee.  “That’s a fundamental overhaul of our transport system, which will need major infrastructure upgrades, like new charging stations everywhere.""  The country’s cycling network will be more than 1,300km long by 2030, or long enough to cycle to Phuket from Singapore, he added.  Buildings and towns, as well as Singapore's power sources will be more green. About 50 per cent of HDB blocks will have solar panels affixed to their roofs over the next two to three years, and 70 per cent by 2030, said Mr Lee.  Singapore will also try to import more green electricity from other countries in the region that have better access to renewable energy like hydropower, he added.  “We want to bring sustainability right into our daily lives. In fact, we’re making our HDB towns, where 80 per cent of Singaporeans live, more sustainable through the Green Towns programme,"" said the National Development Minister.  ""By using technologies like smart lighting, we aim to reduce energy consumption in existing towns by 15 per cent more from 2020 to 2030.”  Even if Singapore does its part, global emissions may still not fall fast enough, and the country must be protected from the worst effects of climate change, said Mr Lee.  Long-term moves like improving flood resilience and defending the coastline against rising sea levels could cost Singapore S$100 billion or more over the next 50 to100 years, he added.  Singapore also aims to produce 30 per cent of its nutritional needs locally and sustainably by 2030 because climate change may cause crop failures, which could disrupt food imports, said Mr Lee.  ""We must also remember that all these endeavours will involve some trade-offs, even painful ones. And as young people, your leadership is important.""  All Singaporeans ""need to take action in our own ways"", said Mr Lee in closing.  ""Going beyond ideas and discussion, as valuable and important as these are, to roll up our sleeves, get to work, experiment with different solutions, figure out the ground issues and how we can overcome them,” he added.  “And who better to take this action than young people like yourselves, with your ambition, your energy, your inspiration and your conviction. Not just when it comes to sustainability, but also in tackling all the other challenges coming Singapore’s way. “Because that’s the wonderful gift of youth, that sense of endless possibility, that confidence to open new doors, the willingness to take risks, to explore the unknown, because so much of your life lies ahead of you. And that brings with it a certain responsibility too, to march forward bravely and to blaze new trails, and bring the rest of society with you.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/digitalisation-sustainability-opportunities-covid-19-singapore-economy-gan-kim-yong-2139486,"Digital transformation, sustainability among post-pandemic opportunities for Singapore: Gan Kim Yong","SINGAPORE: Digital transformation and sustainability are among several opportunities that have emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic and Singapore can take advantage of them to emerge stronger amid the ""significant challenges"" it faces, Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong said on Friday (Aug 27). Speaking at his ministry’s annual economic dialogue, Mr Gan noted that the pandemic has caused and accelerated several key shifts in the global economy such as a changing global balance, accelerating digital transformation and innovation, as well as an increased focus on sustainability. These shifts present significant challenges for Singapore’s economy but also offer new opportunities. Digitalisation is one such opportunity as the pandemic emphasised the significance of the virtual realm. Singapore will need to create “new virtual frontiers” to transcend the constraints of its physical size and boundaries, the minister said. For instance, a virtual marketplace of goods and services can be set up to allow businesses to enter new markets and reach customers from all over the world. Sustainability and the green economy present the second opportunity, according to Mr Gan, who added that Singapore can “capture first-mover advantage” in areas such as carbon trading and services, low-carbon technologies, green financing and sustainable infrastructure. It can also help existing industries transition to a lower-carbon economy, as well as help companies create new sustainable products and solutions. The third area of opportunity lies in developing more home-grown “global champions”. Mr Gan said large enterprises make “disproportionate contributions” to the Singapore economy, be it in terms of gross domestic product (GDP), employment or productivity. Several home-grown “unicorns” – a term for start-ups that reach a private valuation of US$1 billion or more – have emerged over the years, he added, citing the likes of Grab and Razer.
    
These large enterprises have the potential to expand further and compete in the global market, he said. The challenge ahead is for Singapore to groom the next generation of future champions and soon-to-be “unicorns”. This is an important area, the minister said, so as to provide Singaporeans with new and exciting opportunities for many years to come. The Singapore economy shrank an unprecedented 5.4 per cent last year on the back of the pandemic, marking the country’s worst recession since independence. There have been “promising signs of recovery” this year, said Mr Gan, noting that the economy grew by 14.7 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter. This was much faster than the 1.5 per cent growth in the first three months of the year. Policymakers have also raised the official growth forecast for 2021. The economy is now expected to grow between 6 and 7 per cent, compared with the previous projection range of 4 to 6 per cent. Mr Gan said: “We expect the Singapore economy to continue to recover gradually in the second half of the year, given the global economic recovery that is under way. “With our domestic COVID-19 situation remaining stable and our vaccination rates continuing to improve, we should also be able to progressively ease our border and domestic restrictions over the course of the year.” But recovery is to likely remain uneven as the impact of COVID-19 has differed across sectors. For instance, tourism and aviation-related sectors are expected to see a slow and protracted recovery. Global travel restrictions remain in place and global travel demand is also likely to be sluggish amid the spread of more contagious virus strains, the minister said. On the other hand, outward-oriented sectors such as manufacturing, wholesale trade and finance and insurance are set to record healthy growth this year, driven by the rebound in global demand. “The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our lives, jobs, and the economy. But there are also bright spots and new opportunities for us to look forward to,” Mr Gan said at the online dialogue. “As long as we maintain our can-do spirit, remain nimble and adaptable, and embrace new ideas and innovation, I am confident that Singapore will continue to thrive.”  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sg-eco-fund-second-grant-call-sprout-mse-community-projects-sustainability-2136926,New category for smaller community projects as SG Eco Fund opens second grant call,"SINGAPORE: The SG Eco Fund has introduced a new category for smaller community projects, to encourage more ground-up action and more people to apply.  This was revealed as Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu announced the second grant call for the Fund on Thursday (Aug 26) at the Ricoh Eco Action Day 2021: The Future of Work event. Applications close on Oct 17.  The new category, Sprout, will cater to smaller community projects seeking funding of up to S$10,000. It will be easier to apply, as applicants only need to submit a pitch deck instead of a written proposal, and present it to the evaluation committee if they are shortlisted. The outcome of their application will be made known within two months from the close of the grant call, compared to four months for other applications, the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) said. The S$50 million SG Eco Fund was launched in November 2020 to promote environmental sustainability in communities. The first grant call was opened from Nov 25 last year to Jan 31, and awarded a total of S$3.7 million in funding to 37 projects in May. ""The Fund is open to the People, Private and Public (3P) sectors and aims to support ground-up projects that involve the community and advance environmental sustainability in Singapore,"" MSE said. Areas covered include climate change mitigation, waste reduction and conservation of nature and biodiversity. Individuals who apply for funding must be Singapore citizens or permanent residents above 18 years old and they must be residing in Singapore. For those applying as a group, at least one member must meet the criteria. Singapore-registered organisations – including companies, charities, government and non-government organisations – are also eligible. The projects must not have obtained funding from other government sources. “Projects should address at least one area of environmental sustainability, including but not limited to the following: Climate change; energy; waste; water; food; nature and biodiversity; environmental pollution; or environmental public health,” said MSE. Applicants can find out more about the fund at their website. The ministry also encourages applicants to sign up for upcoming public workshops which will share more details on the fund and provide tips on how to apply.  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/net-zero-buildings-sustainability-energy-design-2134106,"Net-zero buildings: More than design or engineering, but about 'better quality of life'","SINGAPORE: The drive down Clementi Road might be peppered with greenery alongside several schools, but the National University of Singapore’s School of Design and Environment 4 (SDE4) is still a sight to behold. Standing six storeys tall at 8 Architecture Drive, the multidisciplinary space boasts a large oversailing roof, airy and open spaces, floor-to-ceiling glass panels and concrete surfaces that resemble marble — and its sleek facade is only enhanced by weaving in the surrounding mature trees into its design.  But one thing stands out: Singapore’s first net-zero energy building to be built from scratch doesn’t have a green facade. And this decision was intentional.  “Green facades are very popular now. This is a great idea, there’s nothing wrong with it. But we realised our building is (already) surrounded by all this dense greenery. When you come to our campus, you'll see large trees and amazing flora. It felt like putting a green wall was just lip service to green sustainable thinking,” explained Dr Nirmal Kishnani, associate professor at NUS SDE, to CNA.  “Not to mention, green walls still place a certain burden in terms of water consumption. Again, (green walls) have value, they provide cooling, they do a lot of things, but we evaluated the idea and decided it wasn’t what we wanted to do for this particular site.”  Mr Giovanni Cossu, associate director of sustainability services at the Dean’s Office in NUS SDE, added that there was “a lot of discussion on how to preserve the existing vegetation, primarily the trees, which are literally encapsulated in the structure”.  Such meaningful decisions are necessary in creating a net-zero building like SDE4, as these buildings are “an absolute key to a sustainable future”, said Dr Kishnani.  Under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, one of the Singapore Green Building Masterplan's key targets is to green 80 per cent of its buildings by 2030. Aside from NUS SDE4, some notable players in the market include Keppel Bay Tower, which is Singapore’s First Green Mark Platinum (Zero Energy) Commercial Building, and the Building and Construction Authority's (BCA) zero-energy building. Yet, despite being known to be good for the environment, net-zero buildings are hardly springing up across the island. ""The basic premise of net-zero is when the building produces enough power by itself, and matches its consumption. It equalises the load that is consumed by the building."" ""Zero means the building is at zero every day, every minute, every second. In the definition of how the industry looks at it, net-zero is assessed over a period of one year, where you’re zero most of the time. ""After all, there are days or hours that you may end up producing more power than the building is consuming, and there are days when it’s on the opposite end. Therefore it’s net-zero over a 365-day period.""  ""In an off-grid building, you don’t need to connect it to the grid. You put a bunch of batteries in it, and then whenever you are producing more than you’re using, you store it in the battery. ""In net zero, you don't install the batteries for a reason. Singapore’s grid is better than a battery. So when we make extra (energy), we’re putting it into the grid; when we need some, we’re taking it from the grid. But it should net out to zero."" Source: Mr Erwin Chong, Group Head of Corporate Real Estate Strategy and Administration at DBS, and Mr Prescott Gaylord, Head of Sustainability for Corporate Real Estate at DBS.    For a start, many companies might not have an incentive to build net-zero buildings, because it “isn’t their primary business to be net-zero” or focus on energy, suggested Mr Ang Kian Seng, group director of the environmental sustainability group at BCA.  “If you're in the business of healthcare, for example, your main priority is how you deliver healthcare to patients in a cost-effective manner. So energy is secondary, and therefore it’s never high up (on your priorities),” he explained to CNA.  “But having said that, because of the climate emergency, like just this morning there was a flash flood, everything can be attributed to global warming. There is more extreme weather. People are beginning to realise we all need to do something.” As a result, net-zero buildings can be part of the solution to fight climate change, added Mr Lei Zhang, founder and CEO of Envision Group and Envision Digital, whose company aims to address sustainability challenges with technology solutions.  “Buildings in Singapore account for over 20 per cent of the country’s carbon emissions. Given the high emissions footprint of buildings, using design and technology to enable them to be net-zero can help mitigate climate change in a meaningful way,” he told CNA.  Mr Zhang also cited the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, which he said suggested that “globally, we will see more floods, changes in temperatures, more frequent rainfall”.  “A third of Singapore, including its central business district, is less than 5m above mean sea level. Singaporeans have cause for concern, as it will literally be a situation of sink or swim if nothing is done,” he added. One company that will soon walk the talk is DBS.  Building on its commitment to achieve “net-zero operational carbon emissions” by 2022, the bank will transform an existing four-storey office building at 135 Bukit Timah Road into Singapore’s first net-zero development by a bank, DBS said in a press release in July.  Modifying an existing building is known as “retrofitting”. “We thought, what can be more green than not tearing down the building that we already have? … We said, hey, let’s truly challenge ourselves. Can we actually turn it into a net-zero building?” shared Mr Erwin Chong, Group Head of Corporate Real Estate Strategy and Administration at DBS.  “(There’s) carbon that has already been used. There’s concrete, there’s cost, there’s everything that has already been built. (So that) set the ambition and the way we look at it. All of that fits with our responsible business practices and goals.”  Another principle guiding DBS in the process is that their building should “blend in with the existing environment”, much like the NUS SDE4 building.  “We’re very near Botanic Gardens, a nice green patch of land in Singapore. The last thing we want is to create a building that looks like a concrete thing. We also wanted to make sure that we give back to the environment and the community,” added Mr Chong.  Speaking to CNA about BCA's zero-energy building that was built more than a decade ago by retrofitting a building within the BCA Academy, Mr Ang pointed to the concept of “passive design”.  “It’s about harnessing the energy from the external environment to create a space that’s conducive for the end-users. This is probably the first step that most buildings must take - deploy as many passive design strategies as possible,” he said.  “One concept that we're trying to promote very aggressively is the use of natural ventilation, even in office space. We recognise that it's challenging, because now I think the acceptance of air conditioning is almost the (default) mindset. “I think we need to do a lot of demonstration projects around what we call mixed mode ventilation, which means that you have a hybrid kind of system.” Mr Ang also said BCA employs “smart energy management”, which is the opposite of a “one size fits all” approach in many offices, where a central system controls the lights and air-conditioning for the entire building.  “We wanted to give power to the individual, in terms of air-conditioning and lighting. For instance, they will (gauge) the right level of light for their own workspace; if other people are not using the space, then the light might not be so bright … We need to make sure that the demand is met just right, so we don't waste energy unnecessarily,” he said.  But engineering and design challenges aren’t the only hurdles in adopting net-zero buildings.  It’s also about changing deep-rooted mindsets, whether it’s about embracing sustainability in our daily lives or accepting a lack of need for air-conditioning, said experts.  “My own opinion is that people are guarded by mindset. They (often) think of a traditional (type) of building, especially in a tropical climate like Singapore, with the air-con and all that. It’s a big deciding factor as to why people don't adopt this (net-zero concept). Because it’s not traditional, or it’s not the general (way that things are done),” said DBS’ Mr Chong.   Concerns around cost and air-conditioning need to be addressed, added Mr Ang.  “One concern is the cost (of net-zero buildings). What is the incremental cost? … There is a premium, but it will pay for itself, because the savings from running the operation will offset the upfront incremental costs.”  And where Singaporeans’ love for air-conditioning is concerned, changing their behaviour might take more than a little convincing.  “We started to have discussions around what indoor air comfort is, and it’s probably a function of three factors: The temperature you maintain within the space, the humidity and the airflow. When you talk about these three things together, I think people’s acceptance level (of using less air-con) becomes higher,” said Mr Ang.  “They realise that with a bit of draft, you can do with a higher temperature. It’s more comfortable that way. When the temperature is low, it might not be so good for the skin.” Changing individual mindsets will mean that more companies make plans to build or retrofit their own net-zero buildings – and DBS hopes theirs can eventually be a blueprint of sorts.  “We’re not trying to just make this one net-zero building. This is part of an overall change in how we're looking at our space. We want to apply it to everything. Should all of our space be net-zero, we wanted to do it right,” shared Mr Prescott Gaylord, Head of Sustainability for Corporate Real Estate at DBS.  “We wanted to use technologies, try things, such that it could be applied to our whole portfolio, and that it was accessible enough so that anyone else could copy us. We're not trying to hold on to any of our information. It will all be publicly available on the BCA website, if nothing else. We wanted to have a (greater) impact with our net-zero thinking.”  Mr Chong echoed his sentiments, hoping that big companies can think about net-zero beyond their premises and use their influence to encourage other companies to consider doing more. “It is still important to go do your CSR (corporate social responsibility) activities, like cleaning the beach every now and then. But if it’s not part of your core business activities, where you can implement this at a (higher) level or (bigger) scale, then you’re not doing your duty, since you are able to (have more) impact,” he said.  “When I talk to Singaporeans about it, I think there is a great kind of camaraderie and civic understanding in doing your part. … I think people in general understand that we have to take care of each other,” added Mr Gaylord.  Ultimately, experts agreed that the concept of net-zero buildings might be difficult to grasp if it’s seen as too technical for the layman. Instead, consider this: Net-zero is fundamentally about improving the individual’s quality of life.  Whenever NUS’ Dr Kishnani talks to people about zero energy, they assume it’s a “cost-saving issue or a technology issue”, but the SDE project has shown him that it makes for “a much better quality of life”, he said.  “The hybrid cooling system is not just saving us money; it's improving the health of our students and staff who use the building because it's 100 per cent fresh air, as compared to a conventional air conditioning system which is recirculated air. So we have less risk from spread of pathogens or build-up of carbon monoxide indoors,” he shared.  The zero-energy target is not something that “stands on its own as a numerical target”, and neither is it solely “an engineering problem”, he added.  “It’s a different way of thinking about design. And if you think about it creatively, you bring to the table a lot of other benefits to the quality of our lives, and to our safety and our health … It’s a design problem, an everyday life problem.”  Dr Kishnani pointed out that it would help to reframe the issue of sustainability so that people don’t see it as a sacrifice or ask what they must give up.  “If you think about sustainability in the right mindset, it’s a bonus to our lives. It creates pleasure, beauty and a higher quality of life. I think this is the thing that gets lost in the conversation, because there is a climate emergency so we're all reacting to that, and then there are issues of cost. They don't look at what value it brings to our lives, like how it changed the way we teach or how we experience the indoor environment,” he said.  “We have to see (sustainability) not as an either/or situation, but as an and/also situation: If we do that, we get this as well.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/advertorial/5-ideas-fun-filled-school-break-without-leaving-country-2110716,5 ideas for a fun-filled school break without leaving the country,"School holidays are both boon and bane for parents. Most love to see the joy in their children’s eyes and relish that there isn’t a need to wake up before dawn to prep them for class. On the other hand, it is now on you to plan your kids’ days with activities to avoid the inevitable cries of “I’m bored!”  With overseas travel remaining a distant dream for now, filling up your family calendar isn’t as easy as taking a short flight to a novel new land.  Rather than treating school holidays as one more thing on your to-do list, approach it as a precious opportunity to bond. After a stressful year filled with home-based learning and disruptions to family routines, time carved out to reconnect as a family can serve as a balm for the soul.   With the likelihood that movement restrictions are set to ease , the school holidays offer a chance for you and your kids to shake off cabin fever, try new things and spend quality time together. Singapore may be small, but it is densely packed with activities for different interests and age groups. There are memories to be made and there is no better time than now. Here are some ideas for a fun-filled school break. 1. TURN A STAYCATION INTO AN ADVENTURE Staycations have replaced the overseas vacation for now, so why not up the ante and sprinkle a little adventure into the experience?  Go Glamping SG offers a luxury camping experience for the family in the heart of wild Kranji. Located at Gallop Kranji Farm Resort, each roomy tent comes equipped with two queen-sized mattresses, a patio, a portable air-conditioner and a personal campfire that doubles as a BBQ pit. Explore the natural surroundings and for an additional fee, go on a thrilling ATV ride on the grounds.  If you’re looking to indulge a little more, Pan Pacific Singapore and the Ritz-Carlton, Millennia Singapore offer family packages that include kid-sized tents and teepees in the comfort of a suite. There are also kids’ clubs in the hotel where the little ones can go wild, while you luxuriate in the spa.  HSBC credit cardholders can enjoy 15 per cent off staycations on Agoda and up to 10 per cent cashback on hotel bookings on booking.com. 2. PLAN A MINI-FAMILY OLYMPIC GAMES Nothing gets the adrenaline going like friendly competition. Take advantage of post-Olympic Games fever and hold a family athletic meet. This activity requires some advanced planning, but the memories made will be more than worth it.  Put together a series of easy sports like an obstacle course, a 100m sprint and a trampoline competition. The games can easily take place in a public park, stadium and trampoline facility with simple equipment. Remember to pack water and light snacks to keep the family hydrated and energised.   No Olympic Games is complete without awarding medals and a closing ceremony, and crafting some prizes only adds to the fun. 3. GET THEIR HANDS DIRTY The school holidays offer an opportunity for children to learn new skills without the stress of scoring As. Instead of signing them up for another tuition session, take advantage of parent-and-child creative workshops that go beyond the basic art class.  Singapore’s child enrichment industry has exploded with a variety of lessons that both adults and kids can take part in, from cooking and leatherworking to sewing and pottery.   Exploring non-academic passions together is a great way to bond and you might even discover a new hobby for yourself.  4. VISIT A VIRTUAL WORLD With few options to leave the island, why not explore the virtual world instead? There’s no need to invest in a pricey home virtual reality (VR) set when award-winning VR parks offer more space to play and professionals to guide the young ones.  Hologate Singapore offers a wide range of multiplayer games from dance to escape games that the whole family can play together. If you prefer a mix of the virtual and real worlds, Virtual Room puts you and your family in dedicated personal rooms where you will have to work together to solve puzzles and challenges. HSBC credit cardholders enjoy exclusive one-for-one offers at Hologate Singapore and Virtual Room when using the ENTERTAINER with HSBC app. 5. EXPLORE THE HIDDEN SIDE OF SINGAPORE If you have a car, take a family adventure off the beaten track. The Kranji Heritage Trail is a self-guided tour that covers 14 historical and agricultural markers tracing landmarks such as the first landing site of Japanese troops during World War II, the Kranji War Memorial and Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve. Along the way, explore different farms and expose the little ones to a different side of Singapore. Alternatively, eschew crowded parks and uncover hidden gems in Singapore’s park system. Breathtaking sunset views and family photo opportunities can be found on the boardwalk of Rower’s Bay Park at Lower Seletar Reservoir. In the east, Tampines Eco Green offers easy hiking trails and rich flora and fauna, including camouflaged bird-watching stations. If you’re lucky, you might catch sight of a purple heron, the tallest bird seen in the park. HSBC Visa Platinum credit cardholders enjoy 5 per cent rebates off petrol, so you can traverse Singapore in comfort and save money for the other important things in life.  While you plan for your kids' fun, enjoy cashback, rewards and more with your HSBC credit cards.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/temperatures-warmer-climate-change-singapore-urban-planning-developments-2107851,"With temperatures rising, how can Singapore shape its future developments to keep cool?","SINGAPORE: The relentless and punishing heat in July saw Singapore's temperatures soaring above 34 degrees Celsius for 14 days. But while the heat blanketed most of the country, some parts were hotter than others. Records from the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS) show that the eastern parts of Singapore have consistently seen higher temperatures than the rest of the island. Moving forward, how these areas will be developed will play a significant role in the way heat distributions pan out, said experts. This also comes after a major report released on Aug 10 by the United Nations' intergovernmental panel on climate change sounded a warning bell on rising temperatures in the coming decades. In the first half of the year, eastern areas such as Marine Parade and Changi bore the brunt of the heat compared to other parts of Singapore, according to climate maps from MSS. In some months, the difference was nearly as much as 4 degrees Celsius. Data of historical temperature extremes from MSS also shows that Paya Lebar saw the highest monthly mean temperatures on record for seven months of the year. Four of them were recorded in 2019, the country's hottest year to date.  While a range of factors, such as cloud cover and rainfall, can affect the air temperature in an area, discrepancies could also be due to the urban heat island effect. This is a phenomenon that occurs when natural land cover is replaced by urban surfaces that absorb and trap heat, such as buildings and roads. Studies have shown that this has caused temperature differences of up to 7 degrees Celsius between urban and less built-up areas in Singapore. In this respect, Singapore is “asymmetric”, said weather and climate scientist Koh Tieh Yong, an associate professor at the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS). ""The concentration of urban areas just means that you have more buildings and roads that trap heat. On the whole, the hotspots are usually in the eastern side,” said Assoc Prof Koh. This eastern side, stretching from Tampines to Hougang and Ang Mo Kio, is all urbanised, he said, meaning there are no ""big stretches of vegetation”. ""If you look at the rest of Singapore, there's the central catchment area, and in the western area, you have reservoirs and green spaces reserved for military training, as well as rural agricultural areas,” said Assoc Prof Koh. A massive upcoming development in Paya Lebar could further change the urban climate in eastern Singapore. The relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase from 2030 will free up 800 hectares of land – equivalent to about five Toa Payoh towns. This will be progressively transformed into a ""highly liveable and sustainable” new town, according to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA). Satellite images of Singapore also show undeveloped greenery in the area.  The greenery will inevitably be removed for the new town. But how it will be redeveloped will affect the urban climate for residents from Tampines to Sengkang, said climate scientist Winston Chow, an associate professor at the Singapore Management University (SMU). In recent years, greater public awareness has led to calls against clearing existing forests for urban developments. The proposed redevelopment of Ulu Pandan – including the 33ha Dover Forest – for housing needs led to a public outcry earlier this year. Following months of consultations, authorities announced in July that only a third of the plot would be used for housing, and land will be set aside for a nature park. Plans for the rest of the plot will be deferred until around 2030. Such cases have cast the spotlight on Singapore's perennial issue of land scarcity, and the ongoing tension between the need for urban development and the need to preserve green spaces for their environmental value. Authorities have also been intensifying tree-planting efforts, for instance, to mitigate the urban heat island effect. Under a nationwide green movement, the country has pledged to plant 1 million trees in areas including industrial estates and along roads by 2030. But Assoc Prof Koh said these may not be enough to bring down temperatures.  ""You can (already) achieve a lot by shading people away from direct sunlight for their thermal comfort, but that does not bring down the area's average temperature in the vicinity,” said Assoc Prof Koh.  ""The fact is that we still have many more buildings and much more road surfaces, even in areas where we try to plant trees in our so-called garden city.” To keep cool, Singapore is also increasingly turning to science and technology. Efforts to study and mitigate the urban heat island effect have gained momentum, especially over the last two years. In 2019, an inter-agency working group led by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment and URA was launched to come up with mitigation strategies. During her Committee of Supply debate speech in Parliament earlier this year, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu announced plans to deploy a network of climate sensors across the country, along with other initiatives to tackle the problem.  These sensors, she said, would measure and collect data on ambient temperature, relative humidity and wind speeds, helping to close the knowledge gaps on urban heat island effect. Singapore is also embarking on a large-scale pilot on the use of ""cool paints"" in housing estates, with a goal of bringing down ambient temperatures by up to 2 degrees Celsius. The pilot comes under a 10-year plan to make Housing and Development Board (HDB) towns more sustainable and liveable. Heat-reflective paint will be used on 130 HDB blocks in Tampines – an estate that was chosen because it had ""a higher average land surface temperature compared to other towns”. ""The outcome of this pilot will help us test the market readiness of cool paints for wider implementation and pave the way for its use in more HDB towns, to mitigate urban heat effects and further improve the liveability of our HDB towns,” said the Housing Board's CEO, Mr Tan Meng Dui. The project, including a review of outcomes, is due to be completed by 2024. HDB will also study whether surrounding greenery will affect the performance of these paints and lead to a further reduction in ambient temperature. Private developers here have also been working on designing cooler buildings. Common practices include orienting buildings to the north-south direction to allow for more natural ventilation and to reduce exposure to the sun during the day. Installing solar panels on top of the building, or on its facade, can also act as ""sun-shading devices” to reduce the heat load into the building, said Mr Mark Yeo, CBRE Singapore's chief operating officer for property management. Energy-efficient practices such as recovering waste heat from air-conditioners to warm indoor pools and showering facilities could become more common in future, with some developers already exploring such solutions, he said.   With the updated Green Mark Certification, which evaluates a building's environmental impact and performance, there is a focus on carbon-neutral or super low energy buildings as the “right building model”, Mr Yeo added. Leveraging technology can also help to better manage resources, as the country adapts to climate change. For instance, in the upcoming Tengah district, sensors will be embedded in infrastructure, street lamps and bus stops, collecting a wealth of real-time environmental data. If linked to district cooling plants, Assoc Prof Chow said operation capacity can be adjusted accordingly. ""In terms of adaptation, you try to integrate a high resolution of environmental data with the decision-making to immediately respond to real-time events, so that the population there won't be unduly exposed to bad environmental conditions,” he said.  Ultimately, having an ever-evolving blueprint to tackle climate change will be key in making the country more resilient.  ""There's no end-point ... or saying we've achieved a gold standard or anything like that,” said Assoc Prof Chow.  ""The best sort of adaptation is proactive rather than reactive. You anticipate what can happen to reduce the impact and risks accordingly.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sustainability/tampines-cooling-buildings-eco-friendly-towns-2122426,"Greener system of cooling buildings may be set up in Tampines, paving the way for more eco-friendly towns","SINGAPORE: Several buildings in Tampines central may soon be retrofitted with a cooling system that is more energy efficient, after a feasibility study found that it could lead to a 17 per cent reduction in electricity consumption. Known as distributed district cooling, the proposed network for Tampines involves having the existing cooling systems of selected buildings produce chilled water to serve the building and others around it. The buildings will all be interconnected via insulated pipes that can distribute and circulate the chilled water in a closed loop. In the study conducted by Temasek and SP Group, 14 buildings in Tampines central were involved, including retail malls, commercial and public offices, data centres and a community sports hub. On Thursday (Aug 19), the owners of seven of those buildings, including CapitaLand and Frasers Property, signed letters of intent with SP to pledge their interest in subscribing to the distributed district cooling network. “I am hopeful that the adoption of this green cooling solution will bring Tampines closer to our ambition to be an Eco Town by 2025 and pave the way for district cooling to be explored across other towns and built-up areas,” said the adviser to Tampines Grassroots Organisations Masagos Zulkifli, who is also Minister for Social and Family Development. “Sustainable towns and districts are essential for Singapore to meet our sustainability goals under the Singapore Green Plan 2030.” The proposed cooling network for Tampines differs from the usual district cooling systems in greenfield sites – or new developments planned from a clean slate – such as the upcoming Tengah precinct, where the systems are incorporated into the design of the new development. In Tampines, where existing buildings already have their own chiller plant systems, a “distributed” district cooling network can be a “game changer”, said SP Group and Temasek in a joint media release. A district cooling system can be likened to a giant air-conditioner that can cool an entire district of buildings rather than just individual ones. Chilled water is generated in a central cooling plant before being piped to various buildings through an underground network to provide air conditioning. Warmer water is then circulated back to the cooling plant, so that they can be chilled again and redistributed to buildings. One area that has implemented a district cooling system is Marina Bay. Designed and operated by SP, the underground system serves 16 developments in the area, including Marina Bay Sands, the Marina Bay Financial Centre, as well as One Raffles Quay. By centralising the production of chilled water, about 25,000 sq m of prime land space was freed up for other uses, as buildings did not have to build their own chiller plant. The upcoming Tengah precinct will also house Singapore’s first residential centralised cooling system. On Thursday, Temasek and SP also released a white paper that consolidated key findings from the feasibility study that started last year on the 14 Tampines buildings. The report outlined the economic and environmental benefits of having district cooling systems in existing developments as well as the challenges in setting them up. Among the findings, the study found that implementing such a system could lead to a 17 per cent reduction in energy consumption and significant cost savings. It estimated that S$4.3 million can be saved annually due to lower energy consumption, reduction in equipment replacement and maintenance costs, as well as potential earnings from freeing up chiller plant space which can be converted into retail or office space. Reductions in energy usage and the amount of refrigerant used to cool buildings can also result in an 18 per cent cut in carbon emissions. However, rolling out such a system in an area that has already been developed is not without challenges. The district cooling system provider will have to navigate the existing built environment and may face several constraints such as having to minimise disruptions to existing operations in order to implement the system. Given these challenges, Temasek and SP said the white paper can serve as a “useful blueprint” for other districts looking to reduce their energy consumption from cooling, as Singapore looks for solutions to address the climate emergency, they said. Providers can also work with the building owners to optimise and incorporate district cooling considerations right from the design stage of the projects. SP said it will work closely with the building owners to factor in their considerations in the commercial terms of the supply agreement. During the installation and retrofitting period, the group said it will also engage relevant government agencies on ways to lay the chilled water pipes in order to optimise resources while minimising inconvenience to the public. Meanwhile, discussions with the other building owners who supported the study are continuing, Temasek and SP said. Both parties will work together to launch the first phase of the network in Tampines. If the distributed district cooling network is installed in Tampines central, SP said it could also be extended to nearby HDB blocks in future. The group added, however, that it is important to ensure that the base operations are stable before looking into the possibility of extending the network into residential areas. Opportunities to scale brownfield district cooling systems in other parts of Singapore will also be explored."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sustainability/jurong-island-testbed-sustainable-solutions-circular-economy-study-2122981,Jurong Island to serve as a 'living' test bed for sustainable technology,"SINGAPORE: Jurong Island will serve as a “living” test bed for sustainable solutions for the first time, as the industrial estate transforms into a sustainable energy and chemicals park. Two innovation calls aimed at coming up with solutions to boost the circular economy and reduce carbon footprint were announced by JTC on Thursday (Aug 19).  The first - Jurong Island Innovation Challenge - will crowdsource innovative ideas from startups and small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) to enhance the sustainability and circularity of resources. According to JTC, the industry players such as Chevron Oronite, Shell and Singapore LNG Corporation will be participating in the call, and will come together to submit 10 challenge statements. The challenge statements cover four key themes that will boost resource efficiency efforts: Energy efficiency, emissions reduction, water management and chemical waste management. SMEs that put forth proposals will gain opportunities to work with large corporates and will also receive funding support for the development of their solutions, said JTC. Under the enterprise track, qualifying startups and SMEs can tap on ESG’s Enterprise Development Grant, which can provide support for up to 80 per cent of the qualifying solution development costs. For selected challenge statements, awarded solution providers will receive up to S$2 million in grant support under the National Innovation Challenge, for solution development and industry adoption. “Through this innovation call, startups and SMEs will have the opportunity to showcase their capabilities in addressing real-world circularity challenges, and work with prominent industry players to develop and testbed solutions for wider deployment eventually,” said Mr Png Cheong Boon, Chief Executive Officer of ESG. “We hope that such pilot projects help build up the track records of our startups and SMEs, and enable them to seize more opportunities in the green economy both locally and globally.” The second innovation call is a request for proposals for energy solutions that can reduce the island’s carbon footprint. Scheduled to be launched in October, the call will focus on test-bedding renewable energy and energy storage systems such as high-efficiency solar panels and solar deployment on pipe racks and storage tanks. In addition to the innovation calls, JTC, Singapore LNG Corporation and other agencies will also embark on a new project to pursue the use of cold technology for the Jurong Island ecosystem. If successful, it will enable cold energy to be harnessed efficiently from the SLNG terminal on Jurong Island and reduce its carbon footprint, said JTC. ""As Jurong Island transforms into a more sustainable energy and chemicals park, it can, and will, play a leading role in spurring game-changing technologies, making it more competitive and sustainable in the long term,"" said JTC CEO, Mr Tan Boon Khai. The innovation calls come after a JTC-led circular economy study identified opportunities in the areas of clean energy use, water recycling and recovery, and the sustainable recovery and treatment of chemical waste. Launched in 2019, the study involved 51 companies including Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell. These companies shared data on energy, water and chemical waste, as well as identified potential synergies to reduce resource use at the system-level. Among the key findings, the Jurong Island Circular Economy (JICE) study found that there was scope for greater collaboration in the use of cleaner energy and exploration of new technologies. For instance, solar energy generation on the island can be scaled-up. To better optimise energy supply, an islandwide smart grid or network of smart grids can also be used to coordinate conventional and renewable energy generation. Besides improving energy efficiency, pursuing cleaner energy technologies can also help to reduce the overall carbon footprint of the island and increase the clean energy mix of companies on Jurong Island. The study also highlighted opportunities to improve water recycling and recovery as well as developing solutions for more sustainable waste recovery and treatment of chemical waste. However, implementing such solutions comes with some challenges, as some technologies have not reached the level of maturity, or may be energy-intensive. Speaking at the closing webinar of the study, Second Minister for Trade and Industry Tan See Leng said the innovation calls will help to better address these challenges. “For our sustainability efforts to really take off, we need go much further. Our industries must transform and achieve breakthroughs in carbon and energy efficiency and we must also do more with what we have,” he said. “Our hope is that the JICE study and innovation calls will help catalyse new ideas, underscore how our industrial estates can be a living testbed for new solutions that could serve as engines of growth for the future, and give new impetus for our energy and chemicals sector to enhance its competitiveness and produce sustainably for the world,” he added."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sustainability/pras-association-plastic-recycling-waste-2118121,New association launched to help enhance rate of recycling plastic waste in Singapore,"SINGAPORE: The newly launched Plastics Recycling Association of Singapore (PRAS) will enhance Singapore's capability in plastics recycling by bringing together various stakeholders to exchange knowledge and best practices on plastic waste management and recycling, said Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu on Tuesday (Aug 17). The association was officially inaugurated on Tuesday. Speaking at the launch of PRAS, Ms Fu outlined three areas of opportunities that it can harness.  First, PRAS will develop and expand Singapore's capabilities for plastic waste. One way of doing this is through a beverage container return scheme for packaging waste, she shared. The scheme will hold producers, such as beverage companies, accountable for the collection and recycling of their beverage bottles. Consumers will get a refund when they return empty beverage containers at designated return points.  Ms Fu added that a PET bottle recycling facility in Singapore would be one way for PRAS to strengthen Singapore's local capability in recycling PET bottles. Such a facility will create economic value and green jobs locally, as well as bring expertise in areas like precision engineering, manufacturing of recycling equipment, and plastic recycling processes, she said. PET stands for polyethylene terephthalate, a form of polyester. It is moulded into plastic bottles and containers for packaging foods and beverages, personal care products, and many other consumer products commonly used in Singapore. Secondly, PRAS can explore new solutions in plastic waste recycling, collaborating with Singapore's ""research and development ecosystem"", said Ms Fu.  ""For example, a team from A*STAR's Institute of Chemical and Engineering Sciences is developing a solution to recover PE and PET layers in multi-layered films, while a team from Temasek Polytechnic's Centre for Urban Sustainability is looking at processing mixed plastic waste into ingredients for building and construction applications,"" said Ms Fu.  Finally, she added that PRAS can create opportunities to bring about a ""circular economy"" beyond Singapore. ""Singapore is certainly not alone in recognising the need for a circular approach when using our resources,"" the minister said. Ms Fu cited Malaysia's roadmap towards zero single-use plastics, and Indonesia's circular economy approach towards sustainable growth and development. Through bodies like PRAS, there are opportunities for Singapore to ""accelerate the shift towards plastics circularity in our region"", she said.  ""While plastic is a critical component in our manufacturing and logistical processes, its impact on the environment cannot be ignored. The current business-as-usual mode cannot continue. The world is urgently in need of sustainable solutions to plastic waste,"" said Ms Fu.   PRAS president Edwin Khew said: ""We're all stakeholders who are manufacturers of raw plastic material and pallets, producers of plastic products, consumers, collectors and recyclers of waste plastic ... and can be involved on a singular platform to help move the recycling needle of plastics from 4 per cent to 30 per cent and then to 70 per cent within the next five to 10 years. ""This will be PRAS' aspirational targets for plastic recycling in Singapore, which we hope to achieve with recycling technologies and new plastic technologies that we will be introducing into Singapore by Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) we will be signing."" In a separate press release, PRAS said it has established the Plastics Recycling Centre of Excellence to find innovative solutions to address the ""ubiquitous plastic waste in Singapore"". The centre aims to fast track and customise ""leading edge solutions"" to Singapore, then serve as a reference to facilitate ASEAN countries' own recycling projects, said PRAS. The centre will sign five MOUs with different partners focusing on a range of skills training, and research and development collaborations to achieve a higher circularity of plastics.  Ms Fu also announced that the new Tuas Nexus Integrated Waste Management Facility (IWMF) will be the first infrastructure project by a statutory board to be financed through green bonds. The National Environment Agency has established a S$3 billion Multicurrency Medium Term Note Programme and a Green Bond Framework. Proceeds from the issuance of notes will be used to finance sustainable infrastructure projects, such as the IWMF, said the minister. The Tuas Nexus facility will be Singapore's first integrated facility to treat incinerable waste, source-segregated food waste, and dewatered sludge.  ""In Singapore, our amount of waste generated locally has increased sevenfold over the last 40 years. Our only landfill, the Semakau Landfill, will run out of space by 2035, based on the current waste disposal rate, even with incineration,"" said Ms Fu.  She added that Singapore generated 868,000 tonnes of plastic waste in 2020, with only 4 per cent being recycled, making plastic waste one of the country's ""largest waste streams"".  ""It is clear we need a paradigm shift - to move from a linear approach of take, make and throw, to a circular one where waste becomes resource and is reused over and over again. And we need to move fast,"" she said. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/advertorial/5-ways-teach-your-kids-importance-sustainability-2088886,5 ways to teach your kids the importance of sustainability,"Climate change is undeniable. According to experts, record-breaking temperatures, unprecedented rainfall, widespread forest fires and other global natural disasters are signs that the earth’s ecosystems have reached a tipping point.  With fewer natural landscapes and heavy reliance on air-conditioning, the signs of climate change may not seem as dramatic to the average Singaporean. However, all reports point to median temperatures rising steadily through the decades, and if temperatures continue to trend upwards, there will be dire consequences on life as we know it. While the biggest contributors to climate change are larger-scale practices like deforestation or burning fossil fuels for electricity and heat, there are also aspects of daily life that affect the climate. Practices such as the over-consumption of goods lead to increased plastic wastage – a material that cannot be broken down – and in turn, create massive landfills. Landfills and other waste systems produce methane, a greenhouse gas that destroys the ozone, contributing to climate change.  For parents especially, the gloomy prospects of a world traumatised by growing environmental hazards may be overwhelming. What sort of world will our children and grandchildren live in?   Instead of panicking, start educating. It is never too early to teach kids the importance of sustainability. Here are five ways you can start.   1. CARE FOR A PLANT Nothing says sustainability more than cultivating life.  Grow a plant with your kids and track its progress, educating them on the preciousness of life and the value of growing our own food. Teach your child how plants and trees support our lives in many ways, such as releasing oxygen, reducing ground-level ozone pollution and providing sustenance. You can start by planting microgreens – seedlings of edible vegetables and herbs – such as pea sprouts, chives or wheat grass, which take up little space and where progress can be seen relatively quickly. In less than two weeks, children will get to enjoy the fruits of their labour sprinkled on their favourite dishes, hammering home the point. There is another lesson to be learnt here: Parents can teach their children that no matter how the grown vegetables and herbs turn out, planted food may come in different shapes, sizes and may have blemishes. This however, does not make it any less safe to eat. In fact, you can show your kids how Singaporean grocer UglyFood specialises in less aesthetically-pleasing produce. Get 10 per cent off UglyFood bundles when you use your HSBC credit card and quote HSBCxUF as a promo code.  2. MAKE RECYCLING A HABIT Recycling is a cornerstone of sustainability and explaining the whys and hows of recycling will help build long-term habits that will follow your child into adulthood.  First, explain the difference between organic and inorganic materials. Materials that are not recycled are often sent to landfills or burnt in incinerators, which are not good practices for the planet.  Then, get the kids started on a recycling project by sorting items based on their different metal, paper, glass and plastic components. You can also point out to your kids the different types of recycling bins available in your neighbourhood. To cement the lesson, show them examples of items made with recycled materials and explain how repeated usage of materials helps the earth. A good example on hand is HSBC’s new credit cards that are made of recycled plastic. The bank is committing to eliminating single-use polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic in favour of recycled PVC plastic by the end of 2026. This act will help reduce CO2 emissions by 161 tonnes and save 73 tonnes of plastic a year. 3. CLEAN UP A BEACH A day out at one of Singapore’s beaches makes a fun excursion for the family and a great lesson on environmental impact. Seeing trash clogging up nature is an experiential way for kids to understand how thoughtlessly discarded items can kill wildlife and destroy natural ecosystems.  Equip your children with gloves, trash bags and tongs and spend an hour cleaning up a small stretch of the beach. By picking up cigarette butts, plastic bottles and other trash, your kids will learn that everyone can do their part to save the planet, however small, and the importance of discarding waste in designated bins. There are also several groups that one can find online to visit beaches with – a good way to introduce your children to other like-minded individuals who want the best for our planet.   4. VISIT A SUPERMARKET Growing up in a country with few farms, it is understandable that children may think that everything comes ready-made from a store. Teaching kids the intrinsic value of household items helps them to appreciate what they have – a great sustainability lesson in itself. The next time you shop for groceries, bring your kids along to the supermarket. Using an everyday item like milk, explain the natural resources and human labour that go into its creation: Dairy farms, trees milled for packaging and the transport of the finished product from overseas, to name a few steps. Additionally, you can point out eco-friendly products in the supermarket that use minimal packaging as good examples of sustainability. While you’re teaching your kids, you can also support your family's sustainable lifestyle and earn a 5 per cent cash rebate on groceries by applying for the HSBC Visa Platinum Credit Card. Additionally, get up to 15 per cent off when you shop at sustainable and ethical grocers such as Sasha's Fine Foods. 5. LIVE AND SHOP CONSCIOUSLY Children are shaped by their upbringing.  Parents leave the deepest impression on their children and are their role models. Through conscious living, spending wisely and making sustainable choices, you normalise positive behaviour and actions that your child will adopt as they grow into independence. Normalising this behaviour need not just be all action. Talking about sustainability and the mindfulness that comes with it can also help to build a solid foundation for your children to grow into it themselves.   Pursuing a low- or zero-waste lifestyle does not mean you have to compromise on quality or comfort. Enjoy up to S$60-worth of bill rebates when you choose to power your homes sustainably with Sembcorp Power’s Sunshine plan that offers 100% solar energy. Also, enjoy S$20 off daily essentials from partners like Sustainability Project to take that green step forward.  To help families save more on their spending and live consciously, apply for the HSBC Visa Platinum Credit Card to enjoy up to 5 per cent cash rebates on purchases, with up to S$1,000 cashback annually. Furthermore, take advantage of HSBC’s partnerships with leading sustainable merchants to enjoy exclusive rewards when you shop with your HSBC credit card. Start your conscious journey and receive up to S$200 cashback when you sign up for an HSBC credit card, now made from 85.5 per cent recycled printing and packaging industry waste.  Terms and conditions apply."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ntu-sweat-powered-battery-wearable-device-health-sensors-2115251,NTU scientists develop sweat-powered battery for wearable devices,"SINGAPORE: Scientists from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) have developed a sweat-powered battery, capable of generating enough energy to operate commercial temperature sensors. The prototype battery, which measures 2cm by 2cm, only requires 2ml of sweat to discharge 20 hours worth of electricity. The stretchable battery is meant to be used on wearable devices like watches and health sensors. It also does not require charging. Materials scientist Professor Lee Pooi See, who led the study, told reporters at a media briefing on Monday (Aug 16) that the device is also sustainable as it does not contain heavy metals or toxic chemicals, thus reducing harmful electronic waste.  Other members of the research team include NTU’s School of Materials Science and Engineering’s Dr Lyu Jian and Dr Gurunathan Thangavel. The study was published in the peer-reviewed journal Science Advances in July.  The battery is created by printing ink that contains silver flakes and hydrophilic poly(urethane-acrylate), which function as the battery electrodes, onto stretchable fabric. When sweat comes into contact with the battery, it improves the conductivity of the silver flakes and also causes an electric current to flow.  As the stretchable textile used is very absorbent, it retains a lot of sweat, allowing the battery to remain powered even when the rate of sweating is inconsistent.  This is vital for consistent functioning of the battery as the amount of sweat produced by people varies and depends on factors such as the area of the body, environmental conditions and time of day, added NTU.  The device is also “more durable” than current technology, said Prof Lee, as the team has shown that it can withstand strain from a wearer’s daily activities and repeated exposure to stress or sweat. The slimness of the battery additionally addresses two problems in wearable technology: It is sleeker and thus more attractive to consumers compared to traditional button batteries and it carries enough charge to last throughout the day, unlike current thinner batteries. However, Prof Lee noted some challenges in the use of the battery, including its ability to last longer when there is not enough sweat, or when faced with the inconsistent sweating rate for different people. Associate Professor Irene Goldthorpe from the University of Waterloo’s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, who is not involved in the research, said the study may open a “new paradigm” in the design of wearable electronics.  “It is well-known that electronics do not like moisture and thus wearable devices are typically fully encapsulated to shield them from sweat,” she said, adding that the study turns sweat “from a hindrance into an asset”. A patent application for the sweat-powered battery has also been filed through the university’s enterprise and innovation company, NTUitive. The researchers plan to further explore the effects of other components of human sweat and how factors such as body heat may affect the performance of the battery, added NTU.  In an email to CNA, Associate Professor Stefan Adams from the National University of Singapore's Department of Materials Science and Engineering raised concerns that the battery contains heavy metals.  He said that the battery used by Prof Lee and her team uses zinc and silver nanoparticles, silver oxide or silver chloride, adding that both are heavy metals. In response, the NTU team said that silver and silver oxides in the battery are ""stable, non-toxic and not in nanoparticles form"", while the zinc undergoes reduction to zinc oxide during the electrochemical reaction. ""We do not use hazardous heavy metal such as mercury that was used in conventional aqueous batteries. ""We recognise that silver in certain forms could pose an environmental threat, but the silver flakes, in their current form in the battery, do not form major free ions and are not considered an environmental risk."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/oil-gas-jobs-career-industry-uni-grad-green-sustainable-climate-change-2103636,Commentary: It's sad that graduates don’t want careers in oil and gas anymore,"LONDON: In the undying scene from the 1967 film The Graduate, the young Benjamin Braddock is at a gruesome party hosted by his parents when he is ambushed by the besuited middle-aged Mr McGuire. Throwing an arm around Benjamin, McGuire guides him through the suburban splendour of the house to the pool. “I just want to say one word to you. Just one word,” begins McGuire. Then, with the air of initiating Benjamin into the great grown-up secret: “Plastics.” A silence falls. Benjamin (played by Dustin Hoffman) eyes McGuire as if he’s deranged and asks, politely: “Exactly how do you mean?” McGuire urges, “There’s a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?” This classic scene of the 1960s’ generational clash – the materialistic old square versus the spiritual young baby boomer – resonates today. We too find ourselves in a burgeoning generational clash, albeit this time with Benjamin’s boomers as the old guard. So far, the clash has mostly been over issues of money, climate and the amorphous concept of “woke”. But, as in the 1960s, it’s also about something closer to home: Career choice. Some major professions – and the boomers in them – are becoming taboo for young people. For decades from the 1970s, the generational clash lapsed. Boomers had been shaped by the 1960s, so when they started families, they didn’t want to be joyless anti-sex authoritarians like some of their own parents. They tried to understand their children rather than merely discipline them. The parent-child relationship evolved into something akin to friendship. But from 2008, the generational divide widened again. Younger people had their careers derailed by the financial crisis. Living in their parents’ homes, they watched once-stable middle-class professions such as academia, journalism and the civil service sink into precarity. They disagreed with their parents on issues of racism, gender and immigration. And above all, they inherited a poisoned planet. Climate change is the single biggest worry for 18- to 25-year-olds, according to a large-scale survey by Amnesty International in 2019. Older generations may pretend to care, but have shown by their emissions and voting records that they don’t. If you worry that you’ll be spending your old age on a planet that has warmed 3 degrees Celsius, you won’t be happy with the industries that helped heat it. Demonising them also allows you to displace blame from your own consumption habits. No wonder the oil and gas industry, despite its high salaries, is struggling to hire young workers. The number of business-school graduates choosing careers in oil and gas has dropped 40 per cent since 2006, partly for ethical reasons. Forty-four per cent of 20- to 35-year-olds and 62 per cent of 16- to 19-year-olds found a career in the industry unappealing, said a survey by EY in 2017. The young were much less likely than older people to believe that oil and gas were good for society. Other sectors – such as meat, aviation and indeed plastics – risk running into the same disapproval. Bankers and tobacco marketers already know how that feels. To some degree, I do too. Almost no profession enjoys less public esteem than journalism. Some years ago, reporting from a working-class town in northern England, I found myself in a volunteer after-school club in a church basement. Most of the volunteers were old ladies, and when I admitted to being a journalist, they turned away from me in horror, as if I had said I was a serial killer. The only one willing to talk to me said: “Don’t worry, dear. Everyone’s got to make a living somehow, don’t they?” Painful as this was, it was easier to cope with because this was a tribal rather than a generational clash. In my liberal urban bubble, trust in media remains quite high. Outside, it’s low. That divide is damaging to society, but is endurable on a personal level because I can get some respect by withdrawing into my tribe. It’s harder for the oil executive. He (and this is a male-dominated profession) may find himself demonised by his own children. That’s not very damaging to society because parents and children are held together by ties of love and money, but it can be personally devastating. How sharper than a serpent’s tooth it is to have a thankless child. I once wrote a book that entailed interviewing a lot of old men. I found that my interviewee would often receive me in a room of his house that was a sort of tribute to his career – which, for a man of that generation, was almost synonymous with his life. The room would be hung with his awards, photographs of his encounters with famous people, and portraits of his grinning descendants. The effect was to claim, in the words of Randy Newman’s mock-defiant song: “My life is good/My life is good/My life is good, you old bag.” One side-effect of the unfolding climate crisis will be to deny that comfort to some of today’s career successes."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/ipcc-2021-report-climate-change-impact-singapore-2100661,Commentary: Latest climate change report is the most important by far. Here's why,"SINGAPORE: Over the past three years, approximately 250 experts in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s Working Group I (WGI) writing team volunteered their time and expertise to author the sixth - and latest - assessment on the physical basis of climate change.  It is the first of a series of IPCC reports in each assessment cycle spanning approximately seven years, examining climate research undertaken since the last cycle ended in 2014.  The writing team faced considerable obstacles. The assessment cycle was extended because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which fundamentally changed how authors met and worked across borders and time zones in collaboratively writing multiple drafts.  Almost 80,000 comments on the drafts were submitted from expert reviewers and governments over the past three years; all had to be addressed for the report to pass the IPCC approval process.  They also faced the challenge of completing a report concise enough for policymakers seeking authoritative information on climate change, while simultaneously accounting for the explosion of climate literature published since 2014.  About 14,000 total citations to relevant literature were assessed - and even that voluminous amount doesn’t cover the staggering breadth of climate science research during that period. As such, the approved report released on Monday (Aug 9) is a monumental feat and the authors’ efforts should be applauded.  While the report’s fundamental conclusion - that climate change is happening and that humans are causing it - isn’t new, there are three key takeaways worth highlighting. First, stronger evidence has emerged of clear human influence on more frequent extreme weather events across the globe, such as rainfall, droughts, severe storms like cyclones, and from compound events like wildfires driven by heatwaves and dry conditions. We can say with strong confidence that historical “natural” variability of the climate system alone can no longer explain most extreme weather events experienced since 2014.  Instead, human influence, through increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land cover change, is now the prime suspect.  Second, it appears all but certain that average global surface temperatures, currently at 1.1 degrees Celsius above the baseline pre-industrial era in the 19th Century, will exceed the 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius threshold goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement. Without rapid cuts to the approximately 50 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent gases currently emitted worldwide per year, we will pass 1.5 degrees Celsius sometime early during the next decade.  Even the reduced emissions from COVID-19 lockdowns over the past 18 months will not slow future temperature increases; the temporary blip is more than offset by the momentum from decades of accelerating global GHG emissions that won’t abate.  Yet, the report also assesses that scenarios with stringent global GHG emissions cuts during this decade, resulting in net-zero emissions by 2050, can stabilise temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius - and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius - by 2100. This small window of opportunity to meet the Paris Agreement goal, however, will continue shrinking every year without substantive action.  Third, the need for action is urgently critical since the report clearly articulates a bleak climate future without achieving the net-zero goal.  A useful analogy with the recently concluded Tokyo Olympics may help illustrate this point. Adding GHG emissions to the climate system and the resulting change in extreme weather is akin to an athlete’s health when continuously using performance-enhancing drugs.  Record-breaking extreme weather events like the heatwaves, severe storms, and wildfires that we’ve seen across the globe over the past few months are likely to occur more frequently in the years to come, just like record sporting performances from athletes’ consistent usage of human growth hormone or anabolic drugs. As continued steroid use often leads to debilitating chronic health issues for athletes, the report also stresses long-term and potentially irreversible changes to our planet, such as the continued melting of massive Greenland and Antarctic glaciers leading to dangerous levels of sea level rise.  Just like drug overuse in sports can damage an athlete’s future health and lead to premature death, we must therefore be wary of uncontrolled GHG emissions and its detrimental risks to societies.  Indeed, these risks can be existential, as Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted in his 2019 National Day Rally regarding the environmental and geopolitical threats of rising sea levels to Singapore. In this IPCC assessment cycle, detailed information into climate risk assessment, particularly on climate hazards arising under different global warming levels (i.e., 1.5, 2 degrees Celsius or beyond), is available for discrete geographical regions like Southeast Asia. While the report describes and assesses such risks for different regions in detail, one exciting development stands out.  The regional variations in climate - from historical data and from projected climate model simulations assessed by the IPCC - will be publicly available through an interactive online atlas.  Users can analyse and download the numerous datasets used in the report for their regions of interest, and access synthesised information for climatic impact drivers such as temperature, rainfall and sea level rise. As an educator, it is often difficult to dynamically display the variety of potential climate futures for my students, especially at regional levels and over different time periods.  They - and their families and loved ones who live, work and play in Southeast Asia - are more invested in knowing how climate change affects them locally, which can be significantly different than the global “big-picture” impacts.  For instance, the atlas illustrates that some coastal Southeast Asian cities like Manila likely face greater risks from wet weather extremes and more intense tropical cyclones, while other cities in the region like Singapore instead face greater heat risks with each degree Celsius of additional warming.  Having this atlas will be an exciting communication tool to clearly illustrate concepts of climate science for students and for many other stakeholders affected by climate change, as well as demonstrate the regional outcomes of global action (or inaction) on GHG emissions.  The report articulates the dire nature of the climate emergency we face, and provides important information for accelerating action towards the Paris Agreement goals in the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow held this November.  For the IPCC, subsequent reports building on WGI’s work will be released next year from Working Group II (dealing with climate impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability) in February, Working Group III (on climate mitigation) in March, and a Synthesis Report from all Working Groups in September. Taken together, these documents provide an important blueprint for people to understand what can be done to address the climate emergency we face.  However, our work as IPCC authors has one important caveat. While we objectively assess relevant science-based climate policy options for governments, we do not formally prescribe such policies in our reports. As I tell my students, we climate scientists can authoritatively answer questions of whats, whys, and wherefores of climate change.  The important climate policy questions starting with “should”, however, have to be determined collectively by decision-makers in each country and the people who support them, based on the best information available.

He is also a lead author for two urban chapters in the IPCC’s WG II assessment report due in February 2022 and a contributing author to the WG I report. The views expressed in this commentary are his own."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-studies-uns-latest-climate-change-report-it-continues-plan-and-implement-adaptation-measures-2101531,Singapore studies UN’s latest climate change report as it continues to plan and implement adaptation measures,"SINGAPORE: The Centre for Climate Research Singapore is studying findings from the UN’s latest climate change report to see how they impact Singapore and to inform its policy recommendations.
 
On Monday (Aug 9), the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a major report detailing the latest scientific assessments of climate change. It is the first of three reports which will make up the panel’s Sixth Assessment Report.
 
The panel’s key findings include the clear influence of humans on climate change, resulting in the warming of the atmosphere, ocean and land. 
 
It warned that unless deep – and quick – cuts in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions are made, global surface temperatures will cross the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold goal of the 2015 Paris Agreement sometime in the early 2030s. In the most aggressive emission scenario, the world could exceed that mark by the end of this decade. Today, the world is more than 1 degree Celsius hotter than it was during the pre-industrial period from about 1850 to 1900. Different emissions scenarios also show that the world will exceed the Paris Agreement’s 2 degrees Celsius threshold goal by this century. In addition, the report found that every region in the world is projected to experience more extreme droughts, intense and frequent rainfall, and flooding. Singapore said the findings underscore the urgency for the global community to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
 
“Singapore is committed to play our part. The Government will rally and partner Singaporeans and businesses to advance our national agenda on sustainable development, as set out in the Singapore Green Plan 2030,” said the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) and Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS) in a press release. 
 
“We will also leverage climate science to understand the effects of climate change on Singapore and press on with efforts to mitigate and adapt to them.”
 AREAS OF CONCERN 
 
The authorities highlighted three areas of concern – changes in temperature, rainfall and sea level rise – as well as their implications for Singapore. Findings from the summary for policy makers, which was released together with the IPCC report, suggest that Singapore could feel elevated temperatures in the coming decades, said the MSE and MSS. It is a concern for the country, which is already heating up faster than the rest of the world. Singapore’s annual mean temperatures have been steadily climbing from 26.9 degrees Celsius in 1980 to 28.0 degrees Celsius last year. Seven of the top 10 hottest years also fell within this decade, according to data from the MSS website. This is largely due to the urban heat island effect, where the heat generated from human activities are trapped by urban surfaces such as buildings and roads. Aside from this, Singapore may also see more intense and frequent rainfall, with global precipitation projected to increase with each additional degree of warming. Since 1980, the country’s average annual rainfall has increased at an average rate of around 70mm per decade. The intensity and frequency of heavy rainfall events have also increased over the past few decades up until 2012, but these trends were modulated by strong El Nino conditions in 2015 to 2016, the press release said. While it is challenging to pinpoint the cause of past rainfall changes in Singapore with current models due to a combination of factors, MSS said it will continue to study this, along with the impact of climate change on the country’s weather. RISING SEA LEVELS Another area of concern for low-lying countries like Singapore is rising sea levels. The report warned that under a low emission scenario, global mean sea levels could rise between 0.32m and 0.62m by the turn of the century. Under the highest emission scenario, sea levels could rise between 0.63m and 1.01m. The report also said sea level rise is virtually certain to continue throughout the 21st century in most regions of the world. While sea level change is not globally uniformed, and regional and local rates of sea level rise may differ from the global mean, MSE and MSS said Singapore will study sea level rise in “greater detail” under a national programme that aims to strengthen local research and provide more robust projections of sea level change for the country and the surrounding region. Findings from the national sea level programme will be contextualised by the Centre for Climate Research, which will also study their impact on Singapore. In the meantime, the centre has started work on its third national climate change study which will provide “localised and high-resolution” climate projections derived from the latest climate models used in the UN report. The study is expected to be completed by end-2022. The findings will guide the planning and implementation of adaptation measures to safeguard Singapore against the impact of climate change, said MSE and MSS. These measures will be continually reviewed and adjusted, as new knowledge and information on the effects of climate change become available, they added. A virtual symposium on climate change will also be held later this month to discuss the scientific findings of the report."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/garden-edible-urban-farm-nparks-grow-vegetable-fruit-food-security-sustainable-2095091,Commentary: Singaporeans are proving you can grow your vegetables and eat them too,"SINGAPORE: Each morning, when I step out of my back gate with my two-year-old before sending him to school, I am excited to point out a new bud bursting or another edible item ready for harvest.  He would point out a blue pea flower or even a bright red chilli not there the day before. Once in a while, we spot an orange flower and cross our fingers for a pumpkin, but the Singapore weather means such flowers usually wither within a few days.  There is great pity when that happens but therein lies lesson number one: Gardening is about the circle of life, of things dying as much as it is about the most suitable and carefully tended plants flourishing.  Fruits of our labour have a literal meaning to gardeners. My son has yet to take a liking to our green great hog plums, more affectionately known to us as kedondongs, but we point out the dishes prepared with it to him at the dining table. And it is a labour of love. My edible garden was once an infertile, small grass patch when we first moved in.  But thanks to my father who developed an interest in his retirement years and decided to try growing species that could be used in the kitchen, a luscious plot of flowering plants lies before us today. Gardening is also about community and sharing in our collective labouring.  It helps that I live in an estate of avid gardeners who readily share tips and their harvests of cherry tomatoes and jackfruits. Moringa, banana and mango trees grow freely in the neighbourhood – reminiscent of the kampung days of Singapore, my father said.  With more time spent at home, Singaporeans have been getting their hands dirty and discovering a whole new world of horticulture.  Local commercial farms, like Edible Garden City, have seen a surge in volunteer applications, along with an increase in the number of calls asking for home gardening advice. The Urban Farmers (Singapore) Facebook group saw a surge in membership since the onset of the pandemic. Members of the 48,000-strong group post about harvest successes, pro tips and the latest horticulture trends. Some users even swap plant cuttings and seeds. Meanwhile, NParks has been distributing free seed packets to households through their Gardening with Edibles initiative. Many of my friends and family took full advantage and now have a small edible garden in their homes too. Stuck together due to pandemic restrictions, my friends Valerie Lo, 29, and Francis Woo, 31, decided to start a home garden together. Tending to their starfruit, asparagus and melon plants at the end of a long day proved to be a great way to destress. Now veteran gardeners, they plan to secure a plot of land to experiment with other vegetables and fruits. COVID-19 has caused us to pause, reflect and invest in tomorrow. “Gardening is all in the future, and the less future people have, the more they tend to think about it,” famed public intellectual Germaine Greer once said. The gardening movement is only set to grow. NParks aims to increase the number of community gardens and allotment gardens by up to three times, to 3,000 of each by 2030.  The Community in Bloom initiative, a nationwide gardening movement, has seen over 40,000 gardening enthusiasts volunteer to care for farms or lease gardening plots in over 1,600 community gardens. Do our inclinations to grow plants at our doorsteps translate into a desire for more locally grown foods?  There is a practical side to pushing for local gardening on a commercial level. Rising interest in gardening and urban farming fits into the broader picture of Singapore’s food security aspirations.  Singapore relies heavily on imported food. We import more than 90 per cent of our nutritional needs from about 170 countries – but hope to produce 30 per cent of our nutritional needs by 2030 under the “30 by 30” goal. The pandemic has been a wake-up call to look inwards in terms of food security. We might remember waking up to empty shelves and snaking queues at our supermarkets in March 2020, when fears over the availability of food triggered panic buying. But can local produce take off? Farmers face high operating and capital costs. Land and manpower are expensive. Our farms also spend on marketing and outreach to grow their customer bases. According to a survey by Urban Origins, an overwhelming majority of Singaporeans are aware that local produce is fresher, more sustainable and that buying them contributes to the local economy. But buyers baulk at the price tag – local produce can cost up to 20 per cent more than imported produce. However, cost is set to be less of an issue. Farmers and food scientists are optimistic that prices of locally grown food will decrease as economies of scale are met. This looks set to happen in Singapore. Lim Chu Kang, where many traditional vegetable farms are situated, will be redeveloped to take Singapore’s agri-tech capabilities to the next level. With upgraded water, electricity and transport infrastructure to support high-tech farming, Lim Chu Kang could more than triple its current food production. Since COVID-19 revealed how vulnerable the status quo of importing food is, Edible Garden City founder Bjorn Low said smaller scale, decentralised urban farms on rooftops of malls and even carparks are the way forward. And Singaporeans are on board. “We are optimistic about ’30 by 30’, with the government strongly pushing urban farming by injecting funding and spreading awareness among locals. We have also personally noticed more Singaporeans supporting local agriculture, and choosing to buy local produce over imported varieties,” he said. There’s room for improvement. Local agriculture companies could do more to meet the demands of Singaporean consumers. Many focus on growing more commercially viable, high-value crops such as kale instead of vegetables more commonly found in our hawker culture and local cuisines, such as cabbage, kailan and kangkong. That needed mindset shift among consumers does not have to be a grand, sweeping change – it can start with the humble act of growing basil and thyme by the kitchen window, or visiting the farmers’ market, such as the one held in Kranji Countryside every three months. Getting involved in community farms is a good start for us, especially young ones, to appreciate the time and effort that go into growing something from farm to table. Today, my mother-in-law who stays with us and helps out with cooking is the main caretaker of the plants in our house. She finds joy in plucking the chilis and planting new kinds of seeds. She proudly tells my son that the lady’s fingers he eats are grown from our garden every time she prepares them. Just as it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a community to sow the seeds of appreciation among our young of how food reaches our plate. So start now, start at home and soak in the tenderness of cultivating your own food. It can be a tonic in these trying times. Suzanna Tang is Co-Founder of Urban Origins, a ground-up initiative connecting communities with local urban food. Urban Origins was a participant in the 2020 Youth Action Challenge Season 2, organised by the National Youth Council Singapore, where it won the outstanding award for its pitch on Urban Solutions and Sustainability."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-reviewing-sustainable-aviation-fuels-changi-airport-2087151,Singapore reviewing study findings on use of sustainable aviation fuels at Changi Airport,"SINGAPORE: Government agencies are reviewing the findings of a study conducted on the operational and commercial viability of using sustainable aviation fuels at Changi Airport, Transport Minister S Iswaran said on Tuesday (Aug 3). Such fuels can be produced from sustainable resources such as waste oil. It can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent, compared with conventional jet fuel on a lifecycle basis, but it is two to five times more expensive, Mr Iswaran said in Parliament. 
  The study, conducted by the Singapore Government and industry players, has presented options to integrate sustainable aviation fuels with traditional jet fuel at Changi Airport. For instance, at jet fuel facilities or at tank terminals in the existing supply chain. Based on the availability of feedstock in the region, as well as cost and lifecycle assessments, the study also identified viable feedstock-technology combinations for the production of sustainable aviation fuels in Singapore. In addition, it suggested various options to facilitate uptake and production of these fuels in Singapore. “Our agencies are reviewing the findings,” he said in response to a question from Member of Parliament (MP) Leon Perera (WP-Aljunied) who had asked for updates on the Government’s study. Mr Perera also asked if the Government is looking at the possibility of Singapore becoming a production or export hub for sustainable aviation fuels. The minister replied that industry players that focus on biofuels, such as Neste, are already part of Singapore’s broader petrochemical ecosystem. “We have always proactively wanted to anchor some of these more sustainable options as part of the broader fuel mix available in Singapore,” said Mr Iswaran. 
  Agencies are also studying how Singapore can produce sustainable aviation fuels for both domestic needs and exports, but there are supply constraints. “One of the things we need to look at is, how we can not just make it available in sufficient quantities which in itself is a challenge, but also do so in a manner that is cost competitive,” he told the House. Meanwhile, being able to produce sustainable aviation fuels locally will benefit Singapore-based carriers, as well as other carriers that come to Singapore. “Therefore, that is also a matter of export,” the minister added. “So long before we talk about physically exporting them to other locations, there are supply chain developments already taking place in Singapore. Our focus is on cost viability and adequate supply,” Mr Iswaran said. “Once we’re able to work on this and implement this, then it will be available to aviation players in Singapore, based out of Singapore using Changi as a hub, and potentially also for the region.” Separately, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, Singapore is participating in the voluntary phase of the International Civil Aviation Organization’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). The scheme aims to cap the emissions of the international aviation sector. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and Singapore-based carriers, such as Singapore Airlines, are monitoring and reporting the airlines’ submissions, under CORSIA, said Mr Iswaran."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-partnerships-capture-store-carbon-dioxide-2060521,"Singapore exploring partnerships to capture, store carbon dioxide as part of low-carbon push: Tan See Leng","SINGAPORE: As Singapore lacks suitable known geological formations needed to store carbon dioxide permanently underground, it is exploring partnerships with companies and other countries to do so . “Climate change is an existential challenge for Singapore,” said Second Minister for Trade and Industry Tan See Leng on Tuesday (Jul 27). He was responding to parliamentary questions by Dr Tan Wu Meng (PAP-Jurong) on the current state of carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) and the assessment of potential technological advancements in the sector for the next decade. According to Dr Tan See Leng, who is also the Minister for Manpower, one of Singapore’s key thrusts of its enhanced 2030 Nationally Determined Contributions and Long-term Low Emissions Development Strategy is to adopt advanced low-carbon technologies to decarbonise its economy. These technologies include CCUS and low-carbon hydrogen. CARBON CAPTURE, UTILISATION AND STORAGE A “small number” of pathways for CCUS are at a technologically advanced stage, but they require further development to be commercially viable in Singapore, said the minister. Carbon capture and storage is one of these pathways. While there are more large-scale projects developed internationally, Singapore faces challenges in deploying it domestically as it does not have known geological formations suitable for the permanent storage of carbon dioxide underground, he said. “We are therefore exploring partnerships with companies and other countries with suitable geological formations to enable carbon dioxide storage opportunities.” Carbon capture and storage is the process of capturing and storing carbon dioxide before it can be released into the atmosphere.  The Government is also exploring carbon capture and utilisation pathways, where carbon dioxide is captured and recycled, said the minister. The recycled carbon dioxide can be used to produce reclamation aggregates or building materials. “There are a number of companies developing test-beds for use in Singapore and examples of commercial-scale operations in other countries,” said Dr Tan See Leng. 
  In addition, captured carbon dioxide can be used to manufacture synthetic fuels and chemicals such as kerosene and methanol. They can be used as aviation and marine fuels. “However, most pathways for synthesising fuels or chemicals from carbon dioxide are not mature and they are relatively nascent,” said the minister. Some are more expensive than conventional methods of production, some remain at lab-scale and others require “significant amounts” of energy in the form of low-carbon hydrogen. LOW-CARBON HYDROGEN Dr Tan Wu Meng also asked questions on the state of Singapore’s low-carbon hydrogen sector. “Low-carbon hydrogen is a key technology for Singapore to decarbonise,” said Dr Tan See Leng, adding that a recent feasibility study showed that hydrogen could decarbonise maritime, electricity generation, heavy transportation and some industrial process. “However, until CCUS is commercially viable, Singapore cannot produce low-carbon hydrogen at scale,” he said. As such, Singapore is exploring other sources. A key challenge of scaling up the supply of hydrogen is the high storage and transportation costs, said Dr Tan See Leng. It is thus a “significant engineering challenge” to transport and store hydrogen in a commercially viable manner. 
  Listing several methods of transportation, the minister noted that there is currently no global consensus on which method would dominate in the future or when the long-distance transport of hydrogen and the processes to liberate hydrogen from hydrogen carriers might become viable. In a supplementary question, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim (WP-Sengkang) asked if the Government would consider public transportation as part of its low-carbon push. Dr Tan See Leng said this was something that the Government could “potentially” look at on a “limited basis”, depending on the proposals it receives. However, he added that the Government is “actively pursuing” renewable energy imports from ASEAN countries and countries that have “maximum geographical advantage” in producing renewable energy with “very low carbon or zero carbon”.  “Those are the immediate short-term measures that we will be moving forward to reduce our carbon footprint,” he said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/seafood-sustainable-label-easpiracy-jurong-fishery-port-covid-2037691,Commentary: Plenty of fish in the sea? Seafood-loving Singapore may not have its fill in the future,"SINGAPORE: The Netflix documentary Seaspiracy has triggered discussion about the ills of the global seafood industry. While it got blowback for its sensationalism and quoting studies out of context, the film has shone a spotlight on issues such as overfishing and plastic pollution, convincing many viewers to swear off seafood. But is abstaining from seafood consumption really the solution? 
  That doesn’t sound like an easy task when Singaporeans love seafood. Each person consumes an average of 22kg of seafood per year, above the global average of around 20kg. In 2020, Singapore imported 134,000 tonnes of seafood worth S$760 million, mostly from countries in the region such as Indonesia and Malaysia. But this rate of seafood imports might give one pause given the finite number of fish in oceans and Singapore’s food security goals. 
  A SEAFOOD-LOVING NATION A 2016 report by WWF revealed that 75 per cent of the seafood consumed in Singapore is unsustainable, meaning they are irresponsibly fished or farmed.  A notorious industrial fishing method is bottom trawling, in which a large fishing net is used to comb the seabed. The net collects everything in its path, including juvenile fish, turtles and marine mammals, and destroys coral reefs in the process. Species that are trawled include ikan kuning (the fish typically served in nasi lemak), silver pomfret and swordtip squid. Yet, Singapore is highly dependent on these imports. Over 90 per cent of the food we eat is imported, with only 9 per cent of fish produced in local farms, according to the Singapore Food Agency (SFA). This makes Singapore vulnerable to temporary shocks in supply chains. The Jurong Fishery Port, a source of a growing COVID-19 cluster, has been closed for deep cleaning until Jul 31, causing short-term disruptions to the supply of chilled seafood. The Ministry of Health noted on Jul 17 that there was a rush to buy fish and urged visitors to avoid crowds when marketing. It’s therefore no surprise that Singapore aims to beef up its food security with its “30 by 30” goal: To produce 30 per cent of its nutritional needs locally by 2030. THE GLOBAL PICTURE But the problem goes beyond Singapore. Worldwide, seafood consumption has reached 156 million tonnes every year. The United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimated global fish consumption per capita more than doubled from 9kg in 1961 to 20.5kg in 2018. The annual growth in seafood consumption has outpaced population growth twofold and is higher than the growth in consumption of all other animal proteins. The world’s insatiable appetite for seafood has led to overfishing and resulting declining fish populations. In 1974, 90 per cent of the world’s fish stocks were at healthy levels. That figure dropped to 65.8 per cent in 2017, according to FAO. Fifty years ago in Thailand, 300kg of seafood could be fished per hour. Today, only 18kg of seafood can be fished per hour. 
  Farming practices such as aquaculture can fill the shortfall in consumer demand for seafood. But aquaculture has also been associated with environmentally harmful practices, including overfishing, ironically, when an unsustainable number of wild fish is caught to feed the farmed fish. There’ve been health scares linked to cultivated seafood too. For instance, the US Food and Drug Administration issued an import alert in 2016 on shrimp and prawns from Malaysia, alleging the presence of antibiotics that prevent disease in farmed crustaceans, but are harmful to humans. The ongoing pandemic has added another layer of complexity. According to a recent FAO information paper, the slowdown in consumer demand, disruption to fishing supplies and health measures for crew members have all affected the seafood industry. In the US, fishing catches dropped by 40 per cent at the peak of COVID-19. With all these stresses on the seafood industry, it’s time to think about the bigger questions during our trips to the supermarket. SUSTAINABLE SEAFOOD LABELS – A GUARANTEE? One solution to the depletion of fish stocks is to eat responsibly. The big boys know this trend is on the horizon. Marina Bay Sands, for instance, is starting to use more certified sustainable products in their kitchens with Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) being the dominant seafood sustainability certifier. MSC labels caught or farmed seafood as sustainable based on three criteria: Using sustainable fish stocks, minimising environmental impact and effective management. Other certifiers include the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) and the Global Aquaculture Alliance’s Best Aquaculture Practice (BAP). Still, there’s understandable public scepticism over sustainable seafood labels, not to mention the green-washing risk of seafood being wrongfully claimed as sustainable, or simply mislabelled. In 2018, CNA enlisted a laboratory to test eight samples of certified sustainable fish, and found one product did not match its packaging label of Pacific cod. 
  Nonetheless, seafood labels do go some way to raise public awareness about sustainable seafood and guide consumers in making better choices. In a study conducted by consultancy GlobeScan, 75 per cent of people in Singapore felt consumers should protect fish stocks so others can enjoy them in the future. But sustainable seafood is still by far the exception rather than the norm. Walk through the seafood section in a local supermarket and you’ll find that only about one in 10 seafood products have any of the three sustainability labels (MSC, ASC, or BAP). 
  TAKING MATTERS INTO OUR HANDS How should we as consumers prepare ourselves now for the future that we are aware of global threats to seafood availability? We could get educated, for a start. WWF Singapore published a sustainable seafood guide in 2016, identifying species that are sustainable and those that should be avoided. But the industry too must step up. Food vendors today may have no idea whether their fish is sustainable and where it comes from, or even what is in a product such as fish balls. 
  The good news is that aquaculture using sustainable technology is showing results and gaining support as part of Singapore’s “30 by 30” plan. Consumers can now choose from a growing range of seafood products from local farms (like fish, prawns and crabs). Operated and monitored according to the sustainability guidelines by SFA, consumers have less to worry about compared to labels from MSC and the like. Food safety of new local aquaculture products will also receive a boost from NTU’s recently launched Future Ready Food Safety Hub (FRESH), which uses data analytics to cut down the risk of food fraud so Singaporeans can feel more confident in these products. 
  Innovations in food science and technology have produced higher nutrient values in familiar seafoods like seabass, groupers and soon hock.  For example, the St John’s sea bass, a new breed developed by SFA and Temasek Life Science Laboratory, is healthier for consumers and easier for farmers to produce. 
  It’s true the current scale and production yield of Singapore’s aquaculture are not yet comparable with the economies whose seafood exports we rely on. That’s why local innovations should be shared with neighbouring countries, in the hopes that regional collaboration can address the threats to seafood supply. Already, local aquaculture firms Barramundi Asia and Apollo Aquaculture are expanding their operations into Brunei. In the meantime, responsible seafood consumption – such as eating less sambal stingray and steamed red grouper – may be a small way of ensuring that we can continue enjoying these dishes in the years to come. How could climate change reshape your dinner?

Spanning 45 hectares - the equivalent of about 45 football fields - the Sembcorp Tengeh Floating Solar Farm contains 122,000 solar panels, which are durable enough to last 25 years. It is also one of the world’s largest inland floating solar PV systems, said national water agency PUB and Sembcorp Industries in a joint press release.  “The commencement of the solar farm’s operations marks a significant step towards enduring energy sustainability in water treatment, making Singapore one of the few countries in the world to have a 100 per cent green waterworks system while contributing to the national goal of quadrupling solar energy deployment by 2025,” they said in the release. The launch ceremony was officiated by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu was also in attendance. In his speech, Mr Lee noted that it was ""important"" for Singapore to keep finding ways to shift away from fossil fuels in meeting its energy needs. ""Innovations such as floating solar farms will help us overcome our physical constraints,"" he added.   "" I hope this project will give our solar and renewable energy industry a boost, and pave the way for more such facilities to be built here and in the region. This will take us one big step forward towards environmental sustainability, as we transition into a low-carbon world."" This is equivalent to powering about 16,000 four-room HDB flats and reducing carbon emissions by about 32 kilotonnes annually, the same as taking 7,000 cars off the roads. “With this floating solar power plant, which we believe to be one of the largest in the world, PUB takes a big step towards enduring energy sustainability in water treatment,” said PUB chief executive Ng Joo Hee. “Solar energy is plentiful, clean and green, and is key to reducing PUB’s and also Singapore’s carbon footprint.” Group president and Sembcorp Industries CEO Wong Kim Yin described the solar farm as the “crown jewel” in the company’s portfolio. “As the leading homegrown renewable energy player, Sembcorp has over 3,300 megawatts of renewable energy assets around the world,” he said. “We are committed, and have the track record and competencies, to support the Singapore Green Plan.” 
  A testbed was launched by PUB and EDB at the reservoir in 2016, before construction of the floating solar PV system - which occupies about one-third of the reservoir’s total area - began in August 2020. ""We came up with the idea of building a floating solar farm a decade ago. We were looking for ways to harness solar energy at scale because we do have year-round bright sunlight for solar power ... Unlike wind or hydro power, which are not reliable nor even available here,"" said Mr Lee. ""As the cost of solar cells came down, solar power became increasingly viable and attractive to us, so we made use of whatever available space we could find to install solar panels. We put them on building rooftops, we put them on vacant state properties. But we still lacked large-scale plots of land to scale up our solar power deployment.  Hence the idea of a floating solar farm was attractive, because it allowed us to make full use of the large surface area of reservoirs, while giving them a dual use."" And the success of the testbed - which performed up to 15 per cent better than a conventional rooftop solar power system, due to the cooler reservoir environment - provided the ""confidence"" to develop the farm. ""That makes Singapore one of the few countries in the world to have a fully green waterworks system producing clean water with 100 per cent clean energy, which is another remarkable achievement in our 'water story',"" added Mr Lee. 
  An environmental impact study, which included biodiversity surveys, water quality monitoring and modelling, along with consultations with nature groups was carried out on the site between 2015 to 2018.  Results from PUB’s testbed deployed at Tengeh Reservoir in 2016 showed no observable change in water quality nor significant impact on surrounding wildlife, said PUB and Sembcorp. “Referencing the study, the Sembcorp Tengeh Floating Solar Farm was carefully designed to minimise impact on the reservoir’s water quality, flora and fauna,” said both parties. “Sufficient gaps between solar panels were incorporated to improve the airflow and allow sufficient sunlight to reach aquatic life. Additional aerators were also put in place to maintain oxygen levels in the reservoir.” Floats deployed are made using high-density polyethylene (HDPE), a certified food-grade material that is recyclable, UV-resistant and corrosion resistant.  “In addition to having a comprehensive environmental management and mitigation plan, PUB and Sembcorp will continue to monitor the reservoir closely, and take necessary measures to maintain biodiversity and water quality,” said the press release. Other floating solar PV projects in the pipeline include ones at Lower Seletar Reservoir and Bedok Reservoir. They are scheduled to be completed this year. Environmental studies are also ongoing for a 100MWp project at Kranji Reservoir as well as a 6.7MWp project at Upper Peirce Reservoir.  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/public-sector-sets-more-sustainability-targets-launch-new-green-movement-2025901,Public sector sets more sustainability targets with launch of new green movement,"SINGAPORE: From ramping up solar capacity to replacing government vehicles with cleaner energy models, the public sector is setting new sustainability targets to meet its goal of peaking carbon emissions around 2025. This will come under its new sustainability movement, GreenGov.SG, which was officially launched on Monday (Jul 12). The initiative is part of the Singapore Green Plan 2030 that was unveiled in February to advance the national agenda on sustainable development.  The Green Plan charts Singapore’s green targets over the next 10 years and is spearheaded by five ministries: The environment, education, national development, trade and industry, and transport ministries.  
  Under GreenGov.SG, all premises will deploy solar photovoltaics ""where feasible"". The public sector will increase solar energy deployment to 1.5 gigawatt-peak by 2030, which is equivalent to powering more than 260,000 households a year.  This will account for three-quarters of the national solar target of 2 gigawatt-peak by 2030, said Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu, who was speaking at a forum to kick off Climate Action Week 2021. To pave the way for greener transport, all new government cars will have to be cleaner energy models from 2023. By 2035, all government cars will run on cleaner energy. Targets have also been set to improve resource efficiency within the sector. By 2030, the public sector aims to cut energy and water use by 10 per cent from the average of the last three years, said Ms Fu. The sector has also committed to reducing the amount of waste disposed by 30 per cent from 2022 levels. As for buildings, all new and existing public sector buildings will be required to achieve the Green Mark Platinum Super Low Energy standard or equivalent, which is the highest rating under the system that evaluates a building’s environmental impact and performance. All government data centres will have to achieve the Green Mark Platinum standard by 2025, said Ms Fu. 
  The scope of GreenGov.SG will be expanded to include public sector infrastructure and operations, such as public transport infrastructure and healthcare facilities. This will double the number of premises covered, from 800 to 1,600 facilities, said Ms Fu. For example, the Government is looking to halve the amount of energy used to produce desalinated water and is exploring new technologies in reverse osmosis to improve the production of NEWater. In the defence, a sustainability office will be set up to drive the planning and implementation of green efforts. By 2030, the Defence Ministry (MINDEF) and the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) will reduce their carbon emissions growth by two-thirds by doubling their solar adoption in camps and bases, electrifying their administrative vehicle fleet, and trialling green aviation fuels. ""These targets will apply to the whole spectrum of public sector operations, and ensure that sustainability is embedded at the core of public sector functions,"" said Ms Fu. “By integrating sustainability and climate resilience into our policies and programmes, we will engender a shift in our companies and across our economy, as consumers and investors increasingly prioritise low-carbon products and solutions,” she added. She added that the Government will support Singapore companies in the transition, through incentive schemes such as the Energy Efficiency Fund and Resource Efficiency Grant for Energy. 
  A new initiative called the Enterprise Sustainability Programme will also help to support local companies in building capabilities in sustainability and in developing new products and solutions for the green economy. Under GreenGov.Sg, public officers will also be encouraged to contribute actively in the country’s green efforts. Regular sharing sessions will be conducted within the public sector to promote the exchange of ideas, best practices, and the latest technological solutions. This will help to ""inspire and support public officers to champion ground- up initiatives"", said the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) in a media release. Campaigns will also be organised to raise awareness and encourage public officers to take simple steps to lead a more sustainable lifestyle."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/g20-recognises-carbon-pricing-climate-change-tool-first-time-2026861,G20 recognises carbon pricing as climate change tool for first time,"VENICE: G20 finance leaders recognised carbon pricing as a potential tool to address climate change for the first time in an official communique on Saturday (Jul 10), taking a tentative step towards promoting the idea and coordinating carbon reduction policies. The move marked a massive shift from the previous four years when former US President Donald Trump's administration routinely opposed the mention of climate change as a global risk in such international statements. The communique, issued on Saturday after a meeting of Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank governors in the Italian city of Venice, which is threatened by rising sea levels, inserted a mention of carbon pricing among a ""wide set of tools"" on which countries should coordinate to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Such tools include investing in sustainable infrastructure and new technologies to promote decarbonisation and clean energy, ""including the rationalisation and phasing-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption and, if appropriate, the use of carbon pricing mechanisms and incentives, while providing targeted support for the poorest and the most vulnerable"", said the communique from the financial leaders of the world's 20 major economies. 
  The statement was issued just days before the European Union was scheduled to unveil a controversial carbon-adjustment border tax on goods from countries with high carbon emissions. ""It is the first time in a G20 communique you could have these two words 'carbon pricing' being introduced as a solution for the fight against climate change,"" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters. ""We have been pushing very hard to have these two words ... introduced into a G20 communique."" REVERSAL OF TRUMP-ERA INITIATIVES Those efforts met strong US resistance for most of Trump's presidency, during which the United States quickly withdrew from the Paris climate agreement. At a summit in Saudi Arabia in 2020, then-US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin agreed to a G20 reference to climate change, but not as a downside risk to global growth. Instead, it was included in a reference to the Financial Stability Board’s work examining the implications of climate change for financial stability. The carbon pricing mention on Saturday marks the influence of the Biden administration, which immediately rejoined the Paris agreement in January and has set out ambitious carbon reduction targets and clean energy and transportation investment plans. But while supporting emissions reductions, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called on Friday for better international coordination on carbon-cutting policies to avoid trade frictions. SINGAPORE'S CARBON TAX Singapore Finance Minister Lawrence Wong on Monday said the world must come together to act urgently on climate change. “The current average global emissions price of US$3/tonne is too low. One idea being mooted at the G20 is to have a global minimum floor price for carbon, and to set it at a higher level across the board.  ""Naturally, countries will have their own considerations as to where the right price should be, and it will take some time to forge an international consensus on this,” he said in a Facebook post. He added that Singapore already has a carbon tax, and that the Government is now reviewing the level and trajectory of the carbon tax, and will take these global developments into consideration in its review.  “We will continue to reduce our emissions and carbon footprint, and do our part to contribute to the overall efforts to decarbonise the global economy,” said Mr Wong, who attended the G20 meeting in Venice.  The EU's carbon border adjustment mechanism would impose levies on the carbon content of imported goods in an effort to discourage ""carbon leakage"", the transfer of production to countries with less onerous emission restrictions. Critics of the measure worry that it could become another trade barrier without reducing emissions."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/us-climate-envoy-announces-russia-trip-time-tension-1982286,US climate envoy announces Russia trip at time of tension,"US climate envoy John Kerry will meet with Russian officials in Moscow next week, making him the highest-ranking Biden administration official to visit Russia so far, at a time when the two countries are at odds. A terse State Department announcement on Thursday (Jul 8) said Kerry's four-day trip would be aimed at discussing “means of enhancing global climate ambition”. China and then the United States lead the globe in climate-damaging emissions of coal and petroleum fumes, but Russia, at No 4 globally due to its dependence on coal burning, is an outsize contributor to climate change relative to the size of its economy and population. Kerry, former Secretary of State in the Obama administration, is encouraging other governments to commit to tough targets to cut emissions ahead of a UN global climate summit later this year. Russian President Vladimir Putin took part by video in President Joe Biden's April climate summit. But Putin's government has set only unambitious goals for cutting emissions as the waste from burning fossil fuels heats up the planet. The trip comes as the two nations spar over ransomware attacks blamed on gangs linked to Russia, putting Biden under domestic pressure to punish Russia over the hacking. Biden's administration has sought cooperation with US opponents and competitors on climate despite sometimes hostile relations on other matters. Arms control is one area where both Russia and the United States are pursuing new agreements. Strategic talks between the two are expected to start late next week in Geneva, as agreed to by Biden and Putin in a summit in Geneva last month."

""Singapore and the EU are committed to achieving our mutual goals in climate action leading up to COP26 and beyond,"" said a joint media release by the EU, Singapore's Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, and the National Climate Change Secretariat in the Prime Minister's Office. In the run-up to COP26, European Commission executive vice-president Frans Timmermans was visiting Singapore to discuss issues related to climate change and biodiversity. He was hosted by Sustainability and Environment Minister Grace Fu, Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan and Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean, who is also the chairman of the inter-ministerial committee on climate change. Their meetings focused on opportunities for collaboration in areas such as circular economy; research, development and deployment for low-carbon solutions (hydrogen, for example); green finance; and urban greening. ""Singapore and the EU jointly underscored the importance of taking urgent action to combat climate change, and in preserving biodiversity for future generations, even as we respond to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said the media release. 
  It also mentioned the EU-Singapore free trade agreement, calling it a ""high-standard and comprehensive"" agreement for advancing the two parties' sustainability and development agenda. Both parties will cooperate closely in areas ranging from low-carbon energy technologies to carbon services and solutions, said the Singapore authorities and EU. ""WE OWE IT TO OUR CHILDREN"" Mr Timmermans said ""the EU and Singapore are similarly committed to investing in and speeding up the urgent global green transition"". He said authorities have demanded a ""high degree of solidarity"" from the young generation during the COVID-19 pandemic in the form of restrictions and loan financing needed to stimulate the economy. ""This should remind us that, likewise, we owe it (to) our children and grandchildren to leave them decent living conditions on our planet. We must take decisive climate action and preserve biodiversity – and the environment more generally,"" added Mr Timmermans. He said he hopes that the conversations with the Singaporean ministers will allow them to explore opportunities for advancing the green transition. ""I believe that we now all have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to use the singular fiscal efforts to recover from the pandemic to 'build back better'. We stand ready to work with Singapore to this end,” he added. 
  On Singapore's part, Mr Teo said that the EU is a ""close and strong"" partner in the fight against climate change, ""The discussions today reaffirm our common vision to achieve a low-carbon future together, and to find new engines of growth in sustainable development,"" he added. Ms Fu said she had a ""good discussion"" with Mr Timmermans on ways they can advance global climate action and strengthen bilateral cooperation. ""Singapore is a strong supporter of global climate action and is committed to working with all parties, including the EU, for a successful outcome at COP26,” she added. Announced in February, the Singapore Green Plan 2030 sets out ""concrete sectoral plans and targets over the next ten years that will position Singapore to achieve net zero emissions as soon as viable"", the authorities said. Under the European Green Deal presented in December 2019, the EU is aiming for net zero emissions by 2050 and -55 per cent by 2030."

This will allow carbon emissions to be reduced by an estimated 55 per cent compared to conventional petrol vehicles, Grab said in a media release on Wednesday (Jul 7).  
  The Singapore-based firm - which earlier this year announced plans to go public with a US$40 billion (S$53 billion) valuation - said the trial service will operate under the same price structure as JustGrab, which deploys the nearest taxi or private-hire car to commuters for a flat fare.  The JustGrab Green option will first be made available to those booking trips from areas such as the Downtown Core, Marina South, Marina East, Bukit Merah, Outram, Queenstown, Bukit Timah, River Valley, Tanglin, Orchard, Newton, Novena, Toa Payoh, Bishan, Rochor, Kallang, Marine Parade and Geylang before being progressively expanded to other locations.  To reduce their carbon footprint, commuters will also be able to pay an additional S$0.10 on top of their fare, which will go towards carbon offset and solarisation projects in Singapore and the region. The Green Programme, which will also roll out on Jul 14, will see Grab will match commuters’ S$0.10 contribution for up to three million rides. Among the projects supported by the initiative is a collaboration between Grab and Sembcorp Industries to install solar panels on the rooftops of community institutions in Singapore, such as community clubs and welfare homes.  The programme will also support a tie up between Grab and Dutch energy giant Shell to buy carbon credits from the Katingan Mentaya Project in Indonesia, which restores natural forests and conserves peatland habitats. 
  The ride-hailing giant will also be expanding its electric and hybrid vehicle fleet through its rental arm, GrabRentals, and aims to have its entire fleet running on “cleaner energy” by 2030, as part of its transport sustainability goals.  This is in line with plans under the Singapore Green Plan to phase out internal combustion engine vehicles by 2040 and replace them with cleaner energy alternatives, the firm noted.  ""Our 2030 Transport Sustainability Goal is our commitment in taking a holistic approach to combat climate change,"" said Grab Singapore transport managing director Andrew Chan.  ""Introducing JustGrab Green and the Green Programme are the first of many steps Grab is undertaking to create solutions to environmental challenges. It is a team effort, and we will continue to examine ways where we, alongside our partners and consumers, can make a net-zero carbon future a reality for Singapore and the region."" Grab’s group head of marketing and sustainability Cheryl Goh had last month said the firm had invested more than US$200 million (S$269 million) to increase the number of electric and hybrid vehicles in its rental fleet.  Grab had also last month announced plans to partner with automaker Hyundai to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles in Southeast Asia.  In May, rival Gojek - which operates in Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore - said it aimed to make every vehicle on its platform an electric vehicle by 2030. Meanwhile taxi operator SMRT said in April that its entire fleet - which currently stands at 1,797 cabs - would comprise electric vehicles within the next five years."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/india-tree-planting-forest-sustainability-environment-1993936,Indians plant millions of saplings amid mass campaign,"LUCKNOW: More than a million people on Sunday )Jul 4) began planting 250 million saplings in India’s most populous state, part of an annual mass tree planting campaign to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate the effects of global climate change. Lawmakers, government officials and volunteers from social organisations swarmed riverbanks, farms, forests, schools and government buildings, planting saplings at designated spots. The effort spans 68,000 villages and 83,000 forest sites in northern Uttar Pradesh state. India has pledged to keep a third of its total land area under forest and tree cover, but a growing population and increasing demand for industrial projects has placed greater stress on the land. 
  Social organisations planted a large number of “peepal” trees (Ficus religiosa) in Lucknow, the state capital, which is recovering from a devastating surge of coronavirus infections. “This tree is known to release maximum oxygen. So this plant is the ‘need of the hour’, as we are reminded of its importance after facing the oxygen shortage crisis when the outbreak was at its peak,” said Shachindra Sharma, an activist. India, a country of nearly 1.4 billion people, crossed the grim milestone on Friday of more than 400,000 people lost to the coronavirus. That number is thought to be a vast undercount because of a lack of testing and reporting. New cases are on the decline after exceeding 400,000 a day in May, but authorities are preparing for another possible wave and are trying to ramp up vaccination. India on Sunday recorded 43,071 new infections in the past 24 hours, raising the total cases to 30.5 million. Uttar Pradesh state reported 128 new cases in the same period. “We are committed to increasing the forest cover of Uttar Pradesh state to over 15 per cent of the total land area in the next five years. In today’s campaign, over 100 million trees will be planted,” said Manoj Singh, a senior state forest official. 
  Since the launch of the tree-planting drive four years ago, the forest cover of Uttar Pradesh - home to 230 million people - has gone up by more than 3 per cent, compared to the national average of 2.89 per cent, said state Forest Minister Dara Singh Chauhan. The long-term survival of trees planted in such mass campaigns remains a concern. Usually, only 60 per cent of saplings survive, with the rest succumbing to disease or lack of water, he said. However, Chauhan said the survival rate of saplings in the past four years has gone up to 80 per cent, thanks to better care and methods such as geotagging trees with QR codes in order to monitor their growth. India’s federal government is encouraging all 28 states to expedite tree-planting drives to increase forest cover, part of commitments made at the 2015 climate change summit in Paris. The government designated more than US$6.2 billion for tree planting across the country, in keeping with its pledge to push India’s forest cover to 95 million ha by 2030."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/commentary-excitement-over-marine-creatures-great-are-we-loving-singapores-shores-death-2030261,"Commentary: Excitement over marine creatures is great, but are we loving Singapore’s shores to death?","SINGAPORE: Social media platforms were abuzz in late May with photographs of fan clams, reported to be in the hundreds, in rotting piles strewn along Changi Beach. These clams, buried with only their tips jutting out of the sand when alive, were all cracked open, and their abductor muscles were harvested – likely for consumption. In early June, reports emerged of dozens of beach goers allegedly collecting marine organisms with metal tongs, spades, and rakes at Changi Beach. Over the last weekend of June, photographs were posted online of barefooted beachcombers holding up a horseshoe crab by the tip of its tail at Sembawang Beach. What accounts for the sudden interest in the creatures that dwell in our seas? Some want to consume them as food, while others are curious about these animals and yet others want to collect them for their home aquaria. 
  COASTAL FORAGING IS AN ACTIVITY AS OLD AS TIME Unable to travel due to the pandemic, those seeking an outdoor nature-focused activity during the school semester break were likely inspired by several YouTube videos and blogs that showcased harvesting with metal tools along the shores of Singapore. Singapore experiences two high tides and two low tides a day. During the low tide, a portion of the seabed area is exposed, revealing sandflats and mudflats otherwise under water. The collection of organisms from our shores is not a novel phenomenon. Earlier inhabitants of our island scoured intertidal areas to forage for clams, snails, sea cucumbers and crabs to supplement their meals. But over the years, Singapore faced significant losses of natural marine habitats resulting from land reclamation and coastal urbanisation. Today, approximately 30 per cent of coral reef and 1 per cent of mangrove areas remain. We must question then if the indiscriminate collection of native biodiversity is sustainable. HIGH VISITOR PRESSURE  The negative impact of high visitorship to the intertidal zone is a cause for concern. In addition to the flora and fauna that are easily observable, there exists myriad organisms living within the substrate that are not. These organisms – typically small worms, crustaceans and molluscs – burrow in the substrate and are collectively termed “infauna” or “endobenthos”. The impact of human trampling to the intertidal area varies with the intensity and frequency of visitorship. The in-fauna community, such as soft-bodied marine worms, are especially susceptible to trampling. Studies have found that high human footfall can reduce algae and seagrass cover, crucial as food and shelter to marine organisms. Dugongs, for example, are herbivorous marine mammals that feed on specific seagrass species. The seagrass meadows along the coastline of Changi Beach are known feeding sites for this species. Changes to the seagrass meadows can therefore have vast implications for the organisms that depend on them. Persistent trampling over the long term has been found to significantly change the characteristics of intertidal areas, and negatively impacts their resilience and ability to recover from other threats. 
  LIMITED PROTECTION FOR MARINE CREATURES While there has been an increase in public discourse on intertidal plants and animals, there is limited legal protection afforded to the vast diversity of organisms and to the majority of our coastal areas. Even though wild animals are protected under the Wildlife Act which came into force in June 2020, most invertebrate organisms, including many of these marine critters, are exempt. Furthermore, only a fraction of our coastline is protected or designated as reserve areas. 
  Yet the passing of legislation is not always the most effective approach because of the inbuilt punitive measures. The legal process to formalise specific bills take many months, so might not be adequate as a ready-to-apply solution. Once the legislation is in effect, enforcement can be challenging. The ideal scenario is for users of common resources, such as intertidal areas, to collectively understand the consequences of non-civic actions. To safeguard our shores, it is far more effective for users to arrive at a consensus on key principles to steer future interactions. This idea for collective responsibility towards the conservation of our marine and coastal areas was also suggested in the Singapore Blue Plan 2018 – a ground-up initiative by over 120 contributors and 14 stakeholder groups. This plan included recommendations to the Government for the protection of identified marine areas, enhancement of the legislative framework and the implementation of long-term monitoring programmes. 
  VISITING OUR SHORES RESPONSIBLY Intertidal zones are responsible for coastal protection and offer recreational, cultural and spiritual spaces that contribute to our national identity. Increased visitorship to our shores signals their importance to our well-being within our urban lifestyles. Agencies responsible for these resources have demonstrated their cognisance of this. For instance, in response to the surge in visitors to Changi Beach, the National Parks Board (NParks) will put up signs and increase staff and volunteer presence at intertidal areas, rather than closing the shores or limiting public access. 
  Another way in which people can enjoy these creatures is to learn about the biodiversity of our intertidal areas and how to appreciate them safely when we visit. We can do that by joining organised walks by the NParks and volunteer groups such as Naked Hermit Crabs and Young Nautilus. These are carefully planned to help one prepare to responsibly visit intertidal areas while maintaining safety. Observe their behaviours and photograph organisms you encounter, but do not attempt to touch or handle them because many marine creatures bear sharp spines or are venomous. For those who want to explore intertidal areas themselves, resources on recommended attire and conduct, and on the flora and fauna they might come across are available on the websites of NParks, Celebrating Singapore’s Shores, and WildSingapore. Exhibits such as the Human x Nature at National Library and the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum are also excellent places to learn more about native biodiversity and the socio-cultural elements of nature. ADVOCACY FOR OUR SHORES THROUGH RESPECTFUL DISCOURSE Communities of nature enthusiasts are also becoming very popular. There are groups dedicated to clean-up sessions or hiking. On Facebook, groups were also started for specific areas such as Pasir Ris and Sisters’ Islands Marine Park, where visitors post photographs of their excursions. The Friends Of The Parks networks spearheaded by NParks allows for volunteers to get involved in all kinds of community activities and in managing their favourite parks. 
  As residents in this small island, we recognise the immense pressure we subject our limited natural spaces to. The maturity in public discussions that unfolded in past weeks relating to the collection of intertidal organisms was heartening to observe. Although views were at times different, the discourse remained respectful. If we continue on this trajectory, we will be able to channel our passion towards active engagement for nature-related issues, and advocacy for blue and green spaces in Singapore.

Ruling on a case brought by the northern coastal town of Grande-Synthe, the State Council said France was set to miss its target of reducing emissions by 40 per cent by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, unless it took corrective action. As a result, the court ordered Prime Minister Jean Castex to take ""all the necessary steps to curb greenhouse gas emissions"" by Mar 31, 2022. The deadline falls in the final weeks of campaigning in France's presidential election, meaning that President Emmanuel Macron, who is expected to seek a second term, will be under intense scrutiny on an issue shaping up as a key theme in the vote. 
  The council's ruling comes two days after the High Council on Climate, a body that advises the government, warned that France was still far off its target on fighting global warming, despite emissions falling by an unprecedented 9.2 per cent last year at the height of the COVID-19 crisis. Despite his headline 2017 promise to ""make our planet great again"" – a swipe at former US President Donald Trump, a global-warming denier – Macron has been criticised for failing to meet France's targets under the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. 
  Faced with what they see as the state's inaction, French activists, like those in other countries, have begun using courts to pressure governments into action. In a ruling in February that was hailed as historic by campaigners, a Paris court held that the state was liable for its failure to take sufficient measures to halt climate change and ordered it to pay a symbolic one euro in damages."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/stdct-nus-ntu-test-cooling-solutions-data-centres-sustainability-1966666,"NUS, NTU set up S$23 million programme to test cooling solutions for data centres in the tropics","SINGAPORE: Temperatures ranging from 23 to 27 degrees Celsius and ambient humidity of 50 to 60 per cent are typically the conditions needed to air-cool a data centre housing powerful computers and rows of servers. But to maintain a controlled environment like that requires plenty of energy, even more so if the data centre is set in a tropical location like Singapore. To develop novel and more energy-efficient ways of cooling data centres in the tropics, a new S$23 million research programme was announced by the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) on Wednesday (Jun 16). As part of that, a testbed facility with “state-of-the-art” equipment will be set up at the NUS Kent Ridge campus and will be up and running by October. The Sustainable Tropical Data Centre Testbed (STDCT), as it is called, will “promote the co-creation and demonstration of advanced cooling technologies”, the universities said in a joint press release.   
  The programme is jointly funded by the National Research Foundation Singapore (NRF), a department under the Prime Minister’s Office, and Facebook, which is the anchor industry partner. Research at the STDCT will be co-led by researchers from the NUS, NTU and industry partners such as Keppel Data Centres, with support from the relevant government agencies.  “Companies will share their needs and requirements with the research community to ideate and innovate the solutions,” the press release said. One area that researchers are examining is a heat sink design with both air and liquid modes of cooling in a single integrated piece that eliminates the connectors and ducts. Led by NUS associate professor Lee Poh Seng, who is also the programme director at STDCT, this “direct chip hybrid cooling” idea can be an alternative air-cooling solution during water-loop maintenance to cut down server downtime.  Another, led by NTU’s Associate Professor Tan Rui, will test the possibility of air-cooling data centres at higher temperatures and relative humidity levels to reduce energy consumption yet ensuring the performance of the IT equipment. 
  When successfully developed and tested, a combination of the new cooling technologies being studied at the STDCT could reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by “up to 25 per cent”, compared with data centres that are traditionally air-cooled.  An industry-wide adoption across the entire tropical region can also potentially cut the industry’s energy usage by “at least 40 per cent”, the press release said. “The demonstration and validation of innovative cooling technologies at the testbed facility can greatly mitigate the operational and financial risks of adopting these solutions,” the universities said. “This will accelerate adoption, as well as enhance the sustainability of the data centre industry in Singapore and the wider tropical region.” In the longer term, the STDCT hopes to recommend operating guidelines and set new standards based on proven findings from its new technologies to enable greener data centres. Meanwhile, the facility itself will feature energy-efficient cooling solutions, such as the StatePoint Liquid Cooling System developed by Nortek Air Solutions and Facebook that helps data centres to operate more efficiently in tropical locations. GREENING DATA CENTRES The rise of the digital economy has led to growing demand for data centres but the booming industry’s huge energy needs are also raising concerns. The International Energy Agency estimates that the sector currently uses around 1 per cent of the world’s electricity. This figure could hit double-digits by 2030, making related emissions a problem. In Singapore, data centres accounted for 7 per cent of the country’s total electricity consumption last year. This is projected to reach 12 per cent by 2030, the universities’ press release said. With the industry being an “intensive” user of electricity and water, a “temporary pause” has since been imposed on the building of new data centres as local authorities mull a balance between environmental sustainability and supporting business needs. The Government has said it is in the midst of concluding its review and intends to share its plans with the industry later this year. 
  NRF’s chief executive Low Teck Seng said the STDCT will help to accelerate the development and test-bedding of innovative and sustainable solutions for data centres towards commercial deployment. It will also support Singapore’s journey towards becoming a low-emissions economy as part of the foundation’s Energy Grid 2.0 programme, he added. The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), which is supporting the research programme, said it will work closely with the industry to bring about more energy-efficient data centres and encourage the adoption of best-in-class technologies, solutions and standards.  “This will enable us to grow our data centre ecosystem sustainably and further entrench Singapore as one of the world’s leading data centre hubs,” said cluster director for infrastructure planning and facilitation Yeo Tiong Yeow."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/obsessions/vegan-leather-more-durable-animal-leather-should-you-switch-1966921,Is vegan leather more durable than animal leather? Should you switch?,"Handbag collectors alert! At Senreve’s stylish pastel-hued pop-up store at Takashimaya Shopping Centre, a rainbow coloured array of leather arm candies are tantalisingly displayed, beckoning the bag lady to pick up one – or eight. 
  Besides the attractive range of colours, the bags by the Instagram-famous American brand, which is favoured by celebrities including Lady Gaga and Kristen Bell, come in a variety of leather textures. These include leathers with a sturdy pebbled grain and an embossed crocodile pattern. There is also a range of vegan leather bags that are practically indistinguishable from animal leather. For those who have long associated faux leather with the squeaky and non-durable PVC pleather of yore, this new alternative leather will come as a revelation – and might even convince some to invest in more consciously made luxury products. Not only does Senreve’s vegan leather pretty much look and feel like the real deal, it is also resistant to scratches, stains and water, ideal for the modern woman on the go. “We decided to create luxury vegan products three years ago because there were a lot of women in our community who wanted to have more of an animal-free vegan lifestyle. That includes what they eat and the products they use on a daily basis,” said Senreve founder and CEO Coral Chung. These days, being environmentally conscious is luxe. In recent years, major fashion brands like Armani, Gucci and Versace have pledged to go fur-free. Some luxury brands are also beginning to invest in developing and using animal-free leather in a bid to challenge long-held notions that only animal leathers are worth the price tag. Besides synthetic materials, other forms of vegan leather can be made from plant-based matter, such as pineapples, apples, cacti, corks and mushrooms. Case in point: Cartier and Hermes have recently launched new products made with plant-based leather. Cartier’s latest Tank Must watch collection includes models that have non-animal vegan straps made from apples grown for the food industry. For its autumn/winter 2021 collection, Hermes unveiled a new version of its Victoria bag that is made with Sylvania, a mushroom-based material made in collaboration with Californian start-up MycoWorks. This sustainable leather, which has been tanned and finished in France by Hermes’s tanners to refine its strength and durability, has an amber hue and natural patina that many have come to associate with the brand’s animal leathers. 
  Closer to home, handbag designer Ethan Koh is currently developing a vegan leather made from a plant species from Brazil and he hopes to be able to announce more details later this year. But while it is easy enough to jump on the vegan bandwagon for the feel-good factor, it is also worth asking if buying alternative leathers are indeed that much better for the environment. The answer, it turns out, is that it is complicated. While vegan leathers do score high on the cruelty-free factor since animals are not killed for their production, there are detractors who say that alternative leather materials can also lead to a certain amount of environmental damage. Whether they are made from plastics or plant-based materials, vegan leathers require the use of water and energy to process to create the look and feel of animal leather. Plus, leathers made of plastic generally take years to break down and could release toxic chemicals in the environment, such as microplastic contamination in water and the food chain. 
   A post shared by SINBONO.COM (@sinbono_official)  
    Nevertheless, the Environmental Profit & Loss sustainability report by luxury conglomerate Kering finds that the impact of vegan leather production can be up to a third lower than real leather. For independent designer Jyoti Singh, creative director and founder of Singapore brand Jo Kilda, these considerations were important factors in her design process. “I have always loved the stylish, edgy and luxurious look of leather but could never get myself to own one,” she said. It was only when she discovered PU (a type of plastic) leather, which she says both looks and feels good to touch, that she was convinced to take the plunge. “There are several factors to consider when evaluating both vegan and animal leather options: Animal welfare is our utmost priority along with care for the people making products for us, as well as waste, greenhouse gas emission, water usage, just to name a few,” she said. This material is used in her signature range of vegan leather apparel, which includes pleated skirts that are technically difficult to execute. The collection, which she launched in 2018 at New York Fashion Week, ranks among her most popular, making the challenges of using vegan leather such as sourcing for the right material, well worth the effort. Senreve’s Chung agrees that there are a different set of challenges to overcome in using this relatively new material compared to regular leather. The brand’s vegan leather was created using a complex blend of man-made synthetic materials that are treated to imitate many of the qualities valued in luxury leather goods such as durability, texture and suppleness. It took the brand 18 months of development together with its tannery partners to ensure they achieved the quality they wanted. She also made it a point to ensure the eco-friendliness of the production process. “It was critical for us that all of the materials, components and dyes were all vegan, not from animal or animal byproducts. We also as much as possible want to use materials that are eco-friendly, biodegradable and recyclable as well,” Chung added. They also had to work with partners and factories that were typically more used to working with animal leather. “They had to understand how the materials would interact with the hand-painted edge paint, how durable it was, the tensile strength and many other factors that were new and different,” she said. This summer, to cater to the ever growing demand for vegan products, Senreve is introducing a new cactus leather material which has a softer and more supple quality, making it suitable for new bag silhouettes that are less structured and more lightweight. Best of all, the cactus leather is not only guilt-free, it is also good for the environment. Chung said, “We like that it’s plant-based, and also the cactus plants regenerate and capture carbon from the atmosphere as they grow.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary-covid-19-has-made-cities-cleaner-quieter-and-healthier-1947686,"Commentary: COVID-19 has made cities cleaner, quieter and healthier","LONDON:  If we could transport ourselves back to the last major global pandemic, the Spanish Flu of 1918 to 1920, we would find deserted city centres, curfews and quarantines. But a century ago, the pandemic gave way to the social revolution of the Roaring Twenties – or Les Annees Folles. The future for humanity then was not two-metre social distancing any more than it will be for us.  Nonetheless, it’s worth asking: How will cities survive the current crisis; and how will they be different? In the short term, it might seem as if everything is in flux, but looking further forward I believe we will see that the pandemic has simply accelerated trends that were already evident. 
  CITIES TRANSFORM WITH CRISES The first and dominant trend is the power of the city as a social magnet. That collective energy creates wealth and opportunity – the gross domestic product of New York City, for example, is four times that of Switzerland. There is also a statistical relationship in terms of greater life expectancy, lower infant mortality, and higher levels of education. History tells us that cities are often transformed in response to crises. The Great Fire of London resulted in building codes that created the DNA of the elegant Georgian city; the response to the London cholera epidemic of the mid-19th century was a new city-wide sanitation system. In the same century, health concerns saw the rise of public parks and gardens. Closer to our time, the smoggy conditions of London and Los Angeles in the 1950s and 1970s created Clean Air Acts. You might argue that each of those developments would have happened independently, but there is no doubt that crises hastened the inevitable. In a time of climate change and decarbonisation, the changing nature of mobility is another significant trend.  We are already witnessing a move away from fossil fuel-powered vehicles to those that use electric propulsion that can charge by induction while on the move. When driverless, these vehicles will be able to park densely and safely, platooning nose-to-tail. All of this is happening at a time when younger generations are eschewing car ownership and embracing ride sharing and on-demand services, available at the touch of an app. Trends in mobility cannot be separated from changes in the patterns of work and the nature of the workplace. Working at home was, for a fortunate few, always an option. While the pandemic has prompted an upsurge in home working, it has also spurred the rise of the “third place”, whether that’s a Starbucks on the High Street, or a rural retreat. And while “Zoom-ing” into conferences has stretched technology beyond expectations, it has also made us aware of the innate need to come together creatively and socially in shared spaces. 
  CLEANER, QUIETER, HEALTHIER CITIES Progressive designs for the workplace have always blurred the edges between work and leisure in pursuit of a better life balance. The term “green building” embraces a sustainable approach that has been proven to be healthier and more productive. Until recently, those who championed green buildings have been on the enlightened fringe. But soon the concept will become mainstream, especially given a younger, more health-conscious workforce. These topics have been the subject of workshops at the Norman Foster Foundation in Madrid, to encourage young graduates, who might one day be civic leaders, to anticipate the future. But I have detected something new and that is attitude. This is evident in some bold initiatives taken during the pandemic, such as the creation of 650km of cycle lanes in Paris. It is also manifest in London, where streets in Soho have been commandeered by outdoor cafes. Neighbourhoods outside the city core have also seen a resurgence in appeal. Tagged the “15-minute city”, these are places where working, learning, dining and recreation can all happen within walking distance from home. Again, this is not new, but it has been boosted by the pandemic. Taken together, these trends add up to cities that can be cleaner, quieter, healthier, more walkable and bikeable, and vitally, greener. 
  TOWARDS MORE EQUITABLE CITIES Debates about the city often ignore those who make it function behind the scenes – essential workers in health services, cleaning, maintenance, sanitation and security. A key consequence of change should be greater reward and better housing for this vital sector of society – in other words, a more equitable city. Change is also linked to the rate of urbanisation. Before the pandemic, the equivalent of eight cities the size of New York were emerging annually around the world. All of this adds up to another 2.5 billion people living in cities in 30 years’ time. 
  Looking further afield, could the impact of the pandemic lead to a reassessment of global networks and supply chains? Politically, will it lead to more global collaboration on the big issues, such as energy production and climate change, or will we see more fragmentation and a shift towards an “everyone for themselves” approach? The hope is that it will be “we, we, we” and not “me, me, me”. The ideal outcome is global action on the big environmental and health issues, and local action in all the activities such as governing and improving our connected societies.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/internet-data-centre-carbon-electricity-design-climate-change-1849691,Commentary: The Internet consumes huge amounts of energy – but it can be more sustainable,"GLASGOW: Around 4.6 billion people use the Internet every day. In fact, 350,000 tweets have been sent in the past minute. We tend to think of the Internet as something ephemeral – partly thanks to terms like “web” and “cloud” – but the servers that host all that data produce huge amounts of emissions, leaving giant carbon footprints behind. Today, there are around 30 billion Internet-connected devices in the world. This includes personal computers, smartphones, TVs and tablets, as well as myriad devices using the Internet in subtler ways – like smart vehicles, smart home systems and smart watches – termed the Internet of Things. Such Internet-connected technologies are already playing a key role in the transition to a cleaner energy future; for example, home smart meters being rolled out across many countries help monitor and therefore reduce household energy usage. But as we rely on the Internet to process, use and store ever more data, the power it uses is increasing. For the sake of our planet, we need to make the web more sustainable. 
  ENERGY-SUCKING SERVERS Research estimates that by 2025, the IT industry could use 20 per cent of all electricity produced and emit up to 5.5 per cent of the world’s carbon emissions. That’s more than most countries’ total emissions bar China, India and the US. A growing proportion of IT energy consumption comes from data centres. These are buildings used to store data and computer hardware, which almost always plug directly into the local electricity grid. In most countries, that means they mostly use non-renewable sources of electricity. Around 50 per cent of data centres are now “hyperscale”, meaning they contain more than 5,000 servers and are generally larger than 1,000 sq m. These are typically used by major players in the data industry such as Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud or Amazon Web Services (AWS) – which alone hosts 5.8 per cent of all sites on the Internet. A number of these data centres have been trying to reduce their environmental impact and, in the process, to secure lower energy bills. Google has announced their goal to achieve 24/7 renewable energy-powered data centres by 2030, and their first such data centre became operational last year near Las Vegas. To run such centres solely off renewable energy, locating them in regions with abundant wind, solar, geothermal or hydroelectric power available is vital. The past decade has seen another trend emerge: Renewable energy-powered web hosting. Increasing numbers of website owners are choosing to pay platforms like AWS for space to store files on giant web servers. In an attempt to diminish the environmental impact of all that energy usage, some choose to purchase offsets – payments that theoretically compensate for carbon emissions by supporting low-carbon energy generation – whilst others purchase energy from renewable sources to match their total energy consumption. Meanwhile, a growing number of businesses have installed renewable energy systems such as solar panels or wind turbines with battery backups to directly power IT infrastructure.  (What can Singapore offer as a hub for carbon trading? Find out on The Climate Conversations.)    BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE INTERNET As the Internet grows, I’ve been looking into ways to build greater sustainability closer to home. Designing less energy-intensive websites could be an interesting way to start. Each user who logged onto Google’s relatively minimalist homepage today generated around 0.2g of CO2, depending on their location and connection speed. That’s far better than the Daily Mail’s image-heavy online homepage generating a whopping 54.0g per visit. Considering the two websites receive around 5 billion and 300 million visits per day respectively, it’s easy to see how our Internet-generated carbon emissions add up. If you’re curious about the footprints of other websites, Website Carbon is a simple resource for estimating the CO2 a website produces. Web designers could embrace minimalism, helping to reduce the energy required to load images, video and even specialised fonts that all require extra, sizeable files. Of course, this would make for a much less engaging Internet experience. 
  COULD SOLAR POWER THE WEB? Another potential solution for surfing more sustainably is offered by initiatives like Solar Protocol and the Low Tech Magazine. These ingenious websites are entirely powered by solar energy. Their environmentally friendly, responsive web design strategies – including reduced-colour images and default typefaces – allow their websites to run more efficiently based upon real-time assessment of available sunlight. Solar Protocol, for example, runs via a network of solar servers located across the globe. When a user visits the site, their content is delivered from the server receiving the most solar energy at that time. The resolution of the website is also dynamically altered according to the energy being generated by the solar panel. When the solar energy or battery level falls below a specific threshold, due for example to a cloudy day, the websites become low-resolution. They could even revert to a basic, text-only format when the clouds have truly closed in and power is particularly low. The challenge designers and engineers face is to scale on-site energy generation technologies like these to help run the enormous number of sites on the web. Subtle changes to images or page resolution, made during periods of low wind or solar generation, could have significant effects on energy consumption – but go unnoticed by users. 
  For businesses, the benefits of using tech like this include not only reduced energy costs but enhanced business reputation, thanks to increased public concern around sustainability. Over 40 per cent of UK businesses already generate some of their electricity on site through solar panels or wind capture. The largest solar farm in the UK, in Flintshire, Wales, is mostly used for generating power for a nearby paper mill. So the next step of powering commercial websites from locally-owned, renewable-driven servers might not be such a radical step.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/tackle-climate-change-and-biodiversity-loss-together-un-panel-1845546,Tackle climate change and biodiversity loss together: UN panel,"PARIS: The world must tackle the dual crises of climate change and biodiversity loss together, two United Nations expert groups meeting together said on Thursday (Jun 10), warning against measures to combat global warming that harm nature. In the first ever collaboration between the UN's intergovernmental panels on climate and nature loss, the scientists said that while the twin threats were mutually reinforcing, they had historically been treated as if they were independent of each other. A peer-reviewed workshop report, based on virtual discussions between experts from the IPBES biodiversity and IPCC climate panels, warned that a number of planned interventions against global heating would adversely impact nature. 
  These include planting bioenergy crops over large land areas, which are detrimental to ecosystems. They also cautioned against planting trees to suck up carbon pollution in ecosystems that have not historically been forested, which often damages biodiversity and food production. The panel called for an end to the loss and degradation of carbon- and species-rich ecosystems on land and oceans. Subsidies supporting activities harmful to nature - such as deforestation, over-fertilisation and over-fishing - must halt, the experts concluded. 
  At the same time, they underlined the need for changes in individual consumption habits. Restoring ecosystems was among the cheapest and quickest climate interventions available, and could also offer much-needed additional habitat for plants and animals, the researchers said. Improved management of cropland and grazing systems alone could save 3 to 6 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions a year. ""Climate change and biodiversity loss combine to threaten society - often magnifying and accelerating each other,"" said Hoesung Lee, chair of the IPCC. Lee said that Thursday's report was an ""important step"" in the collaboration between scientific fields focusing on climate and those focused on biodiversity. ""LONG OVERDUE"" Alexandre Antonelli, director of science at Britain's Royal Botanic Gardens, said the IPCC and IPBES collaboration was ""long overdue"". ""Although climate change and biodiversity loss pose unseen threats to our future, the good news is that we can tackle both through the right measures - those that are based on solid science,"" said Antonelli, who was not involved in the report. 
  Several IPCC and IPBES members took the opportunity to stress the need for a total transformation in the way humans interact with nature. Ana Maria Hernandez Salgar, chair of IPBES, said that nothing short of a ""complementary"" approach to both crises would avert the worst. ""Transformative change in all parts of society and our economy is needed to stabilise our climate, stop biodiversity loss and chart a path to the sustainable future we want,"" she said. Environmental groups welcomed Thursday's collaboration, as well as the joint assessment's conclusion that nature alone cannot be relied upon to offset humanity's vast carbon emissions. ""The report unequivocally concludes that land- and ocean-based actions that capture carbon must be in addition to, and not in lieu of, ambitious reductions of emissions from fossil fuels,"" said Doreen Stabinsky, professor of global environmental politics at the College of the Atlantic."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/climatechange/chanel-invests-us-25-million-new-climate-adaptation-fund-1846141,Fashion label Chanel invests US$25 million in new climate adaptation fund,"PARIS: French fashion house Chanel is backing a new climate adaptation fund that aims to raise US$100 million by 2025 to invest in projects to promote sustainable agriculture, protect forests and support small-scale farmers in developing countries. The Landscape Resilience Fund (LRF) was developed by green group the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Swiss-based social enterprise South Pole, and is starting with US$25 million from luxury brand Chanel and US$1.3 million from the Global Environment Facility. An independent non-profit, the LRF aims to attract a further five to 10 additional investors to help finance small businesses and projects that foster climate-resilient agriculture and forestry practices, and protect natural systems. Martin Stadelmann, a senior director at South Pole, which will manage the LRF, said that it was a pioneering way for a major multinational company to invest in adaptation to climate change. ""As (with) other companies, some of their supply chains are under threat because of climate change,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. One million animal and plant species are at risk of extinction due to humankind's relentless pursuit of economic growth, scientists warned in a 2019 landmark report on the devastating impact of modern civilisation on the natural world. 
  Environmentalists largely blame the production of commodities like palm oil, beef and minerals for the destruction of forests, as forests are cleared for plantations, ranches, farms and mines. Cutting down forests has major implications for global goals to curb climate change, as trees absorb about a third of the planet-warming emissions produced worldwide, but release carbon back into the air when they rot or are burned. Forests also provide food and livelihoods, and are an essential habitat for wildlife. 
  Better conservation, restoration and management of natural areas, such as parks, forests and wildernesses, is seen as key for nations to meet targets to reduce planet-heating emissions and reverse the loss of plant and animal species. Global annual spending to protect and restore nature on land needs to triple this decade to about US$350 billion, a United Nations report said in May, urging a shift in mindset among financiers, businesses and governments. Presently, only about 5 per cent of total climate finance goes to adapting to a warmer planet, with most of that coming from public funds, South Pole officials said. ""The fund really targets the 'missing middle' where there is currently no commercial financing,"" said Urs Dieterich, a fund manager at South Pole and managing director of the LRF. 
  The fund will provide cheap loans and technical assistance to small businesses that work with smallholders in vulnerable landscapes – such as cocoa or coffee growers and rattan harvesters – and help them access better farming inputs, such as drought-resistant seeds, as well as training and finance. Repaid loans will be reinvested in other small businesses working on climate adaptation. Projects can apply online for funding or approach the LRF directly, and will be assessed for their climate change exposure and adaptation plans. Their progress will be tracked by local staff and published in annual reports, fund officials said. ""There has never been a more critical time for the private sector to step up and help close the investment gap needed for effective climate adaptation,"" Andrea d'Avack, chief sustainability officer at Chanel, said in a statement. The LRF offers an opportunity to ""explore different approaches that could help advance changes in our own supply chain and business practices"", d'Avack added."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/climate-change-carbon-footprint-recycle-reduce-waste-plastic-1832241,Commentary: Trying to live more sustainably? It’s impossible to make a difference alone,"SINGAPORE: We’re all familiar with the threat of climate change. We also know what we must do: Reduce our emissions to net zero by 2050 to have a 50 per cent chance of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Yet, a common solution among individuals is frantically accounting for every gram of their carbon footprint, hoping that every little action counts when it comes to climate change. This is also encouraged by governments and corporations, with messages to practise the 3Rs and switch off lights when not in use. But if we stop to think about it, our individual efforts are statistically insignificant, especially when compared to what businesses and governments can achieve. 
  Take cooling as an example. Using the fan instead of the air-conditioner to keep cool is a common message to get individuals to reduce their carbon footprint. Unfortunately, air-conditioning in homes only account for 2 per cent of carbon emissions in Singapore. In contrast, air-conditioning in non-residential buildings account for 8 per cent of carbon emissions in Singapore. To lower emissions from cooling in Singapore, many things can be done. Alternative cooling methods can be developed. Buildings can be painted a lighter shade. Plants can be used to reduce the ambient temperature. 
  None of these can be done by individuals. Try painting your HDB flat’s exterior walls white to reduce heat gain of the building, or try planting many trees around your estate and you’ll likely be fined or asked to undo your changes. In non-residential buildings, the building design actually makes it impossible for natural and mechanical ventilation to be sufficient for the building, as recent guidelines on improving ventilation in buildings to prevent the spread of COVID-19 has shown. In this case, systemic change is needed. HDB has to implement a policy to paint HDB flats a lighter shade. Mechanical and natural ventilation have to be mandated in non-residential buildings instead of air-conditioning. Associated rules, such as dress codes, have to change too to fit the new policies. 
  REDUCE, REUSE AND RECYCLE? Waste production is another example. Individuals in Singapore generated 915g of waste per day on average in 2019, about 334kg per person that year, and collectively all individuals in Singapore generated 1.87 million tonnes of waste. It is a staggeringly huge amount but is only about a quarter of total waste generated in Singapore. The rest comes from the non-domestic sector. A lot of effort is then spent on trying to recycle rather than reduce our waste, but recycling is another area where individual action could easily be negated. If you throw a clean plastic bottle into the blue recycling bin, but the bin gets contaminated, all its contents would have to be incinerated. Your efforts would have literally gone to waste. 
  Unfortunately, 40 per cent of recyclables collected in Singapore’s blue bins are contaminated and sent for incineration. Under the National Recycling Programme, a blue recycling bin is placed below every HDB block. Even if most residents know to place only clean recyclables in the bin, it takes one person to dump a bowl of laksa into the bin to ruin the efforts of everyone else. There might be an argument that education would help prevent that, but realistically the number of people who know how to recycle properly and actually do so will never hit 100 per cent. This shows that the existing system is flawed and needs to be changed to achieve the aim of increasing Singapore’s recycling rates, but no amount of proper recycling from an individual can change that. 
  DISTRACTIONS FROM TRUE PROGRESS Focusing solely on individual actions could also distract from metrics that are able to measure if true progress exists. There is a growing plant-based movement in Singapore, where people choose to reduce their consumption of animals and animal products for ethical and/or environmental reasons. According to a 2020 YouGov survey, two in five Singaporeans are on a flexitarian diet, meaning they eat mostly plant-based foods while eating meat and animal products in moderation. However, data from the Singapore Food Agency shows that the overall amount of meat imported into Singapore has an increasing trend from 2010 to 2019. This means that more animals than ever are being farmed and killed for human consumption in Singapore. In this context, it might seem like individual efforts to reduce meat consumption might be better used to engage in systemic change instead. This could include encouraging eateries to introduce more plant-based options or getting event organisers to make plant-based meals the default. 
  Individual efforts might even end up doing harm. Case in point being the plastic alternatives currently available in the market. A 2017 lifecycle analysis commissioned by NEA shows that in Singapore’s context, biodegradable disposables might not be better for the environment. They’re made of plastic and additives to catalyse degradation. But because waste is incinerated in Singapore, rather than buried in landfills, these products cannot degrade, so are not different from plastic in terms of environmental impact. Many shops and retailers offer biodegradable alternatives in a bid to do their part for the environment. Consumers who don’t know how waste in Singapore is handled support this, in the mistaken belief they’re doing good, but it ultimately ends up doing more harm than good. 
  WALKING THE TALK This is not to discourage individual action. Despite all I’ve written, I try to do my part – reduce my use of disposables, recycle, use a fan instead of an air-conditioner and take public transport instead of private transport. These actions might be statistically insignificant, but they help me live my life in line with my values. It is important to do things that make us feel good about ourselves, but we must remember it is not enough to take individual action. We need to learn why things are the way they are now, rethink the assumptions we might have about how things are supposed to be, and work at changing the systems that shape the way we behave. After all, individual efforts can have an outsized impact. Such efforts could be joining a local environmental group, participating in citizen’s workgroups organised by the government, or getting businesses to change their current practices. 
  Efforts by the People’s Movement to Stop Haze managed to get several eateries to switch to using RSPO-certified oil, which helps to reduce haze from forest fires. A Deposit Refund Scheme and disposable bag charge raised by the Citizen’s Workgroup on Recycling Right and Citizen’s Workgroup on Reducing the Excessive Use of Disposables are now being studied for implementation, and will lead to increasing recycling rates of beverage containers and reducing the amount of disposable bags used respectively. These efforts were made by a relatively small group of people, but the impact is far greater than if they just took individual action and nothing else. Our lifestyle choices do have a place in raising awareness and helping us live with our conscience. But if we truly care about any issue, we need to think bigger to really make a difference.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sun-life-singapore-ceo-belinda-au-leading-crisis-2060381,Sun Life Singapore CEO Belinda Au: Leading in a crisis,"Just three weeks after Ms Belinda Au landed in Singapore to take on the role of chief executive officer at Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada Singapore Branch (Sun Life Singapore), borders were closed in response to the fast-spreading COVID-19 virus. The pandemic not only meant she has not been able to see her family in Hong Kong for the past 15 months (and counting), but that she would be launching the Singapore branch of the Canadian insurance company (Sun Life) in an unusually difficult environment. The establishment of a branch here is meant to help Sun Life better meet the needs of high-net-worth (HNW) clients and support them in growing and preserving their wealth for generations beyond. Said Ms Au: “This is where we want to be, this is where we want to have a presence.” Setting up the branch in the midst of an unprecedented crisis was probably her most challenging task to date, Ms Au admitted. Thankfully, she could rely on the foundation and global expertise of Sun Life, which was established in Canada in 1865 and which expanded its foothold to Asia in the 1890s. Today, it has offices in 27 markets worldwide, of which eight are in Asia. Ms Au was also able to draw on a wealth of experience in her 30-year career in the insurance industry where she has helmed a number of leadership roles in the region. Ms Au believes that the pandemic has accelerated the interest in protection solutions sought by HNW clients – a need that Sun Life Singapore aims to meet. Sun Life Singapore plans to offer a comprehensive suite of solutions targeted at the HNW segment. The unexpected silver lining from the pandemic was the additional time it gave her fledgling team to set up systems, processes and infrastructure to make its services more client-centric. “We value our clients and are committed to building long-term relationships with them, and also with our business partners,” Ms Au explained. ​​​​​​​AN INNOVATIVE MINDSET Ms Au’s professed transparent leadership style helps to guide her team members as they navigate unchartered waters. While she is unafraid to speak her mind, she is also aware of the need to be flexible and innovative. “In our rapidly-evolving world, problem-solving and the ability to innovate are skills that will help us go the distance and thrive. While clients continue to expect their insurers to help them grow and protect their wealth, we, as their trusted partner, should continue to innovate and be more creative in engaging our clients and meeting their needs,” Ms Au said. Asked for one piece of advice she would give to newcomers to the industry, she urged them to always know “why” and not just “how” to do something. “If I am given an instruction, I always check why I am I doing it. If the reason is beneficial, then my gut feeling tells me it is right to do it. And asking why may open up further discourse and opportunities,” she said. Ms Au is also a walking testament of Sun Life’s mission of promoting healthy lifestyles. An active person by nature, she counts running at Gardens by the Bay as one of her favourite activities. The avid golfer also tries to play 18 holes every weekend.  THE ROAD AHEAD In the coming two to three years, Ms Au will be focused on launching more products in the Singapore market, and growing the team. She hopes to build a sustainable business here, and put in place a team that can run the business. Sun Life Singapore is also committed to sustainability and giving back to the community, said Ms Au. Last year, Sun Life Singapore made a donation to supercharge a COVID-19 study in Singapore, which aims to develop the optimal dosage of drugs that can be used in combination for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Earlier this year, it donated to a community group to support its efforts in providing services to people with diabetes.  “We are pleased to be part of the Singapore community and are committed to playing our part in the fight against COVID-19 and diabetes,” said Ms Au. Most recently in June 2021, Sun Life Singapore made a donation to the Singapore Association for Mental Health in support of mental health concerns that have arisen in the community as a result of COVID-19.  She added: “I am very excited about the future of our business in Singapore, and I am equally excited to be part of the team in fulfilling our ambition to be a leading HNW insurance company in Asia, and to realise our vision to become your trusted partner.” Find out more about how Sun Life Singapore can help you preserve your wealth and plan your legacy.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/solar-panel-power-primary-schools-carbon-neutral-1824171,3 primary schools in Punggol start tapping on solar power as part of carbon-neutral push,"SINGAPORE: Three primary schools in Punggol have begun tapping on electricity generated from solar panels as Singapore moves towards its target for at least 20 per cent of schools to be carbon-neutral by 2030. Rooftop solar systems were installed at Horizon Primary School, Compassvale Primary School and Edgefield Primary School at the end of April, said Sunseap Group on Tuesday (Jun 1). The systems will generate 397.44 kilowatts peak (kWp), 190.44 kWp and 389.16 kWp of energy respectively – enough to power 297 four-room flats when combined, said the local solar energy solutions provider. Sunseap said it was also installing solar panels at six other schools: Anderson Primary School, Kranji Secondary School, Catholic High School (primary), Methodist Girls' School (primary and secondary) and Tampines Primary School. Earlier this year, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said progressively equipping schools with solar panels was one way it planned to reach the 2030 carbon-neutral target. 
  The target was first announced in February with the launch of the Singapore Green Plan. MOE also said it was working towards a two-thirds reduction of net carbon emissions from the schools sector by 2030. As of March, about 130 schools were on the SolarNova programme with solar panels progressively installed on their rooftops. Then Minister for Education Lawrence Wong told Parliament that MOE will extend the programme to cover most of the remaining schools in the coming decade. 
  The school installations carried out by Sunseap were part of the fourth solar leasing tender awarded to the company under the SolarNova programme in 2019. The company said it is set to install more than 170,000 solar panels across public housing blocks and government sites between 2020 and 2022. ""Sustainability has become increasingly important and there is no better place to instil environmental consciousness in future generations than through schools,"" said Sunseap co-founder and CEO Frank Phuan. Singapore has set a national target of halving its 2030 peak greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and achieving net-zero emissions ""as soon as viable"" in the second half of the century."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/fast-fashion-clothes-sustainability-worker-climate-change-thrift-1395236,Commentary: S$5 tank tops can end up costing too much,"SINGAPORE: I can’t remember the last time I walked into a brick-and-mortar fast fashion retail store. And no, it’s not because the pandemic has made me wary of unnecessary contact with people. Neither is it because I’ve picked up an online shopping habit instead. It’s because I’ve more or less given up on fast fashion. I used to love it. I spent my early teenage years shopping regularly at H&M, noticing that every other week, when I returned, the entire store’s inventory had changed, like magic. I remember going up and down the escalators at Somerset 313’s Forever 21 with friends, spending time in the changing rooms of Cotton On, trying on outfits and snapping selfies in them. But I also remember the flimsy quality of those S$15 rompers, the sheer, see-through design of the S$5.99 tank tops, and the many times S$14.99 sandal straps broke … in public. 
  Today, my closet is made up of more reliable items of clothing: Wearable, repeatable pieces from secondhand fashion accounts on Carousell or friends’ closets, mixed in with fun and colourful vintage numbers from thrift shops, and the occasional splurge on ethical fashion pieces. I’m not saying a higher price tag equates to better quality. And I still own pieces of fast fashion that have lasted – I frequently reach for my thrifted pair of Zara pants, and my Cotton On mock neck top remains a wardrobe staple, even after many years of wear. But we still should be curious about the true cost of fast fashion. THE TRUE COST OF FASHION Too often, the companies who make these clothes cheap don’t make them well. The entire business model of fast fashion companies is built upon our ultra-fast consumption of clothing: The more we buy, the more they make. Which means the faster we dispose of our clothing, the better (for them). So that frustration you feel when a cheap piece of clothing falls apart, and the sigh and shrug that accompanies you going into the store to replace it? It’s entirely intended and works in their favour. 
  Fast fashion grows its empire by making consumers feel like they need to keep buying more, which explains the constant emails, endless sales and relentless collection drops. These days, fast fashion brands go by “micro-seasons”, producing much more than how they used to produce – that is, according to the actual seasons. Hence, total clothing production has roughly doubled since 2000. Such clothing may be affordable, but what is the price we really pay? 
  Much has been written about the environmental cost of these cheap clothes, from cradle to grave. The fashion industry uses 79 trillion litres of water every year to produce cotton and other textiles, and produces 92 million tonnes of waste a year. It’s responsible for 10 per cent of global carbon emissions – more than that of flights and maritime shipping combined. And it’s not just destroying the planet. News report after news report detail examples of how the fashion industry is rife with exploitative practices and human rights abuses. Hidden behind layers of sub-contracting are gruelling working hours, low pay, lack of job security, dangerous (and fatal) working conditions and suppression of trade unions. 
  OUR CLOTHES HAVE STORIES But what happens to us when we purchase disposable fashion? The inconvenience of it all is one thing, but buy-and-throw-away culture has undeniably changed the way we engage with our clothing. As we purchase more and more clothes, these items become utilitarian – we buy them solely to complete our outfits, chase after trends and feel the rush of owning something new. But clothes can have stories, and we can have relationships with the clothes we own. Earlier this year, I was invited to a private, pandemic-safe clothes swap by a friend. There were six of us, and each of us brought items that we had loved, but were ready to part with. The swap started with us going through each of our items in a show-and-tell format. We recounted where we bought them, the places they had been with us, the points of our lives during which they were featured the most. 
  That day, after giving away a number of mine, I adopted a pair of black polyester pajama pants with Chinese characters printed on them, an oversized pink and brown loose-knit blouse, a pair of dark denim Armani jeans and a Boy Scouts of America uniform shirt. Each of them, I imagined, had their own stories beyond the stories that were told that day. But more than the acquisition of those pieces themselves, I felt like I’d taken pieces of those who owned them. It hit me then that I couldn’t recall the last time I felt connected to the items of clothing I owned. I had a wardrobe full of stuff, but the stuff had no meaning beyond their utilitarian function. 
  RETHINK, SLOW DOWN AND ASK QUESTIONS Rather than Marie Kondo our clothes away and down-size our wardrobes, perhaps the solution to regaining that attachment to our clothes is to rethink how we consume them, and then slow down. To start, we can get more intentional about our purchases. This doesn’t mean we have to buy more expensive, ethical fashion. I’ve found thrifting to be much more of a thrilling experience than regular shopping. Thrifting runs the gamut of charity shops, secondhand shops tucked away in quiet malls or unsuspecting buildings and even pop-up events. Check out New2U (a classic), The Fashion Pulpit (for more comfortable try-ons) or Five Finds Thrift Market (packed with Gen-Z styles). There are hidden gems everywhere, you never know what you’ll find, and you’ll never look the same as someone else. Organising a clothes swap among your friends or community also achieves the same effect, and is not as logistically complex as you might think. 
  Practicing better care for the clothes we currently own is a way to start too. If not picking up repairing skills yourself (ever heard of visible mending or upcycling?), try visiting the many tailoring shops we have on the island and supporting a dying trade, instead of just buying something new. Individual consumers not consuming fast fashion alone is not going to be sufficient. Unplugging the fast fashion machine requires shedding light on the unethical practices of fast fashion companies, working with governments and international bodies to enact legislation to protect garment workers and our environment, which fashion activists are doing. But activists need our help too: To set higher standards for our personal wardrobes (if we can), and beyond that, to ask more questions. To be more curious about what’s behind the label. We don’t have to feel guilty that we can’t control the decisions made by fast fashion companies – but we can pressure them to make better, and make less. If individual actions won’t move the needle on climate change, what will?

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/go-green-sustainable-printing-solutions-2060336,Go green with sustainable printing solutions,"Climate change is a global challenge, and Singapore, like many nations, is taking concrete steps towards building a sustainable future. To this end, the Government has outlined a path towards sustainability with a blueprint that aims to achieve its long-term net-zero-emissions aspiration as soon as viable. The Singapore Green Plan 2030, or the Green Plan, is a whole-of-nation movement to advance Singapore’s national agenda on sustainable development. A key aspect of the plan calls for an “energy reset” that targets to promote the use of cleaner energy and increase energy efficiency to lower Singapore’s carbon footprint. Among other initiatives, this will involve the widespread use of solar energy in HDB towns and the eventual phasing out of internal combustion engine vehicles in favour of those that run on cleaner engines. However, achieving a green future will require more than just government action. The actions of individuals and businesses, no matter how small, will play an important part in helping Singapore become more sustainable. This includes the choice of office equipment that a business uses in its operations. Said Ms Tan May Lin, regional director for Epson Sales Division, Retail Products and Regional Brand & Communications: “At Epson, we believe that each of us has a role to play in building a better future. For us, being a sustainable company means being mindful of every aspect of our organisation. With this in mind, Epson has established and is working towards its Environmental Vision 2050, a framework put in place to address climate change. We aim to do this by looking at sustainability and the circular economy as a more comprehensive approach – and we encourage other businesses to do the same.” ECO-FRIENDLY PRINTING Converting laser printers to heat-free inkjet printers is one way businesses can promote sustainability, as it can result in an eco-friendly solution that is fast and energy-efficient. Such printers not only reduce energy use, but also save on time and costs. Indeed, taking small steps such as switching to a heat-free printing option can make a difference in the fight against global warming. One such heat-free product is Epson’s EcoTank monochrome inkjet printers, which have been independently verified to use up to 85 per cent less power1 ; generate up to 85 per cent less carbon dioxide2 ; and have up to 59 per cent less replacement parts when compared to laser printers3. The printers offer numerous features that benefit the environment without sacrificing print quality. For instance, they use refillable ultra-high-yield supplies that reduce waste products and minimise their environmental impact. Each affordable ink bottle can print up to 7,500 pages while an auto-duplex printing feature reduces paper consumption and costs by up to 50 per cent. These printers consume significantly less power than their laser counterparts, which must reheat fusing units every time operation is resumed from standby mode. As EcoTank printers do not require preheating, the first-page-out time is shorter compared to laser printers. They also do not emit heat, which means that fewer replacements of parts will be required over their lifetime. The result – faster printing and less downtime for businesses. “The Epson EcoTank range is designed to fit easily into any office environment with its small footprint,” shared Ms Tan. “Offering a sustainable printing solution for the modern workplace, these printers are equipped with Epson’s revolutionary Heat-Free Technology, which means that Epson’s business inkjet printers use less power and produce less CO₂ emissions, allowing businesses to save on electricity costs and reduce environmental impact as they work towards contributing to the nation’s Green Plan.” Epson’s Heat-Free Technology is part of the company’s broader commitment to sustainability encompassed in its Be Cool campaign. The campaign aims to help people and businesses play their part in protecting the environment by delivering eco-efficient and eco-conscious technology that helps reduce energy consumption, enhance productivity and minimise the overall environmental impact of every Epson product. UNCOMPROMISING QUALITY According to Epson, the EcoTank monochrome inkjet printers have a print quality that rivals that of laser printers. They also feature a pigment ink that is lightfast, which means it resists fading when exposed to the ozone – great for archival storage of office documents – and is water- and smudge- resistant. These versatile machines are able to print across a wide range of media types and applications, including invoices, delivery notes, cheques, envelopes, label printings and barcode printing. They boast a cost per page as low as S$0.002, which means a lower total cost of ownership for businesses. Companies can easily calculate their potential savings compared to other printer brands using the EcoTank TCO Calculator. Epson’s EcoTank printers are designed to support the digital office of the future, thanks to their integrated WiFi capabilities and wireless connectivity options. All EcoTank monochrome printers come with a warranty of up to four years. Reflecting the popularity of the model, some 50 million EcoTank printers have been sold worldwide. Said Ms Tan: “Consumers are increasingly looking to work and purchase from companies that are innovative when it comes to sustainability and are responsible as good corporate citizens. We believe that digital transformation and sustainability are two integral drivers for the digital offices of the future. Epson is continuously working to ensure a seamless integration of digital transformation and sustainability, whether it involves the use of sustainable materials, reducing energy consumption or embracing a clear vision that champions corporate responsibility beyond profit.” ​​​​​​​Find out how you can switch to an eco-friendly printing solution at epson.com.sg/becool. 1 Based on results from internal testing conducted by Epson, using Epson L6550 ISO Color 12ipm vs Laser model ISO Color 22ppm test for power consumed to print 20 pages.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/climatechange/indonesia-cyclone-preparedness-seroja-bmkg-east-nusa-tenggara-1883501,"With climate change supercharging cyclones, experts call for Indonesia to enhance preparedness","JAKARTA: Despite obvious signs that a powerful cyclone was brewing, life carried on as usual in the Indonesian province of East Nusa Tenggara last month.  Aside from grounding ships and airplanes from travelling in the rough weather, hardly any preparation was made.  Locals said that they were never warned while government officials did not seem to pay much attention to tropical depression TD 99S, which had been getting more and more intense since Apr 2 as it travelled through the Savu Sea. Even the province’s then-disaster mitigation chief, Thomas Bangke, appeared indifferent about the warnings. Mr Bangke, who was in Bali at the time on a business junket, did not shorten his trip and order for disaster preparations back home. He was eventually removed from his position days later for neglecting his duties.   TD 99S later developed into Tropical Cyclone Seroja in the early hours of Apr 4, just as people in the predominantly Christian province were preparing to celebrate Easter. That morning, the cyclone made landfall in the Island of Timor, which Indonesia shares with Timor-Leste. The cyclone’s centre came dangerously close to the provincial capital Kupang, a city of 400,000 people.  With windspeed of up to 150km/h, the category one cyclone dismantled roofs, uprooted trees, sent debris flying and caused a ferry sitting on the harbour to capsize and sink. From above, the cyclone was blanketing almost the entire province. In the remote islands of Adonara, Lembata and Alor, about 200km north of Kupang, Cyclone Seroja was causing extreme rainfall of up to 360mm per day. It rained heavily for nine hours and the islands’ barren and sparsely vegetated landscape struggled to contain the influx of water. A series of landslides and flash floods occurred almost simultaneously in numerous areas of Adonara, Lembata and Alor islands, washing away people’s homes and knocking down bridges and roads. As a result, 183 people in Indonesia, 42 in Timor-Leste and one person in Australia were killed in the cyclone that travelled nearly 5,000km and lasted for nine days before it dissipated in the Great Australian Bight. Cyclones are rare in Indonesia and they seldom make landfall. In the last 40 years, Seroja was the seventh cyclone with epicentres passing through Indonesian soil. Seroja was by far the most devastating cyclone to hit the country. Cyclone Seroja also devastated parts of Western Australia, where houses and other buildings were not constructed to withstand tropical cyclones because they usually do not push so far south. The Indonesian Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) said due to climate change, cyclones could be occurring more and more frequently, particularly in East Nusa Tenggara, the province furthest away from the equator and one which is surrounded by vast bodies of water. With more cyclones predicted, experts are urging Indonesia to be more prepared for the weather phenomenon, starting from giving proper early warnings and responses to the way buildings are constructed. NOT ALL AREAS ARE PREPARED Indonesian meteorology agency chief Dwikorita Karnawati told CNA that BMKG had been monitoring Seroja, known as Tropical Depression 99S at the time, since Mar 29. “At the time we did not know that it would develop into a cyclone yet. But there were signs it was strengthening.  ""We immediately issued a high wave warning and recommended that all ships be grounded,” Mdm Karnawati said, adding that her agency constantly updated local authorities on the progress of tropical depression. On Apr 2, the BMKG issued another warning, stating that the tropical depression would likely develop into a cyclone and recommended authorities to watch out for intense rains, high waves, strong winds and lightning. Despite the warnings, regional administrations at the provincial and regency levels in East Nusa Tenggara failed to make adequate preparations in time, Mdm Karnawati said.   “Cyclone is not something which happens suddenly. We should be able to prepare ourselves for the worst, days in advance,” she continued. 
  “However, we are dealing with different regional governments and not all have the adequate resources, equipment and skill needed.”    Response to BMKG warnings can also vary, she added. “Not all governments understand what the warnings meant and how they should prepare. They sometimes cannot imagine the implications of such warnings and the extent of the possible damage,” Mdm Karnawati said. Jonathan Lassa, who teaches humanitarian, emergency and disaster management at Charles Darwin University in Australia said because cyclones happen so rarely in Indonesia, there is a lack of understanding about the weather phenomenon’s risks. “Indonesia underestimates cyclones and this is what happened. We didn’t take cyclones seriously enough because governments only focus on responding to the aftermath of secondary hazards like rains, floods, landslides and high waves instead of looking at the bigger picture,” he told CNA. “We need to start building a system on how to monitor cyclones and prepare for them.” MITIGATION PLANS FORMULATED The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) acknowledges Indonesia’s lack of preparedness for cyclones. On Apr 19, the BNPB staged a discussion to formulate the proper procedures to mitigate future cyclones. Among the issues discussed, the BNPB said in a statement, was identifying areas prone to cyclones and their secondary hazards like earthquakes and flash floods. The disaster agency also talked about ways to make residents more prepared for cyclones, including drills, evacuation plans and means to provide cyclone warnings to the general population. Mr Lassa, the disaster management lecturer, said the government also needs to do more in terms of regulations. “We need to formulate a suitable building code and more importantly enforce it. If needed, the government can subsidise underprivileged families to make sure their houses are up to code,” he said.  “Right now, there are buildings (in East Nusa Tenggara) which are perfect to withstand earthquakes but fare very poorly when dealing with cyclones. We need to start thinking how houses in both cyclone and quake prone areas can withstand multiple hazards."" 
  The government also needs to rethink its spatial planning, Mr Lassa said, highlighting the fact that there were mangrove forests in East Nusa Tenggara which had been converted into salt farms, depriving coastal areas from their natural defences against coastal flooding and storm surges. “Because most parts of East Nusa Tenggara are arid and sparsely vegetated, the government needs to find ways to populate certain areas with trees which are not only suited to the climate but also strong enough to withstand cyclones,” he said. “But first, we need to change our attitude towards cyclones and start taking them seriously. Otherwise, we will never be ready.” Experts said Indonesia’s preparedness towards cyclones is long overdue. Although not as powerful as Seroja and never made landfall in Indonesian soil, tropical cyclone Cempaka claimed the lives of 41 people when it travelled near the southern coast of Java in 2017. The cyclone also triggered landslides, flash floods and high waves. 
  Mdm Emilya Nurjani, a geologist at Yogyakarta’s Gadjah Mada University said Seroja would be far more devastating had it hit the more densely populated Java.   “We need to build people’s awareness about cyclones. In Indonesia, awareness towards cyclones and understanding about them are low. We have to step up our mitigation efforts,” she told CNA.   “We need to forge a stronger relationship between BMKG, which monitors cyclones and issues warning, and the regional governments that will perform these mitigation efforts at their respective areas.” HAPPENING MORE FREQUENTLY Compared to its neighbours Australia and the Philippines, Indonesia is rarely affected by cyclones. However, Mdm Karnawati, the BMKG chief, said that is changing due to climate change. “We have detected 10 cyclones between 2008 and today. Before, it can happen every three or four years. But since 2017, cyclones are hitting Indonesia every year. There are years like 2017 and 2019 when we had two cyclones. In 2017, the two happened within the course of one week,” she said. Mdm Karnawati said because much of Indonesia straddles along the equator, the earth’s rotational speed is too great for a cyclone to form. “Zones around the equator are not conducive to cyclones forming,” she said. The BMKG chief added that cyclones typically form at around 10-degree latitude from the equator, where the sea is hot enough to create low-pressure areas and the earth’s rotational speed is not great enough to stop a storm system from developing into a cyclone. Although East Nusa Tenggara is the only Indonesian province with a latitude greater than 10 degrees, Mdm Karnawati said the tropical depression which eventually turned into Cyclone Seroja was formed at around 9-degree latitude.   “This year’s sea surface temperature was exceptionally warm in Sawu sea. Temperatures there reached 30 degree Celsius while the yearly average is around 26 to 26.5 degree Celsius,” she said. “We might be seeing more of such conditions in the future because of climate change. This will affect the frequency of a cyclone occurring as well as the energy and intensity of the cyclones.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/malaysia-climate-change-weather-patterns-fishermen-fish-stocks-1883486,IN FOCUS: Changing weather patterns a bane for Malaysia's fishery sector," SEKINCHAN, Selangor: A crane operator carefully transferred barrels of seafood from a docked fishing boat’s deck to the Hai Seng Huat Fishery’s wharf, while customers walked gingerly on the wet floor of the fishery, making their picks.  The catch was great, particularly for kembung (Indian mackerel), but for Mr Chia Tian Seng, 47, one of four brothers who founded the fishery, the weather has been a cause for concern for fishermen and middlemen over the past decade. “Normally, the wind would be constant in one direction during monsoon season, but now, the wind and the currents are unpredictable,” Mr Chia Tian Seng, who used to run his own vessel for 10 years, said. “The winds are uncertain, such that normal spots where you’d expect to have fish don’t have the same amount of catch or are even empty,” he added.  Fish that would not normally be in season are caught instead. This is another change Mr Chia Tian Seng noticed.  “Previously, you’d almost never get squid during Chinese New Year season here. It’s more in season towards mid-year. “But this year, we’ve been catching a few tonnes here and there since the beginning of the year,” he said.  His elder brother Mr Chia Tian Hee, 51 who is the current president for the Sekinchan Fishermen and Fish Traders Welfare Association and the national Fish Industry General Association, said fishermen struggled to find kembung a few years ago.  ""But last year and this year, fishermen have been pulling in kembung like you wouldn't believe it, until even we are asking what's going on,"" he said.  For local fishermen out on the sea, the effects of climate change become more apparent as man-made carbon emissions continue to increase.  They have noticed that they need to venture farther and thus spend more on fuel to look for fish. Uncertain weather patterns and the difficulties and danger that come with it are also a challenge.  Eventually, this may affect Malaysians who are among the highest consumers of fish per capita, eating an average of 168g of fish per day according to research published in 2016.  Meanwhile, experts worry about the impact of climate change on the marine food chain and local ecosystems, as warmer and more acidic seas threaten the health of marine life.  
  UNCERTAIN WEATHER PATTERNS According to the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center, sea-caught fish is the main contributor to Malaysia's fish production, valued at over RM10 million (US$2.5 million) in 2016.  Data from the Department of Statistics Malaysia showed marine capture, which refers to sea-caught fish, at 1.45 million tonnes in 2018 and 1.46 million tonnes in 2019. However, Mr Tee Kai Seng, 27, who has been sailing for a decade, said he noticed that the fish he caught were getting smaller. “It also costs more to run a boat these days, because you burn more fuel sailing out farther,” he said. “Last time, I could earn over RM2,000 to RM3,000 each trip. Now I only earn less than RM2,000 after deducting my costs,” he added. Mr Tee said fishermen often have to sail even farther these days because the fishes were moving. ""The normal spots I knew 10 years ago are rather bare now.” Additionally, the government has pushed out the no fishing boundary for commercial trawling, in an attempt to control the damage from trawl fishing. While commercial trawling was banned within a 5 nautical mile zone from the shore, it has been now been revised to 8 nautical miles.   But venturing further comes with its own risks in the narrow Straits of Malacca.  As one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, local fishing boats not only have to contend with container vessels. Fishermen also have to be wary of tangling with the Indonesian maritime authorities. Changing weather patterns were also a concern.  Previously, Mr Chia Tian Seng said, fishermen could depend on reliable winds such as the northeast and southwest monsoons, which blow from November to March and May to September, respectively. “But sometimes when you sail out, the weather and the wind are all over the place. You also can’t find the fish because the weather drives them away too,” he said. The same was said by another fisherman-turned-fishery owner, Mr Hong King Mooi, 54 who for a decade also sailed out for days at a time to catch fish.  Mr Hong still has friends and relatives who sail and shared that sometimes, the unpredictable weather meant intense storms and strong winds. ""You get two (to) three days' of wind blowing from the southeast. Then suddenly, the wind changes (to blow) from the north-east, and then they change again,"" he said.  “At that point, some people don't even dare to sail out. The waves and the wind are so strong that the fishermen fear for their safety,"" Mr Hong said.  Luckily, the Malacca Straits, he said, was not as open a body of water as the South China Sea, so the weather effects are not as bad.  Mr Chia Tian Hee, the fishermen association president, said fishermen had begun noticing the changing weather patterns from 2004 onwards. ""We do not say that the weather suddenly changed in 2004, but we gradually noticed that the winds and the waves became more unpredictable with each passing year,"" he told CNA.  ""Our colleagues on the East Coast and facing the South China Sea have other issues, but along the Malacca Straits, fishermen from other states, not only Selangor, have also told us the same problem,"" he added.  Mr Chia Tian Hee also said that the weather had turned so bad that a few small vessels had capsized in the straits last year, but luckily all hands were rescued.  ""People become more cautious now, because this is their livelihood."" ""If they sail out to a number of spots but find no fishes because the weather has driven them away, they still have to pay for the fuel and workers' wages,"" he noted.  
  MARINE PROCESSES As the fishermen explained, the uncertain weather patterns make it difficult to find fish or even to sail out to the sea.  However, wind action is also necessary for a process called upwelling, where the wind blows away the warmer surface water, allowing the colder, but nutrient-rich waters from lower depths to rise to the surface. According to Associate Professor Mohd Fadzil Mohd Akhir, the director for Universiti Malaysia Terengganu's (UMT) Institute of Oceanography and Environment (INOS) at peninsular Malaysia's East Coast, the upwelling process has been affected by climate change. ""Upwelling is important because up to 50 per cent of global fish stocks depend on this process,"" he told CNA.   ""The natural process, such as the southwest monsoon season during June to August on the East Coast, (means) you have the winds moving in a certain direction, allowing the colder waters to come up. ""But when you have changes in the climate, this will affect the wind intensity, making it stronger or weaker. So the upwelling process could be reduced,"" he said. Alternatively, Assoc Prof Mohd Fadzil said, more intense winds would also enhance the process, allowing for more nutrients to be brought up in a more intense - but shorter - process.  ""In the South China Sea, the upwelling process is more seasonal, compared to places such as California in the United States, where the process is all year round, so when this changes, the impact is more keenly felt,"" he added. INOS, the associate professor said, was starting to monitor these processes, such as observing fish sizes and comparing that over the past 10 years, as well as observing where fish schools were congregating at and if they were shifting.  ""Our studies are not to the extent of that done in the Pacific yet, but we expect similar effects,"" he said.  Explaining the ocean acidification process, Dr Aileen Tan, the director for Universiti Sains Malaysia’s Centre for Marine and Coastal Studies (CEMACS), said that the lower the water temperature, the more carbon dioxide (CO2) could be dissolved in it.  “Thus cold, higher-latitude surface waters like the polar regions can retain more CO2 than warmer lower-latitude like the tropics,” she said.  In the tropics like Malaysia, Dr Tan said, rising temperatures of surface waters were slowing down the carbon exchange between deep and surface waters.  “Wind plays an important role, as it mixes surface and deeper waters and carries CO2-saturated waters to the deeper areas of the oceans,"" he said. He added: “With rising surface temperatures, it’s harder for winds to mix these layers, which become increasingly stratified.  ""The warmer the water, the less dense it becomes and harder it is to get it mixed. The surface waters warm to a point where the difference in density between the layers is so large that wind and waves can no longer generate enough energy to incorporate both the water layers."" ""Hence, in locations with warmer waters, the upper layers are more saturated with CO2 and cannot absorb more, and the lower (deeper) layers have less oxygen,"" Dr Tan explained. More CO2 in the waters means increased acidity.  
  DISEASES COULD EVENTUALLY HIT THE FOOD CHAIN For experts and environmentalists, the warmer temperatures and acidification do not bode well for all marine life, including the commercially important fish stocks that make up an important part of most Malaysians’ diets.  Dr Tan said changes in the sea surface temperatures were known to affect Malaysian marine life in a number of ways.  “You have more frequent harmful algal blooms, increased incidences of diseases and parasites,” she said. In a tropical locale like Malaysia, she added, many seaborne pathogens are temperature sensitive. “The growth rates of marine bacteria and fungi are positively correlated with temperature, hence resulting in increased fish mortalities due to disease,” she said.  Dr Henry Chan, the conservation director for World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Malaysia, added that warmer sea waters would lead to corals expelling their algae, causing the coral to turn white, the process which is also known as “coral bleaching”.  “This is important to note, because coral reefs provide a permanent habitat for many important fish species as well as endangered species. “Some of the important species, which are commercial ones, in turn provide food and livelihood security for coastal communities,” Dr Chan explained.  Dr Chan pointed out that acidification made it more difficult for marine organisms, including commercially important ones like shrimp and shellfish to form their protective shells. ""If the ocean water becomes too acidic, it can start dissolving their shells, and in turn, alter the food web too, where these animals are important food sources for commercial fish species,"" he said.  Dr Tan also told CNA that changes in temperature and oxygen could either reduce or enhance plankton productivity. These microscopic algae (phytoplankton) or animals (zooplankton) form the basis for various food chains in the marine system.  “For example, consistently large decreases in catch potential, may primarily be as a result of a decrease in plankton productivity, and simultaneous loss of habitat can amplify this,” Dr Tan said. She also referred to other scientific literature where in some cases, some species were projected to become locally extinct in tropical areas, and this local extinction rate increased with atmospheric CO2 concentrations.  URGENT NEED TO CUT EMISSIONS For Dr Tan, a consequence of warmer oceans would mean its ability to remove CO2 from the atmosphere would decrease, leading to a downward spiral where CO2 would accumulate in the atmosphere with the ocean unable to function as a carbon sink.  “One way that humans can ward off this feedback loop is by accelerating the global shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy,” she said.  Meanwhile, Dr Chan said while the 2016 Paris Agreement called for action to limit the global average temperature increase to up till 1.5 degrees Celsius, global average temperatures recorded last year showed that this had already increased by 1.16 degrees Celsius, and that the effects of climate change that were happening would still go on even if all man-made carbon emissions were removed. He pointed out that even natural ecosystems which helped mitigate climate change, such as tropical and mangrove forests, as well as the seagrass and coral beds that help remove carbon from the atmosphere, were also simultaneously being threatened by climate change.  “We don’t have a choice but to enhance emission removals from economic activities and to protect and conserve these important areas to address climate change,” Dr Chan said.   Back in September 2019, then-deputy Agriculture and Agro-Based Industries Minister, Sim Tze Tzin stated that climate change was among the factors impacting Malaysia’s fisheries industry.  He called for more marine parks along coastal areas. He also said that fishermen had to adapt and move further into deep-sea fishing. Mr Sim had pointed to parliamentary approval given for Penang and Langkawi fishermen to carry out high seas tuna fishing. This was in conjunction with the Indian Ocean Tuna commission giving its approval as well. Generally, Mr Chia Tian Seng, the fishery owner in Sekinchan, has a pessimistic outlook on fish stocks.  He fears that long before the full effects of climate change could hit the fishing community, human demand for fish would strip the seas bare first. ""Here, there are a lot of smaller purse-seine (a type of fishing net method) vessels, and most only fish from eight nautical miles onwards.""But as you head out further you have even larger vessels, and they use even more effective methods to catch as many fishes as possible,"" he said. CNA has approached the Malaysian Agriculture and Food Industries Ministry for comments on the impact of climate change on Malaysian waters, assistance plans for fishery communities and proposals to ensure fish supply for domestic food security."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/climate-change/indias-deepening-water-crisis-heart-farm-protests-2015451,India's deepening water crisis at the heart of farm protests,"RANSIH KALAN. India (AP) — Every year, Swarn Singh sows rice in his fields, knowing that the thirsty crop is draining northern India's Punjab of its groundwater. But Singh says he has no choice, adding, “We'd rather plant crops that need less water.""  The 32-year-old farmer and school teacher lives in Ransih Kalan village in the state's Moga district, where green fields surrounding its wide roads and large houses belie the reality that the region is among India's most parched and its once-prosperous agricultural system is now broken. India’s water crisis looms over an agrarian crisis that has been brewing for decades. At its heart is a conundrum: the government has been subsidizing the cultivation of rice in northern India, but such water-intensive crops have dramatically lowered the groundwater table. Every third house in Ransih Kalan — a community of nearly 3,000, less than 100 kilometers (62 miles) from India’s border with Pakistan — bears flags supporting thousands of farmers hunkered down outside New Delhi since November to protest three laws Prime Minister Narendra Modi says will modernize agriculture.  Singh says his village's farmers agree changes are needed but fear these laws will only make matters worse, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations. The laws don't address the region's water crisis. But Singh said that if guaranteed prices for all crops were to become a legal right, farmers would shift away from thirsty crops. Home to a fifth of the world’s population, India has only 4per cent of the world’s water. But the country is the largest extractor of groundwater in the world, with 90per cent used for agriculture.  Nowhere is the water shortage more pronounced than in Punjab, where India's government encouraged cultivation of wheat and rice in the 1960s and has since been buying the staples at fixed prices to shore up national reserves. Wheat was a traditional crop, along with mung beans or peanuts, said Singh's father, Bhupinder Singh, 62. But he and experts say a pound of rice needs up to 500 gallons (2,273 liters) of water — and irrigation canals couldn't supply enough as more farmers switched to the grain. Farmers turned to well water. When the government started providing free electricity to run well pumps in 1997, Punjab rice raising rocketed — from 500 square kilometers (193 square miles) in 1975 to 31,000 square kilometers (11,969 square miles). But groundwater levels plummeted as underground pumps proliferated, with over 1.2 million by 2012. And a 2017 federal report warned that the state of 27 million people would exhaust its groundwater by 2039. “It’s becoming a desert,” said Kirpal Singh Aulakh, an agricultural scientist and former vice chancellor of Punjab Agricultural University.  The looming calamity isn’t news to the Singhs. They had to spend US$6,600 to install a pump for a nearly 200-foot (60-meter) borehole. And successive years of planting the same crops leached their village's soil of nutrients, forcing them to rely on expensive fertilizers.  Rising costs have forced the family into debt, and the certainty of selling to their crops to the government is their only way of staying afloat. “All of Punjab is trapped,” the son said. Protesting farmers fear the new laws signal that the government wants to reduce its role in agriculture and that guaranteed prices for their crops will end. The government does fix prices for crops other than wheat and rice, including corn. But Aulakh said these products aren’t purchased for federal reserves and traders in the private market pay much lower prices for them, resulting in farmers feeling “cheated.”  Aulakh, who has sat on government committees that discussed crop diversification in Punjab, said farmers would switch to more suitable crops if they knew they’d be compensated by the government. “We can’t blame the farmers,” he said. India's agricultural and water ministries did not respond to emailed requests for comment. More than 86per cent of India’s farmers work on less than than 2 hectares (4.9 acres). So the falling groundwater table means these small farmers spend increasingly more money to pump water for their crops and this is widening inequity, said Balsher Singh Sidhu, a University of British Columbia doctoral student studying climate change impacts on agriculture. Sidhu compared the available groundwater to a bank account where withdrawals far exceed deposits. “Today everyone has access to water, but we can't say the same about tomorrow,” he said. Climate change has made the monsoon rains - a lifeline for over half of India’s cultivated area - unpredictable and left farmers even more reliant on groundwater. Rice requires standing water in fields. But hotter summers are increasing the amount lost due to evaporation.  Rice farmer Mahinder Singh, 73, said he tried planting corn once but private buyers paid him only a fraction of the prices set by the government. “We will die of hunger,” if the water runs out, he added. India’s food reserves are overflowing, leading to waste, but malnutrition is intensifying and experts fear future water shortages could make it worse. “The richer people can afford to (buy) fruits and vegetables,"" said Upmanu Lall, director of the Columbia Water Center at Columbia University. “Poor people do not, other than what they can scavenge.”  Residents of Ransih Kalan have begun taking steps to conserve water. Villagers have installed a sewage treatment plant, and the treated water is used for irrigation. They’ve also built plants to harvest rainwater and divert it into a man-made lake. In the middle is a 10-foot tall (3 meters) statue of a dinosaur. It’s a reminder, says Preet Inderpal Singh, the 30-year-old village headman, “That if people don’t save every drop of water, people would become extinct, like dinosaurs.”  ___ Associated Press video journalist Rishi Lekhi contributed to this report. ___ Follow Aniruddha Ghosal on Twitter: @aniruddhg1 ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/climate-change-carbon-emissions-energy-biden-summit-montreal-cfc-1883496,Commentary: Moving to net-zero may not hurt as much as we think,"LONDON: In 1987, the world signed the Montreal protocol, agreeing to phase out the chlorofluorocarbons and related chemicals depleting the ozone layer. At the time, CFCs were essential components in everyday necessities, such as refrigerants in fridges and propellants of aerosols. But the chemicals are now largely a thing of the past, and the ozone layer is on the mend. The carbon transition is an incomparably larger challenge. Since the industrial revolution, our societies have been shaped by fossil energy. Our economic geography and even social relations have developed around the extraction, processing and combustion of hydrocarbons. Emitting CO2 can seem as inevitable a consequence of economic and social life as breathing. (Listen to James Trevelyan, engineer and founder of a personal air-conditioner company talk about how to keep the planet cool without harming it.)   The politics of climate change, too, are harder than the Montreal process, which produced results in record time from the scientific discovery of ozone depletion and with virtually unanimous international support. Even so, global leaders’ resolve to shift the world to net-zero carbon is strengthening. US president Joe Biden’s climate summit last week brought forth more ambitious national targets, including from the US itself. These targets need to be tighter still, and are only as good as the laws, regulations and tax reforms governments put in place to force economies off their carbon habit. But the direction of travel is unmistakable. 
  Governments increasingly take the view that economies which fail to take climate action condemn themselves to being technological and business laggards once the transition takes hold. “We are convinced that there is an extraordinary benefit that awaits us,” as US climate envoy John Kerry told the Financial Times. The message is to prepare for a fundamental transformation of our societies and our lifestyles. 
  LESSONS FROM MONTREAL This is where we can learn from Montreal. Its most striking success is something we never think about: We still have fridges, air conditioners and spray cans. There is no consumer convenience we had to give up to save the ozone layer. Once CFCs were banned, alternatives were found quickly. Perhaps the cost increased temporarily, but today’s products are if anything superior to those of the 1980s. The honest answer to what we had to sacrifice is: Nothing. Could the same be true for the carbon transition? We know how to generate electricity from carbon-free sources, so everything electrically powered is compatible with a net-zero economy. The technology exists for zero-emissions road transport. The right financial incentives can trigger very quick take-up, as shown by Norway where the majority of new cars sold are emissions-free. While more progress is needed for hydrogen-powered goods freight, it is clear that a carbon-neutral world is compatible with car habits practically indistinguishable from today (but with cleaner air in cities). In time, shipping, too, can be powered by carbon-free energy. 
  What about flying? Short-haul flights can be replaced by train travel or eventually zero-emissions planes. Such solutions currently seem impossible for long haul. That need not mean an end to intercontinental travel – just an end to frequent, mass intercontinental flights. It may cost a lot more to travel across the globe, but fewer such trips will be taken and when they are, travellers will stay away for longer. That is not a radically different world. It is what long-distance travel was like until the 1980s. 
  In construction, cement and steel are highly carbon-intensive. But they are not the only possible building materials. Timber buildings with over 20 storeys have already been erected. Allow for the development of green steel production, and there is little reason to think that we cannot build and live emissions-free in ways that feel quite similar to today.  Finally, the existence of negative net emissions technologies means some activities can be maintained in a net-zero world, even if it proves impossible to make them entirely carbon neutral. GARGANTUAN CHALLENGE AHEAD The point is not to underplay the challenge ahead of us, which is gargantuan. The carbon transition requires bold steps in politics and policy, and for people and businesses to change their behaviour from fossil-powered to carbon-neutral options. The cost of doing so must be reduced for the poorest, ideally by redistributing carbon taxes as “carbon dividends”. But if – hopefully when – we do this, the result need not feel like a revolution. It is failure that could upend catastrophically the normality most people aspire to. Unlike in a war, victory in the climate fight would amount to our day-to-day-living going on much as it did before. That is a message it would help to hear more often."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/china-says-coal-will-play-less-dominant-energy-role-1883491,China says coal will play less-dominant energy role,"China, the world's biggest coal user, said Tuesday (Apr 27) the fossil fuel will play a less dominant role in its energy mix and that, despite plans to build new coal-fired power plants, the country will not use it on a wide scale. The comments by Li Gao, the director general of the Department of Climate Change in China's Environment Ministry, follow pledges at last week's climate summit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to work with the United States in cutting emissions. “In the past, it (coal) was the main source of power. In the future it will play the role of providing flexibility for the power grid,” Li said at a press conference. “And now we still need a certain amount of coal ... but we will not develop coal on a wide-scale basis, that's very clear and that's strictly regulated,"" he added. 
  Li acknowledged that China was still building new coal power plants, but he emphasised that they were unlike traditional coal plants and would not emit as much as plants did previously. Climate experts have long advocated for a ban on new coal power plants, which would be a significant step. China obtains roughly 60 per cent of its power from coal, and is the world’s biggest source of greenhouse gases. During the Trump administration, the US used China’s emissions as an excuse not to act, and in the past China pointed to US historical emissions as a reason to resist action. Beijing has previously set a target for non-fossil fuel energy to account for 20 per cent of the country's total energy consumption by 2025, which will require further investment in solar and wind energy. 
  Germany and China agreed Monday to step up their cooperation in combating climate change, with the two discussing coal use and how to reduce it. Xi announced last year that China would be carbon-neutral by 2060 and aims to reach a peak in its emissions by 2030."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sfa-23-million-sustainable-urban-food-production-research-grant-245596,SFA awards S$23 million in funding for R&D in sustainable urban food production,"SINGAPORE: The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) said on Monday (Apr 26) it has awarded more than S$23 million to fund 12 research and development projects in sustainable urban food production. The grant is in support of Singapore's ""30 by 30"" goal for food security, in which the country aims to produce 30 per cent of its nutritional needs locally by 2030. “With challenges that impact global food security such as climate change, rising population and decreasing land for agricultural use, R&D holds the key to the future of food,"" said SFA's CEO Lim Kok Thai. The awarded projects span the key research areas of genetics, disease and health management, optimisation of systems and nutrition, said SFA in a media release. Eight of the projects are in aquaculture. They include projects to develop genetic resources and optimise feeds for red snapper, vaccine development for Asian seabass and selective breeding of barramundi. The remaining projects focus on urban agriculture, including improvements in indoor farming and hydroponics. SFA said these projects are aligned with the grant objectives to increase productivity of local food producers, taking into consideration factors such as cost effectiveness, resource use efficiency, sustainability and climate resilience. ""I have every confidence that the outcomes of their research will bring us closer towards a more resilient, sustainable and vibrant agri-tech sector in Singapore,"" said Mr Lim."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/hydrogen-solutions-climate-change-biden-summit-fossil-fuels-1883471,Commentary: Could hydrogen be our solution to climate change?,"WALTHAM, Massachusetts: Tehran, 1943: Joseph Stalin, Franklin D Roosevelt and Winston Churchill – hosted by the young Shah Reza Pahlavi – agree on plans for the two-front attack on Hitler while sketching out the east-west division of Europe.  Holding the meeting in Iran, with separate consultations with the shah, was no mistake. Gulf oil was a critical resource to the Allied war effort. Oil has flowed under the surface of political conflicts ever since. Fast forward to today, and political antagonists and energy players are again forging a messy path forward, this time focused on long-term energy transitions as disparate countries try to slow and eventually stop climate change. The 2015 Paris Agreement was a groundbreaking diplomatic effort – 196 countries committed to prevent average temperatures from rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius, with an aim of less than 1.5 degrees Celcius.  
  To meet that goal, scientists argue that fossil fuel use will have to reach net zero emissions by mid-century. The genius of the Paris climate accord was getting all the major parties to agree – particularly major greenhouse gas emitters including Russia, China, India, Brazil and members of OPEC, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Now, the challenge is implementing the multiplicity of solutions needed to bend the global warming curve.  The Paris Agreement is not a treaty – countries set their own targets and determine their own strategies for meeting them. Each signatory has its own politics, economic structure, energy resources and climate exposure. 
  The commitments from countries are still falling short as President Joe Biden hosted a virtual climate summit with international leaders on Earth Day, Apr 22, and carried out the hard diplomatic work with Russia, China and other countries to develop implementable solutions. As an energy economist, I am familiar with countries’ evolving responses to climate change and companies’ shifting investments and different visions of the future. One technology attracting attention from groups on all sides is hydrogen. DIFFERENT VISIONS OF ENERGY’S FUTURE As the world’s population and economies grow, energy demand is expected to increase by as much as 50 per cent over the next 30 years, so making the right long-term investments is crucial. Energy companies and policymakers have widely different visions of that future. Their long-term scenarios show that most expect fossil fuel demand to remain steady for decades and possibly decline. However, many are also increasing their investments in cleaner technologies. The International Energy Agency – which countries often look to for future scenarios, but which has a history of underestimating demand and clean energy – forecasts that renewable energy will meet about one-third of the global energy demand by 2040 in its most optimistic scenario.  That would be in a world with higher carbon taxes and more wind power, solar power, electric vehicles, carbon capture and storage. Greener technologies may come close to keeping warming under  degrees Celcius, but not quite. FOSSIL FUEL REMAINS Exxon, on the other hand, forecasts a path dependent on a fossil fuel-based economy, with slower transitions to electric vehicles, steady demand for oil and gas, and a warmer world.  Exxon is also investing in carbon capture and storage and hydrogen, but it believes oil and gas will provide half the global energy supply in 2040 and renewable energy will be less than one-fifth. OPEC, whose members are among the most exposed to climate change and dependent upon oil and gas, also sees oil and gas dominating in the future.  Nonetheless, several Gulf nations are also investing heavily in alternative technologies – including nuclear, solar, wind and hydrogen – and trying to transition away from oil. BP proposes a more focused shift toward cleaner energy. Its “rapid scenario” forecasts flat energy demand and a more dramatic swing to renewables combined with a growing hydrogen economy.  The company expects its own renewable energy to go from 2.5 gigawatts (GW) in 2019 to 50 GW by 2030, and its oil production to fall by 40 per cent. 
  Others are also exploring hydrogen’s potential. Much as with utilities’ shift from coal to natural gas, hydrogen may ease the transition to cleaner energy with enough investment. Since this fuel is getting so much industry attention, let’s look more closely at its potential. HYDROGEN AS A CLIMATE SOLUTION Hydrogen has the potential to fuel cars, buses and airplanes, heat buildings and serve as a base energy source to balance wind and solar power in our grids.  Germany sees it as a potential substitute for hard-coal coke in making steel. It also offers energy companies a future market using processes they know. It can be liquefied, stored, and transported through existing pipelines and LNG ships, with some modifications. So far, however, hydrogen is not widely used as a clean-energy solution.  First, it requires a upfront investment – including carbon capture capacity, pipeline modifications, industrial boilers for heat rather than gas, and fuel cells for transportation – plus policies that support the transition. Second, for hydrogen to be “green,” the electricity grid has to have zero emissions. 
  Most of today’s hydrogen is made from natural gas and is known as “grey hydrogen.”  It is produced using high-temperature steam to split hydrogen from carbon atoms into methane. Unless the separated carbon dioxide is stored or used, grey hydrogen results in the same amount of climate-warming CO2 as natural gas. “Blue hydrogen” uses the same process but captures the carbon dioxide and stores it so only around 10 per cent of the CO2 is released into the atmosphere.  “Green hydrogen” is produced using renewable electricity and electrolysis, but it is twice as expensive as blue and dependent on the cost of electricity and available water. NATURAL GAS IN THE MIX Many electric utilities and energy companies, including Shell, BP and Saudi Aramco, are actively exploring a transition to a hydrogen-mixed economy, with a focus on blue hydrogen as an interim step.  Europe, with its dependence on imported natural gas and higher electricity costs, is setting ambitious net-zero energy targets that will incorporate a mix of blue and green hydrogen coupled with wind, solar, nuclear and an integrated energy grid. China, the world’s largest energy user and greenhouse gas emitter, is instead investing heavily in natural gas – which has about half the carbon dioxide emissions of coal – along with carbon capture and storage and a growing mix of solar and wind power.  Russia, the second-largest natural gas producer after the US, is expanding its gas production and exports to Asia. Some of that gas may end up as blue hydrogen. Ramping up blue and green hydrogen as clean-energy solutions will require substantial investments and long-term modifications to energy infrastructure.  
  In my view, it is not the magic bullet, but it may be an important step. Of course, technology investments cannot assume away the messy politics of the world. People and leaders around the globe still have differing views on the urgency of the climate crisis and need for greener energy investments.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/uk-green-spying-climate-change-commitments-mi6-1883481,UK intelligence chief says spying on climate change commitments under way,"LONDON: The head of Britain's MI6 foreign intelligence service said on Sunday (Apr 25) it had started monitoring large industrial countries for the first time to make sure they uphold climate change commitments. In the first broadcast interview ever given by any serving MI6 chief, Richard Moore said the issue was ""the foremost international foreign policy agenda item for this country and for the planet"". ""Of course we have a role in that space,"" he told Times Radio, which branded the evolving realm of global espionage ""green spying"". ""Where people sign up to commitments on climate change, it is perhaps our job to make sure that actually what they are really doing reflects what they have signed up to,"" Moore added. ""As somebody used to say – 'trust, but verify'. On climate change, where you need everyone to come on board and to play fair, then occasionally just check to make sure they are."" 
  In the wide-ranging interview aired on Sunday, the MI6 head also said Russian President Vladimir Putin had been warned recently Moscow would ""pay a huge price"" if his troops invaded Ukraine. Russia began withdrawing its armed forces on Friday after weeks of mobilisations and manoeuvres near its Ukrainian border, which prompted heightened tensions with the West. ""The Russians are in absolutely no doubt of where the UK stands on this issue,"" Moore added. ""And they are in absolutely no doubt of where the Biden administration stands on this issue, because channels are open."" ""LIFE IMITATES ART"" Moore, a former ambassador to Turkey and fluent Turkish speaker, was named head of MI6 – home of the world's most famous fictional spook, 007 James Bond – in July last year. In the Hollywood movies the holder of his post, most famously played by Judi Dench from 1995 to 2015, is called ""M"". But in reality the role is known within the agency as ""C"". In his interview, Moore revealed MI6 is for the first time publicly recruiting an external expert to run the gadgets and technical branch – a role code-named ""Q"" in the Bond films. ""We are in an increasingly contested, difficult world where technology is making what we do for a living more of a challenge,"" he said. 
  ""We have to use and harness technology and the only way we can do that, I think, is with good leadership and somebody who can help us partner with the private sector."" In an eye-catching move, he said the technical department post had adopted the job title ""director-general Q"" directly from the Bond franchise. ""In this one, life imitates art,"" Moore explained. ""We were reshaping our technical side and we couldn't think of the right name for it. In the end we thought well, come on, let's go for it, and so we decided to call it 'Q'. ""But 'C' is still 'C' – we never went to 'M',"" he swiftly added of his own designation."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/joe-biden-100-days-achievements-accomplishments-foreign-policy-1883466,Commentary: Joe Biden is reshaping America and the world in his image,"SINGAPORE: As US President Joe Biden approaches his 100-day mark in office, he and his team seem to be off on a good start to their management of US foreign policy. They are hewing to a disciplined foreign policy approach that prioritises Asia relative to other regions, re-engages on selective priorities such as climate change, ties elements of US domestic renewal to international engagement and defers on some divisive issues. While the disciplined approach bodes well, it remains to be seen whether it will last through his tenure as president. 
  A DISCIPLINED US FOREIGN POLICY Attempted discipline is not new to US foreign policy. George W Bush pledged a humble foreign policy but diverted US attention to the Middle East after the September 11, 2001 attacks with twin wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Barack Obama was criticised for taking discipline too far: Refusing to be tougher on Beijing despite its rising assertiveness and refraining from intervening in Syria lest it drag Washington into conflict and undermine domestic priorities like healthcare. A disciplined foreign policy is not something one expects to associate with Mr Biden, given the man’s off-the-cuff style and emotive brand of politics. 
  Yet he and his team seemed to understand that given the moment they found themselves in – with the fallout from some of Donald Trump’s America First policies and a once-in-a-century pandemic – discipline is an important trait to embrace facing a range of challenges not seen since World War II. This tendency arguably took shape even before he took office. His campaign platform signalled a domestic-focused foreign policy under the banner of a “foreign policy for the middle class”. At his inauguration, Mr Biden enumerated the four areas where the domestic focus that undergirds America’s approach would lie: The pandemic, economic crisis, climate change and racial injustice.   There was no guarantee this discipline during the campaign would live on once Mr Biden began governing, even though structural factors, such as a razor-thin Congressional majority, have acted as guardrails to some degree. But as his administration reaches its 100-day mark, it is clear that a deliberate effort is being made to reinforce a message of foreign policy discipline. REFOCUSING ON ASIA First, Mr Biden has prioritised Asia relative to other regions. Realising the need to clearly signal an Asia-first foreign policy early on, he quickly held the first-ever Quad summit in March and slotted in Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga as his first White House guest in April. These moves helped counter a narrative that the lack of Asia expertise among the administration’s top personnel may limit Mr Biden’s engagement with the region. Within that approach, the administration has also signaled a prioritisation of allies and partners rather than let itself be consumed by how it might differ from Mr Trump’s China approach. 
  The administration’s holding of the Alaska meeting in March right after engagements with treaty allies in Japan and South Korea was a case in point and a part of what Mr Biden’s White House coordinator for Indo-Pacific Kurt Campbell had previously called crafting a “stable competition” approach towards Beijing from a position of strength.   Meanwhile, more peripheral agenda items in the president’s inbox are being de-emphasised alongside this Asia-first foreign policy. For instance, when Mr Biden announced the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan on Apr 14, he specifically noted that US resources would be best spent on other priorities including competing with China and shaping norms on cybersecurity and emerging technologies – “the battles for the next 20 years, not the last 20”. 
  AMERICA IS BACK – IN GLOBAL AFFAIRS, DEMOCRACY AND CLIMATE CHANGE Second, Mr Biden and his team have quickly re-engaged with the world on selective foreign policy priorities. The goal, as administration officials have repeated over past few months, is to signal that “America is back,” and, more specifically, that diplomacy is at the centre of foreign policy relative to the Trump years in a handful of areas clearly be seen as producing value for the American people. Top of mind has been climate change, as evidenced by Mr Biden’s reentry into the historic 2015 Paris climate accord during his first few hours in office and the early announcement of the Leaders’ Climate Summit on Jan 27. That has been spearheaded by the tireless diplomacy of John Kerry, who holds a new Cabinet-level position of special presidential envoy for climate, and Mr Biden’s domestic climate czar Gina McCarthy who ensures the climate priority is also intimately tied to US domestic.     
  Another case in point is democracy and human rights. It is no coincidence Mr Biden’s introduction to his Interim National Security Strategic Guidance, issued on Mar 3, began with reinforcing the importance of democracy both at home and abroad at a time when autocracy appears to be on the rise. Several commitments, including the holding of a Democracy Summit, have yet to be realised, and the balance between ideals and interests that each administration needs to strike will take a while yet to play out. But the administration’s restoration of consistency and calibration on issues ranging from the crisis in Myanmar to Russia’s treatment of its opposition offers early promise about discipline on this front. 
  REWRITING THE RULES OF GLOBAL TAXATION AND TRADE Third, the administration has tied elements of US domestic renewal to international engagement in an attempt to build support for its Foreign Policy for a Middle Class. As Mr Biden noted in his foreign policy remarks at the State Department in February: “There’s no longer a bright line between foreign and domestic policy. Every action we take in our conduct abroad, we must take with American working families in mind.” A case in point is US tax policy. Here, the Biden administration is aspiring to secure support for a global minimum corporate tax rate abroad to maintain US competitiveness. It looks to raise the US minimum tax rate at home to pay for its domestic agenda, which includes the US$1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill signed on Mar 11 and a US$2 trillion infrastructure plan being mulled. Another is supply chains. Mr Biden’s Feb 24 executive order sets out a 100-day review which includes partnering with key US allies to build more resilient supply networks less vulnerable to disruptions by competitors in areas including semiconductors, electric-vehicle batteries, rare earths and pharmaceutical products. Supply chains have factored heavily into the Biden administration’s discussions with allies and partners, including the Quad Summit with Australia, India and Japan.     
  REINING IN DIVISION Fourth, Mr Biden and his team have deferred on some divisive issues in the name of preserving their focus on key priorities at the outset. Most notably, he has punted on entirely and quickly reversing Trump-era decisions that could quickly eat up his political capital in recognition of the domestic political environment. For instance, on trade, he has signaled some continuity with Trump’s America First policies, as evidenced by some of his early moves including signing an executive order strengthening US Buy American policies. His US Trade Representative, Katherine Tai, has also treaded carefully, articulating a domestic-focused “worker-centred trade policy”. A similar trend can be observed with respect to immigration. While Mr Biden had initially pledged to raise refugee admissions back up from Trump’s historically low cap early on, he backtracked on his decision this month and delayed an increase, in part due to rising criticism on the surge of migrant children at the border with Mexico which could distract from his domestic priorities. STILL EARLY DAYS To be sure, it is still early days. It remains to be seen if the Biden administration will be able to maintain its foreign policy discipline. Some of the approaches to key foreign policy issues it faces, including Iran, North Korea and terrorism, have yet to be laid out.  Furthermore, a key litmus test of discipline is whether Mr Biden and his team can keep focused on their priorities even when confronted by a new foreign policy crisis. Yet given the vast array of challenges the administration faced at the outset and Biden’s past difficulty in keeping on message, the early foreign policy discipline is nonetheless noteworthy. As we see other engagements shape up during the course of the year – from Mr Biden’s address to the joint session of Congress on Apr 28 to potential overseas visits as the world gradually reopens – this will be an important test to watch.     Dr Prashanth Parameswaran is Director of Research at BowerGroupAsia, a strategic advisory firm focused on the Asia-Pacific."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/climatechange/thailand-water-war-eastern-economic-corridor-1883451,Locals fear water conflict as new industrial boom arrives along Thailand’s eastern seaboard,"BANGKOK: As Thailand embarks on an ambitious industrialisation drive along its eastern seaboard, local communities and conservationists fear a brewing war over water. The Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) Development Plan is a long-term public project aiming to accelerate development in eastern Thailand, namely three provinces - Rayong, Chonburi and Chachoengsao.  It is attracting global investors in priority sectors to power a national strategy - Thailand 4.0. The types of industries being targeted include next-generation automotive, biotechnologies, AI, robotics, automation and aerospace from countries like Japan, Singapore and China. “Thailand has identified key projects and key elements that will take Thailand forward and get Thailand out of the middle income trap. To do that, Thailand knows that what we need is technology,” said Luxmon Attapich, the deputy secretary-general of investment and international affairs at EEC. At the same time, the development plan is raising community worries and stirring conflict. Central to those concerns is the availability of water.  The landscape in the EEC area is shifting fast already. From farms to factories, what has long been agricultural land is transitioning to accommodate new industry. Huge swathes of land - 48,000 ha in total - have been re-zoned to allow such changes to occur.  Local communities and small-scale farmers fear the changes they are viewing with their own eyes. New, ever-widening roads plunging through the heart of their provinces, factories replacing fields and the movement of masses of water into reservoirs that are not for them. The realities of climate change are hanging over this region; devastating droughts in recent years took a heavy toll on eastern Thailand’s water resources and plunged local farmers into desperation. Flooding is a regular threat too and saltwater intrusion into rivers and along the coastline is worsening.  As a result, the allocation of precious water resources, which must be shared among various stakeholders including new and existing industry, large and small agriculture, and cities and villages has become a flashpoint. The EEC blueprint includes plans for multiple new industrial cities and parks, the expansion of an international airport and ports, new railway infrastructure, urban expansion and a medical hub. All of them will need access to a finite amount of water.  “Even before the EEC, there was a troublesome lack of water in the eastern seaboard area,” said Somnuck Jongmeewasin, a conservationist and research director at EEC Watch, a group studying the impacts of the project. “In my local community, there’s a lack of water. If we want water, we have to buy and it’s very expensive,” he said. “The industrial sector can get the water because they have money. This is the inequality. How to live together peacefully? There is no way. The conflict is still there.” As well as ongoing legal action against the project, Somnuck predicts that locals will start to escalate their opposition to the EEC through protest or by blocking access to key areas of development or infrastructure, if the government does not take measures to ensure fairness and sustainability.  “It’s feasible. (But) if the government does not do as per my suggestions, I think we could not survive and we will see people blocking water, people blocking land, blocking the seashore and you cannot develop anything,” he said.  “It will be the next civil war for the EEC area.” 
  GIVING UP ON THE LAND In parts of Chachoengsao, shrimp farms dot the land close to the Bang Pakong river. Each needs a steady supply of fresh water for the ponds where the shrimps grow and are harvested. They rely on canals that draw water from the main river.  It is a water-intensive industry, and the operations of local farmers are now at risk. Due to a lack of water resources, which are increasingly salty, many have switched to an alternative crop, or are on the brink of walking away from their farms. One of Chamlong Horracharttrakul’s two ponds is now bone dry, its mud surface cracking in the sun. “All the canals are dried up. The weather is very hot as well,” he said.  “In the dry season, I can only do one pond at a time now because I need another pond to keep water. It’s been like this over the past four or five years. “Frankly speaking, if I didn’t own these ponds, I would have given up already.” Nearby, Boonserm Charoenrattana-opas has been maintaining his shrimp operation for 25 years. His output is already low due to salinity and rising water temperatures, which cause disease in his produce, and he worries about the impacts of more industry setting up around him, especially upriver. “If wastewater is released into the river, negative impacts will definitely happen. The water system cannot be used and this will be a problem. The chance of keeping shrimps sustainably will be gone,” he said. “I am just a small villager. I cannot compete against a big investment group. This is the problem.” 
  Further south in Chonburi, Threelathagorn Phanusamporn, a local pig farmer and community activist, is trying to empower locals on water management issues.  “The main issue in this area is water. We are short of water for consumption and water for agriculture. Villagers cannot quite produce enough to reach their target. There used to be paddy rice crops but they don’t have them now,” she said. A small, central reservoir available to residents is close to empty and benefits from a large nearby dam do not reach them. Threelathagorn says there is a mistrust of authorities and a feeling that “poor and struggling villagers” are being left behind. It is a feeling reflected in Rayong province, where fisherman and fruit grower Manu Darat says local communities like his have never been consulted about the EEC's development, nor how water allocation might change.""We just saw them putting water pipes here and there,"" he said. ""Let’s face it, the water demand from the industrial sector increases more and more. I don’t know if they're taking water from us for sure, but no one has told us anything."" MOVING WATER AROUND THE COUNTRY It is evident that the management of massive water storage areas is crucial both to the EEC’s success, and the lives of millions on the eastern seaboard. “The problem is not really big but the problem is really complicated,” says Somkiat Prajamwong, the secretary-general of the Office of National Water Resources. His department is primarily tasked with moving, adjusting and managing Thailand’s water resources. When it comes to quenching the EEC’s thirst, the task is akin to a giant jigsaw puzzle.  Weather patterns are unpredictable in Thailand. This means that rain does not always fall in the right places at the right time. Catchment areas that the country has long relied on cannot be trusted under worsening climate change conditions. In the next decade, water diversions, the construction of new reservoirs and inter-provincial pipelines are set to be key strategies to pump an extra 706 million cubic metres of water into the EEC zone. Most of the water will be drawn from Thailand’s far east, close to the Cambodian border where demand is less and existing reservoirs are healthy. “On the topography map, we cannot move the reservoirs but we can change the channels to take more water or harvest more water into a reservoir. We know we have uncertainty from climate change - we cannot forecast more than a year - so storage is really important,” Somkiat said. In total, some 38 projects with a budget of about US$1.6 billion are earmarked for water supply projects for the ECC, while additional projects will address water loss, agricultural usage plans and groundwater. About 30 per cent of water in the area will be reserved for emergency use. A desalination plant involving private sector investors is also under consideration. Somkiat says a top priority is ensuring that water allocations for agricultural use are not brushed aside in light of rising demand from industry. He hopes better communication and transparency will help overcome local concerns. “We have a fixed amount of water for the agricultural sector and for the industrial sector with some conditions that if the water is below a certain level, we don’t want to transfer to other sectors except agriculture,” he said. “We try to set up the plans in advance so the people know how many crops they can grow, how much water they can use and how much they will suffer in the future. “If we have some problems with water demand or water availability, we may think about how we’re going to use other measures to reduce demand. We know demand never stops, it only increases.” He says many farmers have in recent years shifted to water-intense activities, especially growing durians instead of rice, due to their popularity and high price in export markets. Those farmers will need to make provisions to be more water smart and have their own storage systems.  He also believes that paying for water will become an inevitability for all parties. But those mechanisms are largely still being designed.  Sucharit Koonthanakunwong, an associate professor advising the government on the ECC, in an official capacity as part of the Collaborative Office on Strategic Water Management, says helping farmers install their own water reserve ponds through government subsidies is part of the EEC wider plan. “The recent drought is not a crisis, but the new normal for the future,” he said. “People have some time now to sit down and see what they should prepare for. They have experience of the drought already. They know now what a crisis is.”  
  ""WE DO NOT WANT TO REPEAT ANY MISTAKES"" In this part of Thailand, there remains the lingering imprint of past industrial projects that have polluted water sources and poisoned the air and soil. But the ECC has promised to ensure that this undertaking will be different.  “We do not want to repeat any mistakes that happened in the past. We are very clear that we would like to take care of the environment, the health and wellbeing of the people in the EEC area,” said Luxmon, the deputy secretary-general. Crucial to the sustainability of the EEC will be regulations around the type of companies that can set up within it, and the rules they will need to follow to match its green ambitions. While the next few years will see a further build-up of essential infrastructure to support new industries, space has been made available for investors to move their operations into the EEC now.  “We need to understand that back then, 30 years ago, those were heavy industries and they seemed to have impacts. We do not want that so that was built into our initiative from the very beginning,” she said. She admits that climate change was not an integral part of the initial planning of the EEC, but starting from this year, boosting the scheme’s green credentials has been a focus. 
  However, Somnuck believes that official predictions of future water demand in the ECC are “wrong”, grossly underestimating how much of the resource will be needed.  In light of that, he has called for a clear 6R scheme to address water use throughout the three target provinces - reduce, reuse, recycle, rethink, redesign and regulation. He says some factories have already proven that recycling water is possible but the same attitudes and practices are not being fully adapted.  “Imagine if everyone could recycle 20 per cent, you can drop the demand for water a lot. We can have ‘new water’. Better late than never is the motto for my team,” he said. Luxmon said there will be “both sticks and carrots” to both regulate and incentivise more sustainable behaviours from investors. “We are moving away from those old industries that pollute a lot. We are moving towards technology that will help us meet net zero targets,” she said, adding that in 2021, the EEC has proposed becoming a carbon neutral project in the future. In the meantime, Sucharit is putting more recommendations to the government, calling for more water reserves to be held in the wet season, smarter management systems, real time digital data about water use and better backup schemes to have water saving and recycling programs in the new industrial areas. “The government is listening to our research and recommendations. There are opportunities for them to prepare the plan to counter this,” he said.“No water will not happen. There will be a solution, but at what cost?” Additional reporting by Ryn Jirenuwat."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-climate-strategy-emission-caps-pm-lee-biden-summit-1883476,"Singapore’s climate strategy goes beyond emission caps, carbon tax: PM Lee at Biden’s summit","SINGAPORE: Singapore is committed to tackling climate change and has adopted a strategy that goes beyond meeting emission caps or implementing a carbon tax, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Friday (Apr 23).  “Although Singapore is a small island state, we will contribute our share to the climate agenda,” Mr Lee said in his recorded remarks for the Leaders’ Summit on Climate hosted by US President Joe Biden. “Singapore was among the first 20 countries to submit our long-term strategy to the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change). This year we launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030, our roadmap towards sustainable development and net zero emissions.” 
  Mr Lee noted that because of Singapore’s size and lack of resources, it must innovate and use technology extensively to achieve its emission reduction goals. He pointed out that even though Singapore has “very limited” renewable energy options, there are plans to quadruple solar energy production by 2025, as well as to open one of the world’s largest floating solar energy systems that will offset 33,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. 
  Another “major concern” for Singapore is rising urban temperatures, said Mr Lee. To address this, the country plans to use computer modelling for more climate-responsive urban design, experiment with cooling paint on buildings, as well as plant one million more trees. Given Singapore’s status as a financial hub, it can help the global push for sustainability through green finance, financial technology and capability building, said Mr Lee. “We have launched a US$2 billion Green Investments Programme. This will support the development of carbon trading and services, sustainability consultancies and environmental risk management,” he said. “One promising area is emissions verification, including using new technology to measure the carbon footprints and monitor abatement commitments of businesses.” Mr Lee added that Singapore is “happy” to share its experience in these areas. 
  “We have incorporated climate and sustainability in the Singapore-US Third Country Training Programme. And as country coordinator for ASEAN-US energy cooperation, we will work closely with the US to support our region’s clean energy transition,” he said. “We look forward to working with the US and all countries to build a sustainable future.” The two-day summit convened by Mr Biden involves 40 world leaders. Ahead of the virtual meeting, countries such as the United Kingdom and Japan had announced strengthened new targets as part of their plans to tackle climate change. On Thursday, the Biden administration also pledged to halve US greenhouse gas emissions to 52 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030. 
  As previously announced, Singapore aims to halve its 2030 peak greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and achieve net zero emissions ""as soon as viable"" in the second half of the century.  Said Mr Lee: “I would like to thank President Joe Biden for convening this summit. It is a welcome signal of US leadership and commitment to a multilateral climate solution, underlined by the US rejoining the Paris Agreement.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/climatechange/china-xi-jinping-phase-down-coal-consumption-2026-2030-1883461,Xi says China will phase down coal consumption over 2026 to 2030,"SHANGHAI: China will start to phase down coal consumption over the 2026-2030 period as part of its efforts to reduce climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions, President Xi Jinping told the Climate Leaders' Summit on Thursday (Apr 22). ""We will strictly control coal-fired power generation projects,"" Xi said, speaking via video link. ""We will strictly limit the increase in coal consumption over the 14th five-year plan period (2021 to 2025) and phase it down in the 15th five-year plan period (2026 to 2030)."" Xi's comments imply that China's coal consumption, by far the highest in the world, will reach a peak in 2025 and start to fall thereafter. 
  ""However, more ambitious actions are needed,"" said Li Shuo, senior climate adviser for environment group Greenpeace. ""It is in China's self-interest to announce and implement further plans ahead of COP26,"" he said, referring to the annual climate meeting scheduled to take place in Glasgow in November. Xi pledged last year that China would bring its emissions to a peak before 2030 and become carbon neutral by 2060. 
  ""China has committed to move from carbon peak to carbon neutrality in a much shorter timespan than what might take many developed countries, and that requires extraordinarily hard efforts from China,"" he said. China's energy regulator said earlier on Thursday that it would aim to reduce the share of coal in its total energy mix to less than 56 per cent this year, but it remains one of the only major economies to approve new coal projects. Xi also reiterated China's call for industrialised countries to help poorer nations transition to green and low-carbon development."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tackle-climate-change-good-economic-sense-cop26-alok-sharma-1883456,Investments to tackle climate crisis make ‘very good economic sense’: COP26 president,"SINGAPORE: The fight against climate change is not just about protecting nature and the world’s population but it also makes “very good economic sense”, said Mr Alok Sharma, the president of the upcoming United Nations’ (UN) Climate Change Conference. In a keynote video presentation at the CNA Leadership Summit on Thursday (Apr 22), Mr Sharma cited several examples.  For instance, analysis has shown that a shift to renewable energies can create more jobs than the use of fossil fuels, while every dollar invested in climate adaptation can result in up to US$10 of economic benefit. He also cited the United Kingdom as an example which “shows clearly that economic strength can go hand in hand with driving down emissions”. “Over the past 30 years, we have managed to grow our economy by 75 per cent, whilst reducing emissions by 43 per cent,” said the former UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. 
  Mr Sharma left his position as business secretary in January to focus full-time on his role as president of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26), which is set to be held in Glasgow in November. According to its website, the COP26 summit will bring parties together ""to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change"". The COP26 “must be the moment the world comes together to deal with the climate crisis”, said Mr Sharma, while laying out his four objectives for the conference. The first is to put the world on a path to net zero emissions, which is “absolutely vital” if the world seeks to limit the rise in global temperature in line with the Paris Agreement and “avoid the worst effects of climate change”, he said. Mr Sharma is also hoping for plans to be formulated to boost climate adaptation, to get finance flowing to climate action and collaboration to enable a faster transition to a green economy.  Achieving these aims will require action from across the society, including governments, civil society, businesses and investors, he said. “And we need governments to plan to adapt to our changing climate and to set clear net zero targets (with) long term strategies to get there. And really importantly, short-term emissions reductions targets to keep them on track.” 
  Mr Sharma also said the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has presented countries with “a unique opportunity to reimagine economies, to build back cleaner and greener, creating jobs and prosperity as we do so”. The global shift to clean growth presents huge economic opportunities, he added. On the flip side, polluting ways of working will risk getting left behind with costly, stranded assets. He cited analysis that said climate change could cost more than 200 of the world’s biggest companies a combined total of about US$1 trillion. “Yet those same companies have the potential for US$2 trillion worth of gains from the move to green economies.” “My friends, the economics is behind us and the urgent need for action is clear. So together, let’s make 2021 the year we get a grip of the climate crisis."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/united-states-good-dynamics-fight-climate-change-grace-fu-1883446,New US administration bringing ‘good dynamics’ to the fight against climate change: Grace Fu,"SINGAPORE: The United States, led by President Joe Biden, is bringing “good dynamics” to the fight against climate change in which international collaboration is key, said Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu on Thursday (Apr 22). Since taking office, President Biden has led the US to officially rejoin the Paris climate agreement and is set to hold a virtual climate summit involving 40 world leaders this week. The recent meeting between US climate envoy John Kerry and his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua, which produced a joint agreement, is also “a good sign”, said Ms Fu, who was speaking at a fireside chat with CNA Digital’s chief editor Jaime Ho at the CNA Leadership Summit 2021. 
  “In the Trump administration, the decision to leave Paris Agreement was devastating for the global climate action. The US was not at the table and therefore, I think the much-needed leadership was absent,” she said. “With the US new administration back on track and with the meeting later on, we are hopeful that the leadership will galvanise actions (and) also bring attention to this important matter.” Turning to the recent meeting between the US and China, she added that it is a “good sign” that both countries agreed on stronger pledges to curb climate change. “Any platform that allows the superpowers to come together to have a good discussion, I think it’s a positive one for climate change.” 
  She noted how the world is now “very divided” and it is important to return to a more collaborative rules-based multilateral system, which Singapore needs. While the COVID-19 pandemic may have thrown up issues such as supply disruptions and a shortage of necessary resources, Ms Fu said the world has also done “extremely well” in areas such as exchanging of data at the political level. This has helped countries to understand the new coronavirus “in the shortest time”. “The fact that we can come up with a vaccine in such a short time showed the collaboration, not just at the scientific level, but also at the political level,” she added. When it comes to climate change, the minister called for developed countries to “consider looking at the commitments they have put on the table about financing developing countries”. Developing countries are suffering from both the impact of the pandemic and climate change now, and climate mitigation and adaptation efforts “cannot wait”, she added. Singapore is doing its part. For instance, it has a Climate Action Package, which offers countries in the region with training programmes on climate science, adaptation measures and others. “We really look forward to some concrete action in COP (Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change), that basically show a commitment from the developed countries that they are going to make good their commitment to help the developing countries,” she said. GREEN RECOVERY With the summit being focused on the theme of a “green recovery”, the minister was asked for her take on that. Ms Fu noted that the recovery will “have to be contextualised” given how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted each country differently. That said, there are several areas that countries are already looking into, such as opportunities in sustainable products like electric vehicles and wind turbines. These are “the next big winner”, said the minister, noting that countries and companies are entering these industries early so as to build up their capabilities ahead of time and gain a competitive advantage. 
  Other areas include countries investing differently to ensure that their infrastructure is environmentally friendly and hence future-proof, as well as how the finance sector is seeing a “sea change” in insisting on compliance with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. Asked how she would convince businesses on the importance of a “green” recovery, she said sustainable development “is not just using something expensive” and can be as simple as reducing wastage and improving work processes. “When we talk about reducing our consumption, it's really about reducing wastage and that makes absolute business sense,” she said, referring to the consumption of electricity, water and even the re-organisation of office space amid the COVID-19 pandemic. “I think we should really change the mindset,” she said. “It is about going through your processes and looking at how we can reduce our wastage so that we can be leaner (and) using the resources better many times over.” 
  While the pandemic has delayed action on climate change for about a year, Ms Fu said she is “very optimistic” that the global crisis will not go to waste. Already, there are many nascent technologies ready for take-off in corporate research labs. “We think the market will take off,” she said, citing the example of solar energy costs, which have “dropped tremendously over the last decade”. “And this is what we need – we need the economies of scale. We need countries coming together, put their markets to test (and) put their products to good use.” The minister added that the world is now in a “transition period” where the ways of working and living are being looked at differently. “COVID-19 has given us this opportunity to rethink… and I think this is a good time for us to also explore the new technologies that’s going to come,” she said. “The Government will be there to invest in R&D (research and development), to invest in downstream productisation, and we are very excited to help some of our companies to make that transition from being products in the lab to products in the market.”"

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/businesses-sustainability-conscious-millennials-money-mind-1883311,How businesses are responding to sustainability-conscious millennials,"SINGAPORE: Social enterprise Ugly Food is on a mission to change Singaporeans’ perception of blemished fruits. On Instagram, its comic strips on talking fruits explain how fresh produce gets scarred in the supply chain journey and how people can help save them.  UglyFood hopes the caricatures will build public awareness and help reduce Singapore’s growing food waste. UglyFood started out as a school project. It takes in blemished and excess fruits from importers, supermarkets and wholesalers. The idea is that beauty is not just skin deep, and that produce deemed “ugly”, can also be delicious – and less wasteful. According to a 2019 study by the Singapore Environment Council and Deloitte, Singapore imports about 2 million tonnes of food. About 393,000 tonnes, or almost 20 percent, is lost in the supply chain yearly. Fruits and vegetables account for about 167,000 tonnes in food loss that occur during the post-harvest stage, processing and transportation. Since it was founded in 2016, UglyFood said it has saved 200 tonnes of food – a big leap from just less than 100kg of fruits initially.  ""We want it to be the global brand or global face in terms of food wastage of fresh produce,"" said Mr Augustine Tan, co-founder of UglyFood. ""It’s definitely making a difference. Big or not is relative ... We do hope that can we can shave off at least one-seventh or one-eighth of the total wastage that Singapore has,"" he added.  
   This desire to make a difference is one shared by many in the millennial demographic. According to a global survey by Deloitte, millennials see climate change and protecting the environment as a top concern – overtaking anxieties over health, jobs and personal safety. In its primary poll, 83 per cent of millennials agreed that climate change is occuring and is caused primarily by humans. And only 40 per cent believe current and future efforts to protect the planet will be successful. Though optimism remains low, millennials are making changes in their daily routine to improve the planet. Prior to the pandemic, 58 per cent said they had increased use of public transport, while half had cut their purchases of fast fashion and 64 per cent were cutting down on single use plastic and recycling more. According to Ms Yvonne Zhang, lead sustainability director at Deloitte Singapore, millennials are making important life decisions based on sustainability concerns. These include questions such as how many children to have, or whether they should have children at all. Other key decisions include those about daily diet. 
   Deloitte said millennials are in a position to create wider awareness and effect changes on sustainability, as they become consumers, policymakers, investors and workers. “The millennials are concerned with more than just profits, with more than just self-interest,"" said Ms Zhang. ""Millennials want to contribute actively to reducing consumption, removing some of the biases and impediments facing society, as well as rehabilitating society for environmental concerns, social concerns, and also improving governance and transparency. They have a lot of preferences and a lot of asks for entities to do better and show that they are doing more,” she added. For small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), this presents an opportunity to transform their operations and benefit from the growing clamour for sustainable practices. “For a lot of SMEs, the whole pandemic has been a chance for them to rethink their positioning, their marketing,"" said Mr Ang Yuit, vice president of the Association of Small & Medium Enterprises (ASME). ""So I think many may actually go down the path of repositioning themselves with the ESG (environmental, social, and governance) goals. In some cases, maybe pivoting to one that has more alignment with environmentally sustainable goals, that would allow them to reach out to a different market.” 
  For retailers and food industry players, going green could mean using less plastic for packaging or adopting practices to avoid wastage. For others, this could entail changing equipment, materials and processes or even revamping the entire business model. According to Mr Ang, this may pose a challenge for some businesses. “The barriers are that a lot of firms have a fixed way of doing their business. And that inertia would then continue - I use whatever that's there, established suppliers that don't have to change. Because even if it is cheaper, establishing new suppliers and supply routes will cost me time. So that's still imputed costs,” he said. Deloitte said there remains a lack of clear sustainability benchmarks that can result in actual benefits for companies. In addition, the pathway to profitability to justify investment in environmental and social goals may not always be clear. Challenges aside, many still see sustainability as a way forward due to its potential impact to bottom lines. “What we are noticing is because of the change in demand and a slight change in the way the overall government has been pushing for this, people are starting to move towards that direction,” said Mr Ang."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/us-china-biden-climate-change-summit-net-zero-carbon-emissions-1883431,"Commentary: Cooperation between US, China at global climate summit could yield significant benefits","SINGAPORE: One of the most egregious legacies of the Donald Trump presidency has been an unapologetic onslaught on the environment. Trump not only set up a bonfire of domestic environmental safeguards, he also notoriously pulled the United States out of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. The first 100 days of President Joe Biden’s administration has been mostly about course correction, salvaging whatever remains of the nation’s capacity and credibility for battling global warming. 
  CHINA AND THE US NEEDED FOR MEANINGFUL HEADWAY ON CLIMATE ACTION Mr Biden’s virtual global climate summit, held to coincide with Earth Day this week, will set the stage for the US to renew its vows with the climate agenda. Dozens of world leaders have promised to attend, though the US should be pleased that China President Xi Jinping will be joining the party. After all, any climate talks would lack meaning without having representatives of the world’s biggest carbon emitter in the midst. Together, China and the US account for nearly half of global greenhouse gas emissions. A cooperative arrangement between the two countries is hence necessary to meet the target set in the Paris accord: Limiting global warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius. 
  To be sure, as the testy bilateral meetings in Alaska in March revealed, China-US relations remain extremely fraught. Fundamental disagreements on what China perceives as its “internal” affairs, such as Hong Kong, Taiwan and Xinjiang, cannot be papered over. This, combined with bipartisan US scepticism towards China, may well derail any current goodwill toward a joint collaboration on climate. Yet, according to a recent poll, a majority of US registered voters support greater government action in fighting climate change, three-fourths of whom wanted their country to rejoin the Paris agreement. Seizing the initiative in international climate action will likely be politically rewarding. (Will a Biden presidency move the needle on climate action? Find out on The Climate Conversations.)  PROMISING SIGNS So far, the signs are promising. The recent Shanghai talks between the special climate envoys of China and the US concluded with a joint statement on strengthening cooperation on climate issues. This is not insignificant. A pathway may now open up for continuous bilateral dialogue to formulate concrete action, auguring well for the upcoming UN climate summit in November. Indeed, both countries - and the rest of the world - are hoping for a repeat of the 2016 breakthrough in China-US talks that paved the way for the ratification of the Paris agreement. Securing mutual commitment to the climate agenda avoids what partly doomed the 1992 Kyoto Protocol – the non-participation in different ways of these two major carbon polluters. In other words, it will be easier to pressure other countries to follow suit with their climate ambitions. If it goes well, it may consolidate what the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres envisioned last December of “a truly global coalition for carbon neutrality”. And since both China and the US have been hit hard by COVID-19, it becomes urgent to pool resources to stay the course of global decarbonisation. 
  CHINA HAS THE UPPER HAND Regrettably, when it comes to climate change initiatives over the last three decades, the US has followed a “one step forward, two steps backward” trajectory. By contrast, this time, China has entered the climate negotiations from a far stronger position. The US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement had created a global climate leadership vacuum that China was keen to fill. Since then, China has been slowly but surely polishing its climate credentials. The UN leadership has even recognised that Chinese investments, specifically the Belt and Road Initiative, will help foster sustainable development across developing countries throughout the global South. Calling the Belt and Road “an important space” where green principles can be reflected in green action, Mr Guterres said in 2019 the initiative maps onto 17 Sustainable Development Goals and can translate into “real life progress for people”. While the US has been a laggard in financing projects that help emerging economies to reach their climate goals, China has lived up to its reputation as the largest renewable energy investor worldwide. That 2020 was a difficult pandemic year did not stop China from spending about US$11 billion on renewable energy projects in its BRI partner countries – more than half of its total energy infrastructure investments. Late last year, to the pleasant surprise of many observers, President Xi pledged that China's emissions will peak by 2030, and turn carbon neutral by 2060. To align with this national commitment, leading Chinese state-owned oil and gas companies have declared their own targets of carbon neutrality and begun diversifying their investments. The same cannot be said of their US counterparts yet. Tellingly, China now hardly uses the excuse of being a “developing country” to reject its climate responsibility. 
  MUCH MORE TO BE DONE To be sure, a look at the Climate Action Tracker tells you how much still needs to be done by both nations. Though the US is performing worse, having been slapped with the rating “critically insufficient”, China’s progress remains “highly insufficient.” This is due to its addiction to coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel. China currently burns more coal than all other countries combined for energy to grow its economy. In fact, rather than downsizing its coal industry, China has been building more coal plants at home and abroad, contributing to three-quarters of the world’s new coal power capacity in 2020. The US may still be able to catch up with China and most of the industrialised world. Sealing a cooperative pact with China on climate will be a crucial first step toward reclaiming a leadership role on climate action. The planet is better off with the US taking a more assertive position. China-US relations can then be a mix of bilateral climate cooperation and constructive competition. The US could challenge China to a showdown of climate supremacy: Who reaches net-zero emissions first and who becomes the largest renewable energy solution provider. This will certainly keep China on its toes, ensuring that it works hard toward matching its rhetoric with action. Like the so-called Beijing and Washington Consensus that have shaped how states should run the economy today, US-China climate competition is as much a battle of ideas to influence the global order for generations to come. Put simply, it is a matter of soft power. Each side will attempt to forge a new global consensus on climate governance by offering competing strategies for decarbonisation – will Washington’s market-led model prevail, or will it vindicate Beijing’s technocratic approach? 
  Moreover, it impinges on their economic and technological competitiveness in a carbon-neutral future. Both countries will want to be in pole position to tap the rich market potential for green tech innovation in the developing world. Unlike the zero-sum – and carbon intensive – nature of military competition that has intensified regional security concerns, such a climate tussle, if managed well, could offer humanity a greater sense of climate security, while helping support the next biggest carbon emitters transition into clean energy. However, as President Xi noted, this is contingent on all parties remembering that climate change “should not become a geopolitical bargaining chip”. This is unfortunately something even China has been equally guilty of when it restricted exports of rare earth minerals (a vital component for manufacturing clean energy technologies such as electric vehicles, solar panels and wind turbines) in response to a diplomatic spat with Japan in 2010. Therefore, at the end of the day, climate competition must be tempered with robust partnership that facilitates knowledge transfers and exchange, research and development collaboration on climate solutions – and ultimately mutual understanding.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/greta-thunberg-docuseries-amplifies-climate-change-fight-1883441,Greta Thunberg new docuseries amplifies her climate change fight,"Greta Thunberg turned 18 in January, but she’s already made peace with her future: While most college students will change their concentrations multiple times, the Swedish high school student says climate change activism will be her life’s mission. “In a perfect world, there wouldn’t need to be a climate activist, but unfortunately, there will probably still be a need for climate activists for quite some time,” she said. “I think I will be doing this for as long as there is a need for people to do this.” Thunberg’s activism and message is brought to life in a new docuseries, Greta Thunberg: A Year To Change The World. The three-part series, a co-production between PBS and BBC Studios premiering Thursday (Apr 22) on Earth Day, follows the then-16-year-old as she took a gap year from school in 2019 to meet with scientists around the world and spearhead awareness about climate change. The docuseries shows her visiting people and places that have been distinctly affected by the heating of the Earth, such as Canada’s Athabasca Glacier, a town in California burned by wildfires and the indigenous Sami herders in Sweden where reindeer face starvation. She even sails across the North Atlantic during the ocean’s busiest season to experience how carbon dioxide emissions from ships have altered the chemistry of the ocean. A Year To Change The World also gives a behind-the-scenes look at her speaking at massive rallies, and also reveals how her momentum was significantly slowed by the worldwide coronavirus pandemic. Thunberg, a 2020 Nobel Peace Prize nominee, said while she grew even more knowledgeable about climate change, there were moments that surprised her, like meeting with Polish coal miners. “I had expected them to not be willing to change, but they were willing to change. They wanted to live in a more sustainable world… as long as they were not left behind,” said Thunberg. “I’ve met with world leaders who are less eager to change.” And it’s many of those heads of government that have positioned Greta as a political lighting rod and inadvertently raised her global profile. Brazil’s conservative president Jair Bolsonaro has called her a “brat”, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said she doesn’t understand that the “modern world is complex”, and former president Donald Trump mentioned her at rallies, which resulted in cascades of boos. He even famously tweeted, “Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill, Greta, Chill!” Thunberg, the youngest person ever to receive Time’s Person of the Year honour in 2019, said she doesn’t fully understand why she’s on the radar of government officials, but it shows that the message of climate change is reaching far and wide. “When people like that do these kinds of things and say these kinds of things, of course, it’s very hilarious,” said Thunberg. “It’s a sign that we are doing something good, that we are having an impact, so that we take it as a compliment.” But Thunberg says she believes what’s most intriguing about the new project is what the filmmakers weren’t able to include. “I think maybe the most interesting thing about the documentary series is what didn’t get into the series. I don’t know how many fashion companies like H&M, car companies like Volkswagen, oil companies like Shell and airlines and so on that we asked for interviews, but they all refused consistently. And that, I think is very interesting – it says a lot about them.” While US PBS stations and BBC Earth in Canada air the docuseries on Thursday, Thunberg will be at her school in Sweden, which re-opened in-person classes to one day a week. She’ll also use Earth Day to testify virtually to the US Congress, along with scientists, about fossil fuel subsidies. Thunberg says she understands that changing the world – or even getting her fellow global citizens to care about how’s it’s changing – will not happen overnight, but she wants everyone to be aware about how their daily actions can affect future generations. “I’m not telling anyone to care,” said Thunberg. “But if you want yourself and your children and grandchildren to be able to live in a prosperous world and in a world where they can enjoy all the things in life that you have gotten to enjoy, then you should care. But of course, that’s up to you. I’m not telling you to do something – saving the world is voluntary.” (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/climatechange/climate-change-putin-russia-greenhouse-gas-emissions-lower-eu-1883436,Russia's greenhouse gas emissions should be lower than EU's: Putin,"MOSCOW: President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday (Apr 21) he wanted Russia's total net greenhouse gas emissions to be less than the European Union's over the next 30 years, a goal he described as tough but doable. The leader of the vast hydrocarbon-rich nation that is the world's fourth largest greenhouse gas emitter is set to deliver a speech at an online climate change summit hosted by US President Joe Biden on Thursday. ""Over the next 30 years, accumulated net greenhouse gas emissions in Russia must be lower than in the European Union,"" Putin told top officials and lawmakers at his annual state-of-the-nation speech. ""This is a difficult task, given the size of our country, its geography, climate and economic structure. However, I am absolutely certain that this goal, given our scientific and technological potential, is achievable."" 
  The European Union, a trade bloc of 27 nations, has committed to cutting emissions by more than most major emitters. Russia's economy is heavily reliant on exports of oil, gas and mineral resources, and the push to combat climate change poses serious challenges for the Kremlin. Putin has said Russia is warming at 2.5 times the world average and that it would be a disaster if the permafrost melts in its northern cities. The Russian leader, who has questioned whether human activity is the sole driver of warming climate cycles, has cast himself as a defender of the environment. Russia joined the 2015 Paris Agreement to fight climate change in September 2019. Putin ordered the government last November to work towards an emissions cut by 2030 of up to 30 per cent below emission levels in 1990. "

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/central-bank-climate-change-green-finance-risk-disclose-esg-bond-1883411,Commentary: Central banks are falling in line in fight against climate change,"LONDON: Nearly everywhere one looks nowadays – newsrooms, corporate manifestos, and government agendas – climate change has moved from the fringe to center stage. And central banks, after long standing on the sidelines, have recently begun to play a starring role. The Bank of England, for example, just became the first central bank to include in its policy remit a reference to supporting the transition to a net-zero emissions economy. The European Central Bank is discussing how – not merely whether – to incorporate climate considerations in its own monetary policy. And the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), a global group of central banks and financial supervisors, has more than doubled its membership over the past two years. Its 62 central banks include those of all but four G20 member states. Such a speedy shift is bound to invite spirited debate – as well it should. But the overall premise for the change is sound. If anything, the overriding risk is that central banks will still do too little, rather than too much, about climate change. 
  Over the past few years, a consensus among central bank leaders regarding climate risks to financial stability has emerged. The Bank for International Settlements database shows that whereas only four central bank governors delivered speeches on green finance in 2018, 13 did just two years later. And now, nearly half of NGFS members have assessed climate risks, and more than one-tenth have already carried out climate stress tests, according to research by BlackRock. Central banks’ investment activities have duly followed suit. Almost 60 per cent of developed economies’ central banks now invest using broad environmental, social and governance criteria, and Eurosystem central banks have agreed to a common stance on climate-related investments in non-monetary policy portfolios. Finally, even monetary policy itself has begun to align with climate issues. Late last year, Sweden’s Riksbank announced a new climate-related exclusion policy. Similarly, the BOE is expected to indicate later this year how it will account for the climate impact of its corporate-bond holdings. Several ECB decision-makers have called for climate risks to be incorporated into corporate bond purchases and collateral policy. And the NGFS has just published technical guidance for “adapting central bank operations to a hotter world.” BEHIND CENTRAL BANKS’ GREEN SHIFT There are three main causes for this shift – all of them legitimate. First, close to 130 governments around the world have committed to large reductions in carbon dioxide emissions over the coming decades. While the policies for achieving this have yet to be fully specified, the premise that meaningful change will occur is no longer merely an act of faith. Central banks that integrate climate considerations into their activities thus can no longer be accused of front-running governments. And where a central bank’s mandate includes supporting a state’s economic policies, agnosticism (or, in central banking jargon, market neutrality), will be increasingly untenable if it clashes with official climate commitments. 
  Second, the case for incorporating climate change into macroeconomic modeling and investment decisions has never been stronger. Extreme weather events have become more frequent, and their impact on growth and inflation more visible. Moreover, as policy plans take shape, the uncertainty around climate impact scenarios over the coming decades has become less daunting. Climate-related data have improved enormously in quality and quantity, and the availability of climate-aware investment instruments and strategies has increased dramatically. Their emerging performance record already indicates that they can boost portfolio resilience without sacrificing returns. Accordingly, a majority of institutional investors globally now consider sustainability to be fundamental to their investment strategies. 
  The third reason for central banks’ new stance is a growing recognition that advocacy alone is insufficient. To have a greater impact, they must lead by example. This calls for greater transparency about their own exposure to climate-related risks and how such risks are modelled and priced. Better disclosure will rest, in turn, on the receipt of adequate data from issuers whose assets central banks choose to hold. As such, central banks will likely exert great influence over the speed with which climate-related risks are priced into the financial system. There are risks in moving both too slowly and too fast, so establishing a clear path ahead is essential. (How are businesses being held accountable for their climate impact? PwC’s Sustainability Leader Fang Eu-Lin breaks it down:)   CONVERSION STILL IN ITS YOUTH That said, central bankers’ conversion to the climate cause is still in its youth. Many central banks have yet to join the NGFS, let alone integrate climate change meaningfully into their activities. The vast majority of emerging-market central banks have not signed up. And, globally, the BOE is the only central bank so far to have published a statement in line with the most exacting recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, albeit Eurosystem central banks have committed to do so within two years. 
  Central banks are understandably wary of mission creep, and of raising expectations that can be met only by becoming reliant on governments. Still, the work of the NGFS and the actions of its leading members should demonstrate to other central banks that their mandates not only permit but in fact require climate change to be incorporated into their activities. Numerous challenges remain, and domestic circumstances differ; but that is no excuse for inaction. Central bankers’ response to climate change risks has plenty of room to grow.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/indonesian-farmers-climate-change-innovation-crisis-1883361,Commentary: Why Indonesian farmers may become extinct in about 40 years,"JAKARTA: It is a bold and somewhat depressing prediction: That by 2063, the Indonesian farmer will disappear as a profession. This according to the National Development Planning Agency of Indonesia (Bappenas). Their projection bears out the slow decline of workers in the agricultural sector. Bappenas data shows that the proportion of Indonesian workers in the agricultural sector reached 65.8 per cent in 1976. However, in 2019 it decreased significantly to only 28 per cent. 
  Part of this decline can be attributed to agricultural sector workers switching professions to other sectors, especially to services. In 1976, service sector workers accounted for 23.57 per cent and this increased to 48.91 per cent in 2019. Likewise, the proportion of workers in the industrial sector increased to 22.45 per cent in 2019 from the previous 8.86 percent in 1976. Aside from the shifting workforce, Bappenas also attributes the decline in the number of workers in the agricultural sector with the decreasing number of agricultural land. In 2013, agricultural land reached 7.75 million hectares, but in 2019 it decreased to 7.45 million hectares. One of the driving factors is land use change due to rapid urbanisation. Whereas in 2045 the population living in urban areas is estimated to increase to reach 67.1 per cent. Based on these trends, the farming profession is under heavy risk of disappearing, said Acting Director at Bappenas, Mia Amalia. SHIFTING DEMOGRAPHICS For years, farmers relied heavily on the weather for a good harvest. For them, a crop failure would be devastating – not only wiping out their incomes but also potentially putting them and their families in starvation. With increased changes in climate, an unpredictable harvest cycle and the pest attacks have added to the problems farmers have faced. 
  Another dilemma for farmers happens when their own children become educated, robbing them of successors. Children sent to the city to pursue a good education are very reluctant to return to the village and take on their parents' agricultural businesses. Children who go to school are expected to become ""someone"" who will remove their families from poverty in the agricultural sector. Fewer young people pick farming. Only 23 per cent of the country’s 14.2 million people under the age of 24 worked in agriculture, forestry or fishery according to data from the National Labour Force. Those left to struggle in the agricultural sector are those who have little education and nothing else to do. And this can lead to a substandard quality of farming. Oil palm smallholders, for example, tend to get a much lower selling price than palm oil from corporate-owned plantations who naturally have better yield because they have sophisticated plantation technology and a highly scheduled maintenance system. Smallholders without these benefits are at the mercy of middlemen who set prices. A LACK OF INNOVATION Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) data until February 2017 shows that the total population working in the agricultural sector is only 39.68 million people or 31.86 per cent of the total working population in Indonesia. Unfortunately, most of these people are older. Even from existing data, only 15.38 percent of farmers are productive enough to meet all national food needs. According to the records of the Ministry of Agriculture (Kementan), agricultural land has shrunk by 100,000 ha a year, with 80 per cent occurring in food production centres. 
  The lack of innovation in the agricultural sector is a chief driver, leaving many second-generation farmers to see the agricultural sector as a less attractive and less promising sector. This is why there is an urgent need to accelerate innovation and technology transfer in the agricultural sector by facilitating synergies among parties, including universities, agricultural start-ups, agricultural research institutes, related authorities, and others. The combination of agricultural human resource development policies and a mix of agricultural technology innovations can increase quality, productivity and market opportunities, and make the agricultural sector even more attractive in the eyes of the second generation of farmers. The Asian Development Bank has suggested increasing investment in agriculture by modernising food systems, getting proper infrastructure for rural communities, creating better cell-phone towers, cold-chain facilities and using advanced technologies to mitigate against pests and other natural disasters. CUTTING OUT THE MIDDLEMAN There must also be new ways that farmers can work with investors directly, thereby cutting out the middleman. In Indonesia, the agricultural economic structure places farmers at the bottom of the chain. 
  The majority of farmers who live in rural areas cannot directly sell their products to the market, so farmers have to sell them to intermediaries or middleman. The middleman also varies, starting from the village, sub-district, regency level, to the big city level. For example, the price of one kilogram of chilli at the farmer level is IDR 10,000 (US$0.69), but on the market in Jakarta it can be up to IDR 60,000-80,000. This further entrenches the view among younger farmers that they cannot afford a better living on these wages. Yet, there are examples to show this can change for the better. Agritech companies like TaniHub and Sayurbox, backed by tech titan Grab, work directly with farmers – they offer them loans, use technology to track their harvest to ensure as much as possible yields are stable (and don’t fluctuate) and offer them steady prices. But these are small successes. There has to be a much wider effort by the government to invest in agriculture, particularly because demand for rice and other vegetables will not go down anytime soon. Meanwhile, the need for food increases every year because the population of Indonesia is increasing. But with the sector experiencing some of its biggest challenges, will it be able to feed enough people? Ronny P Sasmita is a Senior Fellow for Indonesia Strategic and Economic Action Institution."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/flooding-planning-climate-change-grace-fu-1883416,"Recent flooding shows importance of planning for climate change, says Grace Fu","SINGAPORE: Recent flooding incidents here show the importance of planning for climate change, said Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu on Monday (Apr 19). ""The recent floodings have shown the effects of climate change in Singapore. We are getting a lot more intense rainfall, one of the highest in the last 40 years,"" said Ms Fu. This shows that it is necessary to plan for climate change and ways to mitigate its effects, she added, noting that tackling the issue requires understanding the ""twin challenges"" of both inland flooding and sea level rise. Singapore has already been witnessing weather pattern changes, and moving forward, can expect to see even more such changes as a result of climate change, she said.  Ms Fu was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a visit to a worksite for the second phase of the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS). Her comments come after heavy rain across the island resulted in flash floods on Saturday (Apr 17). PUB issued flood risk warnings for more than 20 locations including the Bukit Timah and Ulu Pandan canals as well as Sungei Pandan Kechil. 
  The national water agency noted then that western Singapore recorded the heaviest rainfall of 161.4mm between 12.25pm and 3.25pm, or about 91 per cent of Singapore's average monthly rainfall in April. It said this was in the top 0.5 per cent of maximum daily rainfall records since 1981. Heavy rains also resulted in flash floods in parts of Singapore last month.  PUB has already spent about S$2 billion over the last decade on improving Singapore's drainage system as part of flood mitigation measures, and will spend almost S$1.4 billion more on such efforts over the next five years, said Ms Fu on Monday.  
  There are 37 such projects now, with another 10 to be added this year, she said, noting that this points to Singapore's determination to improve its water infrastructure and become more resilient to the impact of climate change.  Infrastructure such as the DTSS - which will collect and transport water from the whole of Singapore to three water reclamation plants in Changi, Kranji and Tuas - help in enhancing the country's resilience in this regard as it will allow water to be reused multiple times, she said.  ""So this investment is really to help us to improve the resilience of our water infrastructure,"" she said. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/climatechange/toyota-review-climate-change-carbon-emissions-stance-investors-1883406,Toyota to review climate stance as investors turn up the heat,"TOKYO: Japan's Toyota Motor signalled a shift in its climate change stance on Monday (Apr 19), saying it would review its lobbying and be more transparent on what steps it is taking as it faces increased activist and investor pressure. The carmaker came under scrutiny after siding with the Trump administration in 2019 in a bid to bar the state of California from setting its own fuel efficiency rules. Toyota ""will review public policy engagement activities through our company and industry associations to confirm they are consistent with the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement"", it said in a statement, adding that actions will be announced by the end of this year. The automaker also said it will ""strive to provide more information so that our stakeholders can understand our effort to achieve carbon neutrality"". A company spokeswoman, who confirmed that ""public policy engagement activities"" includes lobbying, was not able to respond immediately to questions about pressure from investors. 
  Four funds with about US$235 billion in assets under management are pressuring Toyota before its annual shareholder meeting in June to draw a line under its lobbying against international efforts to prevent catastrophic global warming. ""This move must not be a PR exercise but instead signal a clear end to its role in negative climate lobbying which has given it a laggard status,"" Jens Munch Holst, chief executive officer of Danish pension fund AkademikerPension, told Reuters. AkademikerPension has ""escalated via intense direct engagement"" with Toyota after a decade of communicating with the automaker through a third party, Troels Borrild, spokesman at the Danish fund, told Reuters. 
  ""UNDERMINED CLIMATE ACTION"" AkademikerPension will consider preparing a shareholders resolution to submit at next year's annual general meeting if ""Toyota fails to deliver on its commitment"", Borrild said. The fund would consider selling its Toyota holding if there is no change, but the spokesman said fund officials did not believe it would come to that. ""Right up until now, the company has repeatedly undermined climate action, from opposing the UK government's ban on internal combustion engines by 2030 to opposing car fuel economy standards in the US,"" Munch Holst said. 
  The Toyota spokeswoman told Reuters that it would need more time to respond to Munch Holst's comments. The other investors are Church of England Pensions Board, Sweden's AP7 and Norway's Storebrand. Toyota was among major automakers that supported the Trump administration in its attempt to bar California from setting its own fuel-efficiency rules or zero-emission requirements. They have since dropped that support in a ""gesture of good faith and to find a constructive path forward"" with the Biden administration. With pressure growing on carmakers to slash emissions, Toyota is also scrambling to produce EVs that can compete globally with rivals' models. Toyota this year settled a lengthy Justice Department civil probe into its delayed filing of emissions-related defect reports for US$180 million."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/biden-pressed-emissions-goal-climate-summit-nears-1883401,Biden pressed on emissions goal as climate summit nears,"WASHINGTON: When President Joe Biden convenes a virtual climate summit on Thursday (Apr 22), he faces a vexing task: How to put forward a nonbinding but symbolic goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that will have a tangible impact not only on climate change efforts in the US but throughout the world. The emissions target, eagerly awaited by all sides of the climate debate, will signal how aggressively Biden wants to move on climate change, a divisive and expensive issue that has riled Republicans to complain about job-killing government overreach even as some on the left worry Biden has not gone far enough to address a profound threat to the planet. The climate crisis poses a complex political challenge for Biden, since the problem is harder to see and far more difficult to produce measurable results on than either the pandemic relief package or the infrastructure bill. The target Biden chooses “is setting the tone for the level of ambition and the pace of emission reductions over the next decade″, said Kate Larsen, a former White House adviser who helped develop President Barack Obama’s climate action plan. The number has to be achievable by 2030 but aggressive enough to satisfy scientists and advocates who call the coming decade a crucial, make-or-break moment for slowing climate change, Larsen and other experts said. Scientists, environmental groups and even business leaders are calling on Biden to set a target that would cut US greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. 
  The 50 per cent target, which most experts consider a likely outcome of intense deliberations underway at the White House, would nearly double the nation’s previous commitment and require dramatic changes in the power and transportation sectors, including significant increases in renewable energy such as wind and solar power and steep cuts in emissions from fossil fuels such as coal and oil. Anything short of that goal could undermine Biden’s promise to prevent temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, experts say, while likely stirring up sharp criticism from international allies and Biden’s own supporters The target is significant, not just as a visible goal for the US to achieve after four years of climate inaction under President Donald Trump, but also for “leveraging other countries"", Larsen said.  “That helps domestically in the battle that comes after, which is implementing policies to achieve that target. We can make a better case politically at home if other countries are acting at the same level of ambition as the US.″ The 2030 goal, known as a Nationally Determined Contribution, or NDC, is a key part of the Paris climate agreement, which Biden rejoined on his first day in office.  It’s also an important marker as Biden moves toward his ultimate goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. “Clearly the science demands at least 50 per cent” in reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, said Jake Schmidt, a climate expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a leading environmental group. The 50 per cent target “is ambitious, but it is achievable',' he said in an interview. It's also a good climate message, he said: “People know what 50 per cent means — it's half.'' 
  Whatever target Biden picks, the climate summit itself “proves the U.S. is back in rejoining the international effort″ to address climate change, said Larsen, now a director at the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm. The summit is “the starting gun for climate diplomacy” after a four-year “hiatus” under Trump, she said.  John Kerry, Biden's climate envoy, has been pressing global leaders in person and online ahead of the summit for commitments and alliances on climate efforts. Nathaniel Keohane, another former Obama White House adviser and now a vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund, said experts have coalesced around the need to reduce emissions by at least 50 per cent by 2030. “The number has to start with five,” he said, adding, “We've done the math. We need at least 50 per cent.'' The 2030 target is just one in a sometimes overlapping set of goals that Biden has outlined on climate.  He also has said he expects to adopt a clean energy standard that would make electricity carbon-free by 2035, along with the wider goal of net-zero carbon emissions economy-wide by 2050. Biden's climate adviser, Gina McCarthy, acknowledged that the sheer volume of numbers can be confusing. At a forum last week, she and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said climate activists should focus on actions in the next decade. “Let’s stop talking about 2050,'' said McCarthy, who is leading White House efforts to develop US climate commitments for 2030. Bloomberg, 79, was even more blunt: 2050 “is a good number for people who give speeches, but I don’t know anyone giving those speeches who’s going to be alive in 2050"", he said. Some Republican lawmakers call the focus on reducing US emissions counter-productive, saying Biden's plan would raise energy costs and kill American jobs while allowing Russia, China and other countries to increase greenhouse gas emissions. “The Biden administration will set punishing targets for the United States, while our adversaries keep the status quo. That won’t solve climate change,'' said Wyoming Senator John Barrasso, the top Republican on the Senate Energy Committee.  The United States already leads the world in reducing carbon emissions, Barrasso said, adding that Biden should try to “make American energy as clean as we can, as fast as we can, without raising costs for consumers"". Some on the left think Biden is not going far enough. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat who has called for a massive Green New Deal, said Biden deserves “a lot of credit” for his infrastructure plan's vision and scope, but said it falls far short of what is needed to meaningfully combat the climate crisis.  She and her supporters are calling for at least US$10 trillion in federal spending over the next decade to address climate change and other problems. McCarthy disputed the notion that Biden has backtracked from campaign promises to lead on climate. “We’re always either doing too little or too much,'' she told reporters earlier this month. “But rest assured that the president put a (spending) number out here that he felt was not just defensible but required to meet this moment in time.'' Much of the proposed spending to address climate change is included in Biden’s US$2.3 trillion infrastructure bill. If Republicans think less money should be spent on clean energy and infrastructure, McCarthy added, “then we’ll have those conversations.” Marcella Burke, a former Trump administration official who now is an energy lawyer in Houston, gives Biden an “A-Plus for enthusiasm” on climate, but an incomplete on details.  “We've had a lot of goals, but not a lot of strategy announced to get there,'' she said. ""So the jury is still out.''"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/climate-change/india-may-build-new-coal-plants-due-low-cost-despite-climate-change-1883396,India may build new coal plants due to low cost despite climate change,"CHENNAI: India may build new coal-fired power plants as they generate the cheapest power, according to a draft electricity policy document seen by Reuters, despite growing calls from environmentalists to deter use of coal. Coal's contribution to electricity generation in India fell for the second straight year in 2020, marking a departure from decades of growth in coal-fired power. Still, the fuel accounts for nearly three-fourths of India's annual power output. Environmental activists have long rallied against India adding new coal-fired capacity. Solar and wind energy prices are falling to record lows, which would help the world's third-largest greenhouse gas emitter cut emissions. US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry this month said India was ""getting the job done on climate, pushing the curve"", as he began talks with government leaders aimed at cutting carbon emissions faster to slow global warming. But a 28-page February draft of the National Electricity Policy (NEP) 2021 - which has not been made public - showed India may add new coal-fired capacity, though it recommended tighter technology standards to reduce pollution. ""While India is committed to add more capacity through non-fossil sources of generation, coal-based generation capacity may still be required to be added in the country as it continues to be the cheapest source of generation,"" the NEP draft read. All future coal-based plants should only deploy so-called ""ultra super critical"" less polluting technologies ""or other more efficient technology"", it added. State-run NTPC, India's top electricity producer, said in September it will not acquire land for new coal-fired projects. Private firms and many run by states across the country have not invested in new coal-fired plants for years saying they were not economically viable. A source with direct knowledge said a government panel of various power sector experts and officials will discuss the draft and could make changes before seeking cabinet approval. India's power ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday (Apr 18). The draft document also proposed trade of renewable energy in day-ahead markets, creating separate tariffs for electric vehicle charging stations and privatizing electricity distribution companies. ALTERNATE POWER SOURCES The NEP 2021 is India's first attempt at revising its electricity policy enacted in 2005, when the country produced negligible renewable energy. Experts say phasing in renewable energy sources and phasing out conventional sources such as coal and natural gas rapidly could lead to instability in the electricity grid, potentially causing blackouts. While suggesting flexible use of coal-fired and natural gas-fired power to ensure grid stability in the coming years, the draft policy lists promoting clean power as its primary objective. The policy draft suggested expediting adoption of ""cost effective"" pumped hydro storage to support the electricity grid, adding that only 4.8 gigawatts (GW) of a potential 96.5 GW of pumped storage capacity has been developed so far. The policy also recommends compensating natural gas-fired plants for operating at reduced efficiency to ensure grid stability, and for suffering higher wear and tear due to fluctuations in generation."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/investor-group-calls-banks-set-tougher-climate-targets-1883391,Investor group calls for banks to set tougher climate targets,"LONDON: A group of investors managing US$11 trillion in assets has called on banks to set tougher emissions targets ahead of a meeting of world leaders aimed at accelerating efforts to fight climate change. The group, which includes Pimco, the world's biggest bond investor, and Britain's biggest asset manager, Legal & General Investment Management, said they wanted lenders to set ""enhanced"" pledges to decarbonise their lending books. While a number of the world's biggest banks have already said they have an ""ambition"" to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, many have yet to specify how they plan to do so and continue to fund heavy emitting activities. ""The problem we face today is that too many banks are failing to consider climate harm when they make financing decisions, and too much money is being ploughed into carbon-intensive activities that we so desperately need to move away from,"" said Natasha Landell-Mills, Head of Stewardship at Sarasin & Partners. As the United States gears up to host the Apr 22 to Apr 23 Leaders Summit on Climate, the investor group said it wanted banks to speed up their efforts, including by setting interim targets to get to net-zero emissions by mid-century or sooner. Bank remuneration committees should also ensure that variable pay is tied to hitting the targets, they added, while material climate risks should be included in the lenders' published accounts. A number of banks have already said they plan to increase investment in green energy and other activities that will help in the transition to a low-carbon economy, but the investor group said more was needed and the spend should not be considered as offsetting lending to dirtier projects. Crucially, the investors said banks also needed to set ""explicit criteria"" for the withdrawal of financing to ""misaligned"" activities that run counter to the net zero pathway of sectors and industries. The group of 35 investors, operating through the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, said it had opened talks with 27 of the world's largest banks and expected to expand the list over time."

Australia said in December it could beat its target for cutting carbon emissions under the Paris climate agreement by 2030 without counting credits from overachieving on its targets in previous climate pacts, marking a shift in policy for one of the world's biggest emitters per capita. Under the agreement, South Australia will provide A$422 million and the federal government will spend A$660 million, A$400 million of which will be spent on ""priority areas"" such as carbon storage, electric vehicles, hydrogen and other projects aiming at reducing emissions. ""Families and businesses need affordable, reliable power. That is what reduces prices and creates jobs,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison said during a televised briefing while announcing the agreement. ""Australians also want to ensure we are doing everything we responsibly can to combat climate change."" Premier of South Australia Steven Marshall said the deal will also help to deliver the infrastructure needed for electric cars and to generate new revenue for farmers from carbon reductions. ""This agreement is going to lower power bills for South Australians and create jobs in the fast-growing renewables industry,"" Marshall said. But the agreement was criticised by Mark Butler, who worked as minister for climate change under a previous Labor government. ""What we get is, bit by bit, little bits of announcements in particular states instead of a comprehensive national policy that will underpin investor certainty to transition Australia's energy future,"" said Butler, currently the shadow minister of health."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/climate-change-activist-youth-action-rally-government-carbon-tax-1883216,Commentary: Work of Singapore climate activists has only just begun,"SINGAPORE: To many, activism comes across as a somewhat polarising term – reminiscent of bell-bottom wearing, placard-carrying protestors and demonstrators seen during the flower-power activists’ days of the 1960s and 1970s. But climate change has changed how activism is looked at in many parts of the world. Now that the world is more aware of the dangers of climate change and the need for stronger action, people are starting to better appreciate the role of activists in helping to create that future. The diverse faces of climate activism, from students like Greta Thunberg to actors like Leonardo DiCaprio and politicians like Al Gore, show that anyone could contribute to climate activism. A similar shift is now happening in Singapore, with young students and working adults alike founding a new wave of climate advocacy groups. While we did not physically attend Singapore’s first climate rally in 2019, the passion for activism that the rally sparked in our peers is still palpable today. If individual actions won’t move the needle on climate change, what will? Find out what climate activists are pushing for on The Climate Conversations:   THE NEED FOR CLIMATE ACTIVISM IN SINGAPORE To be fair, activists have not been alone in this fight. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s 2019 National Day Rally highlighted how Singapore stood on the precipice of an “existential threat”.  Since then, the Government has committed to halving emissions by 2050 and reaching net-zero emissions as soon as practicable thereafter. This target has been supported by the introduction of a carbon tax, and initiatives within the recently announced Green Plan, like the electrification of our vehicle fleet and introduction of green bonds. But more can be done. The work of activists is far from over when resistance to climate action remains strong. We can see these tensions in the debates over the future of our petrochemical industry and over carbon taxes. Our society remains unwilling to transition away from such sectors for economic reasons, despite their major contribution to our emissions. Public resistance to carbon taxes is strong, as people fear their impact on costs of living. A conversation on trade-offs must be had, but there is no denying we are not doing our fair share as a developed nation, or maximising Singapore’s chances of survival. We cannot afford such intransigence nor take a gradual, wait-and-see approach. This is where activism can play a role. 
  CLIMATE ACTIVISTS PLAY A KEY BRIDGING ROLE Climate activists play a crucial and bridging role of calling for climate action, while addressing Singaporeans’ bread-and-butter concerns and ensuring that no one is left behind. Climate groups such as SG Climate Rally have suggested redistributing carbon tax revenues to defray increased costs of living, and have campaigned against the increase in petrol taxes due to their impact on taxi drivers and delivery riders.  Activists have also demanded support for local workers retrenched by petrochemical companies like Exxon and Shell. Since 2019, climate activists have made progress in raising awareness of such issues. The organisation we work with, Singapore Youth for Climate Action, recently organised the Singapore Conference of Youths (SCOY) last January to educate approximately 60 participants about climate issues and to encourage them to co-create solutions. Policy proposals and ideas were compiled into a working paper which would feed into the international organisation YOUNGO’s work with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). 
  Other initiatives have translated awareness into advocacy. For instance, SG Climate Rally and Speak For Climate have published a scorecard of political parties’ stances on climate change. Such work has been channelled through community-organised town halls to members of Parliament. CHALLENGES FACED BY CLIMATE ACTIVISTS But many climate groups barely have enough volunteers to run awareness-raising programmes, and have little funding to hire full-time staff to manage them, let alone engage corporations and the government. Founding members of such groups often have little choice but to engage government agencies and members of Parliament on climate issues on an ad-hoc basis, even as they manage their groups while juggling full-time jobs. They also do so without the support of a dedicated policy research team. Such groups could benefit from more volunteers, as well as funding from private individuals and foundations, to run advocacy programmes and carry out needed research to inform policy advocacy. With such funding, climate groups could also augment their capabilities to develop a coherent policy platform to champion. In the United States, policy advocacy groups like the Sunrise Movement focus their efforts on pushing through specific legislation that deal simultaneously with inequality and climate change, like the Green New Deal. 
  For a start, climate groups could dive into individual industry sectors, such as petrochemicals, and champion specific alternative economic strategies for each sector.  Some activists with backgrounds in finance aim to better understand sustainable finance in Singapore, so that they can push for specific proposals to encourage its growth. Such efforts would benefit from the participation of industry experts sympathetic to the climate cause. There is precedent for the effectiveness of expert help in activism. Local nature conservation groups often consist of and work with academics specialising in biological sciences. Such experts help climate groups better understand the impacts of seemingly innocuous development projects on local wildlife. 
  KEEPING THE SPIRIT OF ACTIVISM ALIVE Despite the challenges and the uphill task ahead, climate activists like me feel duty-bound to continue fighting for our goals.  It is important to have an inner drive that endures the bitter moments, rather than waiting for a sweet taste of success, which can be sporadic or slow. We started our journey into climate activism slowly, in order to avoid disappointment or burnout.  First we changed our habits to lead a more climate-friendly lifestyle. We then started talking with our friends and family about the need for climate action, advocated for it on social media, attended events and volunteered to run them. We signed petitions and wrote in to news outlets and MPs and worked through town halls. And eventually, groups like the Nature Society Singapore were consulted by the Government on Environmental Impact Assessments for the Cross-Island Line and deployment of solar panels on reservoirs. Recent events also give us hope that we can mobilise more Singaporeans to be part of the climate movement.  The fact that Singaporeans rallied for the preservation of Dover and Clementi forests, and expressed outrage at the deforestation along the Rail Corridor in Kranji, shows how nature holds a special place in our hearts. This concern for our biodiversity and natural resources can be channelled into something greater – the concern for the planet’s health, our place in it and our duty in creating this green transition. Many years ago, our parents’ generation of nature lovers and climate activists worked hard to preserve Singapore’s green spaces, like Chek Jawa. We are running out of time to protect Singapore from climate change; let us not let their hard work go to waste. Terese Teoh is a volunteer with Singapore Youth for Climate Action."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sustainable-tourism-singapore-challenges-sentosa-hotels-219891,Challenges and opportunities as Singapore targets becoming a sustainable tourism destination,"SINGAPORE: While Singapore will face challenges as it tries to become a sustainable tourism destination, industry players and experts are confident that it can meet such a target. Speaking to CNA, Mr Christopher Khoo, the managing director for international tourism consultancy Masterconsult Services, said the move would be the “responsible” thing to do. “I applaud Singapore's decision to embrace this whole concept of sustainability in tourism, because that’s I think not only the right way to go, it is the responsible thing to do,” he said. The move is one of the 2030 targets under the green economy - one of the five key pillars in the Singapore Green Plan unveiled earlier this year. ""Ten years from now, we also expect that global tourism will have sprung back into a more vibrant sector. Tourists will have a greater interest in sustainable travel options, for example, eco-friendly hotels and attractions,"" said Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing in his speech in Parliament during the Joint Segment on Sustainability last month. ""To prepare ourselves for these opportunities, we are transforming Sentosa into a carbon-neutral destination by 2030. Through such efforts, we will strengthen Singapore as an exemplary sustainable tourism destination,"" he said. Said Mr Khoo: “On the whole, sustainable tourism is something that is becoming increasingly important. In tourism, it's not something new … Sustainability has become more and more important, people are recognising the need to be responsible.” According to the Singapore Tourism Board (STB), there were also 19.1 million visitors to Singapore in 2019, with these visitors spending a total of S$27.1 billion in tourism receipts. 
  As defined by the World Tourism Organisation (UNTWO), sustainable tourism should incorporate three main objectives. These include making “optimal use” of environmental resources as well as helping to conserve natural heritage and biodiversity. In addition, this form of tourism should also respect the socio-cultural authenticity of host communities, said UNTWO on its website. It also needs to ensure viable, long-term economic operations, providing socio-economic benefits to all stakeholders that are “fairly distributed”. Noting that achieving sustainable tourism is a “continuous process”, tourism expert Shirley Tee said that such a destination should also include “curated meaningful experiences” that allow a tourist to understand and be aware of sustainability issues within the community, as well as incorporate activities that promote the destination country’s economy “Efforts to protect and preserve our economic real estate can also be tied in with our journey towards being a sustainable tourism destination. For instance, ensuring that built-up areas with older buildings and our unique heritage be retained and not discarded due to economic pressure will help us preserve the social and urban fabric of the nation,” added Ms Tee, who is a senior manager at Nanyang Polytechnic’s (NYP) School of Business Management.  “This also creates additional sustainable tourism avenues for tourists to visit, and learn more about.” MORE DISCERNING TRAVELLERS Mr Khoo noted that travellers have now become “more discerning” in their choice of service providers in the country they visit. One of the ways in which they do this is to look for sustainably sourced products or products sourced locally. 
  “As more travellers are aware of the importance of sustainability, they will look out for products that are eco-friendly and purchase from businesses that embrace sustainability.  Singapore as a destination cannot ignore sustainability and it makes business sense to embrace it,” said Ngee Ann Polytechnic senior lecturer in tourism Michael Chiam. “Many Singapore tourism-related businesses are already embracing the sustainable initiatives. What businesses can do is to dive deeper into adopting more and more sustainable processes in their businesses.” Dr Kevin Cheong, who is chairman of the Association of Singapore Attractions, said local attractions can start with simple things, such as questioning whether brochures or tickets are necessary. “At the same time not just the existing attractions but the new attractions coming on stream, they should start building their attractions in a conscious manner, in that deliberate manner. Design for sustainability,” he added. Last month, Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) announced the resort island would be transformed into a carbon-neutral destination by 2030. This would be a ""key goal"" in its long-term sustainability plan, it said. ""It is possible for Sentosa to lead the way in reducing its carbon emissions and trialling new solutions, given the unique island environment and SDC being a single precinct operator working hand in hand with the community on Sentosa,"" it said in a press release. ""SDC will identify and work with technology partners to testbed sustainable technologies and concepts on Sentosa, while also bringing on board some 200 businesses within Sentosa to work towards the aspiration of island carbon neutrality."" Ms Kwee Wei-Lin, who is the president of the Singapore Hotel Association (SHA), said that to ""safeguard"" the future of the hotel industry, sustainability is the key to long term success.  Ways in which hotels can and have chipped in to do their part include providing recycling bins in guest rooms, filtered water taps in guest rooms instead of plastic bottled water, as well as a paperless check-in and check-out process, she said. ""Greening the supply chain is also an important part of our journey towards sustainable tourism,"" Ms Kwee said. ""Hotels can work with vendors to use environmentally-friendly packaging materials, request for suppliers to minimise packaging for their deliveries, provide eco-friendly products, which could range from office supplies to furniture and paints to cleaning products, as well as to source from sustainable food sources."" In addition, SHA has also established the Hotel Sustainability Committee (HSC) which comprise both private and public sector representatives, who will ""conceptualise solutions and strategies that bring together sustainability and commercial value"", she added. At the same time, Mr Khoo noted that Singapore would also need to hold itself up to a particular set of standards as it tries to achieve its goal.  “Different countries have got different accreditation schemes … These accreditation schemes are usually very specific to regions or destinations,” he said. While Singapore may not be “specific” enough for such a tailored scheme, these schemes are very important in the area of sustainability, he added. “Because you cannot just say, I want to do well, you should measure yourself against a standard.” “There is still a lack of awareness and wide adoption of sustainable practices. While there is a blueprint, there is no clear assimilation for the hospitality and tourism organisations on the dos and don’ts,” said Ms Tee. “What we need now is targeted initiatives to increase the understanding of sustainable practices and clear guidelines for execution.” At STB's annual industry conference last week, its chief executive Keith Tan said that it would be approaching industry players over the coming months to share its thoughts on developing strategies and a roadmap for destination sustainability. 
  “Ultimately, we don’t just want to be known as a sustainable destination, but as a great location for companies to test bed sustainable tourism solutions,” Mr Tan had said, citing examples such as a net zero-carbon hotel or entertainment event. A LOT OF 'PLUSES' At the STB conference, Mr Chan said that Singapore’s tourism sector will also have to capture opportunities in the shift towards sustainability. While Singapore might not be able to compete with other “eco-destinations” given its land scarcity and lack of natural landscapes, the country’s value proposition comes from “the intangibles”, he said. “We want to be the best place to test bed sustainable solutions, new products and new experiences, enabling businesses from around the world to launch first-to-market solutions and innovations, right here in Singapore,” said Mr Chan. Mr Khoo noted that Singapore has a number of “pluses” which it can use to its advantage, even though it is not typically seen as a nature destination. “Being clean and green is a big advantage. We've always had that. And then we've got the advantage of having four superb nature parks … We do have a very soft side, and that in the part is actually going to be pushed a little bit more when the Mandai area is further developed,” he added. “So we've got a very balanced product in that sense, in terms of saying that we are also sustainable.” Dr Chiam noted that Singapore is not new to the area of sustainability. “We have hosted many world-renowned sustainability events such as World Cities Summit, Singapore International Water Day and Singapore International Energy Week ... This makes Singapore a sustainable destination from the MICE perspective,” he said. “The challenge is how to translate this knowledge to something easily adopted by local businesses. The Singapore Green Plan 2030 is a good vehicle to drive awareness among local businesses on the importance of embracing the sustainability movement.”  Dr Chiam also noted that there are a number of “success stories” when it comes to sustainability among businesses in the tourism industry. “These stories can act as a catalyst to inspire other businesses to join the sustainability movement,” he added.   FACING UP TO COSTS  At the same time, associated costs could be an issue as Singapore strives to achieve this goal, said experts. “I think cost or managing costs will always be an issue, as Singapore looks to implement different standards, for instance, it will just mean that our businesses have to adhere to something that in the future will become more important,” said Mr Khoo. He noted that given how the COVID-19 pandemic has brought travel to a halt, now would be an opportune time to implement some changes. “Everybody's minds are very malleable, we're in a very plastic situation, you set us in the right direction, it will stand us in good stead 10, 20 years from now,"" he explained NYP’s Ms Tee noted that the S$68.5 million that the Government will pump into the Tourism Development Fund for businesses looking to test-bed sustainable tourism offerings is a “good sign” that Singapore is moving in the right direction. At the same time, Dr Cheong pointed out that attraction operators would need help from the Government even as they seek to become more sustainable in the way they operate. “(Cost) is where we hope the Government can give us a leg up,” he said.  “COVID-19 has hit us deep in the core, our financial core. Many smaller attractions, SME (small- and medium-size enterprises) attractions may not have the financial appetite ... But I think if we do it collectively, in a single-minded manner, with government support, I think we can make a difference.”  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/climatechange/apple-forestry-fund-reduce-carbon-climate-change-1883376,Apple announces US$200 million forestry fund to reduce carbon,"SAN FRANCISCO: Apple on Thursday (Apr 15) announced a US$200 million fund to invest in timber-producing commercial forestry projects, with the goal of removing carbon from the atmosphere while also generating profit. The Restore Fund, launched in partnership with Conservation International and Goldman Sachs, expected to have its first projects targeted later this year. ""Nature provides some of the best tools to remove carbon from the atmosphere,"" Apple vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives Lisa Jackson said in a statement. ""Through creating a fund that generates both a financial return as well as real, and measurable carbon impacts, we aim to drive broader change in the future - encouraging investment in carbon removal around the globe."" Forests draw in carbon from the air, storing it away and stopping the gas from contributing to climate change. The fund aims to remove one million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually from the atmosphere, equal to the amount spewed by more than 200,000 passenger vehicles. Apple said last year it would become carbon neutral by 2030 for all its operations, including manufacturing. The California-based iPhone maker said its goal was to have no climate impact for all its devices sold. ""Investing in nature can remove carbon far more effectively - and much sooner - than any other current technology,"" Conservation International chief executive M Sanjayan said in a joint release. ""As the world faces the global threat climate change presents, we need innovative new approaches that can dramatically reduce emissions."" Also on Thursday, Google unveiled a time-lapse feature to its Google Earth service that provides a satellite view of the world. The new feature is based on tens of millions of satellite images from the past 37 years to enable users to see in rich detail how the face of the planet has changed. ""Time-lapse in Google Earth is about zooming out to assess the health and well-being of our only home, and is a tool that can educate and inspire action,"" the company said in a blog post. ""Visual evidence can cut to the core of the debate in a way that words cannot and communicate complex issues to everyone."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/climatechange/dbs-bank-zero-thermal-coal-exposure-2039-1883371,DBS Bank commits to zero thermal coal exposure by 2039,"SINGAPORE: Singapore’s DBS Bank has committed to zero thermal coal exposure by 2039, as part of “continued efforts to tackle climate change and work towards a lower carbon future”, it said on Friday (Apr 16). To achieve this goal, the bank will cease the onboarding of new customers who derive more than 25 per cent of their revenue from thermal coal. This will take effect immediately. It will also stop financing customers who derive more than 50 per cent of revenue from thermal coal from January 2026, except for their non-thermal coal or renewable energy activities. These thresholds will be lowered over time, the bank said. 
  As part of its plans, DBS bank will leverage its framework to achieve “meaningful decarbonisation” in sectors that remain reliant on thermal coal. “This will be conducted through engagements with customers to establish their transition strategies, and the incorporation of greenhouse gas reduction targets in all applicable sustainability linked loan structures,” said the bank. It will also disclose its thermal coal exposure annually in its sustainability report. DBS in 2018 issued a statement to restrict financing to only coal-fired power projects that adopt more advanced technologies which emit lower carbon emissions, and to stop financing new thermal coal mining projects. This was followed by a blanket cease in financing any new coal power assets in April 2019. At the same time, the bank increased its exposure to renewable energy projects at S$4.2 billion in 2020, up from S$2.85 billion in the preceding year. 
  Ms Tan Su Shan, group head of institutional banking at DBS Bank, said: “Every year counts in the journey towards a low-carbon future and we recognise the increasing need for transition financing to help industries gradually navigate away from brown to green. “In turn, renewable energy will increasingly take centre stage as a core component in the world’s transition towards net-zero. “To spur the development of renewables, we have upped the ante on financing projects by leading energy players in the region with the aim to scale the reach and supply of renewable energy in the near future. I believe that our commitments will result in substantial impact in the years to come.” 
  DBS recently committed to ensuring net-zero operational carbon emissions across the bank by 2022. It has also committed to using 100 per cent renewable energy for its Singapore operations by 2030. Last year, the bank increased its operational energy consumption from renewables across its key markets to 21 per cent of the bank’s total energy consumption, up from 14 per cent in 2019. “In January 2021, DBS raised its sustainable finance target to S$50 billion by 2024, accelerating its sustainability agenda in helping customers incorporate sustainable business practices into their overall business strategy. This reinforces DBS’ efforts in responsible banking which is a key pillar of the bank’s approach to sustainability,” said the bank."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/climatechange/bhp-first-refuelling-ship-biofuel-mpa-singapore-port-1883366,BHP completes its first refuelling of a ship with biofuel,"SINGAPORE: BHP Group said on Thursday (Apr 15) it completed its first refuelling of a ship with biofuel this month in a trial run that is part of its efforts to reduce carbon emissions. It was also the first time that a ship has been refuelled with biofuel in Singapore, the world's largest bunkering hub. A biofuel blend derived from certified sustainable feedstock sources such as cooking oil, crude tall oil and sewage sludge was used on Apr 4 to refuel the 81,000 deadweight tonne dry bulk carrier Kira Oldendorff which was on its way from Australia to Europe. 
  The blend required no significant modifications to the engine or other components, a BHP spokesman said. The mining giant is exploring the use of bunker fuels such as liquefied natural gas and biofuels to replace fuel oil, aiming to reduce carbon emissions by 40 per cent when shipping its products as part of the company's climate change goals for 2030. The biofuel blend used is said to reduce well-to-exhaust carbon dioxide emissions by 80 per cent to 90 per cent compared with conventional residual fuel oils, BHP said in a statement. The spokesman said enough was loaded to trial the biofuel over a number of days, a significant portion of the vessel's voyage. He declined to comment on the price of the biofuel, citing a confidentiality agreement. The shipping industry is examining a range of technologies as it looks to meet an International Maritime Organization target of a 50 per cent reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2008 levels by 2050. Consultancy Wood Mackenzie says global demand for oil-based marine fuels is set to fall in the next three decades as stricter carbon emissions rules for the shipping industry kick in and alternative fuel use climbs. The biofuel was supplied by Netherlands-based GoodFuels in partnership with German shipping group Oldendorff Carriers and the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore. ""This trial marks the start of a process for GoodFuels of facilitating more structural supply of sustainable marine biofuels in Singapore, in a commercial, operational and technically feasible manner,"" Isabel Welten, chief commercial officer at GoodFuels, said in the statement."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/climatechange/climate-change-indian-monsoon-stronger-more-erratic-rain-floods-1883356,"Climate change makes Indian monsoon stronger, more erratic: Study","PARIS: Climate change is making India's monsoon stronger and more chaotic, scientists said on Wednesday (Apr 14), warning of potential severe consequences for food, farming and the economy affecting nearly a fifth of the world's population. A new analysis comparing more than 30 climate models from around the world predicts more extremely wet rainy seasons, which sweep in from the sea from roughly June to September each year. Researchers at the Potsdam-Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) found strong evidence that every degree Celsius of warming would likely increase monsoon rainfall by about 5 per cent. The study not only confirmed trends seen in previous research, but found ""global warming is increasing monsoon rainfall in India even more than previously thought"", said lead author Anja Katzenberger, also of Ludwig Maximilian University. ""It is dominating monsoon dynamics in the 21st century."" This raises the possibility that key crops - including rice - could be swamped during crucial growing stages. 
  Moreover, the monsoon is likely to become more erratic as warming increases, according to the study, published in the journal Earth System Dynamics. ""Since Indian society is overall affected by the monsoon in a very strong way, stronger variability produces problems for agriculture, but also for the organisation of public life,"" said Anders Levermann from PIK and Columbia University. ""If your roads are flooded, if your train tracks are flooded, that inhibits economic productivity."" He said the year-to-year variability would also complicate strategies to cope with the increasing strength of the rainy season. ""More chaos in the Indian monsoon rainfall will make it harder to adapt,"" he told AFP. CLIMATE IMPACTS The research tracked dramatic shifts in the monsoon from the mid-20th century, when human-driven alterations began to overtake the slower natural changes that occur over millennia. Initially, air pollution from aerosols - which largely reflect sunlight and act to subdue warming - caused monsoon rainfall to decrease. But then, from the 1980s, the warming effects of greenhouse gases began to dominate, driving stronger and more volatile rainy seasons, the researchers said. The planet's average surface temperature has gone up 1.1 degrees Celsius on average compared to the late 19th-century, with much of that warming occurring in the last half-century. 
  The 2015 Paris Agreement enjoins the world's nations to collectively cap global warming at ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius, and even 1.5 degrees Celsius if feasible - although experts say that target is fast slipping out of reach. Last year, five of the most costly extreme weather events in the world were related to Asia's unusually rainy monsoon, according to a tally by the charity Christian Aid. Intense flooding in China and India, where the monsoon season brought abnormal amounts of rainfall for the second year running, are consistent with projections on how climate will impact precipitation. In 2013, about 6,000 people died when flash floods and landslides swept away entire villages in the Indian state of Uttarakhand as rivers swollen by monsoon rains overflowed."

""We are working very hard to ensure we deliver an in-person COP, which allows all countries to participate on an equal footing,"" Alok Sharma told parliament. ""This is incredibly important as many parties feel strongly that negotiations must be in person,"" Sharma said. The November summit in Glasgow, Scotland, was originally due to be held in 2020, but had to be postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
  Asked if the summit would go ahead, Sharma said: ""COP26 has already been postponed by one year and the urgency of the climate crisis has not abated."" ""I don't sense any desire amongst parties for a further postponement and we're working very hard to ensure that we have an in-person physical COP, taking into account of course any COVID-related contingencies,"" he said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/deployment-eu-electric-vehicle-charging-stations-too-slow-auditors-say-1883346,"Deployment of EU electric vehicle charging stations too slow, auditors say","BRUSSELS: The European Union's deployment of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles is not quick enough to meet the bloc's targets, EU auditors said on Tuesday (Apr 13). The European Court of Auditors (ECA) looked at how the European Commission supports member states in expanding electrical charging infrastructure as well as how it manages EU funding. It found that availability of public charging stations varies significantly between member states and that payment systems are not harmonised, forcing drivers to use multiple subscriptions or payment methods to charge their cars if they travel in different EU countries. ""Last year, one in every 10 cars sold in the EU was electrically chargeable, but charging infrastructure is unevenly accessible across the EU,"" said Ladislav Balko, the ECA member responsible for the report. The Commission has set a target to have 1 million charging points by 2025 and is aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transport by 90 per cent from 1990 levels by 2050. The number of charging points in the 27 EU nations and the UK increased by roughly 36,000 a year from about 34,000 in 2014 to 250,000 in September 2020. There is a significant risk that the target of 1 million public charging points by 2025 would be missed if deployment continues to follow current trends, the auditors said. About 150,000 new points would be needed each year - almost 3,000 a week - to close the gap. Carmakers forecast a sixfold increase in production of electric vehicles in Europe between 2019 and 2025, reaching more than 4 million cars and vans a year, representing more than a fifth of EU car production volumes. The European Commission, meanwhile, has set a target of at least 30 million zero-emission vehicles by 2030 and a largely zero-emission vehicle fleet by 2050. That compares with roughly two million currently registered in the EU. Auditors drove more than 2,000km in an electric vehicle between Germany, France and Italy to test EU co-funded charging infrastructure. Overall, they said their experience was positive and they managed to charge their cars in all the stations. But their report warned that drivers lack real-time data, such as information on which chargers on their route are faulty or have long queues. About a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions in the EU come from transport, predominantly (72 per cent) through road transport."

All banks with total assets of more than NZ$1 billion (US$703 million), insurers with more than NZ$1 billion in total assets under management, and all equity and debt issuers listed on the country's stock exchange will have to make disclosures. ""We simply cannot get to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 unless the financial sector knows what impact their investments are having on the climate,"" Shaw said in a statement. ""This law will bring climate risks and resilience into the heart of financial and business decision making."" The Bill, which has been introduced to the country's parliament and is expected to receive its first reading this week, requires financial firms to explain how they would manage climate-related risks and opportunities. Around 200 of the country's biggest companies and several foreign firms that meet the NZ$1 billion threshold will come under the legislation. Disclosures will be required for financial years beginning next year once the law is passed, meaning that the first reports will be made by companies in 2023. 
  The New Zealand government last September said it would make the financial sector report on climate risks and those unable to disclose would have to explain their reasons. The New Zealand government has introduced several policies to lower emissions during its second term, including promising to make its pubic sector carbon-neutral by 2025 and buy only zero-emissions public transport buses from the middle of this decade. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who returned to power last October delivering the biggest election victory for her centre-left Labour Party in half a century, had called climate change the ""nuclear free moment of our generation"". "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/climatechange/french-lawmakers-approve-ban-short-domestic-flights-carbon-1883336,French lawmakers approve a ban on short domestic flights to cut carbon emissions,"PARIS: French lawmakers voted late on Saturday (Apr 10) to abolish domestic flights on routes than can be covered by train in under two-and-a-half hours, as the government seeks to lower carbon emissions even as the air travel industry reels from the global pandemic. The measure is part of a broader climate Bill that aims to cut French carbon emissions by 40 per cent in 2030 from 1990 levels, though activists accuse President Emmanuel Macron of watering down earlier promises in the draft legislation. The vote came days after the state said it would contribute to a 4 billion euro (US$4.76 billion) recapitalisation of Air France, more than doubling its stake in the flagship carrier, to shore up its finances after over a year of COVID-19 travel curbs. Industry Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher dismissed criticism from the aviation industry that a pandemic recovery was not the time to ban some domestic flights, and said there was no contradiction between the bailout and the climate Bill. 
  ""We know that aviation is a contributor of carbon dioxide and that because of climate change we must reduce emissions,"" she told Europe 1 radio. ""Equally, we must support our companies and not let them fall by the wayside."" Air traffic may not return to pre-crisis levels before 2024, McKinsey analysts forecast. Some environmental campaigners have said the bill does not go far enough. A citizens' climate forum established by Macron to help shape climate policy had called for the scrapping of flights on routes where the train journey is less than four hours. Saturday night's vote in the National Assembly was the first. The Bill goes to the Senate before a third and final vote in the lower house, where Macron's ruling party and allies dominate."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/pub-coastal-inland-flood-model-climate-change-nus-1883331,PUB starts development of coastal-inland flood model which will help assess flood risks,"SINGAPORE: Singapore’s national water agency PUB has started work on a new coastal-inland flood model, which will enable it to better assess the impact of climate change on Singapore’s coastal areas. The model, which is capable of simulating and evaluating both inland and coastal flood risks, will be developed “based on Singapore’s densely built-up and urbanised environment”, PUB said on Friday (Apr 9). It will also “enable holistic flood risk assessment by estimating the combined effects of extreme sea levels and inland floods caused by intense rainfall”. It will consist of two independent models – a coastal model and an inland model – which can run separately or together to carry out flood risk analysis for different scenarios. The coastal model will be equipped to simulate potential changes in nearshore waves and storm surge activities within the region under different climate change scenarios. Meanwhile, the inland model will be capable of simulating urban flooding caused by different sources, including heavy rainfall, and their interactions with sea levels. PUB added that advanced modelling techniques will also be used to enhance accuracy and speed in simulating rainfall-induced flows within Singapore’s water catchments. 
  “The model will aid PUB in the planning of coastal adaptation measures, to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed coastal protection infrastructure, as well as for operations management,” the agency said. “In the near term, the model will also be able to support the upcoming site-specific studies, starting with the City-East Coast and Jurong island.” A study completed in 2019 had identified the City-East Coast and Jurong Island coastlines to be more vulnerable and critical based on factors such as the potential impact of a flood event, given critical assets there such as airports and economic districts. NUS-LED CONSORTIUM The model will be developed by a consortium led by the National University of Singapore (NUS), with management solutions provider Hydroinformatics Institute (H2i) – which has previously worked with PUB on its rainfall monitoring and predicting system – as a partner. 
  Development will take about four years, PUB said, adding that it will be “continually updated and improved along with new climate data and developments in climate science”. Philip Liu, Distinguished Professor in the NUS Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, will lead the project team. “In anticipating continued climate changes, the development of a Coastal-Inland Flood Model is timely and will help to safeguard both our coastlines and our collective future against severe weather and rising sea levels,” said Prof Liu, who is internationally recognised for his work on coastal engineering and wave modelling. He has been instrumental in developing tsunami and coastal disaster resilience technology in Taiwan and the South China Sea region. PUB will also work closely with the teams from NUS and H2i during the entire project duration to share their experience with existing modelling systems, it added. “This will also allow PUB to build new expertise in-house to develop, test and validate coastal protection technologies and concepts,” the agency said. “When completed, PUB will be equipped to operate the model and make future enhancements to it when needed.” Ms Hazel Khoo, director of PUB’s Coastal Protection Department said it aims to “enhance capabilities and deepen our expertise in modelling to support coastal protection efforts from now and into the future” through the project. “Given the uncertainties in climate science, protecting our coastlines will always be a work-in-progress, but we aim to stay ahead of the curve,” she said."

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/hydrogen-power-renewable-green-lobbying-oil-gas-company-climate-1883301,Commentary: Why is hydrogen becoming such an attractive clean energy source?,"ABERDEEN, Scotland: Hydrogen is often touted in the scientific and general media as a silver bullet for reaching net-zero emissions. Such articles might include the following claims: It’s the most common element on Earth. It can be synthesised from electricity and water. It can be stored and used to produce heat and electricity. It provides energy without harmful carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions as it burns to water. When liquefied the energy per unit weight is superior to fossil fuels. It can deliver power via a fuel cell. It can be transported using the existing gas grid. It burns at a similar temperature to natural gas. Although I could put a “but” after all of the above, hydrogen presents a compelling case for its widespread use to support net zero. So, what’s not to like about it? 
  HYDROGEN DOESN’T COME FOR FREE Although hydrogen is the most common element in the universe it does not come for free. It is bound up in compounds such as fossil fuels and water and requires energy to break the chemical bonds to release it. It is not energy efficient: For every three units of energy provided by hydrogen you have to put one unit of energy in. But hydrogen receives so much interest because it fits many business models. Fossil companies like it because it will be derived from fossil fuels for the next decade or more. Gas grid operators and gas boiler manufacturers see hydrogen as their only survival route as fossil fuel burning is being phased out. And the power utility companies also like it as they’ll be able to sell more power thanks to hydrogen inefficiencies. THE HYDROGEN PROMOTION INDUSTRY Hydrogen is being pushed in the UK by various highly influential groups. These include an advisory council – jointly chaired by the government and Shell – an industry taskforce and a cross-party group of MPs and peers, the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Hydrogen. The APPG is sponsored by fossil fuel companies, gas grid operators, gas boiler manufacturers and power companies. These are organisations that will benefit from the adoption of hydrogen. The group has put out a very favourable report. 
  There is nothing new or wrong in big business promoting their service or product, as they are mandated by their shareholders to turn a profit. Yet these groupings promote hydrogen in near isolation and do not fully present the benefits in comparison with other net-zero heat and power options, for example electrification or biofuels. In this isolated context it is easy for politicians to be seduced with “What’s not to like about hydrogen?” Academics at Exeter and Imperial universities recently investigated this hydrogen bias in the UK heat sector. Their study concluded that “Incumbents [actors within the heat sector] are overselling ‘green-gas’ to policymakers in order to protect their interests and detract from the importance and value of electrification.” 
  The APPG’s recently issued call for evidence on the role of hydrogen in powering industry may be perceived as an example of such bias. The group’s chairman, Jacob Young MP, said it wanted to hear from all relevant businesses and authorities to “understand what needs to be done to ensure that hydrogen plays a crucial role in industrial decarbonisation”. So the outcome of the evidence is pre-prescribed to “ensure hydrogen plays a crucial role”. To my mind that is deeply troubling as it gives no scope for providing evidence for the many drawbacks. For example, it will cost much more to provide heat and power with hydrogen when compared with electrification, since inefficiencies mean you have to use much more hydrogen than electricity. In a tweet on Jan 9, 2021, Young congratulated Kwasi Kwarteng for his appointment to UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Young added, “As chair of the Hydrogen APPG, I can say with confidence that Kwasi is a great friend of hydrogen and our agenda for green energy.” It looks as if Kwasi Kwarteng, the government minister in charge of business and energy, is facing a lot of encouragement. (How will importing electricity from Malaysia help with Singapore's quest for cleaner energy? Find out on The Climate Conversations.)    HYDROGEN HAS A ROLE IN REACHING NET ZERO Even a relative hydrogen sceptic like me realises that it will have a role in reaching net zero. Hydrogen is a very useful building block for a range of chemicals that benefit society, none more so than ammonia which is used to produce fertiliser and help feed the planet. So our first hydrogen action should be to decarbonise current CO2-emitting hydrogen production. Hydrogen may also find applications in heavy haulage, aviation, shipping and high temperature industrial processes. Let’s identify where hydrogen is to be used from “people, profit and planet” evidence and not from hype. 
  The UK government is soon to publish its Hydrogen Strategy and I hope the politicians involved have sufficient knowledge to balance the evidence-weak hydrogen position pushed by organisations with something to gain. I hope they also realise that what is good for big business may not be in the best interest of the consumer.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/malaysia-us-climate-change-summit-not-top-greenhouse-gas-emitter-1883306,Malaysia not involved in US-led climate summit as it is not among top greenhouse gas emitters: Environment Minister,"KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia will not be involved in a virtual leaders summit on climate change led by US President Joe Biden, as the event is for big economies that collectively contribute to 80 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, said environment minister Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man.  In a statement on Tuesday (Apr 6), he said: “It needs to be understood that the main objective of this summit is to encourage big global economies which collectively contribute 80 per cent of greenhouse gases (globally) to increase their commitment in achieving the goal of maintaining the maximum temperature rise for global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius.” “(The summit) is also related to countries that are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change such as Vietnam and Indonesia. Malaysia is not included in either category,” he added. The minister also pointed out that other countries that stand out in the global climate change agenda such as Sweden, Switzerland and Thailand were also not invited. 
  “The summit is a one-off event which does not affect negotiations and decisions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,” he said.  Additionally, Mr Tuan Ibrahim stated that the government is formulating five new policies under a national climate change management strategy.  He elaborated that this includes revising existing climate change policies, the policies and management of a carbon market mechanism and forming a greenhouse gas inventory among others. Last month, the White House said that 40 world leaders, including those from China, Japan, India, Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam and New Zealand, have been invited to attend a virtual leaders summit on climate change. The summit will be held on Apr 22 and 23. 
  Earlier on Tuesday, Democratic Action Party Secretary General Lim Guan Eng said in a statement that the Perikatan Nasional (PN) government has failed to push “green policies” when compared to the Pakatan Harapan administration.  “Malaysia’s exclusion from a climate action summit featuring world leaders from 40 countries, including neighbours Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam has become a sad joke on the declining state of Malaysia’s previous leading activism on promoting climate change. “Malaysia’s exclusion from the United States Climate Action Summit confirms that Malaysia is viewed as more of a dumping ground for plastic waste than a strategic environmental partner,” he said.  Mr Lim noted that former environment and water minister Yeo Bee Yin was at the forefront of returning shipping containers of plastic waste back to their country of origin and amending the classification of plastic waste under the Basel Convention, to restrict the import of such waste. “Despite denials by the PN Environment and Water Minister Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man, the PN government has allowed Malaysia to slowly become the US dumping ground for ‘clean’ plastic waste,” he said. “Tuan Ibrahim should wake up and set his vision on how to integrate climate change measures into the work of government agencies and the way forward to reclaim our climate change reputation,” Mr Lim added.  In response, Mr Tuan Ibrahim said in his statement that the issue of plastic waste should be seen separately from the climate summit. 
  “It needs to be clarified that current policies relating to the recycled plastic industry is allowed as determined by the Federal Government through the Ministry of International Trade and Industries (MITI). “In terms of governance, MITI is responsible for the direction and policy of the recycled plastics industry and the Ministry of Housing and Local Government (KPKT) regulates the issuance of import permits (AP) only for clean and homogenous plastics. The Department of Environment (DOE) acts as the authority to ensure compliance with the Basel Convention,” he explained.  He stressed that strict action has been taken against those who failed to comply to existing laws, including sending back the imported containers of plastic waste to the original countries under the provision of paragraph 31 (1) (g) of Act 127 of the Environmental Quality Act 1974. “The government policy is to make the plastic recycling industry in line with the development of the circular economy as a catalyst to green industries in line with the Green Technology Master Plan 2017-2030,” said the minister. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/data-centres-more-environmentally-sustainable-singapore-198861,"Singapore must ensure digital infrastructure is environmentally sustainable, says Desmond Lee","SINGAPORE: As the digital economy continues to grow, it is important for Singapore to ensure that its digital infrastructure is “as environmentally sustainable as possible”, said Minister for National Development Desmond Lee on Tuesday (Apr 6). Mr Lee was speaking at a virtual event held for the opening of Digital Realty’s third and largest data centre in Singapore.  The five-storey, 50-megawatt facility is also one of the US-based company’s most sustainable data centres in the region with a power usage effectiveness of 1.25. Digital Loyang II, or SIN12, has received the Building and Construction Authority’s Green Mark Platinum certification. This is the highest certification that a data centre can attain under the local assessment scheme for data centres, said the minister, adding that the SIN12 is “over 30 per cent more energy efficient than the industry norm”. Digital Realty’s latest data centre was also built in a smart and resilient manner, Mr Lee added. For instance, a “common data environment” was adopted during the construction process. This allowed the company’s consultants and its contractors to continue working on the building design despite pandemic-induced disruptions. The new data centre also leveraged on design for manufacturing and assembly technology, with the use of pre-cast concrete and pre-fabricated mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems. This enabled construction work to be moved off site and improved productivity by at least 30 per cent. In addition, the pre-cast concrete components for the project were fully sourced locally. “Taken together, these allowed SIN12 to complete construction on time and not be as affected as many other firms by shortages in manpower and material due to COVID-19 border restrictions,” Mr Lee said. “Smart, resilient and sustainable buildings like SIN12 are what we are actively encouraging in Singapore in our ongoing efforts to transform our built environment sector.” MODERATE GROWTH OF DATA CENTRES The opening comes as Singapore is mulling a more sustainable approach for the growth of data centres here. In a written reply to a parliamentary question on Feb 1, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said the Government has “decided to moderate the growth” of data centres with a temporary pause on the release of state land for such purposes, as well as the development of data centres on existing state land. The industry was informed of the decision in 2019 and has been consulted on ideas for a more sustainable growth, MTI added. Data centres form an important part of the digital economy, but they are “intensive users” of water and electricity. MTI said the industry has seen a “rapid increase” over the last five years, with 14 data centres having a total IT capacity of 768 megawatts being approved to be constructed on industrial state land. This compared to the approval of 12 data centres with a total IT capacity of 307 megawatts in the five-year period before that. “We will thus need to manage the data centre ecosystem to ensure that it is environmentally sustainable, while supporting our business needs,” the ministry said in the written reply, adding that the Government is concluding its review and will share its plans with the industry “later this year”. According to previous media reports, Digital Realty announced the acquisition of the site in Loyang for SIN12 in January 2019. BALANCING GROWTH AND SUSTAINABILITY Mr Mark Smith, Digital Realty’s managing director for Asia Pacific, said the company understands the need to balance digital growth with sustainability. The company, which is one of the biggest data centre providers with 275 data centres in the world, said it has committed to the Science-Based Targets initiative, with goals that include bringing its carbon emissions in line with a 1.5-degree climate change scenario by 2030. It has also issued US$5.6 billion in green bonds – the largest in the industry, according to Mr Smith. “This area of sustainability is something that is critical to us because quite simply, it is to our customers and increasingly, for governments where we operate. So this is something that is critically important for Digital Realty going forward,” he said. However, there are challenges.  For one, Singapore’s tropical climate means that 35 to 40 per cent of the energy consumed by a data centre here goes to cooling. Land constraints also pose “a significant constraint” to tapping renewable energy, given how “there’s only so much rooftop solar or floating PV (photovoltaic) that you can deploy in Singapore"", said Mr Smith at an online panel discussion held after the opening. But the company has come up with ways to navigate these challenges. This includes implementing a cooling system design in SIN12 to help minimise evaporation losses and improve water-use efficiency. It also uses turbine generators, instead of diesel engines, and a combination of uninterruptible power supply and lithium-ion batteries to facilitate sustainable management, it said. Apart from sustainable features, the SIN12, which spans 34,000 sq m, also offers “next-generation” colocation services which allows enterprises to “scale their critical infrastructure on-demand within a connected data community with optimal proximity to carriers, networks and cloud service providers”. Enterprises will also be able to tap on its global data centre platform, which offers “productized solutions for network, control and data hub footprints”. SIN12 is located adjacently to Digital Realty’s existing data centre in Loyang, with which it is connected by diverse high-count fibre routes. Both facilities in Loyang are also interconnected with the company’s other data centre in Jurong. Without specifying names, the company said its new data centre is already “substantially pre-leased” to a community of leading global cloud service providers, local and global financial services providers, as well as leading Southeast Asian firms. The opening of the third data centre brings its total committed investment in Singapore to more than US$1 billion (about S$1.3 billion), it said. “Singapore is a well-established financial and business hub, and consistently ranks among the top data centre markets globally,” said Digital Realty’s chief executive officer William Stein. “Expanding our footprint in Singapore will enable us to better help our customers enhance their digital transformation efforts and scale their digital business models regionally as well as globally.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/climate-change-action-risks-business-compliance-leaders-laggard-1883296,Commentary: Climate commitments should be easy table stakes for businesses,"BOSTON, Massachusetts: For decades, global leaders have failed to respond to climate change with appropriate urgency, even though the science has long been clear. Now, the problem has become so acute that it is impossible to ignore, and those in positions of power are under growing pressure to start making up for lost time. For businesses, the pressure is no longer coming only from protesters, but also from shareholders, customers, investors, lenders, employees, policymakers, and every other stakeholder with a true understanding of the climate threat. From supply-chain disruptions to lethal conditions for outdoor workers, the risks to business are multiplying. From now on, CEOs will need to answer four key questions: What will my market look like in a net-zero-emissions world? What is my business model for succeeding in that market? What changes should I make now to prepare for success? What supporting conditions will I need, and how do I go about securing them? 
  THAT SHIFT TO A NET-ZERO WORLD CEOs who act early can secure competitive advantages and capture major economic opportunities for their companies. The global shift toward a net-zero global economy is already underway, auguring a complete transformation of almost every sector, with some players reaping major rewards while others commit to major write-downs. Consider the stock performance of power companies that have committed to the clean energy transition. The Danish multinational Ørsted has gone from supplying 85 per cent of its power with fossil fuels in 2009 to supplying 88 per cent with renewables today. It expects to reach net-zero energy generation and operations by 2025, and to eliminate all emissions associated with its business by 2040. 
  During this transformation, the company has started to post consistent profits, and its stock valuation has soared. “Shares in the company have more than doubled since its listing in 2016, giving Ørsted a valuation of US$56 billion,” E&E News reports. “That is more than ConocoPhillips and all but a handful of American utilities.” TABLE STAKES FOR DOING BUSINESS As the energy transition continues to accelerate, climate commitments increasingly will be seen as table stakes for doing business. Climate champions will surge ahead of the laggards, and this first-mover advantage will cascade across the economy, starting in the sectors with a relatively straightforward path to decarbonisation: Electricity, transportation, and buildings. Progress here will then enable similar transformations in industries that are harder to decarbonise, such as shipping, steel, cement, and aviation. CLIMATE LEADERS IN CHALLENGING SECTORS In fact, climate leaders are already emerging even in these more challenging sectors. In shipping, Maersk has committed to deploying a carbon-neutral vessel by 2023. “Fast-tracked by advances in technology and increasing customer demand for sustainable supply chains,” the company reports that it “is accelerating [previously announced] efforts to decarbonize marine operations.” Similarly, in aviation, Airbus is leading the way with plans to deploy a carbon-neutral hydrogen-powered aircraft by 2035. 
  Its chief executive, Guillaume Faury, sees this as “a historic moment for the commercial aviation sector” that marks “the most important transition this industry has ever seen.” Such decarbonisation ambitions in hard-to-abate sectors should be a signal to CEOs everywhere that the net-zero transition is already here. As Ernest Hemingway famously said about personal bankruptcy, it often happens “gradually, then suddenly.” The shift to a green economy will be no different. Increasingly, business leaders are recognising that the risks of being left behind will grow larger by the day. (Listen: MAS chief Ravi Menon talks about why climate risks are financial risks, how the financial sector can be a tool for the green agenda and why he’s positive Singapore can be a global leader in green finance:)  GOOD FOR BUSINESS The imperative to achieve net-zero emissions is not merely about positioning one’s company for survival; it will also be good for business. Chief executives can start implementing initiatives that will actually save money, by reducing waste, increasing circularity, and improving energy efficiency. Moreover, adopting sustainable systems and operations will yield significant benefits to a company’s brand, attracting not just customers but also top talent. Investors, board members, policymakers, and other key stakeholders are increasingly interested in companies with a sustainable plan for the future. 
  As leaders with an important role to play in global decision-making, CEOs have an enormous responsibility to help drive progress toward net-zero emissions. We are in the race of our lives, and so are companies. Any attempt to win by moving slowly will amount to a defeat for everyone. But while we all must take action, it is incumbent on those with the most power to leverage their positions in the interest of rapid change. We still have a chance to avoid truly catastrophic climate-change scenarios, but only if every leader steps up. The risks posed by climate change are an existential threat that no one – and no company – can avoid.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/cycling-electric-cars-carbon-net-zero-climate-change-1883251,Commentary: Cycling is 10 times more important than electric cars for cities to reach net-zero,"OXFORD: Globally, only one in 50 new cars were fully electric in 2020, and one in 14 in the UK. Sounds impressive, but even if all new cars were electric now, it would still take 15 to 20 years to replace the world’s fossil fuel car fleet. The emission savings from replacing all those internal combustion engines with zero-carbon alternatives will not feed in fast enough to make the necessary difference in the time we can spare: The next five years. Tackling the climate and air pollution crises requires curbing all motorised transport, particularly private cars, as quickly as possible. Focusing solely on electric vehicles is slowing down the race to zero emissions. 
  This is partly because electric cars aren’t truly zero-carbon – mining the raw materials for their batteries, manufacturing them and generating the electricity they run on produces emissions. Transport is one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonise due to its heavy fossil fuel use and reliance on carbon-intensive infrastructure – such as roads, airports and the vehicles themselves - and the way it embeds car-dependent lifestyles. One way to reduce transport emissions relatively quickly, and potentially globally, is to swap cars for cycling, e-biking and walking – active travel, as it’s called. Active travel is cheaper, healthier, better for the environment, and no slower on congested urban streets. So how much carbon can it save on a daily basis? And what is its role in reducing emissions from transport overall? 
  In new research, colleagues and I reveal that people who walk or cycle have lower carbon footprints from daily travel, including in cities where lots of people are already doing this. Despite the fact that some walking and cycling happens on top of motorised journeys instead of replacing them, more people switching to active travel would equate to lower carbon emissions from transport on a daily and trip-by-trip basis. WHAT A DIFFERENCE A TRIP MAKES We observed around 4,000 people living in London, Antwerp, Barcelona, Vienna, Orebro, Rome and Zurich. Over a two-year period, our participants completed 10,000 travel diary entries which served as records of all the trips they made each day, whether going to work by train, taking the kids to school by car or riding the bus into town. For each trip, we calculated the carbon footprint. Strikingly, people who cycled on a daily basis had 84 per cent lower carbon emissions from all their daily travel than those who didn’t. We also found that the average person who shifted from car to bike for just one day a week cut their carbon footprint by 3.2kg of CO2 – equivalent to the emissions from driving a car for 10km, eating a serving of lamb or chocolate, or sending 800 emails. 
  When we compared the life cycle of each travel mode, taking into account the carbon generated by making the vehicle, fuelling it and disposing of it, we found that emissions from cycling can be more than 30 times lower for each trip than driving a fossil fuel car, and about ten times lower than driving an electric one. We also estimate that urban residents who switched from driving to cycling for just one trip per day reduced their carbon footprint by about half a tonne of CO2 over the course of a year, and save the equivalent emissions of a one-way flight from London to New York. If just one in five urban residents permanently changed their travel behaviour in this way over the next few years, we estimate it would cut emissions from all car travel in Europe by about 8 per cent. Nearly half of the fall in daily carbon emissions during global lockdowns in 2020 came from reductions in transport emissions. The pandemic forced countries around the world to adapt to reduce the spread of the virus. In the UK, walking and cycling have been the big winners, with a 20 per cent rise in people walking regularly, and cycling levels increasing by 9 per cent on weekdays and 58 per cent on weekends compared to pre-pandemic levels. This is despite cycle commuters being very likely to work from home. 
  Active travel has offered an alternative to cars that keeps social distancing intact. It has helped people to stay safe during the pandemic and it could help reduce emissions as confinement is eased, particularly as the high prices of some electric vehicles are likely to put many potential buyers off for now. So the race is on. Active travel can contribute to tackling the climate emergency earlier than electric vehicles while also providing affordable, reliable, clean, healthy and congestion-busting transportation.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/coldplay-malaysia-environment-climate-activism-plastic-pollution-1883281,Commentary: What good will Coldplay’s vessel cleaning up Malaysia rivers do?,"SINGAPORE: British band Coldplay recently announced that they are sponsoring a vessel that can clean up the polluted rivers in Malaysia. Where this latest announcement seemed in line with Coldplay’s declared desire to minimise waste, even wanting their concerts to be carbon neutral some years back, it is to be applauded. But the news had a mixed reception, with some praising their advocacy and expressing support, and others waving it off as a publicity stunt. Coldplay isn’t the only music artist on the go-green bandwagon. Teenage singer-songwriter Billie Eilish is one of the biggest pop stars on the planet, but what stands out almost as prominently as her music is her speaking out against the climate crisis. 
  In September 2019, Eilish posted a video of her and Hollywood star Woody Harrelson talking about the climate crisis across her social media channels just before she went on Saturday Night Live. In it, they urged people to follow organisations like Greenpeace and Fridays for Future, an international climate movement founded by teen activist Greta Thunberg. Eilish’s video went on to accumulate over 40 million views worldwide. Thunberg herself is an example of the celebrity who rose to stardom as a grassroots activist. She has packed quite a punch for the environment in focusing public attention on climate change, whether sailing to the United Nations General Assembly in New York from the UK, missing lessons to strike for #FridaysForFuture or accusing world leaders of betraying her generation by failing to tackle greenhouse gas emissions at a UN climate summit in 2019. 
  A celebrity, or even an accidental one, can make a splash when they speak up for a cause. Their star power is alluring, enabling them to cast a wide, global net of influence, reaching the hearts and minds of young and old alike. Their actions shine a spotlight on worthy causes, generating needed attention and mobilising resources for social ills. To be sure, such celebrity advocacy for environmental causes is not new, though it has grown dramatically with the rise of awareness on climate change, with some positive effects.  A 2017 study by Imperial College academic Elizabeth Duthie shows celebrity endorsements improved people’s receptiveness to conservation efforts. But while celebrities may move public attitudes and inspire millions of youths around the world to follow in their footsteps, there are other everyday heroes who play equally significant roles in nurturing eco-consciousness in our youths. (If individual actions won’t move the needle on climate change, what will? Find out what climate activists are pushing for on The Climate Conversations:)   THE POWER OF EVERYDAY INFLUENCES I grew up under the influence of my father who taught us to conserve water and electricity from a young age. Until today, it is semi-automatic for me to turn off the lights and fans upon leaving the house or the bedroom. It is so deeply encoded in my DNA that I don’t even think about it. There is certainly very little celebrity influence here; just good ol’ dad. Since my children were kindergarteners, we have spoken to them about the importance of conserving our natural resources and reducing waste. We remind them to take shorter showers, turn off the air-conditioner, lights or fans when not in use and have set up a separate bin for recyclable wastes, teaching our kids what materials are suitable for recycling and sometimes enlisting their help to rinse empty juice cartons and set them aside. 
  In our family’s eco-journey, educators have also played a significant role. Our kids were often encouraged by their teachers to bring along to school recyclable materials like old CDs and plastic bottles, or other odds and ends, which they would upcycle to create new toys or decorative items. I still recall three years ago when my daughter came home waving her first bamboo straw excitedly and declaring that she’d never again use a plastic straw. It was a gift from her teacher. 
  Perhaps parents and teachers are the everyday role models and unsung heroes in nurturing a love for nature and environmental conservation in our children – and their influence is no less extraordinary compared with larger-than-life celebrities. While we may not have millions of followers on our social media accounts, our words (especially when matched by deeds) speak loudly and clearly in our children’s minds. None of our tweets will go viral, but our daily habits leave a deep imprint in their hearts, as they see us make an effort to consume less, buy from local or sustainable sources, and use products that are less harmful to the environment. 
  As Malaysia netizens rightly observed, while Coldplay’s effort to clean Malaysia’s rivers was appreciated, their latest effort has shone an uncomfortable light on whether Malaysia should take greater charge of their environment instead of having international celebrities swoop in to remedy a poor situation. And after all, Coldplay’s aid would be for nought if people continue to throw plastic waste into rivers. 
  GREENING OUR WORLD, GLOBALLY AND LOCALLY Truth be told – it hasn’t always been easy to walk the recycling talk, especially with the COVID-19 pandemic and the changes in our daily habits, which unfortunately includes an increased reliance on food delivery and its use of plastic or paper food packaging. But I remind myself that every little thought and action counts. As Stephen Covey wrote in The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: “Sow a thought, reap an action; sow an action, reap a habit; sow a habit, reap a character; sow a character, reap a destiny.” We hope that destiny includes a world that uses resources responsibly and sustainably. As parents, we have the uncanny ability and huge responsibility to speak into the souls of our youths and to influence their choices and character. But tackling the behemoth of climate change and environmental conservation requires all hands on deck, so there is nothing to complain about when celebrities step in to lend their star power to a worthy cause. They may not intimately shape the values and habits of our children compared to us parents, but they do a pretty good job in thrusting the issue of climate change into the global limelight. Their battle is on the world stage; ours in the daily grind. Besides, how many of us are able to singlehandedly fund a vessel to help clean up a polluted river? Or get an audience comprising world leaders?Undoubtedly, celebrities and the art that they do – be it music, movies or attending a late night talkshow – carry a certain power and mystique to help us dream and think big. 
  Wasteful corporate practices must also be reviewed in order to move the needle on waste management and pollution. But it is up to ordinary people like you and me to catch on to those ideals and to re-think the way we live our lives – and to pass on these ideals to the next generation. After all, our domestic recycling rates has remained low at around 20 per cent over the last few years. 
  Our influence may be subtle and we may not see the fruits of our labour till many years later, but the opportunity is ripe for the taking: Our choices today can help to raise up a generation of better lovers and stewards of the environment. Their future, and their children’s future, depends on it.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/controversial-test-flight-cooling-planet-cancelled-esrange-1883286,Controversial test flight aimed at cooling the planet cancelled,"STOCKHOLM: US and European scientists have called off a controversial balloon test flight that was to take place in Sweden's far north in June, part of a disputed solar geoengineering experiment to artificially cool the planet. A team of Harvard scientists had been planning to launch a high-altitude balloon from the Esrange Space Station in the Swedish town of Kiruna, to test whether it could in future carry equipment to release solar radiation-reflecting particles into the Earth's atmosphere. The project has been dubbed SCoPEx, short for ""Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment"". 
  Mimicking the effect of volcanic eruptions, the project's supporters say the technology should be studied to see if it could become a method of combatting global warming. But the project, like geoengineering itself, has raised concerns among both scientists and environmentalists who say the technology is dangerous and risky. Critics fear the injection of particles into the stratosphere could damage the ozone layer and disrupt ecosystems. ""The scientific community is divided regarding geoengineering,"" the state-owned Swedish Space Corporation (SSC), which operates Esrange, said in a statement issued Wednesday. Following dialogues with experts, stakeholders and Harvard University, ""SSC has decided not to conduct the technical test flight planned for this summer."" 
  A special committee set up by Harvard to study the societal and ethical aspects of the project had also called for the test flight to be postponed in order to review the implications for Sweden's indigenous Sami people and Sweden in general. The committee recommended ""that societal engagement should occur in Sweden before any SCoPEx research is conducted in the country."" ""This will likely postpone the platform launch until 2022,"" it said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/climatechange/mas-ravi-menon-climate-change-green-finance-bank-esg-carbon-tax-1883276,Climate change both an existential risk and an opportunity for the financial sector: MAS chief Ravi Menon,"SINGAPORE: Working at the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) since 1987, he has seen tectonic shifts in the financial world, from the rise of digital finance, to artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. But what drives Ravi Menon and his team at MAS these days are the risks and opportunities that addressing climate change will bring to the Singapore economy. “It was about two to three years ago … I became increasingly convinced that if indeed climate change is the existential risk of our times, then it must also be the existential risk for the financial sector,” said Mr Menon on CNA’s The Climate Conversations podcast. As a global financial centre, Singapore had to think seriously about not just what the risk was, but in mitigating it and in the process make a clear shift towards a lower carbon economy. All of this, he said, “was going to change the structure of economies and societies”. 
  To him, three key factors will drive this change: How financial institutions work around the risks, how they tap on opportunities and how they can become a force for good. He gave the example of global financial institutions based here, banks and asset management firms who have a “strong consciousness” about climate risk – which is why Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) reporting has been around for some time. But COVID-19 has accelerated this push. “The shock of the pandemic kind of woke them up to the realities of our interdependence with nature and the planet and that sparked a strong commitment to environmental sustainability,’’ he said. 
  Singapore declared climate change to be one of the “gravest challenges facing mankind” during Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s National Day Rally speech in 2019, which saw PM Lee commit S$100 billion to protect the country from rising sea levels. The Singapore Green Plan 2030 was also unveiled in February outlining sustainability targets for next 10 years. The Government also announced it would issue green bonds on selected infrastructure projects, with S$19 billion worth already identified. WHERE THERE ARE RISKS, THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES Responding to a question from CNA Digital’s Chief Editor, Jaime Ho on the pressures that banks face in easing off their investments in, and loans to industries still heavily reliant on fossil fuels, Mr Menon acknowledged that this is not something that can be done immediately. “It's easy to issue a directive and say no more investments in fossil fuels. But that doesn't make sense because the world needs fossil fuels.’’ He pointed to Asia, where there are vast populations who still need electricity and “the cheapest way to get electricity is to burn coal”. So the challenge for banks and financial institutions is to map out a clear transition plan. “So we tell the banks, you must have a transition strategy, that will make sure your customers and clients go on to cleaner and cleaner fuels … and you must create incentives to do that.’’ 
  The “bread and butter” issue for financial institutions is the calculation of profit versus risks but the reality is that in the next 10 to 20 years, these risks are going to be too high, and if companies don’t address them, they are passed on to the banks investing in them. So it is an “active conversation” MAS has had with the financial institutions. The key is to measure what these companies have been doing to go green. Mr Menon added that this then leads to another key issue: Enhancing transparency and reporting standards when it comes to companies outlining their climate risks as well as actions taken to lower carbon footprints. The central bank chief noted this was still a work in progress and would take some time; as a regulator, MAS will play a big role in holding companies accountable and if they fall short, punished, he said. “So you need to build up the capability, then you need to put pressure through regulation and the two must work in tandem, then we will get there,’’ he said. 
  JOBS AND NEW SECTORS Asked about the jobs that Singaporeans can look forward to as the country moves on its journey towards a green economy and hub for green finance, Mr Menon was upbeat. For a start, he noted that more financial institutions have been hiring entire ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) teams – numbering anywhere from 10 to 30 people. As more firms do this, Singapore can become a key point from which ESG developments in the region and beyond are monitored, he said. But this is just one small part of an entire “eco-system” he sees springing up, creating substantial job opportunities. He spoke about the growing demand for people skilled in climate risk management, monitoring and reporting, and workers who are able to verify information and sustainability outcomes. MAS itself is not sitting idle either. Asked about MAS’ own hiring plans as it scales up its climate capabilities, Mr Menon revealed that the authority has just begun a search for a Chief Sustainability Officer – something he says should ideally have been done “six to 12 months ago”.  Mr Menon added that for himself, his own journey in MAS has seen him learn new skills. “When I started this job, I knew nothing about technology and sustainability was an alien concept. Today, I'm forced to know how blockchains work; I am forced to know what the various lingua in sustainability literature is. And that’s what is happening for the whole organisation,"" he said. 
  THE ROAD AHEAD ON CARBON TAX Mr Menon was asked about his view on the role the carbon tax will play in a green economy.   Singapore's carbon tax rate has been set at S$5 per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions from 2019 to 2023. The Government had earlier said this would be increased to between S$10 and S$15 per tonne by 2030. During his budget speech in February this year, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said the Government will review the “trajectory and level” of the tax and this will be announced next year after it consults with industry and experts. Until 2023, the carbon tax rate will be maintained at S$5 per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions as previously announced, Mr Heng said in Parliament. Mr Menon believes the carbon tax can be a “powerful tool”. “I would prefer earlier and higher. But there’s a lot of adjustment considerations we need to take into account,’’ he said. He noted, however, that this would have to be done progressively, not in “jumps and starts”. This with the goal in mind of altering behaviours towards ultimately lowering carbon emissions.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ntu-develop-device-harvest-sunlight-led-underground-294136,NTU researchers develop smart device to harvest sunlight for underground use,"SINGAPORE: What looks like a crystal ball in a transparent glass case could soon be used to light up underground spaces in a sustainable way.  Drawing inspiration from the magnifying glass, several Singapore researchers have developed a smart device that can harvest daylight and transport it underground, reducing the need to rely on traditional sources such as LED bulbs. It was designed and developed by a team of Nanyang Technological University (NTU) researchers, including Assistant Professor Yoo Seongwoo from the university's School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering as well as Dr Charu Goel, who is a principal research fellow at the NTU's “The Photonics Institute”. The innovation was reported in scientific journal Solar Energy earlier this month. The device is made from an off-the-shelf acrylic ball, a single plastic optical fibre and computer chip assisted motors. “In Singapore, authorities are looking at the feasibility of digging deeper underground to create new space for infrastructure, storage and utilities. Demand for round-the-clock underground lighting is therefore expected to rise in the future,” said the university in a press release on Wednesday (Mar 31). HOW IT WORKS Just like a magnifying glass, the acrylic ball acts as the solar concentrator, focusing rays of sunlight to form a sharp focus at its opposite side. The focused sunlight is then collected into one end of the fibre cable, and transported to another end that is deployed underground. Light is then emitted via the end of the fibre cable. Concurrently, small motors - assisted by computer chips - automatically adjust the position of the fibre’s collecting end. This allows the device to optimise the amount of sunlight that can be received and transported as the sun moves.  During rainy or overcast days, an LED bulb powered by electricity installed right next to the emitting end of the fibre cable will automatically light up. This ensures that the device can illuminate underground spaces throughout the day without interruption. The device overcomes several limitations of current solar harvesting technology, said NTU. ""In conventional solar concentrators, large, curved mirrors are moved by heavy-duty motors to align the mirror dish to the sun. The components in those systems are also exposed to environmental factors like moisture, increasing maintenance requirements,"" said the university. ""The NTU device, however, is designed to use the round shape of the acrylic ball, ridding the system of heavy-duty motors to align with the sun, and making it compact."" The prototype designed by the researchers is 50cm tall and weighs 10kg. To protect the acrylic ball from environmental conditions, the researchers also built a 3mm-thick polycarbonate dome-shaped cover. Researchers believe the device is ideally suited to be mounted as a conventional lamp post above ground. This would allow it to be used in two ways: To harvest sunlight in the day to light up underground spaces; and as a street lamp to illuminate the ground at night using electricity.  A MORE EFFICIENT SOLUTION NTU researchers have found that the device boasts a higher luminous efficacy - the measure of how well a light source produces visible light using 1 watt of electrical power - compared with commercially available LED bulbs. In experiments in a pitch-black storeroom used to simulate an underground environment, researchers found the device's luminous efficacy to be at 230 lumens per watt. Commercially available LED bulbs have a typical output of 90 lumens per watt. The qualities of the light output of the NTU device is also “comparable” with current commercially available daylight harvesting systems that are more costly, said the university.  “The luminous efficacy of our low-cost device proves that it is well-suited for low-level lighting applications, like car parks, lifts, and underground walkways in dense cities,” added Dr Charu. “It is also easily scalable. Since the light capturing capacity of the ball lens is proportional to its size, we can customise the device to a desired output optic power by replacing it with a bigger or smaller ball.”  Lighting company Technolite is exploring ways to potentially incorporate the smart device or its related concepts into industrial projects for “improved efficiency and sustainability”, revealed NTU. Technolite was an industry collaborator in the research study. “Our innovation comprises commercially available off-the-shelf materials, making it potentially very easy to fabricate at scale. Due to space constraints in densely populated cities, we have intentionally designed the daylight harvesting system to be lightweight and compact,"" said Asst Prof Yoo. ""This would make it convenient for our device to be incorporated into existing infrastructure in the urban environment.”   "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/climatechange/uk-online-summit-climate-change-solutions-government-banks-1883271,UK-hosted summit seeks solutions for 'searing injustice' of climate change,"LONDON: Britain will highlight how the poorest who have done the least to cause climate change are suffering the worst of its impacts, and urge rich countries to offer more support at an online ministerial summit on Wednesday (Mar 31). The virtual meeting will bring together governments, development banks and others to work on solutions to the floods, droughts and extreme heat faced by many developing countries, as well as ways to boost energy access, clean air and smart cities. In a statement, London said the event would be an opportunity for countries on the climate frontline to ""help set the international agenda"" ahead of the G7 summit in June and the COP26 UN climate talks to be held in Glasgow in November. People in developing nations being hit the hardest by climate change are suffering ""a searing injustice"", Alok Sharma, the UK's president for COP26, is expected to say at the event. ""Developed countries have a particular responsibility to support the response of communities which are most vulnerable to climate change,"" he will add in a speech. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is due to tell ministers from about 35 countries, including in Asia, Africa and Latin America, that a lack of finance is creating barriers to meeting the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. ""Combined with the challenge of recovering from the pandemic, this threatens to set back progress,"" he will say. ""We need to consider where international systems can do more to deliver urgent climate action."" 
  The meeting comes amid calls from development organisations for Britain to reverse a decision to cut its foreign aid budget temporarily in response to economic pressure from the COVID-19 pandemic. London has promised the move will not affect £11.6 billion (US$15.9 billion) in climate finance it has committed to deliver over the next five years. But because international development spending and climate aid often overlap or can strengthen each other, cuts to one can lead to setbacks on both fronts, experts said. That is particularly true as many debt-laden poor nations struggle to respond to the twin COVID-19 and climate crises, with aid cuts likely to undermine already weak resilience to extreme weather and rising seas, researchers and aid workers said. In a letter ahead of the summit, the heads of nearly 20 groups working on climate change and development warned the cuts would ""inevitably harm the most vulnerable in society, pushing huge numbers (back) into poverty"" and should be reversed. Clare Shakya, director of climate change research at the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), said Britain's aid reduction would undermine its credibility in encouraging other wealthy nations to step up funding for climate action. ""In the middle of a pandemic, to have health or education services under threat because of one donor suddenly disappearing"" can throw overall progress off track, she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""It's incredible that (the UK) could think that isn't a problem,"" she added. 
  The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office noted Britain would double its climate finance over the next five years. ""We stand by this commitment and are pushing other developed countries to follow our lead,"" it said in emailed comments. The letter from NGOs also urged Britain to appoint a champion to prioritise efforts to tackle losses and damage caused by climate change, and called for a greater share of climate finance to go to efforts to adapt to climate impacts. That work currently receives only about a fifth of climate funding for developing countries. The UN chief has called for adaptation efforts - to protect people, cities and infrastructure from climate change - to receive half of international flows. A paper from the Center for Global Development this month found that almost half of about US$79 billion in climate finance provided by wealthy countries in 2018 came from existing aid spending and was not ""new and additional"", as promised. ""SOARING COSTS"" Ahead of the meeting, Harjeet Singh, ActionAid's global lead on climate change, said governments could ""no longer ignore the soaring costs of the climate crisis in the global south"". He cited the example of Mozambique, which had to borrow from the International Monetary Fund to pay for its response to two powerful cyclones in 2019 and is now struggling to help ""hungry and desperate"" communities rebuild their lives. ""Urgent debt cancellation to enable countries to recover from the COVID-19 health and economic crisis and build climate resilience is also vital,"" he said in a statement. Wednesday's meeting is not expected to yield pledges of fresh finance from the donor countries that will attend, which include the United States, Italy, Japan, Norway and France. The aim is rather to build consensus on practical actions and solutions to better respond to climate impacts and alleviate fiscal pressure so developing countries can better address climate change. Ministers will also consider ideas to improve the quantity, quality and access to climate finance for vulnerable countries and communities. Ahead of the event, the UK government announced half a million pounds (US$685,000) in funding to develop high-quality voluntary carbon markets, which it said could increase finance flows to where they are most needed. IIED's Shakya said she hoped the summit would lead to the establishment of a taskforce and plan to push key finance shifts ahead of COP26, including helping poorer nations access major international climate funds more easily. Right now the climate finance system ""isn't working,"" she noted, and ""we need to fix it""."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/china-brazil-greenest-central-banks-climate-change-g20-1883266,"China and Brazil have world's greenest central banks, activists say","FRANKFURT: China has the world's greenest central bank, followed by Brazil, both beating richer countries thanks to concrete steps such as lower interest rates on loans for pollution-fighting projects, an activist group said on Wednesday (Mar 31). The UK-based campaign group Positive Money ranked the central banks and financial supervisors of G20 countries based on how much they are doing to fight climate change. Only three of them got a pass: China, Brazil and France. The results may surprise some as China, which got the highest rating in the report, is one of the world's top polluters and Brazil has faced criticism for destroying parts of the Amazon's rainforest. But the authors of the study said financial policymakers in both countries acted earlier precisely because they faced larger environmental threats. ""This makes environmental impacts and risks more immediately visible and relevant for their central bankers and supervisors, and may result in a greater impetus to green their policymaking processes,"" Positive Money said. For example, the People's Bank of China's first green initiative dates back from 1995 and banks are now required to offer cheaper loans on environmentally friendly projects, the report said. Brazil stands out for restricting financing for crop expansion in the Amazon and other vulnerable regions. 
  France, which largely derives its monetary policy and financial regulation from the European Union, narrowly beat its EU peers to the third place thanks to extra points earned through its own climate stress test of large banks and insurers. This comes on top of steps taken by the European Central Bank, which has started demanding that banks take climate change into account when making loans and is considering adopting a green bias in its bond purchases. The report mainly focuses on official policy and does not reflect efficacy in implementation. NO CONSENSUS Central banks' role in fighting climate change is the object of an increasingly lively global debate but so far there is no consensus on the way forward. A report by a group of 89 institutions published last week found all policy options, such as skewing central bank funding to benefit green issuers or punishing polluters, have drawbacks. A key issue is that engaging in climate policy would raise questions on two sacred cows of the past three decades: central bank independence from politics and its single-minded focus on inflation, coupled in some countries with employment. Indeed, the Chinese central bank is not independent of its government while Brazil's has only just been granted autonomy. Positive Money advocated throwing such qualms to the wind because the costs of inaction would be more severe, and called for choking off funding to polluters. ""Targeting the most high risk and environmentally harmful assets —such as those linked to fossil fuel extraction— for exclusion from monetary policy operations and limits or penalising factors in prudential policy would be an important first step,"" it said in the report."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/japan-cherry-blossom-sakura-season-peak-bloom-climate-change-1883256,Japan's famous cherry blossoms bloom early as climate warms,"TOKYO: Japan's famous cherry blossoms have reached their flowery peak in many places earlier this year than at any time since formal records started being kept nearly 70 years ago, with experts saying climate change is the likely cause. Japan's favourite flower used to reach their peak bloom in April, just as the country celebrates the start of its new school and business year. Yet that date has been creeping earlier and now most years, the blossoms are largely gone before the first day of school. This year's peak bloom was reached on Mar 26 in the ancient capital of Kyoto, the earliest since the Japan Meteorological Agency started collecting the data in 1953 and 10 days ahead of the 30-year average. Similar records were set this year in more than a dozen cities across Japan. Some say it is the earliest peak bloom ever, based on records from historic documents, diaries and poetry books from Kyoto. Osaka Prefecture University environmental scientist Yasuyuki Aono, who tracks such documents, said the earliest blooms he has found before this year were Mar 27 in the years 1612, 1409 and 1236, though there are no records for some years. ""We can say it's most likely because of the impact of the global warming,"" said Shunji Anbe, an official at the observations division at the Japan Meteorological Agency. The agency tracks 58 ""benchmark"" cherry trees across the country, and this year 40 of those already have reached their peak bloom and 14 have done so in record time. The trees normally bloom for about two weeks each year from first bud to all the blossoms falling off. Cherry trees are sensitive to temperature changes and the timing of their blooming can provide valuable data for climate change studies, Anbe said. According to the agency data, the average temperature for March in Kyoto has climbed to 10.6 degrees Celsius in 2020 from 8.6 degrees Celsius in 1953. So far this year's average March temperature in Japan has been 12.4 degrees Celsius. Sakura have deeply influenced Japanese culture for centuries and regularly been used in poetry and literature, with their fragility seen as a symbol of life, death and rebirth."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/go-ahead-conduct-six-month-trial-buses-solar-panels-291381,Go-Ahead to conduct six-month trial of buses with solar panels,"SINGAPORE: Your bus ride in Singapore could soon be partially powered by the sun.  Bus operator Go-Ahead Singapore has installed ultra-thin solar panels on the roofs of two of its buses, which will run on Service 15. This is the first time such solar panels have been installed on buses here. The 1.6mm-thick panels will convert solar energy into electricity to charge the buses' batteries.  ""This reduces the load on the vehicle's alternator, and in turn saves fuel and reduces carbon emissions,"" said Go-Ahead Singapore engineering director Leonard Lee on Tuesday (Mar 30).   ""The whole setup weighs less than 20kg – that's very negligible compared to the weight of the bus as a whole, so it won't cancel out the (fuel) savings."" The ultra-thin panels were chosen instead of conventional solar panels due to their lightweight and flexible nature.  The buses underwent ""rigorous safety assessments"" by the Land Transport Authority before being approved for public road trials, Go-Ahead said.  Service 15 – one of the routes where an electric bus was tested about four years ago – is a 33km route starting from Pasir Ris bus interchange and plying areas such as Tampines and Marine Parade.  The firm had considered conducting the trial on shorter routes such as feeder services, but decided on a longer route to better test the system, said Mr Lee. The buses began operating on Tuesday and will run for six months until the end of September.  The panels are part of a trial to evaluate the buses' performance and effectiveness in using solar energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption. The panels will initially be inspected every week for two months, after which the inspection schedule will be reviewed.  Go-Ahead Group – the parent company of Go-Ahead Singapore – has operated 18 buses with solar panels in Southampton, Britain, for more than a year under its subsidiary Bluestar. The use of these panels has resulted in savings of 1,400L of diesel per bus per year, the transport operator said.  This translates into reductions of about 3.7 tonnes of carbon emissions per bus, said Go-Ahead's Mr Lee. ""It was based on the success of that trial in Southampton that we've decided to bring the idea to Singapore, and actually we think the solar panels should be even more effective in the climate in Singapore,"" said Go-Ahead Singapore managing director Andrew Thompson.  The two buses with solar panels conform to the Euro 6 emissions standard for diesel vehicles, he added. The firm may expand its installation of solar panels to other buses, including electric ones, depending on findings from the current trial, he said. As part of Singapore's 2040 Land Transport Master Plan, diesel buses will be phased out and replaced with cleaner energy models, including diesel-electric hybrids and fully electric buses. ""Buses are a very efficient form of public transport – they carry lots of people much more efficiently than cars,"" said Mr Thompson. ""By fitting the solar panels, we can make the diesel buses even more green and efficient."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/keeping-trees-carbon-capture-mitigate-climate-change-1883211,Commentary: Keeping trees where they are is a low-tech way to slow climate change,"OREGON: Protecting forests is an essential strategy in the fight against climate change that has not received the attention it deserves. Trees capture and store massive amounts of carbon. And unlike some strategies for cooling the climate, they don’t require costly and complicated technology. Yet although tree-planting initiatives are popular, protecting and restoring existing forests rarely attracts the same level of support. As an example, forest protection was notably missing from the US$447 million Energy Act of 2020, which the US Congress passed in December 2020 to jump-start technological carbon capture and storage. In our work as forest carbon cycle and climate change scientists, we track carbon emissions from forests to wood products and all the way to landfills – and from forest fires. 
  Our research shows that protecting carbon in forests is essential for meeting global climate goals. Ironically, we see the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve as a model. This program, which was created after the 1973 oil crisis to guard against future supply disruptions, stores nearly 800 million gallons of oil in huge underground salt caverns along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. We propose creating strategic forest carbon reserves to store carbon as a way of stabilising the climate, much as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve helps to stabilise oil markets. CARBON STOCKPILES THAT GROW Forests pull about one-third of all human-caused carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere each year. Researchers have calculated that ending deforestation and allowing mature forests to keep growing could enable forests to take up twice as much carbon. Half of a tree’s stems, branches and roots are composed of carbon. Live and dead trees, along with forest soil, hold the equivalent of 80 per cent of all the carbon currently in Earth’s atmosphere. Trees accumulate carbon over extremely long periods of time. For example, redwoods, Douglas firs and western red cedars in the coastal forests of the Pacific Northwest can live for 800 years or more. When they die and decompose, much of that carbon ends up in soil, where it is stored for centuries or millennia. 
  Mature trees that have reached full root, bark and canopy development deal with climate variability better than young trees. Older trees also store more carbon. Old-growth trees, which usually are hundreds of years old, store enormous quantities of carbon in their wood, and accumulate more carbon annually. There are many fallacies about forest carbon storage, such as the concern that wildfires in the American West are releasing huge quantities of carbon into the atmosphere. In fact, fires are a relatively small carbon source.  For example, the massive Biscuit Fire, which burned 772 square miles in southwest Oregon in 2002, emitted less than 10 per cent of Oregon’s total emissions that year. Another false claim is that it’s OK from a climate perspective to cut trees and turn them into furniture, plywood and other items because wood products can store substantial amounts of carbon.  These assertions fail to count cradle-to-grave emissions from logging and manufacturing, which can be substantial. The wood products industry releases carbon in many ways, from manufacturing products and burning mill waste to the breakdown of short-lived items like paper towels. 
  It takes decades to centuries for newly planted forests to accumulate the carbon storage levels of mature and old forests, and many planted forests are repeatedly harvested. In a review that we conducted with colleagues in 2019, we found that overall, US state and federal reporting underestimated wood product-related carbon dioxide emissions by 25 per cent to 55 per cent. We analysed Oregon carbon emissions from wood that had been harvested over the past century and discovered that 65 per cent of the original carbon returned to the atmosphere as CO2. Landfills retained 16 per cent, while just 19 per cent remained in wood products. In contrast, protecting high carbon-density western US forests that have low vulnerability to mortality from drought or fire would sequester the equivalent of about six years of fossil fuel emissions from the entire western US, from the Rocky Mountain states to the Pacific coast. FOCUS ON BIG TREES In a recently published analysis of carbon storage in six national forests in Oregon, we showed why a strategic forest carbon reserve program should focus on mature and old forests. Big trees, with trunks more than 21 inches in diameter, make up just 3 per cent of these forests but store 42 per cent of the above-ground carbon. Globally, a 2018 study found that the largest-diameter 1 per cent of trees hold half of all the carbon stored in the world’s forests. Findings like these are spurring interest in the idea of proforestation – keeping existing forests intact and letting them grow to their full potential. Advocates see proforestation as an effective, immediate and low-cost strategy to store carbon. Older forests are more resilient to climate change than young tree plantations, which are more susceptible to drought and severe wildfires. Like the 2,000-year-old redwoods in California that have survived recent wildfires, many tree species in old forests have lived through past climate extremes. Creating forest carbon reserves would also conserve critical habitat for many types of wildlife that are threatened by human activities. Connecting these reserves to other parks and refuges could help species that need to migrate in response to climate change. Less than 3 per cent of land conserved in the Northeast US is forever-wild. The Northeast Wilderness Trust is working with landowners, volunteers, and other conservation organisations to rewild the Northeastern landscape. USING FORESTS TO MEET CLIMATE GOALS More than half of US forested lands are privately owned, so strategic forest carbon reserves should be established on both public and private lands. The challenge is paying for them, which will require a major shift in government and societal priorities. We believe that transferring public investment in oil and gas subsidies to pay private land owners to keep their forests growing could act as a powerful incentive for private land owners. 
  Many researchers and conservation advocates have called for comprehensive actions to slow climate change and reduce species losses. One prominent example is the 30x30 initiative, which seeks to conserve 30 per cent of the world’s land and oceans by 2030. In an executive order on Jan 27, 2021, President Biden directed his administration to develop plans for conserving at least 30 per cent of federally controlled lands and waters by 2030. Recent projections show that to prevent the worst impacts of climate change, governments will have to increase their pledges to reduce carbon emissions by as much as 80 per cent. We see the next 10 to 20 years as a critical window for climate action, and believe that permanent protection for mature and old forests is the greatest opportunity for near-term climate benefits.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/australia-floods-bushfire-climate-crisis-disaster-1883201,"Commentary: With the latest floods, Australia is at the forefront of the climate crisis","NEW SOUTH WALES: In the late 1980s, while I was a reporter covering one of the mega-cyclones to hit Bangladesh, a government official in Dhaka confided in me that he was fed up with seeing his nation only make the global headlines as a result of the disasters that befell it. Australia is fast catching up in that regard. In the past 18 months, the driest continent on the planet has made global news for unprecedented bushfires that left 33 people dead and more than 17 million hectares in ash. 
  This was followed by the great floods of 2020, which left hundreds homeless and drenched the eastern part of the country with more than 700 millimetres of water in a week. Come March of 2021 and Australia is in the global headlines yet again. The descriptions are as similar as they are familiar. Worst floods in decades. One-in-a-hundred-year event. Greatest concern. News reporters and politicians appear to have run out of adjectives, recycling the same phrases used in previous disasters. Gone are the days when Australia was famous across the world for stories of cuddly koalas, boxing kangaroos or surfers versus sharks. Australia is now well and truly at the forefront of the climate crisis. Compounding this challenge is a view of a government out of step with the world to act in response. 
  It was not always thus. Consider the case of the hole in the ozone layer, when after its discovery in 1985, Australia played an outstanding role in the creation of the Montreal Protocol, which became known as the “world's most successful environmental agreement”. Notions of isolation and relative safety have long been a mainstay for global views of Australia. In 2021, it may well be the reverse. POLITICAL INACTION That success only makes for a more striking contrast with Australia’s contemporary international reputation for the approach it has adopted to climate change, particularly under the Liberal-National Coalition government in power since 2013. People are regularly reminded that Prime Minister Scott Morrison once brandished a lump of coal in the country’s parliament, that the Coalition dismantled the carbon tax and struggled over a renewable energy target, and has consistently ignored the pleas of business groups, environmental organisations and climate scientists for firm action. 
  It’s not that Australia has been without recommendations. The Garnaut Climate Change Review, for example, commissioned in 2007 by then-Labor leader Kevin Rudd, argued that it was in Australia’s national interest to seek an international agreement for holding carbon dioxide equivalent concentrations at 450 parts per million (ppm) or lower, and for Australia to offer in advance to play its full proportionate part in such an agreement. The report also said the cost of action to the Australian economy of tackling climate change was far less than the cost of inaction. But today the Garnaut report is hardly mentioned and has all but disappeared from public discourse. Instead, Australia appears trapped in a turgid political contest where critics are dismissed as “woke inner-city greenies” and the attempts to discuss the cause of regular crises are deflected as “not the right time”. PEOPLE ARE PAYING THE PRICE All of this can’t help but be noted around the world as the country first burned and then drowned.  Even former finance minister Mattias Cormann’s campaign to become chief of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development was dogged by criticism of Australia’s climate stance, and while this did not prevent him winning the gig, will such questions continue to mount and in future hold Australia back? 
  As I write this from home the rain has been steadily falling for the past week. So far, in the small hamlet of Marlee, on the mid-north coast of New South Wales, we have received 820 millimetres of rain. The creeks around our property have inundated paddocks, created rivers out of streams and uprooted 30-metre-tall gum trees. The roads into our area have been wiped out, causeways and bridges destroyed. Landslides block access to many properties, livestock washed downstream and drowned, communication systems are down, electricity and water supplies cut. Supplies are running low, and with every passing hour the ground is getting more sodden. The State Emergency Service and the Rural Fire Service, both voluntary organisations, have been run off their feet. Evacuation centres are swelling, roads are closed, and flood waters continue to rise. We’ve been through all of this before. Australia is a land of extremes. We all know that. And we also know the national storylines of a people who are resilient and stoic and tough. But that reputation is at risk of being overwhelmed without the leadership to act. In 1957, Nevil Shute wrote his nightmarish vision of waiting to die in a nuclear catastrophe, On the Beach. He set it in Australia, the last place on earth to receive the radioactive fallout that would wipe out life on earth. That notion of isolation and relative safety has long been a mainstay for global views of Australia. In 2021, it may well be the reverse. It is in Australia where it all begins – the bellwether of inaction on climate change.

Leaders of some of the world’s top climate-change sufferers, do-gooders and backsliders round out some of the rest of the 40 invitations being delivered Friday. Hosting the summit will fulfil a campaign pledge and executive order by Biden, and the administration is timing the event with its own upcoming announcement of what’s a much tougher US target for revamping the US economy to sharply cut emissions from coal, natural gas and oil. The session will test Biden’s pledge to make climate change a priority among competing political, economic, policy and pandemic problems. It also will pose a very public - and potentially embarrassing or empowering - test of whether US leaders, and Biden in particular, can still drive global decision-making after the Trump administration withdrew globally and shook up longstanding alliances. 
  The Biden administration intentionally looked beyond its international partners for the talks, an administration official said. “It’s a list of the key players and it’s about having some of the tough conversations and the important conversations,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss US plans for the event. “Given how important … this issue is to the entire world, we have to be willing to talk about it and we have to be willing to talk about it at the high levels.” Trump mocked the science underlying urgent warnings on global warming and the resulting worsening of droughts, floods, hurricanes and other natural disasters. He pulled the United States out of the 2015 UN Paris climate accords as one of his first actions.  That makes next month’s summit the first major international climate discussions by a US leader in more than four years, although leaders in Europe and elsewhere have kept up talks. US officials and some others give the Obama administration’s major-economies climate discussions some of the credit for laying the groundwork for the Paris accord.  The United States and nearly 200 other governments at those talks each set targets for cutting their fossil-fuel emissions, and pledged to monitor and report their emissions. Another Biden administration official said the US is still deciding how far the administration will go in setting a more ambitious US emissions target. 
  The Biden administration hopes the stage provided by next month’s Earth Day climate summit - planned to be all virtual because of COVID-19 and all publicly viewable on livestream, including breakout conversations - will encourage other international leaders to use it as a platform to announce their own countries’ tougher emission targets or other commitments, ahead of November’s UN global climate talks in Glasgow. The administration hopes more broadly the session will help galvanise governments on getting moving on specific, politically-bearable ways to retool their transportation and power sectors and overall economies now to meet those tougher future targets. The US summit isn’t just “about the deliverables, it really is about engaging at the leader level … sending a signal from the US perspective about how serious we are, and putting our own cards on the table in a significant way,” the first official said, referring to Biden’s upcoming announcement on a more aggressive US emissions target. “And hoping that countries will join us.” Like Bush’s and Obama’s major-economies climate forums, Biden’s invite list includes leaders of the world’s biggest economies and European blocs. That includes two countries - Russia and China - that Biden and his diplomats are clashing against, over election interference, cyber attacks, human rights and other issues. It is not clear how those two countries in particular will respond to the US invitations, or whether they are willing to cooperate with the US on cutting emissions while sparring on other topics. China is the world’s top emitter of climate-damaging pollution. The US is No 2 Russia is No 4. 
  Brazil is on the list as a major economy, but it’s also a major climate backslider under President Jair Bolsonaro, who derailed preservation efforts for the carbon-sucking Amazon and joined Trump in trampling international climate commitments. The 40 invitees also include leaders of countries facing some of the gravest immediate threats, including low-lying Bangladesh and the Marshall islands, countries seen as modeling some good climate behavior, including Bhutan and some Scandanavian countries, and African nations with variously big carbon sink forests or big oil reserves. Poland and some other countries on the list are seen by some as possibly open to moving faster away from dirty coal power. Biden as a candidate pledged US$2 trillion in investment to help transform the US into a zero-emission economy by 2050 while building clean-energy and technology jobs.  Biden and other administration officials have been stressing US climate intentions during early one-on-one talks with foreign leaders, and Biden climate envoy John Kerry has focused on diplomacy abroad to galvanise climate efforts."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-sea-level-rise-marine-climate-change-research-nparks-1883206,Singapore to invest S$25 million in marine climate change research,"SINGAPORE: To address issues like rising sea levels and warmer sea surface temperatures, the National Parks Board (NParks) will lead a new S$25 million research programme on marine climate change.  It is among five initiatives announced on Friday (Mar 26) to study urban sustainability. The initiatives are part of the Government’s S$25 billion RIE 2025 plan, which charts Singapore's research direction over the new five years. “If done well, our R&D efforts will not only make our city more resilient but will also help to strengthen our economy,” said National Development Minister Desmond Lee at an event called Urban Sustainability R&D E-Symposia 2021. In his speech, Mr Lee said that the Marine Climate Change Science programme will comprise different research areas. It will strive to better understand the impact of climate change on marine species, habitats, ecosystems and connectivity, and use nature-based solutions and ecological engineering to study how to better protect Singapore’s coasts from rising sea levels. 
  It will also look at blue carbon - carbon that is captured and stored by coastal and marine ecosystems - to help Singapore further reduce its carbon footprint. “So we achieve two objectives at the same time - reducing our carbon emissions and conserving our natural environment,” he said. Government agencies, research institutes and industry partners will collaborate on this programme. Separately, water agency PUB is looking into ways to reduce energy consumed and waste produced by desalination. It recently awarded nearly S$11 million to six projects researching new technologies for this purpose. TRANSFORMING THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT SECTOR As part of the Government’s effort to shift the built environment sector away from its reliance on manual labour, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) and A*STAR’s Institute for Infocomm Research will develop a 5G-enabled Smart Construction concept. They will look into integrating 5G technology with drones, robots and artificial intelligence to monitor construction sites. “Technological breakthroughs from around the world can help us to build faster, safer, and more efficiently – for example, through greater use of robotics, automation, and digitalisation,” said Mr Lee, adding that this could include incorporating robot-oriented design in construction. 
  A CITY TO FORGE STRONG RELATIONSHIPS Another priority for the Government is to strengthen Singapore’s urban social sciences. “We aspire to build a city that not only meets our physical needs, but that also enables us to forge strong relationships and deep emotional connections with each other,” said Mr Lee. 
  To understand how the well-being of residents is affected by Singapore’s built environment, the Government will combine social science knowledge with big data analytics, in a project that is said to be the first of its kind. “If this effort is successful, our findings will inform our planning strategies and interventions, to build a socially more resilient and sustainable city,” he said. CLOSER PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN RESEARCH, PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS HDB and A*STAR will sign a Memorandum of Understanding which aims to take the research findings from the Ministry of National Development’s agencies and turn them into commercial applications before scaling up, said Mr Lee. He noted that this would make Singapore’s built environment industry more competitive. Said the minister: “I encourage all our industry and research partners to tap on these platforms for collaboration and turn your ideas into deployable solutions and bring them to market.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/rising-sea-levels-sinking-land-shanghai-jakarta-climate-change-1883191,Commentary: Rising sea levels and sinking land are hitting big cities but the solution is far from simple,"NORWICH, England: It is well-known that climate-induced sea level rise is a major threat. What is less well known is the threat of sinking land. And in many of the most populated coastal areas, the land is sinking even faster than the sea is rising. Parts of Tokyo for instance sank by 4m during the 20th century, with 2m or more of sinking reported in Shanghai, Bangkok, and New Orleans. This process is known as subsidence. Slow subsidence happens naturally in river deltas, and it can be accelerated by the extraction of groundwater, oil or gas which causes the soil to consolidate and the surface to lose elevation. Subsidence leads to relative sea level rise (sea level rise plus land sinking). It turns croplands salty, damages buildings, causes widespread flooding and can even mean the loss of entire coastal areas. 
  Subsidence can threaten flooding in low-lying coastal areas, much more so than rising sea levels, yet scientists are only just realising the global implications of the threat with respect to coastal cities. In fact, while the average coastal area experiences relative sea level rise of less than 3mm per year, the average coastal resident experiences a rise of around 8mm to 10mm per year. This is because so many people live in deltas and especially cities on deltas that are subsiding. That’s the key finding of our new research, where we analysed how fast cities are sinking across the world and compared them with global subsidence data including less densely populated coastlines. Our finding reflects that people often choose to live in river deltas, floodplains and other areas that were already prone to sinking, and in doing so will further enhance subsidence. 
  In particular, subsiding cities contain more than 150 million people in the coastal zone – that’s roughly 20 per cent of people in the world who live by the sea. This means relative sea level rise will have a more sudden and more severe impact than scientists had originally thought. Here are a few of the most affected cities: JAKARTA The Indonesian capital Jakarta is home to 10 million people, and is built on low-lying land next to the sea. Groundwater extraction caused the city to sink more than 3m from 1947 to 2010 and much of the city is still sinking by 10cm or more each year. Subsidence does not occur evenly, leading to uneven risks that make urban planning difficult. Buildings are now flooded, cracks are appearing in infrastructure which is being abandoned. Jakarta has built higher sea walls to keep up with the subsidence. But since groundwater pumping continues, this patching-up policy can only last so long before the same problems occur again. And the city needs to keep pumping since groundwater is used for drinking water. Taking water, the very thing that humans need to survive, ultimately puts people at risk of inundation. The battle against subsidence is slowly being lost, with the government proposing in 2019 to move the capital to a purpose-built city on the island of Borneo more than 1,000km away, with subsidence being one of many reasons. SHANGHAI Developing rapidly in the past few decades, and now with a population of 26 million, Shanghai is another sinker. The city has maximum subsidence rates of around 2.5cm a year. Again this is mostly caused by lowering groundwater levels, in this case thanks to drainage to construct skyscrapers, metro lines and roads (for instance Metro Line 1, built in the 1990s, caused rapid subsidence). If no additional protection is built, by 2100 this rate of subsidence and sea level rise mean that a storm surge could flood around 15 per cent of the city. NEW ORLEANS In New Orleans, centuries of embankments and ditches had effectively drained the city and sunk it, leaving about half of it below sea level. 
  When Hurricane Katrina breached the levees in 2005, the city did not stand a chance. The hurricane caused at least US$40 billion in damage and particularly took its toll on the city’s African American community. More than 1,570 people died across the state of Louisiana. If the city had not subsided, damage would have been greatly reduced and lives would have been saved. Decisions that were made many decades or more ago set the path for the disasters that are seen today, and what we will see in the future. NO SIMPLE SOLUTIONS So what can be done? Building a sea wall or dike is one immediate solution. This of course stops the water coming in, but remember that the sea wall is sinking too, so it has to be extra large in order to be effective in the long-term. In urban areas, engineers cannot raise ground easily: That can take decades as buildings and infrastructure are renewed. There is no simple solution, and large-scale urban subsidence is largely irreversible. Some cities have found “solutions”. Tokyo for instance managed to stop subsidence from about 1960 onwards thanks to stronger regulations on water pumping, but it cannot get rid of the overall risk as parts of city are below sea level and depend on dikes and pumps to be habitable. Indonesia’s bold proposal to move its capital city may be the ultimate solution. Increased urbanisation especially in deltas areas and the demand for freshwater means subsidence will remain a pressing issue in the coming decades. Dealing with subsidence is complementary to dealing with climate-induced sea level rise and both need to be addressed. A combination of rising seas and sinking lands will increasingly leave coastal cities at risk.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/china-us-climate-change-working-group-meeting-1883181,"China, US to work on climate, Beijing says after rancorous meeting","BEIJING: China and the United States will set up a joint working group on climate change, China's official Xinhua news agency said, in a potentially positive takeaway from what was an unusually rancorous high-level meeting. The top Chinese and US diplomats, in their first meeting of Joe Biden's presidency on Thursday and Friday, publicly rebuked each other's policies at the start of what Washington called ""tough and direct"" talks in Alaska. But the Chinese delegation said after the meeting the two sides were ""committed to enhancing communication and cooperation in the field of climate change"", Xinhua said on Saturday (Mar 20). They would also hold talks to facilitate the activities of diplomats and consular missions, ""as well as on issues related to media reporters in the spirit of reciprocity and mutual benefit"", the report said. The US Embassy in Beijing did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on Sunday. 
  Last year, as tensions between Beijing and Washington worsened dramatically, the two countries expelled journalists and the United States shut China's consulate in Houston, prompting China to shut the US consulate in Chengdu. The talks in Anchorage, headed by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, had a fiery kickoff, in front of TV cameras, and had appeared to yield no diplomatic breakthroughs. But the Chinese delegation said ""both sides share the hope of continuing such type of high-level strategic communication"", Xinhua reported. ""The two sides also agreed that they ... will maintain dialogue and communication, conduct mutually beneficial cooperation, avoid misunderstanding and misjudgment, as well as conflict and confrontation, so as to promote sound and steady development of China-US relations."" 
  China and the United States also discussed adjusting travel and visa policies according to the coronavirus pandemic situation, ""and gradually promoting the normalisation of personnel exchanges between China and the United States"", the report said. After the meetings, Yang told China's CGTN television that the discussions had been constructive and beneficial, ""but of course, there are still differences"". "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/cryptocurrency-blockchain-environmental-impact-singapore-320461,Can cryptocurrencies and their vast energy use co-exist with Singapore’s green goals?,"SINGAPORE: Amid Singapore's push for sustainability, the growing interest in blockchain and cryptocurrency - with its vast energy consumption - may present a conundrum. Blockchain relies on a vast decentralised network of computers to record transactions. Its most well-known applications are cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.  Digital currencies require heavy computing power to solve complex algorithms in a process known as mining, which creates new coins. But they come at a heavy environmental cost.  According to a Reuters report citing a 2019 study in the scientific journal Joule, Bitcoin production, for instance, is estimated to generate between 22 and 22.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year, or between the levels produced by Jordan and Sri Lanka. And the energy consumption by the Bitcoin network globally has doubled or even tripled since late-2017, said Professor Benjamin Horton from the Asian School of the Environment in Nanyang Technological University (NTU). “Now the network uses … between 78 terawatt hours (TWh) and 101TWh, or about the same as Norway,” he added. BLOCKCHAIN, CRYPTO ON THE RISE These technologies have gained ground in Singapore over the years. Since its establishment in 2014, the Association of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Enterprises and Start-ups Singapore (ACCESS) has seen its membership rise an average of 25 per cent year-on-year, it told CNA. It now has more than 400 members. ""The future of crypto is bright as more institutions are coming in to service the space, such as DBS and the Singapore Exchange (SGX) with their digital currency exchanges,"" said ACCESS. Singapore's status as a blockchain hub is also growing, with numerous government-backed trials and a proactive regulatory stance, said Assistant Professor Dinh Tien Tuan Anh from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). Most recently, in December, authorities launched a S$12 million blockchain innovation programme to strengthen the fintech ecosystem here. In addition, retail investors are increasingly getting in on the action, spurred by the promise of new highs with digital currencies, experts said. Despite these developments, blockchain technology can co-exist with Singapore's green plans, said Asst Prof Dinh. The Government launched a Green Plan last month, charting Singapore’s sustainability goals over the next 10 years across various ministries.  For one, experts believe that energy-intensive cryptocurrency mining is not done on a large scale in Singapore. In a written parliamentary reply in February, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said that cryptocurrency mining happens predominantly in markets with a cheap supply of electricity.  ""Conversely, our local conditions are not favourable for cryptocurrency mining,"" she said in response to a question by MP Jamus Lim (WP-Sengkang) on the environmental cost of digital currencies. “Our relatively high land, labour and electricity costs, coupled with our hot tropical climate, make it expensive to operate cryptocurrency mining.”  CAN CRYPTO BE GREENER? Whether mining is done locally or overseas, experts concede that there will still be an environmental impact. But they noted that it is a misconception that all blockchain applications and cryptocurrencies are as damaging as Bitcoin, for instance. “In the crypto space, right now there are so many alternatives to co-exist with a green environment,” said Mr Muoi Tran, a researcher at the National University of Singapore’s Cryptocurrency Strategy, Techniques, and Algorithms (CRYSTAL) Centre. “Bitcoin is first generation, but we are now moving to the next generation (of green cryptocurrencies) … which are already running and available,” he added. For instance, he cited blockchain applications that use Proof-of-Stake protocols, instead of the traditional Proof-of-Work ones that require users to solve problems. SUTD's Asst Prof Dinh added: “Proof-of-Stake doesn’t require you to solve this puzzle, it only requires you to prove you have some money in the bank."" Another example is that of homegrown blockchain platform Ziliqa, which uses a method called sharding that is more energy-efficient. Simply put, it involves dividing blockchain workloads for separate sets of nodes, or shards, to handle. Since each node only has to process what is assigned to its shard, less energy is used overall. Mr Tran likened the concept to a group project, where each student handles a different part of the workload, instead of all of them working on all tasks together.  “We definitely need better education to let people know about these greener solutions,” he said, adding that government backing for these technologies could gel with sustainability plans. “(Another) easy way is to encourage renewable energy for mining bitcoin,” said Mr Tran, noting that this is a trend in the US. Asst Prof Dinh added: “Singapore’s openness to cryptos should drive research on those topics towards more sustainable cryptos that solve these environmental issues."" What bodes well for this need to innovate is the amount of ""world-class research"" coming out of local universities, as well as a vibrant start-up ecosystem, he said. ""I'm quite positive (we will develop even better solutions) ... because we cannot afford to sustain Bitcoin and Ethereum,” said Asst Prof Dinh. On whether authorities have considered restricting cryptocurrency mining in Singapore, Ms Fu previously said: ""The Government will continue to monitor the development of cryptocurrencies and the risks they pose."" If regulation is required down the line, Prof Horton suggested that policymakers could follow the example of other cities, citing Québec in Canada where a moratorium was imposed on new mining operations. Alternatively, large-scale miners could be targeted with higher electricity rates, he said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/climate-change/first-us-pipeline-agency-weighs-climate-change-impacts-1883171,"In a first, US pipeline agency weighs climate change impacts","WASHINGTON: For the first time, a federal energy board is weighing how a proposed natural gas pipeline would affect greenhouse gas emissions, one of several steps taken this week by the Biden administration in its effort to slow climate change. With a new Democratic chair at the helm, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission voted 3-2 to approve a pipeline operator's request to replace 140km of natural gas pipelines in South Dakota and Nebraska, finding that the project’s climate-warming carbon emissions would not be significant. The ruling marked the first time the commission has formally assessed a pipeline's greenhouse gas emissions and their expected contribution to climate change, a reversal of policies pursued under Republican chairs appointed by former President Donald Trump. FERC is an independent agency that regulates interstate transmission of electricity, natural gas and oil, among other tasks. Members are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. ""A proposed pipeline’s contribution to #ClimateChange is 1 of its most consequential environmental impacts,"" the chair, Democrat Rich Glick, tweeted Thursday. FERC ""cannot claim to have adequately addressed the public interest without addressing the significance of that impact"", Glick added. ""More work to do, but this is an important start."" Glick was one of two Democrats to support the addition of climate change as a key consideration, along with former FERC Chair Neil Chatterjee, a Republican who previously opposed the climate provision. Two other Republicans opposed the ruling. Chatterjee, a former aide to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said in an interview that his vote reflected a ""pragmatic approach"" to the commission's work. ""Without compromise like this, needed infrastructure won't get built"" around the country. Under FERC rules, the chair has broad authority over pipeline projects and can delay a vote indefinitely. Glick, who became chair in January after the inauguration of President Joe Biden, had voted against a string of pipeline projects while serving under Chatterjee and other GOP leaders, citing their refusal to consider climate impacts. Glick has said he does not oppose all pipelines, but that climate change must be considered along with other environmental impacts. Biden has called climate change an ""existential threat"". In other action this week, the acting chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced he is establishing a unit to focus on the role of complex financial derivatives in understanding and pricing climate-related hazards. The Securities and Exchange Commission said it is seeking public input on how to require companies to disclose information on climate change risks to investors. The Environmental Protection Agency reinstated a dormant website centered on climate science and policy. The information was removed from the agency's website by the Trump administration, which frequently downplayed or denied the risks of climate change. Biden has pledged to slash greenhouse gas emissions amid a government-wide focus on climate change. Biden has set a goal of eliminating pollution from fossil fuel in the power sector by 2035 and from the US economy overall by 2050, speeding what is already a market-driven growth of solar and wind energy and lessening the country’s dependence on oil and gas. The aggressive plan is aimed at slowing human-caused global warming that is magnifying extreme weather events such as deadly wildfires in the West and drenching rains and hurricanes in the East. There were nearly two dozen extreme weather events in the US last year, costing taxpayers, businesses, investors and homeowners a combined US$95 billion, according to the federal government. Gillian Giannetti, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the FERC ruling ""a tremendous step in the right direction"" and an indication of how the agency will rule under Glick's leadership. She praised Chatterjee for his apparent change of heart, calling him ""a smart and thoughtful member of the commission"" who ""recognises he's not chairman anymore"". Chatterjee, who led the commission in 2017 and again from late 2018 until last November, offered a similar rationale for reversing his position on climate. Glick has assured him he will not oppose all pipeline projects, so long as their climate impacts are considered, Chatterjee said, adding: ""He's a man of his word."" By making the policy change, other pipeline projects are likely to go forward, Chatterjee said. James Danly, a fellow Republican who briefly replaced Chatterjee as chair, blasted the decision, saying the only thing that's changed is the panel's leader — and Chatterjee's views. “Basically, I think the reasoning in the order is legally infirm,” Danly said. He accused Glick of hiding a major change to FERC policy in an order for a specific project."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/bp-britain-largest-blue-hydrogen-plant-clean-energy-1883166,BP plans to build Britain's largest hydrogen plant,"LONDON: Energy group BP aims to build Britain's largest hydrogen plant by 2030, it said on Thursday (Mar 18), as part of the country's push to boost use of the fuel and cut greenhouse gas emissions. The Teesside plant in northern England will have capacity of up to 1 gigawatt (GW) of so-called blue hydrogen, about a fifth of Britain's target of 5 GW of hydrogen capacity by the end of the decade. Blue hydrogen is produced by converting natural gas into hydrogen and storing the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from its production. BP has begun a feasibility study on the project to explore technologies that could capture up to 98 per cent of carbon emissions from the hydrogen production process. The Teesside project, dubbed H2Teesside, is expected to capture up to 2 million tonnes of CO2 a year and pipe it into storage below the North Sea, BP said. 
  H2Teesside will be linked with Net Zero Teesside, a planned industrial zone that will also be linked to a carbon capture and storage project. The hydrogen could also be used for heating residential homes in the region or for transportation, BP added. Governments and energy companies are placing large bets on clean hydrogen playing a leading role in efforts to lower greenhouse gas emissions, but its future uses and costs are highly uncertain. Britain on Wednesday announced an industrial decarbonisation strategy aiming to cut emissions from industry by two thirds in 15 years through projects including carbon capture and hydrogen. ""Clean hydrogen is an essential complement to electrification on the path to net-zero carbon emissions,"" said Dev Sanyal, BP's head of gas and low carbon energy. ""Blue hydrogen ... can also play an essential role in decarbonising hard-to-electrify industries and driving down the cost of the energy transition."" The company will make a final investment decision on the H2Teeside project in early 2024 and production could begin in 2027 or earlier, it said. Norwegian energy company Equinor last year announced plans to construct a blue hydrogen plant in the Humber region in northern England."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/business-pledging-net-zero-sustainability-climate-change-targets-1883161,Commentary: Companies pledging net-zero targets need to show substance,"LONDON: What will you be doing in 2050? As individuals, most of us struggle to picture what our lives will be like almost 30 years from now. But many of the world’s largest companies and their bankers sound serenely sure of the future. To believe their press releases, the midpoint of this century will be the moment when they will no longer emit a single puff of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere without doing something that removes a similar amount.  Companies as diverse as 3M and Mastercard, and as fossil-fuelled as BP and Shell, have set “net-zero” goals for 2050. Forests will be planted, supply chains will be cleaned up and new technologies will replace dirty power plants, belching trucks and inefficient office buildings. 
  The world’s largest lenders to carbon-emitting industries are following suit, with Wells Fargo’s wind farm-illustrated announcement earlier this month making it the last of the big six US banks to set such a target.  A search on the financial data service Sentieo shows that mentions of 2050 in corporate announcements have doubled in the past two years.  But much like Saint Augustine asking to be made chaste (just not yet), such far-off goals raise the suspicion that some executives would like more time before they — or, preferably, their successors — must embrace environmental virtue.  Today’s CEOs “will all be retired or dead” by 2050, says Patrick McCully, Rainforest Action Network’s climate and energy programme director, a little harshly.  Boards may have felt under pressure to come out with net-zero commitments, he says, but he fears that they will now “take the pedal off the metal in terms of how they’re actually implemented”.  
  Such concerns are understandable. A PwC survey released earlier this month showed that climate change ranked only ninth among global CEOs’ perceived threats to growth. More than a quarter of the executives polled claimed to be unconcerned by a warming planet.  The scepticism is reinforced by the lack of detail most companies have given investors on how they intend to hit their distant targets and, most importantly, how they plan to start working towards them now.  BEWARE THE GREENWASHING But about a quarter of S&P 500 members had made net-zero commitments by the end of 2020, according to FCLTGlobal, which champions long-term investing, and the number is growing fast.  Some, such as FedEx and Walmart, aspire to emissions equilibrium in 2040, while less carbon-intensive businesses from PwC to Sky hope to get there as soon as 2030. Critics have spent decades complaining that companies cannot see beyond the next quarter, so even environmentalists agree that their apparent willingness to tackle such long-term challenges is welcome, especially given that it has emerged despite the short-term pressures of the pandemic. It is also increasingly good business. With President Joe Biden promising to put the US on “an irreversible path” to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, most major economies are leaning on the private sector to meet the goals set out in the Paris climate agreement, which will require trillions of dollars of investment in green technologies. Their shareholders, too, are turning up the heat. In 2019, 34 asset owners managing US$5.5 trillion pledged to zero out the net emissions from their portfolios within 30 years. 
  BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, has warned it may vote against directors who do not take the issue seriously.  Most companies with the sense and resources to make even minimal environmental, social and governance commitments have benefited from the vast sums poured into such funds in recent years.  
  But investors are getting choosier, and influential new EU rules on which investment products can call themselves “sustainable” are expected to make them more alert to greenwashing.  “Net-zero pathways” have slipped easily into the corporate jargon. But investors need to see meaningful milestones along those paths to 2050, starting with a clear plan for aligning with the UN goal of halving emissions from their 2010 level by the end of this decade. Companies cannot get away with doing little towards their 2050 goals until 2049, says Bob Eccles, the Saïd Business School professor and sustainability expert. “Give me interim targets,” he says. “Give me the narrative and then tell me what is the logic behind why [you think] you’re going to get to x per cent by 2030 and y per cent by 2040.” The expected launch this year of a sustainability standards board by the IFRS Foundation, which oversees international accounting standards, should make ESG reporting more consistent.  But for now investors are suffering from a shortage of meaningful data by which they can track progress and dissuade executives from fudging the numbers if they miss their targets, Eccles warns. Without measurable commitments about what changes must be made in the near term, companies’ 30-year plans will ring hollow, however well-intended they may be.  If investors are as serious as they claim to be about ESG, they should insist on meaningful annual reporting on companies’ progress towards those goals, and hold directors to account who continue to see the challenge as a problem for the next generation.  And if they really want to focus attention on the task, they might also encourage boards to tie more executives’ pay to the progress they make in fulfilling it."

The 50-year-old woman, who like many Indonesian goes with one name, used to live several hundred metres from the sea in the village of Dukuh Semonet on the northern coast of Java. But since 2015, strong winds, high waves and land subsidence have been causing the coastline to advance further inland.

When high tide comes, the entire house is submerged, including my bedroom. I cannot sleep at night. I just stay at my porch all night long as waves pound my walls. I cannot go anywhere. Everything is inundated. Even the bridges are submerged,” she told CNA. “I am scared. One day my house will become uninhabitable, then where will I go? I have no money to buy another house. I don’t know what to do.” The dire circumstances in Dukuh Semonet are not unique. In the 46 sqkm city of Pekalongan, there are dozens of neighbourhoods under threat of becoming one with the sea, with saltwater encroaching inland for up to 1.5km. At the heart of the problem is Pekalongan’s overreliance on groundwater, which is not only extracted for domestic use but also to irrigate fish farms and rice fields. Groundwater is also essential to the city’s thriving batik industry. Batik is a traditional Indonesian method of using wax to resist water-based dyes to depict patterns and drawings on fabric. 
  The over-extraction of groundwater has caused the city to sink at a rate of between 10cm to 15cm per year. In some areas, the land subsidence has been as severe as 26cm per year. Meanwhile, climate change has brought more extreme rainfall, stronger winds, higher waves and rising sea levels.   Scientists have warned that if nothing is done to stop the widespread land subsidence and encroachment of the sea, the entire city could be underwater by 2036. LAND SUBSIDENCE ACCELERATED OVER LAST DECADE Mr Heri Andreas, who has been studying land subsidence in parts of  Indonesia, noted that Pekalongan is built on flat, low-lying sediment, which has been sinking for decades. However, the process seemed to have accelerated from 2010, when the local government encouraged people to exploit groundwater on a massive scale. “Ninety per cent of Pekalongan’s water needs are supplied by extracting groundwater. This causes Pekalongan’s soft alluvial sediment to compact and as a result the surface sinks,” he told CNA. A third of the city is now below sea level, he also said. Mr Andreas is a geodesy lecturer with the Bandung Institute of Technology. Geodesy researchers look at how the earth’s geometric shape changes over time. Although there are five rivers flowing into the city, all of them are heavily polluted by the batik industry, the backbone of Pekalongan’s economy. “The government has been encouraging the use of groundwater. The government even built boreholes across the city to extract groundwater on a massive scale, not only for drinking but also agriculture and aquaculture as well as hotels and industries,” Mr Andreas said. “This is why land subsidence occurs so massively in Pekalongan and at an alarming rate.” “In some places, the ground is sitting 1m to 1.5m below the surface of the sea,” he said. “By 2035, these places will sit between 2.5m to 3m below sea level. According to our (computer) simulation, 80 per cent of Pekalongan could be below sea level by 2035.” The Energy and Mineral Resource Ministry’s department of geology has an even grimmer assessment. Their study, which was published in January, predicted that the entire city could be below the surface of the sea by 2036. This makes Pekalongan one of the fastest sinking cities in Indonesia, Mr Andreas said. The city is littered with houses, factories and offices which have sunk way below street levels, trapping years of rain and floodwater. Most of these buildings are now abandoned and slowly decaying. 
  Land subsidence has also caused coastlines to disappear, leading to thousands of hectares of farmlands and residential areas being permanently submerged in seawater. Mr Darwanto, who also goes with one name, said there are hundreds of houses that have been devastated by the sea in his sub-district of Bandengan, which used to sit 1.5km away from the coastline. “There used to be fish farms and rice fields in this area. Now they have become a watery wasteland. Hundreds of houses have also been affected. When a tidal flood comes, roads and houses can be flooded in seawater between 30cm and 1m deep,” he told CNA.   “Once, the tidal flood was so bad residents had to evacuate for more than one week to the sub-district office. Even the sub-district office was flooded, so we had to seek shelter on the second floor of the building.” Mr Darwanto said many people in his neighbourhood have moved elsewhere and abandoned their houses. “The rest stayed because their houses are still liveable or because they have no money to buy a new house. People here try to move and sell their houses for cheap, but nobody wants them,” he said. Meanwhile in Dukuh Semonet, land subsidence has caused the village to be waterlocked. Roads and pathways are permanently submerged in 1m deep water. Today, the only way in and out of the village is through a short boat ride to a neighbouring village across the river. “It affects our mobility. Sometimes our children cannot go to school, especially during high tide when you cannot even leave the house. In fact, our houses are also inundated,” Dukuh Semonet resident, Mr Sumaryo told CNA. ""WE ARE BESIEGED BY WATER"" Land subsidence has caused rivers running through Pekalongan to sink below sea level, and as a result the city constantly floods during the rainy season. Since the beginning of the year, Pekalongan has been hit with one flood after another with some areas constantly inundated for weeks. Fluvial floods have also drowned several batik factories, sometimes turning the water red from the dyes used. “We are besieged by water, both seawater from the north and fluvial flood from the south. The sea would enter the city from the rivers and from there spill into peoples' homes. Our roads and alleyways now resemble small rivers,” Mdm Anita Heru Kusumorini, chief of the Pekalongan Development Planning Agency told CNA. “We cannot discharge the water because the city is already like a bowl and the water is trapped. Even if we pump out the water to the rivers or the sea, it will flow right back to residential areas and streets. Meanwhile, the rivers are also narrowing because of sedimentation, so two hours of rain is enough to inundate parts of the city.” The city also floods during the dry season, caused by tidal floods and storm surges. Last year, the city had two devastating storm surges, one in June and one in December. Both times, the sea swelled and breached 1m tall dikes that defend parts of Pekalongan’s coastal areas. Because of climate change, storm surges have happened more frequently and are of greater intensity. “During the last tidal flood, a third of Pekalongan was submerged. It has become that severe,” Mdm Kusumorini said. LACK OF FUNDS The city plans to construct a massive sea dike to protect around 290,000 inhabitants. The coastal defence system will include building a pumping station at the mouth of Pekalongan’s biggest and most flood-prone waterway, the Loji River. To stop people from extracting groundwater, the city is also planning to build reservoirs and create an elaborate piping network to distribute fresh water. It also plans to relocate people living at flood-prone riverbanks, build embankments and fix its drainage system which is no longer adequate to cope with extreme rainfall, the consequence of a changing climate. But these projects come with a hefty price tag and the small city does not have sufficient funds. “We can only earmark 250 billion rupiah (US$17.7 million) each year for infrastructure projects. This is not a lot. This is why we rely on help from the national and provincial administrations, said Mdm Kusumorini.  In 2019, the central government financed the building of a 2.3km sea dike to protect the western part of the city from the encroaching sea. The project cost the national government 500 billion rupiah. To completely stop seawater from seeping through and drowning the city, Pekalongan still needs to build another 4km of sea dikes. Mdm Kusumorini added: “We want to get these projects off the ground soon. But the central government and provincial government cannot provide us with funds just yet because the country is focusing on mitigating COVID-19."" The planning agency chief said the central government is still paying for the upkeep of the existing dike as well as the cost to operate pumping stations to flush out excess water back to sea. “The cost to operate and maintain the dike and the pumping stations is around 2 billion rupiah per year. The central government is planning to transfer the responsibility for the upkeep to the city sometime this year, so that is another expenditure which we have to think about,” she said. 
  Mdm Kusumorini said because of land subsidence, the dike is also sinking and will need to be raised every five years. The city, she said, is still trying to figure out how to pay for that project.   “Because our budget is limited, we cannot complete big projects like this in a single financial year,” she said. “We are also planning to cut down the use of groundwater. We have barred the building of new wells. But we cannot stop people from using existing wells before we come up with alternatives. Even government offices are using groundwater. We want people to still be able to have access to clean and affordable water.” One solution is to pipe water from a reservoir 30km south of the city. Freshwater from the reservoir, she said, is enough to supply half of the city’s water needs. “The reservoir is already connected to the city. But we still need to build a water distribution network, which again takes money and time.” And time is not on Pekalongan’s side. Mdm Kusumorini said the city is well aware of the scientists’ prediction that between 80 per cent and 100 per cent of the city could be under sea level in the next 15 years.   “We hope that through some of the efforts which we have done and the projects which we plan to do, land subsidence rate can slow or even stop,” she said. “I hope we can get some of the projects off the ground soon. Because we are indeed racing against time.” "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/green-tech-bubble-financing-new-deal-infrastructure-1883151,Commentary: Surging interest in green tech will power next industrial revolution,"CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts: Following the tenfold growth of Tesla’s stock between March 2020 and January 2021, the company’s founder, Elon Musk, has emerged as the avatar of green innovation. The Tesla phenomenon has spilled over into the rest of the nascent electric-vehicle (EV) industry, sprinkling stardust on a host of green startups with unproven technologies and minimal revenues. As entrepreneurs and private investors step in to do what governments have failed to do, some commentators now believe a “Green Revolution” is at hand. Others, however, look at the same picture and see the early signs of a “greentech bubble"". 
  THE PROBLEM WITH EASY MONEY The greentech (or cleantech) boom is indeed vulnerable. Like the earlier digital boom that resulted in the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, it is heavily reliant on an outside force that could suddenly recede – namely, easy money. In today’s environment of low interest rates, the present value of future cash flows has been inflated, and thus will plummet were interest rates to rise. For 10 years now, central banks have set policy rates below the rate of inflation – which itself has resided at historically low levels. As a result, negative real interest rates on safe assets have pushed large institutional and retail investors alike into riskier assets yielding higher potential returns. It is worth remembering that just before the recent focus on greentech stocks, the Big Tech giants achieved extremely high valuations as part of a broader “unicorn bubble” in private markets, where “unconventional” investors paid premium prices for unsellable shares of what they hoped would be the next FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) stock. WILL GREEN REVOLUTION SAVE GREEN TECH? In any case, the US Federal Reserve has responded to the COVID-19 crisis with a commitment to keep its policy rate near zero until the US economy achieves “maximum employment and inflation averaging 2 per cent over time"". Yet, given the rapid administration of COVID-19 vaccines under US President Joe Biden’s administration, the stage is being set for normalisation in capital markets. So, the question is not whether the green bubble will burst (all bubbles do, eventually), but whether it will burst before the Green Revolution has established a firm foothold. Will the capital mobilised by the current boom be wasted, or will it be embodied as the infrastructure needed to turn the revolution into the new normal? 
  Effecting radical change in energy supply and consumption inevitably will require what only the state can provide: Vast public investment and new rules of the road (taxes and regulations). We know this from the history of the digital revolution in the second half of the twentieth century, which I examined in my book Doing Capitalism in the Innovation Economy. THE STATE PLAYS THE BIGGEST ROLE In technological revolutions, state actors must play the initial leading role, by establishing a politically legitimate mission (such as winning the Cold War) to justify massive spending on high-risk programmes. Likewise, it is the state that must fund upstream investment in basic research whose potential returns are too uncertain to motivate the private sector. And, as a novel technology matures, the state creates a market by serving as the first customer, thereby pulling the supply side of the innovation economy down the learning curve to low-cost, reliable production. The final stage begins when speculators identify the transformational potential of the new technology and mobilise capital to fund the infrastructure needed for its broad deployment, and for the Darwinian exploration of additional applications. A productive bubble emerges, driven by the promise of a new economy. Elements of this pattern can be seen in previous industrial revolutions. In the century leading up to the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, the British army’s rising demand for guns fueled the productivity gains (from mass production and the division of labor) that made Birmingham, England, the workshop of the First Industrial Revolution. Then, a generation later, the British Parliament endowed railway promoters with powers of eminent domain and limited liability, setting the stage for the Great Railway Mania of the 1840s. Likewise, in the United States, state guarantees and subsidies underwrote the canal and rail networks that were needed to establish a truly national economy. And, as in Britain, speculators followed where the state had led. 
  THE IMPERATIVE TO GREEN Today, climate change offers a mission that is greater in scale and scope than even the Cold War. But the response so far has been radically different. For years, the US was paralysed by Republican politicians’ denial of reality – a self-defeating stance that culminated in former President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement in 2017. In America’s absence, China sought to lay claim to the Green Revolution, funding the world’s largest programme for greentech research and development, and securing its dominant position in the production of wind turbines and solar panels. But China’s climate leadership is compromised by its reliance on coal and continued construction of new coal-fired power plants both at home and abroad. Moreover, while US policymakers have dithered, the American public has accepted reality. According to the Pew Research Center, a majority of Republican voters and an overwhelming share of Democrats believe the US government should do more to address climate change. That means there is a broad constituency for Biden’s plan to “build back better,” the blueprint of which already contains much of what is needed. THE STAGE IS SET Biden’s commitment sets the stage for government to fill in the missing pieces of a nationwide shift to renewable energy, starting with the establishment of grid-scale energy storage. Also needed are enhanced grid management to accommodate a preponderance of intermittent energy sources; an extension of the grid to substitute electricity for carbon-generating systems in industrial, commercial, and residential buildings; a nationwide expansion of broadband access; and the reconstruction of transportation infrastructure to accommodate lower-carbon forms of mobility (including charging stations for EVs). Having witnessed the difference that competent national leadership makes in the deployment of vaccines, it is possible that US voters will deliver the Democrats even larger legislative majorities in the 2022 midterm elections. The last time that happened was in 1934, when voters heartily endorsed Franklin D Roosevelt’s New Deal. If a Green New Deal then follows, the greentech boom, bubble or not, will leave behind a new world. With new green targets announced by the Singapore Government, when will we be seeing more electric vehicles on our roads? And will town council and condominium committees get involved?

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-climate-change-energy-sources-renewables-sustainable-318006,"First water, now energy as Singapore's key challenge for the next 50 years: Chan Chun Sing","SINGAPORE: After addressing the issue of meeting Singapore’s water needs for the past 50 years, meeting the country's energy needs sustainably will be the country's primary challenge for the next five decades, said Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing. Mr Chan was speaking on CNA's The Climate Conversations podcast. “When we first became independent, our number one priority was to get enough water for ourselves. And over time, I think our water needs have also increased. Now, today we have pretty much gotten the technology to purify water, to recycle water and so forth. But that has just converted the dependence on external water supply to one of external energy supply,” said Mr Chan. “So I've always said that if water has been the challenge for the last 50 years, energy will be our challenge for the next 50 years.” Mr Chan was responding to a question from CNA Digital chief editor Jaime Ho, who had asked what Singapore's ""energy reset"" as defined by the Government would entail, and what the nation's energy transition would look like. Mr Chan reiterated Singapore's challenges as an alternative energy disadvantaged nation, with limited access to renewable sources of energy. “The only renewable that we have is, perhaps, solar, and we have done the calculation, even if we cover every inch of our land area and sea area with solar panels, we will still not be able to generate sufficient renewable energy for our survival, based on the current technology,” he said. As such, Singapore needs to continue finding more efficient ways to reduce its demand for energy, said Mr Chan. A CONSTANT CHURN As part of efforts to tackle climate change, Singapore’s target is to halve its 2030 peak greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and to achieve net zero emissions ""as soon as viable"" in the second half of the century. Responding to a question on what Singapore's energy mix could could look like by 2050, Mr Chan said there will be a need to increase the proportion of renewable energy that is part of Singapore’s energy mix. “We hope that we will be able to up our proportion of renewable energy, and that depends on a few factors,” he explained. While Singapore has deployed solar panels across the island, it is still insufficient and there needs to be a “breakthrough” in current solar panel technology to allow more energy to be generated, said Mr Chan. Other solutions include bringing in clean energy from alternative sources, including from potentially as far away as Australia, Mr Chan noted.  PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY TRANSFORMATION In light of global trends towards decarbonisation and moves away from fossil-fuel intensive industries such as petrochemicals, Mr Chan was asked if there would be longer-term moves in Singapore to lower the country's dependence on the sector. Mr Chan said that the oil majors located in Singapore had started to make the transition towards sustainability some time ago. “Even before this current word ‘sustainability’ became fashionable in Singapore, that transition ... has already started many years ago. If we are looking at the oil majors that are present in Singapore, they have already started some of the transition - even before the Paris treaty came about,” said Mr Chan, referring to the 2015 Paris Agreement. Mr Chan also spoke about jobs in the sector. Shell Singapore said in November last year that it plans to repurpose its core business and halve its crude processing capacity at its Pulau Bukom oil refinery, as part of an overhaul in its journey towards a low-carbon future. As part of the transition, Shell would cut 500 jobs by the end of 2023 at the Pulau Bukom site, which now employs 1,300 staff, a Shell spokesperson told CNA at the time. In response to a question on his concerns regarding such developments in the sector, Mr Chan said that the process of the Government creating jobs for Singaporeans needs to be an ongoing one. “If we look at the economy - including the petrochemical industry - there will be a constant churn. And because Singapore is not the cheapest place to put all your production here, they will always concentrate the highest value-add production in Singapore, because our wages are higher than the rest. So there will always be a churn whereby some of the people with lower wages might be displaced,” added Mr Chan. “But we constantly seek to create better jobs for our people at the higher ranges of the wage ladder, and that must be an ongoing process for us.” When asked about the jobs available in the green economy, Mr Chan noted that it was not about defining what jobs would constitute clean jobs, but more of making each job a cleaner one over time. ""We want every job to be a cleaner job over time. That means the same production - whether is it pet chems (petrochemicals), whether is it semi-con (semi-conductors, whether is it biomedical - we want every (one) of our products and processes to be greener, as we go along,"" he said. ""And we want our companies and workers to be able to embrace the new technologies to produce products that are cleaner and greener. In addition, new growth opportunities can lead to new jobs in the green industry, noted Mr Chan.  ""We won't put a target to say that we want 'X' number of green jobs because actually our target is every job can become a greener job. And there are many more green jobs that today don't yet exist but can come about. And if we have the right skills and the right capabilities in our companies, we will be able to seize those opportunities against the global competition,"" he added. A QUESTION OF MAGNITUDE Mr Chan also responded to questions on Singapore’s carbon tax. He agreed that while the carbon tax could be the most “efficient and fair way” to transit to a greener economy, there needs to be a “clear, transparent and fair” carbon pricing across the board, including internationally. “We all know that Singapore is just a tiny fraction of the global economy. And so while we want to price the carbon externalities right, we actually need to move in tandem with the rest of the world,” he explained. “In the rest of the world, there are many countries with different practices in terms of their carbon pricing. Some of them have higher carbon prices, but they have all kinds of offsets which means that the effective carbon price is not as high as they claim it to be, then that causes all kinds of distortion to people's investment decisions and production decisions.” The hope would be for the world to come together and embrace a common carbon price, so that the “externalities” are shared, said Mr Chan. “Having said that, we all know how difficult it is for the whole world to come and agree on a common carbon price, or even agree on a common mechanism to price carbon,” he said. Announced at Budget 2018, Singapore's carbon tax rate has been set at S$5 per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions from 2019 to 2023. The Government said then that this would be increased to between S$10 and S$15 per tonne by 2030.  There have been a number of calls from Members of Parliament for Singapore to raise the carbon tax, most recently during a wide-ranging parliamentary debate in February.  This debate followed a motion tabled by members of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Sustainability and the Environment to speak on climate change and its impact on Singapore. Speaking at the unveiling of Budget 2021 in Parliament last month, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said Singapore would review the tax's ""trajectory and level"" , and reveal the outcome at next year's Budget. Mr Chan also noted that all sectors would be impacted by an adjustment in the carbon tax, and the main question would be the magnitude of the impact. “I don't think when we adjust the carbon price that only some sectors will be involved because I think all sectors will be involved (and) will be impacted in some way. The question is one of the magnitude, rather than whether they are or they are not impacted,” said Mr Chan. As such, the Government will bear in mind various considerations and make sure that when it reviews the carbon price, it will fulfil its responsibility to future generations, but also take into account the impact on jobs and the cost of living for the current generations, he added. Ultimately, the push for sustainability will come with trade-offs noted Mr Chan, but that does not mean that Singapore has not planned ahead. “I think there will be some trade offs, but … in the usual spirit of Singapore and Singaporeans, we always try to have our cake and eat it, and try to have the best of both worlds,” explained Mr Chan, who was asked about the overall costs that societies will have to bear in the name of climate action.  “If we think back on our journey for the last 50 over years of nation building, in some sense, actually we have been ahead of the curve in having to pay this price.” This has been demonstrated in how Singapore has accounted for nature in urban planning, and made sure buildings are energy efficient, among other measures, he added. “I don't think it is entirely mutually exclusive to say that we want a higher quality of life, we want a greener life and yet at the same time we want to mitigate the cost of living,” Mr Chan said. “All in all, I wouldn't be too pessimistic, to say that it is a binary option between one versus the other. The solutions are definitely not mutually exclusive, and we can, in the best of Singapore spirit, find ways that can combine the best of both worlds.” Listen to the Mr Chan Chun Sing's full conversation with CNA's Jaime Ho in The Climate Conversations podcast:  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/climate-change/ditch-lending-rules-favour-polluters-think-tank-tells-ecb-1883146,"Ditch lending rules that favour polluters, think tank tells ECB","FRANKFURT: The European Central Bank's lending schemes disproportionately favour polluters, think tank New Economics Foundation argued on Tuesday (Mar 9), calling for new rules that benefit ""green"" companies and punish energy intensive firms. With €1.8 trillion (US$2.1 trillion) in outstanding loans to banks, the ECB has become the single biggest source of funding for the eurozone economy and its plan to keep increasing its balance sheet indicates an oversized role for years to come. But the ECB tends to ask for less collateral on carbon intensive corporate assets, implicitly encouraging fossil fuel companies to tap bond markets, the think tank argued. ""The collateral framework is not only at odds with democratically defined goals of the Paris Agreement and the EU’s Green Deal, but it also actively underpins financial market failures and reinforces the carbon lock-in,"" the group said in a report. Alternatives to the current framework include tougher collateral pricing for polluting firms to excluding assets from fossil fuel and energy intensive companies, the report argued. The ECB, which is conducting a broad policy review, has acknowledged that markets are failing to properly price carbon intensive assets and promised to take on a bigger role in fighting climate change. But policymakers disagree on the specific measures it should take and options include a wide array of proposals from forcing banks to make greater climate-related disclosures to skewing asset purchases away from polluters. ""The principle of market neutrality is increasingly challenged on the ground that it may reinforce market failures that decelerate society’s transition to a carbon-neutral economy,"" ECB board member Isabel Schnabel said last week. ""One may question whether the market is the appropriate benchmark."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/india-goa-water-supply-ponds-restore-recharge-wells-dams-314366,"Preserve, revive, restore: Indian ponds spring back to life","CHENNAI: It was only when the buffaloes disappeared from an almost-dry pond in Saligao, in India's state of Goa, that residents hatched a community plan to revive it - one now seen as a model for local efforts to shore up India's precarious water supplies. Working together, local people pulled out trash and invasive species, replanted native plants and restored the pond's natural water flow. ""We thought we will just clean the pond that my aunt, an artist, loved gazing at and sketching,"" said Sharada Kerkar, a 28-year-old member of citizen's group CatcH2o. ""It was meant to be a very small initiative that some of us friends were doing but it has grown into something bigger. We have done five ponds now and keep getting calls to do others."" CatcH2o's success has come just ahead of the harsh Indian summer which, as climate change strengthens, is increasingly associated with parched cities and a worsening drinking water crisis across the country. A government think-tank report in 2018, when India suffered what was called the worst water crisis in its history, predicted that at least 40 per cent of India's 1.3 billion population will have no reliable access to drinking water by 2030. Changing that will likely require not just government efforts to shore up water security but community ones, conceived and carried out by residents, climate adaptation experts say. The transformation of Goa's village ponds coincided with a new plan by the western state's wetland authority to encourage people to protect their own ecosystems. Launched in February, the Shram Shakti se Jal Samrudhi (""water security through hard work"") programme for the first time allots funding for people to carry out projects they develop, as well as to join up the work of different government agencies. ""The idea is to preserve, revive and restore water bodies,"" said Pradip Sarmokadam of the Goa State Biodiversity Board. ""We will provide the technical assistance, but want people to own these water bodies."" GENERATING JOBS In southern Tamil Nadu state, more than 1,000 women from 21 villages in Vellore district four years ago cooperated to build rainwater harvesting structures to boost the lagging flow of the nearby Naganadhi River. Those structures include recharge wells that trap rainwater runoff, including from roofs and roads, to help boost the water table, and check dams that slow down water flow on rivers or streams. ""When we first heard the idea, we scoffed,"" said Vidya Bhaskaran, one of the women from Salamanatham village who worked on the recharge wells. ""We were dependent on borewells, which were giving us muddy water only and thought it was impossible to find water again. But I am glad we were eventually convinced and worked on it."" Chandrasekaran Kuppan, the man behind efforts to rejuvenate the Naganadhi, is now collaborating with district officials to take his model to 300 more villages, training 20,000 women in the process. In a rare collaboration, the government pays the women via its rural employment guarantee scheme, while the humanitarian Art of Living Foundation bankrolls technical studies and Kuppan's charity oversees much of the execution. ""The idea is simple,"" Kuppan told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""When people in my village first mentioned the water crisis to me, I sat down with them to understand what could be done to resolve it."" The answer was to combine the traditional knowledge of villagers with technical advice from geologists, Kuppan said. Such efforts to consult with and source solutions from local people is seen as key to ensuring the success of work to build resilience to climate threats. In Goa, CatcH2o achieved its successes with similar efforts to combine skills and knowledge. After getting technical experts on board, local people recruited migrant workers stranded at home during lockdown to provide labour to revive the pond in Saligao. With plenty of labourers - who were paid the minimum wage - the group managed to avoid using heavy machinery, which could have damaged the pond's ecology. ""The results are there to see,"" Kuppan said. ""The dry villages have good groundwater now, the idea to work with communities is being used across the state and in the process employment is being generated."" ONLY WAY OUT In recent years, many city residents also have come together to clean lakes, better harvest rainwater and increase water storage capacity at home. But tens of thousands are still dependent on deliveries by water tanker trucks, paying for each litre of clean water they need. Many areas in Goa, including tourism spots, struggle with providing drinking water, with chief minister Pramod Sawant telling reporters last month that the state faced a shortage of 76 million litres a day. ""Traditionally Goans have not had any water storage mechanisms, given the great rainfall in the state and open wells,"" Sarmokadam said. ""But things have changed and therefore fresh efforts are needed."" Bhaskaran, who helped revive water supplies in Salamanatham, could not agree more. ""Making recharge wells was hard work but we sang songs, chatted and got it done,"" said Bhaskaran. ""Now we have drinking water available all 24 hours rushing out of taps in every home. And we have set an example for others."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/coffee-climate-change-carbon-footprint-reduction-cup-one-1883136,Commentary: Coffee - your daily cup has a climate cost,"LONDON: For many of us, coffee is essential. It allows us to function in the morning and gives a much needed boost during the day. But in our research documents the effect that our favourite caffeine hit has on the planet. Weight for weight, coffee produced by the least sustainable means generates as much carbon dioxide as cheese and has a carbon footprint only half that of one of the worst offenders – beef. And that’s all before adding milk, which carries its own hefty environmental baggage. Over 9.5 billion kg of coffee is produced around the world each year, with a total trade value of US$30.9 billion. Global coffee demand is expected to triple production by 2050, raising pressure on forests and other habitats in the tropical regions where it’s grown as farmers look for new land to till. Fortunately, there are greener ways of growing coffee. 
  In our study, we calculated and compared the carbon footprints of conventional and sustainable Arabica coffee – the beans baristas use to make a high-quality brew – from two of the world’s largest producers, Brazil and Vietnam. We found that changing how coffee is grown, transported and consumed can slash the crop’s carbon emissions by up to 77 per cent. DECARBONISING A CUPPA Growing a single kilogramme of Arabica coffee in either country and exporting it to the UK produces greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 15.33 kg of carbon dioxide on average. That’s raw, pre-roasted beans (otherwise known as “green coffee”) produced using conventional methods. But by using less fertiliser, managing water and energy use more efficiently during milling and exporting the beans by cargo ship rather than aeroplane, that figure falls to 3.51 kg of CO₂ equivalent per kg of coffee. The average cup of coffee contains about 18g of green coffee, so 1 kg of it can make 56 espressos. Just one espresso has an average carbon footprint of about 0.28 kg, but it could be as little as 0.06 kg if grown sustainably. But what if you like your coffee with milk? Lattes have a carbon footprint of about 0.55 kg, followed by cappucinos on 0.41 kg and flat whites on 0.34 kg. 
  But when the coffee is produced sustainably, these values fall to 0.33 kg, 0.2 kg and 0.13 kg respectively. Using non-dairy milk alternatives is one way to make white coffee more green. CHANGING THE METHODS OF PRODUCTION There are plenty of other ways to shrink the carbon footprint of sustainable coffee even further, like replacing chemical fertilisers with organic waste and using renewable energy to power farm equipment. Roasting coffee beans in their country of origin makes them lighter during transport too, so vessels can burn less fuel transporting the same amount of coffee. Of course, it’s not just carbon emissions that leave a bitter taste. The coffee industry is plagued by other environmental issues, such as water pollution and habitat destruction. Certification schemes exist to ensure coffee meets a minimum ethical standard during its journey from crop field to shop shelf. These schemes need constant improvement as the industry grows. One way to do that would be including our recommendations for growing more climate-friendly coffee, so that people can buy certified coffee with confidence that their daily luxury isn’t costing the Earth.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/planting-trees-safe-climate-change-action-benefits-environment-1883086,Commentary: Planting trees is a safe climate action but are its benefits inflated?,"SINGAPORE: Planting trees has long been described as a strategic and “politically safe” climate action.  Targets for the Singapore Green Plan 2030 announced on Feb 10 included planting 1 million trees by 2030. Elsewhere, the UK government has pledged to plant 30,000 hectares of trees annually until 2025. Even notorious climate change denier Donald Trump committed the US’ support for the World Economic Forum’s One Trillion Trees initiative when he was in office. The argument is simple: Trees store a large amount of carbon, so planting more of them will help remove significant amounts of planet-warming greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.  Amidst an ongoing debate about reforestation, scientists however, are now arguing that the climate benefits of tree planting are inflated, while the potential adverse social and environmental impact is downplayed. 
  A scientific estimate that we could plant enough forests to store 205 gigatonnes of carbon – equal to one-third of all emissions produced by humans so far - was met with criticism for overestimating the land suitable for tree planting, including areas where native ecosystems or indigenous livelihoods would be disrupted.  In addition, predicting the amount of carbon absorbed by forests is extremely challenging and vary based on a multitude of factors such as tree species, climate or soil quality.  Many also claim that planting trees distracts from the more pressing need to phase out fossil fuels which account for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions.  The sheer number of ambitious tree planting initiatives launched in recent years is encouraging but it’s critical that we understand that planting trees offers no panacea to climate change, and if done wrongly, could actually harm the planet.  The world’s largest afforestation project – cultivating trees where none has grown before - spearheaded by China is a prime example of a tree planting initiative with mixed results.  Launched in 1978 to fight desertification in the north of the country, the Three-North Shelter Forest Programme, also known as Great Green Wall, set out to grow 87 million acres of forests, equivalent to the size of Germany, by 2050.  Under political pressure to show quick results, efforts were focused on planting monocultures of fast-growing poplars. While forest coverage has almost doubled, planting a single, non-native species in a dry region attracted pests and diseases, causing many of the trees to die, whilst also exacerbating water scarcity and destroying existing ecosystems. 
  The project did learn from its initial missteps, and the second phase focuses on natural forest regrowth and engaging local communities for improved maintenance of the forests.  A middle ground can be found in the wisdom of organisations that have long looked at the challenge of reforestation like the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in the UK. They’ve listed a few guiding rules that may be helpful. PROTECT EXISTING FORESTS FIRST Countries and organisations which destroy natural forests for agricultural or industrial use cannot make up for the biodiversity damage and carbon emissions caused by planting trees elsewhere - keeping forests in their original state should always be a priority. In Singapore, greater public awareness has also led calls against clearing forests for housing and industrial development – most recently over Kranji, Dover and Clementi forests. In Indonesia, the Bukit Barisan Selatan Sustainable Commodities Partnership (BBS KEKAL) exemplifies the delicate balance required between safeguarding existing forests and ensuring sustainable livelihoods for local farmers without deforestation.  Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park (BBSNP) in Southern Sumatra is one of the last remaining habitats of the critically endangered Sumatran tiger, rhino and elephant, yet is under threat due to agricultural expansion.  An estimated 10 per cent of the park is under active coffee cultivation, contributing up to 5 per cent of Indonesia’s annual coffee production.  Through training and incentives such as preferential access to finance and markets, BBS KEKAL aims to improve the productivity and profitability of smallholder coffee farmers on their existing land, reducing the need to cut down more trees, and supporting a transition to deforestation-free coffee production.  CHOOSE THE RIGHT AREA TO REFOREST Authors of the Kew research also suggest prioritising natural regeneration, the process of natural forest regrowth, either by simply protecting the area from further damage, or with appropriate human intervention.  
  Natural regeneration can be more cost-effective and efficient compared to building a man-made forest from scratch, especially if the degradation is minimal, natural vegetation is still present, or the area is located close to another forest that can serve as a seed source. Where natural regeneration is not feasible, scientists at Kew recommend that reforestation focus on previously forested areas that have suffered degradation, or expand an existing forest by connecting it to the reforested site. In dense urban places such as Singapore, the National Parks Board (NParks) is planting trees and shrubs along sidewalks to create so-called “nature ways”, which connect and facilitate the movement of animals like birds and butterflies between green spaces, and replicate some of the habitat value of natural forests in an urban setting.  It’s also critical to identify “no-go zones” for reforestation. These include naturally tree-less snow-covered areas such as tundras that provide a cooling effect on the planet by reflecting the sun, or in the case of Africa and tropical or subtropical Asia, savannas and wetlands which already contribute to capturing carbon, mostly in the soil.   SELECT THE CORRECT TYPE OF TREES TO PLANT Choosing the right type of trees will ensure greater biodiversity conservation and more resilience towards pests, disease, extreme weather events and climate change. Instead of monoculture tree plantations that might cause soil erosion and degradation, experts suggest focusing on planting a mix of trees, including native, rare, endemic or endangered species.  It’s also crucial to select species that are able to form mutually beneficial relationships with the surrounding flora and fauna, including fungi, pollinators and seed-dispersing animals.   Native species which have a better chance of surviving unfavourable conditions in a heavily damaged site should be prioritised. NParks, for instance, selected various types of native coastal and back mangrove tree species, two of which are critically endangered in Singapore, as part of its mangrove restoration efforts.  Exotic species, such as acacia or eucalyptus, might be promoted for their higher commercial value or because of their fast-growing nature, but often become invasive, meaning that they take over natural habitats, compete with native species, reduce biodiversity and water availability. 
  One example of this is in Isan, one of the poorest regions of Thailand where tropical forests were cleared to harvest eucalyptus as feedstock for paper mills, but the non-native species diminished soil quality and drained all the water, making it impossible for any other crops to grow.  Eventually even the eucalyptus trees failed to survive or were cut down, leaving the forest barren and the soil chalky. Villagers who used to source native medicinal plants or seasonal food from the forest, struggled to look elsewhere for income or food. ENGAGE LOCALS AND COMMIT TO LONG-TERM SUPPORT  Lack of community involvement is often cited as the key reason why reforestation projects fail. If the land considered for tree planting has been used as a source of livelihood by locals, they might resort to cutting down trees elsewhere or try to retake the land once the trees have been planted.  According to Marie-Noëlle Keijzer, co-founder of non-profit WeForest, projects should last a minimum of 10 years for local populations to reap the benefits of preserving cultivated trees, in contrast with “plant and go” schemes which leave the responsibility to care for the trees to local communities. The NGO Eden Reforestation Projects employs local villagers in its reforestation projects to provide them with an economic incentive to safeguard the trees, and invests a percentage from the cost of each tree to hire forest guards for the long-term protection of the forests.  
  “Reforestation is more than just about the number of trees and tree planting. You can't just plant or restore a tree and leave it, or expect that restoration without protection is sufficient to reach our climate goals”, says John Lotspeich, Executive Director at Trillion Trees.   This list is not exhaustive but it is important that we understand why we are planting trees, and if they are the right ones at the right place. Tree planting is an undoubtedly valuable solution to mitigate climate change, but reforestation cannot be a cure-all. It must be combined with efforts to protect existing forests, tackling the root causes of deforestation and cutting carbon emissions at source.   Could conserving green spaces lead to more dangerous wildlife encounters? Conservationists and an NParks director weigh in on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast:   Trang Chu Minh is a consultant on international development projects on topics ranging from climate change mitigation to inclusive education. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/pub-study-ways-protect-singapores-north-west-coast-1883131,PUB to study ways to protect Singapore’s north-west coast,"SINGAPORE: National water agency PUB will study ways to protect Singapore’s north-west coast against rising sea levels, after the completion of coastal protection studies for City-East Coast and Jurong Island, it said on Thursday (Mar 4). PUB also provided an update on these two studies, which were first announced last year. A Coastal Adaptation Study completed in 2019 identified the City-East Coast and Jurong Island coastlines to be more vulnerable and critical based on factors such as the potential impact of a flood event, criticality of assets such as airports and economic districts, and opportunities to dovetail with upcoming developments. “In April last year, PUB was appointed the national coastal protection agency to safeguard Singapore’s coastline against the threat of rising sea levels, while managing inland flood risks. We will implement coastal protection measures in phases, beginning with the more vulnerable parts of our coastlines,” said Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu in her speech during her ministry’s committee of supply (COS) debate. “This year, PUB and JTC will embark on site-specific studies at the coastlines of City-East Coast and Jurong Island. Potential measures to be examined include sea walls, polders and nature-based solutions like mangrove planting,” she said. “In developing these plans, we will search for innovation in complementing our land use, sea space needs, and the natural environment.” PUB is expected to award the tender for the City-East Coast study in the coming months, with the study expected to be completed in four years, it said. Following City-East Coast and Jurong Island, studies to protect the north-west coast, comprising Sungei Kadut and Lim Chu Kang, are next in line. These two areas include “key assets” such as Kranji Reservoir and Woodlands Checkpoint, while Sungei Kadut is also home to a number of industries such as timber, construction, and waste management, said PUB. Speaking earlier during the joint-segment on sustainability at the COS debate, Ms Fu noted that the target is to complete the formulation of “adaptation pathways” at coastlines along City-East Coast, Lim Chu Kang, Sungei Kadut, and around Jurong Island by 2030. “PUB, as the lead coastal protection agency, will work with other agencies to conduct site-specific studies, and develop coastal adaptation pathways and protection measures that are adaptive to climate uncertainties,” she added. A coastal protection department has also been set up within PUB to address both coastal and inland flood risks holistically. In an interview on Mediacorp Channel 5's News Tonight, Ms Fu stressed that Singapore's flat topography means that there is a need to find adaptive measures to guard against the threat of sea-level rise.  ""We are a very flat country. We only have a little Bukit Timah Hill that is 100-over meters. So there's really nowhere to run,"" she said. ""And we have to prepare, while we do all those things that we said ... about mitigating carbon emissions, we need to find adaption measures, and we'll start with studying parts of the island."" Ms Fu noted that there needs to be a ""very clear understanding"" of how rising sea levels affect the different segments of Singapore's coastline. ""What we want to do is really to have a very clear understanding of how rising sea level(s) affects a specific area, and to plan for adaptation that's relevant to the area. We have divided the country in seven parts, and we have started with City-East coast ... Jurong island,"" she explained. ""The next one that we will be moving on to would be the northwestern (part) which is Sungei Kadut - each part of it, setting up the study, setting up the measurements, understanding how sea level rises affect the specific places, and work with stakeholders."" Last year, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat announced that a new Coastal and Flood Protection Fund, with an initial injection of S$5 billion, would be set up as Singapore prepares to deal with the “significant” risk of rising sea levels. The fund will be topped up whenever Singapore’s fiscal situation allows for it, Mr Heng had said. NEW FLOOD MODEL In addition to conducting studies along the coastlines, PUB will be developing a Coastal-Inland Flood Model to better equip the organisation for coastal protection planning and operations in the face of climate change. The model will comprise a “suite of tools” that incorporates advancing climate science and data to enable “holistic and updated” flood risk assessment by analysing the combined effects of extreme sea levels and intense floods in Singapore caused by rainfall. It will be capable of simulating flood events based on projected rainfall and coastal events, while evaluating the effectiveness of proposed coastal infrastructure under various climate scenarios, added PUB. “Climate change has caused more intense rainfall, and more serious and frequent flooding … It is important to develop a comprehensive and coordinated understanding of Singapore’s level of flood resilience,” added Ms Fu. “To holistically manage both inland and coastal flood risks, PUB will be developing the Coastal-Inland Flood Model this year. This computational model will simulate flood risk events and evaluate effectiveness of coastal infrastructure designs against different climatic scenarios. This will equip PUB with capabilities to plan and implement adaptation measures.” A tender has been called for the development of the model, and it is expected to be awarded in the first half of this year, noted PUB.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/clean-energy-singapore-mti-solar-low-carbon-305956,Trade-offs and challenges ahead as Singapore moves towards cleaner energy: Tan See Leng,"SINGAPORE: Singapore needs to obtain energy that is secure and reliable, affordable and environmentally sustainable but seeking to achieve each means trade-offs for the others, said Dr Tan See Leng, Second Minister for Trade and Industry on Thursday (Mar 4). Dr Tan highlighted this as he laid out how Singapore will move away from natural gas and find low-carbon energy sources to help alleviate climate change. ""Therein lies the challenge for all of us here in Singapore – how can we obtain energy that is: One, secure and reliable; two, affordable; and three, that is environmentally sustainable, for ourselves over the long haul.  ""These three objectives constitute our 'energy trilemma', as seeking to achieve each will entail trade-offs for the others,"" said Dr Tan in a joint segment on sustainability during the Committee of Supply debate. Singapore is greening its energy sources by developing four “supply switches” – natural gas, solar energy, regional grids and low-carbon alternatives such as hydrogen, he said. Singapore's main source of renewable energy is solar power and it is speeding up efforts to make full use of suitable solar deployment spaces, Dr Tan said. This means more solar panels on rooftops and open spaces, such as reservoirs, and using untapped spaces including existing land, canals and roads. With more solar energy, Singapore will also have to increase Energy Storage Systems (ESS) capacity, and the Energy Market Authority (EMA) will test-bed solutions with the industry and researchers, said Dr Tan, who is also a Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for Manpower. EMA is piloting Singapore’s first floating ESS, which can power over 600 four-room Housing Board flats, and this will enable EMA to study how batteries can be stacked to reduce land use. FIRST ELECTRIC VEHICLE SERVICE STATIONS Dr Tan also announced that a grant was awarded to a consortium led by local SME Eigen Energy to pilot Singapore’s first clean-energy powered service stations at three HDB towns, to be ready by the first quarter of next year. These stations will provide one of the fastest public EV charging services here, he said. Three Shell service stations in Tampines, Pasir Ris, and Lakeview will have these fast charging EV points, EMA, Enterprise Singapore and Shell said in a press release on Thursday. ""As we increase solar and ESS deployment, our power system will become more decentralised. To enhance our capabilities in grid planning, in maintenance and asset management, we are developing a digital twin of Singapore’s physical electricity grid,"" Dr Tan added. Dr Tan said that EMA is also developing regional grids with countries in Southeast Asia. ""This will allow us to tap on the abundance of hydropower and other renewable energies that some of our Southeast Asian neighbours have,"" he said.  EMA will issue a request for proposal for a two-year trial of 100MW of electricity imports from Malaysia this month and is initiating cross-border power trade of up to 100MW under the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project.  These are pilots and the first steps towards a regional power grid, and MTI plans to import more electricity to diversify its energy sources, said Dr Tan. Addressing Nominated Member of Parliament Koh Lian Pin's concerns about the carbon footprint of Singapore's electricity imports, Dr Tan said that for the upcoming trial with Malaysia, EMA will put in place steps to verify the cleanliness of the inputs. This includes requiring importers to submit proof of carbon output, and cleaner proposals will be scored more favourably, he said. Mr Louis Ng (PAP-Nee Soon) asked in a supplementary question if the ministry is studying the environmental impact of importing hydropower from Laos. ""I hope that MTI can consider not just importing the renewable energy but making sure that it doesn't have that big an impact on the environment in other countries,"" he said. To this, Dr Tan said that EMA will be getting all prospective energy importers to submit information on their energy sources and environmental studies to assess their impact. He added that these measures will make Singapore's economy more sustainable, but solar deployment requires space, and with Singapore's land constraints, there will be added costs.  ELECTRICITY PRICES WILL RISE Dr Tan then addressed MPs' questions on electricity prices in Singapore and how consumers can be encouraged to cut electricity usage. The minister explained that while wholesale electricity market prices are depressed today due to a glut in the electricity market, but this overcapacity is not likely to last. ""Wholesale electricity prices will also rise and normalise, with rising demand driven by the growth of sectors such as data centres, 5G networks, agri-tech, as well as the adoption of EVs"" he said. ""Over the medium to long run, electricity prices normalising is inevitable ... No company that's commercially run will sell electricity below cost perpetually. What we need to prevent is a swing from a glut to a severe shortage of capacity and this will result in sharp price spikes; perhaps even blackouts as we saw in Texas."" EMA has studied how other places have managed this and is consulting the industry on the way forward, he said, adding that more details will be announced later this year. ""We are committed to smoothening these price surges and volatility,"" Dr Tan said. ""Even if prices must go up, we will do our best to ensure that this increase is gradual, and the Government will act where necessary to minimise excessive surges."" Dr Tan also pointed out that fuel prices dipped to their lowest in 20 years last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic but they will rise as global demand recovers and this will lead to electricity prices rising. ""The Government will do our best to manage our 'energy trilemma' by introducing more renewable energy in our energy mix, enhancing the efficiency of our power systems, and minimising the impact on prices,"" he said.  ""However, 'right-pricing' energy is critical to encouraging prudent use of electricity. We must adopt energy conservation as a way of life for all of us here in Singapore."" For example, Singapore households can switch from using gas to electricity appliances for cooking, he said.  ""It is also safer as the risks of gas leaks and fires are reduced. And some of the newer electrical cooking appliances, they do produce very, very good wok hei - the heat that is required to give you very good hor fun,"" said Dr Tan. TRANSFORMING INDUSTRIES Speaking after Dr Tan, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said that existing industries need to produce and operate more sustainably. He announced that Sentosa will become a carbon-neutral destination by 2030, when he expects that global tourism will have revived. ""Through such efforts. we will strengthen Singapore as an exemplary sustainable tourism destination,"" said Mr Chan. Singapore is taking active steps to transform the Energy and Chemicals sector, he added. ""We are also stepping up decarbonisation and resource optimisation efforts at the plant and systems levels, to transform Jurong Island into a sustainable energy and chemicals park."" The country also needs to tap on new opportunities for green growth, such as carbon services sector and green financing, he said. ""Singaporeans can take advantage of these bright spots by upskilling and re-skilling themselves,"" he said. He concluded that Singapore aspires to be a ""bright green spark"", by being an inspiration to the world on how it overcomes sustainability constraints.  ""This is why under the Research, Innovation, and Enterprise Plan 2025, we are attracting companies to anchor their R&D activities in Singapore,"" he said.  ""We will continue to support the start-up and innovation ecosystems in sustainability-related sectors. We endeavour to help others overcome their sustainability constraints, both regionally and globally."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/recycling-beverage-containers-deposit-refund-scheme-nea-257856,"Scheme to encourage take-back, recycling of beverage containers to be implemented in 2023","SINGAPORE: A scheme to encourage people to recycle their beverage containers such as plastic bottles and aluminium cans will be implemented in 2023, with a legislative framework to be introduced by the year before that.   Known internationally as a Deposit Refund Scheme (DRS), it generally involves having producers finance the take-back of used beverage containers with refunds offered to consumers when they return them at designated points. Speaking in Parliament during her speech during the Committee of Supply debate, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said the “transition period” between the start of the scheme and the introduction of a legislative framework will give industry time to set up the collection and recycling infrastructure. “We will continue to engage stakeholders and we welcome all to participate in shaping Singapore’s own DRS framework,” she noted. In a joint media factsheet, the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) and the National Environment Agency (NEA) said packaging waste, including plastics, is one of its “priority waste streams” as it accounts for about one-third of the domestic waste being disposed of. “NEA has been engaging the community and industry to develop the DRS framework such as through surveys and requests-for-information. There was useful feedback provided on various parameters of the DRS framework … We take this feedback into consideration in the development of the DRS framework,” said the authorities. They added that it will continue to consult stakeholders, including the public and industry in the coming months. “We welcome stakeholders to share their views and work with us in shaping the DRS framework, as we consider how best to design a system that is cost-effective and suitable for Singapore,” they stated.  NEA noted last year that a DRS has been implemented in several countries such as Norway, Sweden and Germany, achieving a high recycling rate of beverage containers of more than 80 per cent. STUDY ON CHEMICAL RECYCLING In her speech, Ms Fu said another important aspect in recycling packaging waste would be building up local recycling capabilities. “More than half of our domestic packaging waste disposed of is plastics. We are pursuing both mechanical and chemical recycling solutions, the latter which can take in contaminated plastics that are not suitable for mechanical recycling,” she said. Ms Fu noted that NEA and Shell are jointly studying the feasibility of chemical recycling in Singapore, including the carbon savings potential of diverting plastic waste from incineration to produce pyrolysis oil, or NEWOil, as feedstock for petrochemical plants. MSE and NEA said preliminary findings from the study indicated that chemical recycling is “technically feasible”, as the composition of polymer types in domestic waste is suitable for pyrolysis technology to be deployed. The study also showed that carbon savings can be obtained by using waste plastic to produce pyrolysis oil as feedstock for chemical plants, compared to using crude oil-based feedstock, added MSE and NEA. The carbon savings are primarily derived from the diversion of plastic waste from incineration. “Chemical recycling can help to close the plastic waste loop in Singapore as it is able to treat contaminated plastic waste, which cannot be mechanically recycled, into higher-value products such as pyrolysis oil which can then be used to manufacture new plastic products,” said the ministry and agency."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/electric-vehicle-charging-points-hdb-carparks-8-towns-306771,All HDB car parks in at least 8 towns to have electric vehicle charging points by 2025,"SINGAPORE: As part of efforts to expand Singapore’s electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, all Housing and Development Board (HDB) car parks in at least eight towns will be fitted with EV chargers by 2025.  The eight - Ang Mo Kio, Bedok, Choa Chu Kang, Jurong West, Punggol, Queenstown, Sembawang and the upcoming Tengah town - are part of a ""town-centric"" approach being taken for the installation of charging points, said Minister for Transport Ong Ye Kung in Parliament on Thursday (Mar 4).   “By the 2030s, we will strive to make every HDB town an EV-ready town,” he said.   The towns were chosen as they are spread across Singapore and have a high concentration of car parks with existing electrical capacity to support charging point deployment, said the Land Transport Authority (LTA).  In the near term, charging points will be installed in a variety of public car parks islandwide where suitable and where there is spare electrical capacity, it added.  The agency noted that the first tender for charging points - more than 600 of them at about 200 public car parks - was issued by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and LTA in November last year.  An industry consultation on the private sector’s participation in public charger deployment will be launched later this month.  These initiatives are in line with the aim of deploying 60,000 EV charging points across Singapore by 2030, of which 40,000 will be in public car parks while another 20,000 will be in private premises.  “If we assume one-third of cars are EVs by 2030, this translates into a EV to charging point ratio of about 5:1,” said Mr Ong, noting that estimates of the optimum ratio between EVs and charging points range from five to 10 vehicles per point. For the national public charging standards, Mr Ong said Singapore has settled on Type 2 for AC charging and CCS 2 for DC or fast charging. With a range of about 400km to 500km per charge, a typical EV user would need to charge about once every five days, he said, adding that charging points would need to be shared, especially in public car parks.  “That way, we will be able to minimise electrical infrastructure upgrades, we can tap on the spare electrical capacity in all our public carparks, and install charging points as quickly as possible.” EV COMMON CHARGER GRANT A new EV Common Charger Grant will be introduced to kickstart the expansion of shared charging infrastructure in existing “non-landed private residences” such as condominiums. To be administered by the LTA, the grant will co-fund the installation of 2,000 chargers in such residences between July this year and December 2023, subject to a cap.  More details on the grant will be announced in the second quarter of this year, LTA said. It noted that all new HDB carparks will provide sufficient electrical capacity to support EV slow charging for 15 per cent of their car parking lots, and install a minimum number of chargers in these lots. This requirement will be imposed in due course on new private developments, as well as existing buildings undergoing major redevelopment, LTA said, adding that more details will be released at a later date. NATIONAL ELECTRIC VEHICLE CENTRE A new National Electric Vehicle Centre (NEVC), set up under the LTA, will lead the drive to promote wider EV adoption.  “In addition to planning for the expansion of the nationwide EV charging infrastructure, NEVC will also lead efforts to review EV regulations and standards and develop a robust EV ecosystem in Singapore,” said LTA.  The new centres will work with partners to ""equip our workforce with new capabilities, anchor new EV-related activities in Singapore, and facilitate the safe and innovative development of new EV-related technologies,"" it added.  Meanwhile, legislation is being amended to transfer the role of EV charging systems regulator from the Energy Market Authority to LTA, “to give dedicated focus to this work”, said Mr Ong.  LTA is leading a comprehensive review of TR25 - a set of technical and safety standards governing EV charging in Singapore - together with industry players, experts and other stakeholders, he said, adding that the review is expected to be completed by the end of this year. “Regulatory sandboxes” will be set up to allow commercial players to test and introduce various EV charging solutions while the review is ongoing, he said. “It is very important we get this right, because it will determine the level of private sector involvement in finding solutions to build up the infrastructure and drive EV charging and adoption,” he added. CHANGES TO ROAD TAX Noting that there has already been a ""significant downward revision"" of road taxes for electric cars this year, Mr Ong said the issue has been further reviewed.  ""We should set the electric car road tax schedule such that electric and ICE (internal combustion engine) cars with roughly the same look, feel and level of luxury are subject to the same road taxes,"" he said.  ""This is an inherently subjective exercise and wouldn't be very scientific, but it reflects the policy objective, which is that a large part of road tax is a luxury tax,"" he said.  From Jan 1 next year, the road tax brackets for electric cars will be merged such that vehicles with a power rating of 90-230kW will pay the same road tax as those with a power rating of 30-90kW.  This will result in a reduction of up to 34 per cent in road tax for electric cars in the 90-230kW bracket, the LTA said.  This means the annual road tax for a Hyundai Kona Electric will fall from about S$1,400 to S$1,100; while that of a Tesla Model 3 will drop from S$2,300 to S$1,500, noted Mr Ong, adding that this would make their road taxes comparable to ICE models with a similar look and feel.  ""What is important is that we have now established the principles and policy for charging road tax on electric cars. As more models emerge, we will review the road tax schedule, with a view not to over-charge electric vis-à-vis ICE cars,"" he said.  The LTA said these changes will also apply to petrol-electric cars that currently pay road tax based on their maximum electric power rating. Those who have already paid road tax for the period beyond Jan 1, 2022, based on the existing road tax schedule will have the excess offset from the amount payable at the next renewal.  “If the vehicle is transferred to another owner before its next road tax renewal, any excess road tax paid will be offset against the transfer fee payable, and any amount remaining will be transferred along with the vehicle to the new registered owner,” said LTA."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-depends-global-effort-climate-change-teo-chee-hean-1883116,Singapore depends on global effort to tackle climate change: Teo Chee Hean,"SINGAPORE: While Singapore must do its best to address climate change, the country ultimately depends on a global collective effort to tackle the issue, Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean said on Thursday (Mar 4). Singapore contributes around 0.1 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, said Mr Teo, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Security. However, the totality of global emissions - including the other 99.9 per cent - also affects Singapore, and “often more seriously than it affects larger countries”, said Mr Teo, adding that climate change poses an “asymmetrical challenge” for a small country like Singapore. As such, Singapore is working with international players to combat the issue. 
  Mr Teo is chairman of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change, which was established in 2007 to coordinate a whole-of-nation response. “Singapore has been working hard to strengthen consensus and galvanise climate action regionally and globally,” said Mr Teo in his Committee of Supply speech in Parliament. “This has been especially critical at a time when the multilateral system is under strain from protectionism and unilateral action, further exacerbated by the challenges of COVID- 19,” he added. Singapore has often facilitated discussions on the work and implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, as it is a “knowledgeable, fair and honest broker”, said Mr Teo. The country’s officials have also been working on issues such as carbon market rules, more stringent reporting of national emissions, climate action and multilateral discussions on reducing international transportation emissions.  
  ""TRADE-OFFS ARE REAL"" In his speech, Mr Teo also touched on Singapore’s pursuit of decarbonisation despite its constraints, particularly its limited alternative energy sources, land and manpower. ""Singapore is both a city and a country. Within our small land space, we need to accommodate not just housing, parks and commercial centres, but also power plants, reservoirs, air- and sea- ports, and industries."" ""The trade-offs are real, and often the choices are difficult,” he said.  Unlike larger countries, Singapore does not have plots of land for solar farms, he said. To overcome this problem, Singapore is harnessing as much solar energy as it can by putting solar panels on public housing blocks, and aims to deploy at least 2 gigawatt-peak of solar power in Singapore by 2030. This is about the energy equivalent to about 350,000 households’ consumption levels for a year. The country has also used its reservoirs to house solar farms, he said, referencing Tengeh Reservoir, which began construction last year. The reservoir is supposed to generate enough solar power to meet the demands of five local water treatment plants. As for its water and food security concerns, Singapore has invested in desalination plants and agri-food technology, Mr Teo said. He pointed to the fourth desalination plant at Marina East that started operating last year and the new Agri-Food Cluster Transformation Fund. He also spoke of policymakers’ engagement with the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and institutes of higher learning to develop efficient approaches for water and food production. ""These will help us break out of our constraints to secure our food, through careful long-term planning and innovations in policy and technology, and keep costs affordable while minimising carbon emissions,” he said. Mr Teo added that Singapore has to continue balancing economic development and environmental conservation. While it is among the top 20 countries in the world today in terms of emissions intensity – or emissions per GDP dollar - it will find new ways to grow the economy while taking into account carbon constraints.  For one, steps are being taken to establish Singapore as a centre for carbon credits trading and services, for sustainability consultancy, and to play a role in green finance for sustainable development in Asia, Mr Teo said. These will in turn create high-quality jobs, he added."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/green-building-masterplan-new-targets-sustainability-bca-1883121,Sustainability targets for built environment sector under newest Green Building Masterplan,"SINGAPORE: Amid a nationwide push for sustainability, more ambitious targets to green the built environment sector have been set under the latest edition of the Singapore Green Building Masterplan (SGBMP). The fourth edition of the SGBMP comes as part of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, which charts Singapore’s green targets over the next decade. During a joint segment on sustainability on Thursday (Mar 4), National Development Minister Desmond Lee said in Parliament that buildings account for more than 20 per cent of Singapore’s emissions. “We need to push hard to make our city more sustainable. To achieve this, we will use cleaner energy and increase our energy efficiency,” he said. In line with this push, the masterplan, dubbed “80-80-80 in 2030”, was developed by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and the Singapore Green Building Council, along with industry stakeholders. “The SGBMP captures our collective commitment to pursue more ambitious sustainability standards in our Built Environment,” said Mr Lee. TARGET 1: GREEN 80% OF BUILDINGS BY 2030 An existing goal is to green 80 per cent of buildings by gross floor area (GFA) by 2030. This ensures that “the majority of buildings that we use in our everyday lives will be sustainable and energy efficient,” Mr Lee said. As of December last year, the figure stood at more than 43 per cent, which marks “good progress” - but more can be done, he said. 
  TARGET 2: 80% OF NEW BUILDINGS TO BE SUPER LOW ENERGY  Beyond this, more building owners should be pushed to pursue “best-in-class standards”, and become Super Low Energy (SLE) buildings, said Mr Lee. These buildings, which achieve at least a 60 per cent improvement in energy efficiency compared to 2005 levels, represent “the next wave” of the green building movement. 
  “They are the key to our transition to a more sustainable, low-carbon built environment,” he said. That is why the masterplan’s second target is for 80 per cent of new buildings to be SLE ones from 2030. Mr Lee added that the Government will “take the lead”, without providing more details. “In so doing, we will build industry capability to develop SLE buildings and provide more use cases for the private sector to take reference from.” TARGET 3: 80% IMPROVEMENT IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY  The third target is for best-in-class green buildings to see an 80 per cent improvement in energy efficiency, compared to 2005 levels, by 2030. This is an increase from the improvement of at least 60 per cent that they can currently achieve. “We will ramp up research and innovation efforts to push the boundaries of energy efficiency, and accelerate deployment of cost-effective green technologies,” said Mr Lee. 
  In particular, this will be done through the Green Buildings Innovation Cluster (GBIC), a research, development and demonstration platform for energy-efficient technologies set up in 2014. “We are seeing how we can further enhance funding support for GBIC to help us achieve this third target,” he said. In his speech, Mr Lee also outlined other plans to make Singapore’s urban environment more sustainable, such as greening HDB towns and investing in R&D. In line with the country’s vision to become a “City in Nature”, Mr Lee also detailed efforts to continue weaving nature into Singapore’s urban fabric, on top of protecting ecologically important areas. These moves all have one thing in common: They require ""all hands on deck"", he said. “Sustainability is a marathon which we cannot run alone. We must be in it for the long haul – to be responsible stewards not just for our children, but their children after them.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/schools-solar-power-green-plan-2030-carbon-neutral-singapore-1883126,Solar power for most schools as MOE aims for 2030 carbon-neutral target,"SINGAPORE: Progressively equipping schools with solar panels over the next decade is one way the Ministry of Education (MOE) plans to reach its target of getting at least 20 per cent of schools to be carbon-neutral by 2030. The target was first announced in February at the unveiling of the Singapore Green Plan 2030. MOE is also working towards a two-thirds reduction of net carbon emissions from the schools sector by 2030. Speaking in the joint segment on sustainability during the Committee of Supply debates on Thursday (Mar 4), Minister for Education Lawrence Wong said MOE will start by piloting sustainability features and related concepts in four schools - Elias Park Primary School, Mee Toh School, Commonwealth Secondary School and Tampines Secondary School. ""These schools have already adopted a holistic school-wide approach to sustainability. We will work with them to further reduce net carbon emissions from the school buildings, and to encourage students to actively reduce their individual carbon footprint,"" he said in his speech. ""We will learn from the experiences in the pilot, and progressively scale up good and practical solutions across all our schools."" 
  GREEN CAMPUSES The ministry will also continue to enhance school infrastructure with green features, Mr Wong said. With about 130 schools currently on the SolarNova programme with solar panels progressively installed on their rooftops, MOE will extend this to cover most of the remaining schools in the coming decade, he announced. MOE will also gradually install LED lights as the main light source in classrooms and more energy-efficient direct current fans, he added. ""MOE will continue to green our schools and testbed new innovations, so that our school buildings can be more sustainable and our school campuses can become learning laboratories for our students to see sustainability in practice,"" said Mr Wong. 
  HOLISTIC APPROACH The Education Ministry aims to reduce carbon emissions from schools significantly through the Eco Stewardship Programme, added Mr Wong. The programme aims to inculcate ""informed and responsible sustainability habits"" in students for life and ""empower them to make a positive difference"", he said. Under the programme, environmental sustainability will be ""holistically integrated"" into schools through the 4Cs - curriculum, campus, culture and community. While environment and climate change education is already integrated into subjects such as science, geography and social studies, Mr Wong agreed that MOE can do more to enhance the teaching and learning of sustainability in science and humanities subjects. ""For example, in the new upper secondary geography syllabus, the topics will be organised around the theme of sustainability where students will understand the impact of sustainability issues. We will also refresh and strengthen the Singapore perspective on sustainable development,"" he added. MOE will develop more learning resources that feature sustainability initiatives within the school environment, which will help students ""connect their learning to their actual lived experience in schools"", said the Education Minister. MAKING SUSTAINABILITY A HABIT Everyday responsibilities for students will also be expanded to include sustainability habits, he added. ""It could be simple activities like switching off lights and fans upon leaving the classrooms. And in fact, some schools have also encouraged students to reduce and recycle food waste,"" said Mr Wong. These practices will be expanded to more schools, and MOE will pilot ways for students to see that their daily habits can make a ""discernible impact"" on the environment, he added. ""We will also help students champion sustainability mindset and practices through leadership opportunities so that they can encourage their peers and friends towards more sustainable living."" MOE will work with partners to widen and enhance the platforms for students to participate in and undertake ""meaningful"" community projects to care for the environment and promote sustainable living, said Mr Wong. The ministry will also work with partners to strengthen students' awareness of future green jobs, he added. ""We have set ambitious plans for ourselves. They are not just hard targets in reducing carbon emissions, but equally if not more importantly, they are about nurturing our young with the values, skills and knowhow to become responsible stewards of the environment,"" said Mr Wong in closing. ""We hope to see in every student an eco steward for life, where they will have a sensible sensitivity towards the environment, and understand what it means to live sustainably."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/green-plan-2030-climate-change-existing-initiatives-grace-fu-305691,Green Plan not a 'compilation of existing initiatives' but long-term plan that will evolve: Grace Fu,"SINGAPORE: The Green Plan 2030 is not a “compilation of existing initiatives”, but a long-term and living plan that will evolve as Singapore progresses, said Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu on Thursday (Mar 4). “Some have asked if the Green Plan is just a compilation of existing initiatives ... it is not,” said Ms Fu, who was speaking during the joint segment on sustainability at the Committee of Supply debate. The plan, which is spearheaded by the education, national development, transport, sustainability and the environment, trade and industry ministries, charts Singapore’s green targets over the next 10 years.  “We will update our targets and strategies as new technologies and practicable solutions avail themselves. The Green Plan is also not just an MSE (Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment) or even a government plan, but a blueprint that we have set out for ourselves as a nation,” said Ms Fu. “Everyone must work together to achieve our vision. While some targets are existing, new and enhanced targets have been included.” Some new initiatives under the plan, which was unveiled last month, include requiring all new car registrations to be cleaner-energy models from 2030, and more than doubling the targeted number of electric vehicle charging points by 2030. The plan also builds on Singapore’s 2030 aim to reduce the waste sent to the landfill by 30 per cent, aiming for a 20 per cent reduction by 2026. Singapore will also aim for at least 20 per cent of schools to be carbon neutral by 2030 “for a start”, with the rest of the schools to follow, working towards a two-thirds reduction of net carbon emissions in the sector by 2030.  A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT Ms Fu noted that the Green Plan is a “commitment” from the Government to present and future generations to chart a common vision for a sustainable future and a roadmap for everyone. “Through the Green Plan, sustainability will shape our economy, our infrastructure, our way of life. It will fundamentally change how we live, work and play,” she added. Ms Fu also noted that the Government will set the broad policy direction and the public sector will “lead the change”. She also announced that the public sector will set a carbon emissions target for the first time as part of the Green Plan. It is also important that the Green Plan sparks a national conversation and energises Singaporeans to take action, said Ms Fu. She pointed out that sustainability is not without costs, and just as Singaporeans pay for security and social services, they will have to pay a bit more for greener goods and services, adjust to less convenience in daily lives, or re-skill for green jobs in new industries. These costs cannot be incurred without a “national consensus”, Ms Fu said. “While climate change may feel abstract for individuals, it is our individual actions that determine the collective outcome … Our consumption pattern drive industry,” she added. The minister also said the sustainability sector could bring new business opportunities that will benefit Singapore and Singaporeans. The Green Plan would be a “solemn pledge” to future generations of Singaporeans that there will always be a Singapore, if they work together. “We will face many grave threats, but we will transform challenges into opportunities. This is the Singapore DNA,” she said. “We will take bold and collective action to create a sustainable and liveable home. This is a pledge that Singaporeans today must keep, to give our children the confidence to pursue their dreams, raise their families with hope and optimism and look forward to a brighter, better future.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/saf-sustainability-office-cleaner-fuels-fighter-jets-250456,"SAF to set up sustainability office, trial cleaner fuels for some fighter jets in latest push to go green","SINGAPORE: The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) will set up a sustainability office and trial cleaner fuels for some of its fighter jets in its latest efforts to go green. SAF and the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) will also reduce water consumption by using more efficient water fittings, and install smart meters in all their buildings to monitor greenhouse gas emissions as well as waste and water consumption and reach required targets. “By 2030, MINDEF/SAF will reduce the growth of overall carbon emissions by two-thirds compared to business as usual,” the ministry said in a factsheet on Monday (Mar 1). “By 2050, we aim to halve the 2030 emissions in line with national strategy.” This comes as Singapore on Feb 10 unveiled the Singapore Green Plan 2030, a whole-of-nation movement to fight climate change and push towards halving the country’s 2030 peak greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. “In line with the Singapore Green Plan 2030 (SGP30), MINDEF and SAF will more than do our part,” the ministry said on Friday. “We will meet the national targets set under the SGP30, without compromising operational readiness.” MINDEF also announced last year that it would replace its admin vehicles with hybrid models, install solar panels on more of its buildings and introduce a food waste management system in more camps. MINDEF said the new SAF Sustainability Office will drive the planning and compliance of these sustainability efforts. The office will report to the SAF’s Chief of Staff-Joint Staff, who will assume the role of SAF Chief Sustainability Officer. “The office will be advised by an external advisory panel made up of experts in various fields,” MINDEF said. Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said on Monday that the office will implement a structure to achieve sustainability outcomes and ""not get distracted along the way"". ""There is another force that can dissipate our efforts. If each group champions its favourite environmental cause, the SAF could be pulled in different and unproductive directions,"" he said in his ministry's Committee of Supply speech. ""MINDEF/SAF must start off on and maintain the correct trajectory, guided by science, data and evidence on effective outcomes."" CLEANER JET FUEL MINDEF said the SAF will reduce emissions from its platforms where technology is available and cost effective, and without losing operational effectiveness or incurring a “sharp rise” in spending. MINDEF pointed out that for combat platforms, cost-effective green fuels are not commercially available yet. Nevertheless, it said the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) will trial green aviation fuel for some of its F-16 fighter jets. “This is to understand the engineering, logistics and infrastructure works needed to scale up its use when green fuels become more cost effective,” MINDEF said. The Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) will adopt readily available technology, such as energy-efficient LED lights for its entire fleet. “For newer ships like the littoral mission vessels, the RSN will introduce zero emissions ozone-free water-mist fire suppression systems and look into using advanced garbage converters that reduce the waste volume by up to 80 per cent,” MINDEF added. REDUCING WASTE AND WATER MINDEF also announced that it would extend food waste segregation and recycling processes to all its cookhouses by 2024. It has engaged waste disposal contractors to recycle and repurpose electronic waste, waste oil, chemicals and scrap metal. “We will also increase the number of recycling bins in all camps and bases,” it stated. “The aim is to reduce waste by 30 per cent by 2030.” To reduce our usage, MINDEF and the SAF will progressively replace water fittings with more efficient ones that have at least three ticks under the Water Efficiency Labelling Scheme. The target is to reduce water consumption by 10 per cent by 2030. “We have also implemented rainwater harvesting systems in selected camps and will continue to invest in water-recycling systems, such as those for vehicular washing and sanitation,” MINDEF said. SMART METERS MINDEF and the SAF will also install smart utility metering systems progressively for all its buildings. MINDEF said this will enable units to know how much they contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and waste or water consumption, allowing unit commanders to take ownership and make necessary changes. “When the roll-out of smart metering systems is complete, unit commanders will be equipped to know how they compare with their peers and benchmarks, and to reach their required targets,” it added. GOING DIGITAL Digital solutions will also be implemented in other areas of MINDEF and the SAF to improve organisational effectiveness. These include an RSAF military transport fleet management app that streamlines administrative processes for transport operators and supervisors by digitalising manual recording, for instance in logbook entries, driver’s performance cards and vehicle maintenance forms. The app also automates the tracking of mileage, duration of journey as well as vehicles’ maintenance schedules. At Paya Lebar Air Base, where it is on trial, the app has reduced the time taken for administrative processes by 75 per cent and the probability of human errors, MINDEF said. It will be progressively rolled out across the RSAF. In the bigger picture, MINDEF said it will leverage commercial cloud platforms to host less sensitive digital services, functions and data, enabling faster delivery of new digital services, increased system availability and scalability. “The MINDEF Commercial Cloud will be ready to host the first tranche of pilot digital products for internal organisational needs from mid-2021,” it said. MINDEF and SAF will also develop a dedicated cloud housed on their own servers, to store classified information and workloads will. “This will allow us to reap the benefits of cloud computing securely while greatly reducing the exposure of our data to external sources and cybersecurity risks,” MINDEF said. MINDEF said it began operating a Digital Factory in September 2020 to design, test and scale even more digital products that optimise service experience, business processes and productivity. “The factory is a collaborative facility to securely build and deploy software up to three times faster than before,” it said. “It is a set-up where project leads, developers and user experience designers can come together.” The Digital Factory has since developed six user-centric prototypes, which will be piloted starting from mid-2021, MINDEF added. Dr Ng said the factory has allowed researchers to build and deploy software up to three times faster than before. ""We are already employing artificial intelligence, robotics, and data analytics to enable new warfighting concepts and force multipliers for the next-gen SAF,"" he added."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/malaysia-johor-sultan-largest-solar-plant-pengerang-1883111,Johor to build largest solar power plant in Southeast Asia: Sultan Ibrahim,"JOHOR BAHRU: Johor ruler Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar has outlined plans for the state to build the largest solar power plant in Southeast Asia.  In a press statement on Sunday (Feb 28), Johor's Royal Press Office said that the plant will be built in Pengerang in the southeastern part of the state. It will be ""fully commissioned by 2023"".  ""To be called the Sultan Ibrahim Solar Park, the RM1.4 billion (US$350 million) project will be the biggest of its kind in Southeast Asia with a combined installed capacity of 450 megawatts,"" the statement added.  The project is Johor's first private investment project for 2021, the statement said.  Sultan Ibrahim is set to officiate the ground-breaking ceremony on Mar 23, at the project site in Pengerang. The statement highlighted that the project is in line with the 2030 Johor sustainable development plan, which focuses on environmental preservation and protection as part of the state’s economic development plan.  
  The sultan outlined that the project will have a ""healthy economic spill over effect"" for the people by creating jobs ""at various levels"", said the statement. “With this exciting project, Johor will make a quantum leap into the world of renewable and sustainable clean energy,” he said.  He added that the project will mark Johor’s first major foray into large-scale sustainable energy to foster green economies and a cleaner environment. “Johor is one of the states blessed with high sun hours. It is time that we tapped into this resource to boost our power generating capacity and contribute to the production of renewable energy,” the sultan said. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/climate-change/biden-administration-promises-focus-environmental-justice-1883106,Biden administration promises focus on environmental justice,"WASHINGTON: When President Joe Biden made environmental protection a key element of his campaign, he promised to overhaul the federal office that investigates complaints from people in minority communities who believe they have been unfairly harmed by industrial pollution or waste disposal. Although the Environmental Protection Agency acknowledges that disadvantaged communities in America are disproportionately affected by pollution, hundreds of complaints sent to its civil rights office since the mid-1990s have only once resulted in a formal finding of discrimination. The situation has provoked criticism from the US Civil Rights Commission, the EPA’s own Office of Inspector General and citizens who have filed complaints that sometimes languished for years - or decades. Under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, states, cities and other entities that receive federal funds are prohibited from discriminating because of race, color or national origin. That means citizens bearing the brunt of industrial pollution can bring a complaint if federal money is tied to the project. In Uniontown, Alabama - a mainly Black town of 2,200 - residents complained to the EPA in 2013 about the Alabama Department of Environmental Management’s oversight of a huge landfill containing 4 million tons of coal ash that residents blame for respiratory, kidney and other ailments. Five years later, the EPA dismissed the complaint, saying residents hadn’t proven the landfill caused their health problems. The U.S. Civil Rights Commission called the dismissal of the Uniontown complaint “another distressing step in the wrong direction” by the EPA office. The outcome was typical. In three decades of fielding complaints, EPA’s civil rights office has almost never found pollution was adversely affecting human health. And without such a finding, the agency won’t even consider whether illegal discrimination occurred. Marianne Engleman-Lado, who was recently appointed by the Biden administration to the EPA’s office of general counsel, had helped Uniontown residents with their case. She maintains the way the EPA evaluates such complaints makes it nearly impossible to prevail because proving with scientific certainty that pollution is causing disease is a nearly insurmountable obstacle. Ben Eaton, a Perry County Commissioner involved in the Uniontown complaint, said attorneys warned that discrimination claims usually go nowhere, but residents felt their evidence - including photos and videos - was compelling. “What’s the use of having these agencies,” he said, “if they’re not going to do the job?” Residents of a predominantly Black and Latino community in Oakland, California were similarly disappointed with results of their civil rights complaint over air pollution from ships and truck traffic at the busy Port of Oakland. Margaret Gordon, a co-founder of the West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project, said her group did not have a seat at the table when EPA hammered out an informal resolution with the port. Air pollution is still a problem, she said, although port officials are now more willing to listen to community members. Lilian Sotolongo Dorka, who heads the EPAs office of external civil rights enforcement, touted the 2019 Oakland resolution as an “extremely effective” example of the difference her office is making in people’s lives. But Richard Grow, who worked at EPA for 40 years before retiring in 2019 and was one of the agency’s negotiators, agrees with Gordon’s assessment. “We put forth a number of very practical ... solutions and recommendations and they just said ‘No,’” Grow said. When he reported the port’s and city’s position to Dorka’s office, he said he was told nothing could be done. The office had no further comment, and the port issued a statement saying it is committed to continuing a dialogue with the community. The EPA has the power to withdraw funding from groups that discriminate, although it has never used that power. Dorka defends her office’s record, saying it has eliminated a chronic backlog of complaints. “I disagree very significantly with the conclusion that you can judge our civil rights program by the number of formal findings (of discrimination) we’ve made,” she said, noting the office is required by regulation to seek informal resolutions wherever possible. US Senator Cory Booker (D-New Jersey) is among those who think EPA’s civil rights office should do more. During confirmation hearings this month for Michael Regan, Biden’s nominee for EPA administrator, Booker spoke of meeting Alabama citizens suffering from tropical diseases they attribute to sewage pollution, children with elevated lead levels in his own state, and families in Louisiana’s so-called “cancer alley” who felt abandoned by their government. The EPA’s civil rights office “has been eviscerated over the years,” the African-American senator told Regan. “You’re not even equipped, in my opinion, to actually begin to fight against these issues that affect millions of Americans.” Regan promised to make environmental justice a top priority, including “restructuring and reorganizing” the office of civil rights, which has 12 fulltime employees. “We will need additional resources. ...” he said. Critics concede that Dorka, who took over the office of external civil rights under President Barak Obama, has made some progress, including producing a case resolution manual to guide investigations. Obama’s last day in office marked the only time Dorka’s office issued a formal finding of discrimination - in a complaint filed 25 years earlier over the Genesee Power Plant outside Flint, Michigan. The agency dismissed allegations that the plant’s emissions hurt Black residents, finding insufficient evidence of harm to their health. However, the EPA did find residents were not given a fair opportunity to participate in the permitting process. Dorka said progress has continued under the Trump administration. EPA spokeswoman Lindsay Hamilton said that “The new leadership team will be working closely with career colleagues ... as well as receiving input from stakeholder groups, in an effort to bolster the agency’s capabilities to deliver on our environmental justice and civil rights missions.” Environmental justice advocates say the changes need to be significant. “There are still places where people don’t have access to safe drinking water, where they live in close proximity to hazardous sources,” said Vernice Miller-Travis, a longtime advocate and cofounder of WE ACT for Environmental Justice. “This could be a moment of real sea change in terms of how the EPA is not just paying lip service to civil rights.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/green-plan-2030-grace-fu-government-infuence-documentary-1883096,Green Plan 2030 aims to use ‘government influence in a more concrete way’: Grace Fu,"SINGAPORE: The Singapore Green Plan 2030, a nationwide push for sustainability, aims to use government influence in “a more concrete way” to drive action, said sustainability and environment minister Grace Fu on Friday (Feb 26). The plan, launched earlier this month, charts Singapore’s green targets over the next 10 years, and is spearheaded by five ministries, including the education, national development and transport ministries. “An important element in (the plan) is how the public service will use its resources, use its collective influence to bring about sustainability,” said Ms Fu, who was speaking after a screening of A Wicked Problem, a climate change documentary series by CNA. She was speaking to the series' host, Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information Janil Puthucheary. 
  Specifically, one example of using resources to spur sustainability would be using grant funding to “influence stakeholders to move” in the realm of research and development (R&D), she said. “R&D typically has a very long gestation lead time, but at the same time also a high risk of failure. ""And this is where the Government will have to take a big part of funding, because corporates will not want to take the kind of risk,” she said. Beyond that, she noted the Government is also ""in a position to influence"" when it comes to the institutions that it funds, such as hospitals, schools and universities. “These are all public institutions that, I think, can think about sustainability in a more practical way, in a more immediate way. “So I think with what we're coming up with, a GreenGov.SG plan, it’s to use government influence in a more concrete way, and we hope to see more immediate results, not for (30 or 40 years) but the next five, 10 years,” she said. WHAT ROLES DO COMPANIES PLAY? Moving on to the role of corporates, an audience member raised that companies may be unwilling or unsure of how they can contribute, because they feel the Government has done enough. Dr Puthucheary agreed this was a recurrent sentiment among those interviewed in the show. The four-part series investigates what Singapore is doing to combat climate change, and includes topics such as plastic, energy and food. “This came up again and again in the series … this idea that we're a victim of our success,” he said. 
  In response, Ms Fu said there was some basis for these comments. “To give you an example, for the last 20 years, two decades, our GDP compounded growth was 5 per cent but our CO2 is less than 2 per cent, which means that actually we have been growing our GDP (in) a less energy-intensive or CO2-intensive way,” she said. Ms Fu added that because Singapore is “not starting from zero”, it is harder to make improvements when being held to reduction benchmarks or indicators. “It takes a lot more effort for that kind of improvement because we are pushing to the frontier of technologies,” she said. 
  Nevertheless, she said there is still much room for corporates to get involved in sustainability, especially in the power generation and industrial sectors. For instance, companies can make the decision to be greener individually, but working to do so as a cluster could create more cost efficiencies, she said. She added that the sustainability and environment ministry and the trade and industry ministry have started the ball rolling on these discussions. “When we're looking at transformation of the industry, the sustainability angle should come in, so that we can leapfrog and get our industries ready for a much more low-carbon economy,” said Ms Fu. A Wicked Problem will air on CNA every Monday at 9pm, from Mar 1 to Mar 22."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/climatechange/tesla-indonesia-electric-vehicles-nickel-mining-environment-1883076,"Indonesia is poised for EV riches as Tesla circles, but a nickel rush could hurt the environment","BANGKOK: As American electric vehicle maker Tesla eyes up a hefty investment in Indonesia, concerns are growing over the potential environmental consequences of a nickel mining rush. Tesla has reportedly tabled a proposal to establish a battery production facility in the country, though no official announcement has been made and government decision-makers remain tight-lipped about details. Still, the prospects of Indonesia becoming a global hub for battery production in the electric vehicle (EV) revolution, and a key link in the global supply chain, has already seen mining and nickel processing ramp up across the country. Indonesia has vast resources of nickel - it has about a quarter of the entire world’s supply. It is an increasingly crucial metal in batteries due to its properties that enable mass energy capabilities. Macquarie Bank analysis estimates Indonesia could be the source of half the global supply of nickel and stainless steel within four years. Nickel is seen as a replacement battery component for cobalt, which is more expensive and poses human rights issues due to it being mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo. ""I'd just like to re-emphasise, any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel. Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel,"" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said during a Tesla quarterly conference call in July last year. “Go for efficiency, obviously environmentally friendly nickel mining at high volume. Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time, if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way. Please get nickel,"" he said. But Musk’s call for sustainable nickel in the current Indonesian landscape will be a difficult one to answer, according to analysts. Nickel mining in Indonesia has a dirty track record and the rush to extract and process more of it will add pressure to an industry with opaque rules and regulations.  “I think the statement is an illusion or a contradictory statement. What does sustainable nickel mean? Mining is an unsustainable production,” said Arianto Sangadji, a leading researcher on the industry from the York Centre for Asian Research at York University. “You must consume large amounts of fossil fuel to power the machines for clearing forests, digging the earth, and transporting ore. The more nickel ore is produced, the more fossil fuel is consumed, which has a great impact on climate change,” he said. 
  NICKEL MINING ALREADY INCREASING Records from the Mining Advocacy Network (JATAM) in Indonesia indicate an uptake in nickel interest. There are 328 nickel mining business permits in the exploration stage and 280 nickel mining business permits that have entered the production stage, according to JATAM’s coordinator Merah Johansyah. There may already be thousands of mines operating across the country, many of them small and lightly regulated. Johansyah has observed the impact of mining in local communities and advocated for the rights of workers and protection of the environment. He is concerned that more big investments will worsen existing problems, after witnessing pollution in lakes and drinking water sources, damage to coral reefs, deforestation, fishing impacts and frequent flooding. “There is a threat of a destructive wave behind this business and investment. The threat is very big, especially in the areas where nickel will be mined,” he said. “This mining is also inseparable from the eviction and expulsion of indigenous people, that's a problem that will also get bigger.” Most nickel mining occurs in a small patch of Central Sulawesi, an “absolute biodiversity hotspot”, according to Steve Brown, a consultant on the responsible sourcing of metals. “It’s full of these really incredible endemic species and unique types of rainforest. The mines are also close to the coast, generally, and all of that coast is part of what’s called the Coral Triangle, a marine biodiversity hotspot,” he said. Dirty aspects of nickel mining are expected to be difficult to mitigate. From the mines to the smelters, nickel leaves an impact, on local ecosystems and on climate change. But the opportunity for Indonesia remains enormous; one potentially even more valuable than its vast palm oil industry. The International Energy Agency predicts that some 70 million EVs will be on roads by 2025 and a huge number could contain battery parts mined and manufactured in Indonesia. It represents a huge turnaround for a sector that has been struggling for years. ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES Nickel miners had previously been languishing as the commodity price sunk. But the likes of state firm Aneka Tambang and Vale Indonesia, a component of one of the biggest mining companies in the world, have seen their shares rocket since last year.  Last year, Indonesia banned most nickel ore exports, which were typically headed for stainless steel makers, two years ahead of schedule in order to develop its full nickel supply chain. So, welcoming Tesla’s investment and operations to Indonesia would prove a major boon for the country. Already, other large companies, China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) and Korea’s LG Chemical have entered the nickel game with multi-billion dollar operations.  
  Analysts say that for Tesla, any major move up the production chain in Indonesia, closer to the mines themselves will pose a risk. Currently, the company does not produce its own batteries, and doing so would expose it to greater scrutiny. Tesla did not respond to CNA’s request to comment about its operational plans in Indonesia. “If Tesla gets involved in Indonesia, they’re taking a risk because there are still some question marks in many people’s minds about the sustainability performance of Indonesian nickel mines,” Brown said. “Indonesia can and has produced very sustainable nickel. But that is insufficient production to feed the EV boom. Certainly, the western nickel producers, particularly in North America, are jumping on this sort of narrative, that they are producing clean, green nickel and implying that Indonesian nickel is not.  “With that sort of narrative floating around, if Tesla does invest, they’re taking a risk of being caught up in that reputational risk area. Immediately there will be a lot more scrutiny,” he said. There are also risks of staying out of the battery game, which would force Tesla to continue purchasing its batteries from secondary companies, who would likely be sourcing their nickel from Indonesia anyway. “If Tesla’s plans to ramp EV production up massively by 2030 are to be achieved, it has to consider Indonesian nickel,” said Jim Lennon, a senior commodities consultant at Macquarie Bank. “The problem for the battery market is that Indonesia is the only country that has large volume growth potential and that coal is the main fuel for power generation,” he said. Even if Tesla stays away though, Indonesia is still expected to reap the rewards from extracting more of the valuable metal. The government plans to form a battery manufacturing company with state-owned entities leading the project. Indonesia also plans to export 200,000 EVs of its own by 2025. “Even if Tesla’s investment announcement does not go ahead, Indonesia is well-positioned to establish this industry at scale given the number and size of the planned investments,” said Koketso Tsoai, an auto industry analyst at Fitch Solutions. With confidentiality agreements in place, the Indonesian government has confirmed few details about its discussions with Tesla, but key leaders, including President Joko Widodo, have appeared to be attempting to publicly woo the company. “From our side, we are very excited to work with Tesla to develop lithium batteries for EVs. We can say that Tesla is one of the best in the world,” Septian Hari Seto, deputy for investment and mining at the Coordinating Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Investment, said in a media briefing earlier this month. ""If they only want to take raw materials, we will not be interested. For other details, I cannot disclose. But the collaboration we are doing with Tesla is beyond just taking raw materials.  “Later, we can learn from them. Because one of the things we ask of them is technology transfer,” he said. THE NEXT GREAT CHALLENGE Beyond the pure economics of staggering growth of Indonesian nickel - production could grow from an estimated 100,000 tonnes in 2014 to 1.1 million tonnes by next year - the injection of a company like Tesla could fast-track cleaning up the sector, in terms of energy use, waste disposal, forest management and worker rights. For now though, in its pursuit of growing its extraction potential, the Indonesian government has wound back environmental protections, rather than enhancing them. This could jeopardise Tesla’s investment, according to Brown. “They’re trying to speed up investment and attract more investment. When it comes to Tesla, doing that actually might have the opposite effect,” he said.  “It might scare off a company like Tesla because they’re worried about being in a country that has low environmental standards. If all your neighbours around you are performing badly, you get caught up in that sort of ‘dirty Indonesian producer’ sentiment.”  Tesla in the past has admitted that it does not have full oversight over its battery supply chain, something that would likely need to change if they enter Indonesia. 
  “They must take an environmental and social approach,” said Dwi Sawung, energy and urban campaign manager for the Indonesian Forum for the Environment (Walhi). “They must know whether the land used for mining was obtained properly or if it was confiscated from the people who previously lived there. They have to pay attention to whether there is corruption in the investment process or not,” he said. “Then, Tesla has to make sure that local people could benefit from the mine and make sure they are not poisoned in the long term.” The promise of EVs is their ability to minimise carbon emissions on roads around the world - a climate change solution and driver of economic development.  Tesla’s next great challenge will be proving it can produce its planet-friendly vehicles without actually leaving a dirty footprint. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/climatechange/carbon-cutting-pledges-paris-agreement-target-not-enough-1883101,Carbon-cutting pledges by countries nowhere near enough: UN report,"NEW YORK: The newest pledges by countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions are falling far short of what is needed to limit global warming to what the Paris climate accord seeks, a new United Nations report finds. So the UN's climate chief is telling nations to go back and try harder. Most countries – especially top carbon polluters China, the United States and India – missed the Dec 31, 2020 deadline for submitting official emission-cutting targets for November's climate negotiations in Scotland. Friday's (Feb 26) report provides an incomplete snapshot of the world's efforts: The world's pledges so far are only enough to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions to less than 1 per cent below 2010 levels by 2030. The world has to cut carbon pollution 45 per cent below 2010 levels to achieve the more stringent official Paris goal of limiting future warming to another half a degree (0.3 degrees Celsius) from now, UN officials said. ""We are very, very far from where we need to be,"" UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa said. ""What we need to put on the table is much more radical and much more transformative than we have been doing until now."" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the report ""a red alert for our planet"". UN officials applauded the more than 120 nations, including the US and China, that have made longer-term goals of net-zero carbon emissions by mid-century. 
  But those same nations must translate long-term talk into the immediate action ""that people and the planet so desperately need"", Guterres said. Instead of limiting the world to only 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming since pre-industrial times – the more stringent of two Paris accord goals – the data shows that the world ""is headed to close to 3 degrees Celsius ... and a global catastrophe if this is not curtailed quickly"", said Bill Hare, director of Climate Analytics, a private group that tracks countries' emissions targets. The 2015 Paris climate agreement had nations submit voluntary targets for how much heat-trapping gases they would spew by 2025 and update them every five years. With the big pandemic-delayed climate negotiations in Glasgow set for later this year, nations are supposed to submit updated and tougher goals for 2030. The US, the second biggest carbon polluter behind China, promises its goal will be announced before a special Earth Day summit in April. 
  Fewer than half of the world's countries, accounting for 30 per cent of the world's carbon emissions, submitted targets by the deadline. Only seven of the top 15 carbon polluting nations had done so. At least 10 countries that submitted goals last year did not provide tougher goals, Hare said. And because of changes to emissions in its base year calculations, Brazil essentially weakened its target from its 2015 version, said Taryn Fransen, a senior fellow at the think tank World Resources Institute. Espinosa said even countries that already gave targets need to go back and do better because ""we are simply out of time"". Her predecessor and prime engineer of the Paris agreement, Christiana Figueres, said she thinks the US, China and Japan can change the picture when they announce their goals: ""I have high hopes they will deliver."" China and the United States, with 35 per cent of the world's carbon emissions, can make a huge difference with their targets, Fransen said, noting that the US can pledge to cut emissions in half from 2005 baseline levels by 2030 and can achieve that with concerted action. The goal the Obama Administration submitted in 2015 was to cut emissions 26 per cent to 28 per cent from 2005 levels by 2025. When he was president, Donald Trump withdrew the US from the agreement, but President Joe Biden put the country back in. 
  After dramatic decreases in carbon pollution in early 2020 because of the pandemic lockdown, initial data shows that near end-of-the-year emissions were back up to 2019 levels, pushed by China's industrial production, said Corinne LeQuere, who tracks emissions at the University of East Anglia. The world adopted the more stringent 1.5 degree Celsius temperature goal in 2015 at the urging of small island nations, which fear being swamped by climate-related sea rise if temperatures pass that mark. ""We are flirting dangerously"" with the warming limit, said Ambassador Aubrey Webson of Antigua and Barbuda, chairman of the Alliance of Small Island States. ""It is small island developing states like ours that will pay the ultimate price if we do not."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/budget-2021-debate-women-youths-sustainability-fiscal-position-373591,"Day 2 of Budget 2021 debate: MPs discuss supporting women, youths, sustainability and fiscal position","SINGAPORE: Members of Parliament (MP) on Thursday (Feb 25) discussed issues involving women, youths, sustainability and Singapore’s fiscal position on the second day of the Budget 2021 debate. In particular, they suggested how to better support women, hear youth voices, preserve parks and forests, and balance Singapore’s coffers, as the Government looks to revive its economy amid the global COVID-19 pandemic. The Government has already spent nearly S$100 billion in five Budgets over the last financial year to help Singapore cushion the impact of COVID-19, racking up a deficit of S$64.9 billion or 13.9 per cent of GDP, its largest since independence. Minister of State for Social and Family Development Sun Xueling (PAP-Punggol West) said on Thursday that COVID-19 has brought challenges to women, including increasing the stress of caregiving, financial instability or the risk of violence. SUPPORTING WOMEN While Parliamentary Secretary for Health Rahayu Mahzam (PAP-Jurong) praised this year’s Budget for helping sectors with a high representation of women and addressing their immediate concerns, she acknowledged some gaps that need to be worked on. “Gender bias and stereotypes and the disparity between men and women continue to exist,” she said. “That is one of the reasons why the Conversations on Women’s Development was started, to encourage a whole-of-society discussion on this to nudge behaviours and call for changes that benefit not just women, but the whole community.”  The conversations, launched in September last year, seek to take a comprehensive look at issues that impact women at home, workplaces, schools and the community. Mdm Rahayu said these efforts are ongoing, with “much still to be done” to spark meaningful change in mindsets and systems “so that our boys and girls in the future have equal opportunities to pursue their full potential”. Moving on to women caregivers, MP Joan Pereira (PAP-Tanjong Pagar) called on the Health Ministry to better support caregivers of those with mental conditions, pointing out that Singapore’s rapidly ageing population would lead to more age-related mental health cases. “They need better access to information and guidance with care navigation,” she said. Ms Pereira urged the Government to train and upgrade more mental healthcare professionals to support persons with mental health issues as well as to help maintain the caregivers’ own mental health. “We must provide career counselling, guidance and training for caregivers who would like to start or return to work, including part-time and flexi-work,” she added. Ms Sun said women often play important roles as caregivers in families, noting that the Government is increasing its annual spending on the early childhood sector to more than S$2 billion per annum within the next few years. “These efforts help women, by giving women real choices, as they give women peace of mind should they decide to go back to work when they have a young child,” she said. As part of the Conversations on Singapore Women’s Development, Ms Sun said the Government has conducted 31 sessions and engaged more than 1,700 individuals so far, including youths, working mothers, homemakers, women leaders and men. “Many women and men have shared feedback on how women can be supported in the workplace and in their career aspirations, such as having more women in corporate leadership positions and putting in place formal and informal mentorship and networking platforms for women leaders to support and learn from each other,” she said. Ms Sun highlighted the Council for Board Diversity (CBD) as one platform that looks into having more women on boards. The CBD promotes “sustained increases” in the number of women on boards of SGX-listed companies, statutory boards and Institutions of a Public Character by encouraging organisations to be more diverse and proactively identifying and grooming potential board-ready women, she said. “Our women leaders play key roles in our IPCs, as leaders or board members,” she stated. LISTENING TO YOUTH Several MPs also urged the need to pay youths more attention. For one, Nominated MP Shahira Abdullah noted that this group is concerned about issues such as job security, sustainability and mental wellness - often taking to social media to voice their opinions. “Youth have a lot to say and contribute … It still seems like many would like to see the Government take note of their views and opinions, acknowledge that they have listened and show how their participation has helped to shape future policies,” said Ms Shahira. She also noted the strong potential of youth in the Malay community, citing this group’s strong desire to contribute to society. “We need to tap on our promising Malay youth bulge. I believe that the Budget should try to further leverage on this by providing more platforms to develop their leadership potential and volunteer with the community,” she added. When it comes to helping youths facing adversities, MP Rachel Ong (PAP-West Coast) pushed for a “consistent long-term mentoring programme” amid the social and family development ministry’s plans to expand its Community Link, or ComLink programme. She said that in her experience, consistent mentoring lasting at least a year has proven itself to be the most effective form of intervention. Three main benefits of such a programme are: Giving youth the assurance they are not alone; helping them recognise their value; and helping them break “self-limiting beliefs”, she said. “My hope is that through ComLink, long-term mentoring will be of easy access for our 10- to 16-year-olds to effect mindset growth and a healthier worldview,” she added. Building on the topic of mental health, Parliamentary Secretary for Social and Family Development Eric Chua (PAP-Tanjong Pagar) said a key issue is “to help youngsters suffering silently from mental health issues to normalise help-seeking”. “For our youth, whether they're coping with home-based learning or transitioning from student to working adult life, the pandemic has only made an already stressful rite of passage even more daunting,” said Mr Chua. SUSTAINABILITY Moving on to the environment, MP Dennis Tan (WP-Hougang) welcomed that the Government was aiming to plant a million trees by 2030 under the Singapore Green Plan, but called for greater legal protection for secondary forests. He said that while activities that may damage trees within nature parks are regulated, the mechanisms by which these activities are regulated as well as the penalties for contravention are “much less robust than those applicable to areas designated as nature reserves in the same law. Mr Tan pointed to the recent erroneous clearing of forested spaces in Kranji Woodlands as a “prime example”, where the offending contractor has “gotten away” with a stern warning and developer JTC has not faced any legal consequences so far. “The Workers’ Party thus reiterates our call on the Government to commit to providing more secondary forests with greater legal protection, with some of these areas regulated as nature reserves, while simple recreational areas could be allowed in other areas, but with more stringent rules and penalties than is currently enforced in public parks,” he said. “By legislating to this end, Parliament will send a clear signal to not only future generations but to various actors including contractors, ministries and statutory boards, and the Government itself that the destruction of forested areas will come at a cost.” MP Hany Soh (PAP-Marsiling-Yew Tee) also welcomed the 1 million trees target, saying that it will provide natural infrastructure that cools the environment, improves air quality and provides more places for families to bond and stay active. “With that said, I believe that there is a dire need for us to ensure that our parks and the facilities within them remain a safe environment of all users,” she said. On Feb 18, a 38-year-old woman died after she was trapped under a fallen tree at Marsiling Park. The National Parks Board (NParks) said the 20m-tall Araucaria excelsa tree was last inspected in April last year and found to be healthy.  She suggested that the Government adopts measures such as selecting suitable trees and plants, locating planting areas away from crowded areas, and has “strict” maintenance regimes to check the health of trees periodically. “At the same time, I also hope that NParks will work with the grassroots committees to organise more awareness workshops, sharing tips on how to recognise potential hazards in parks and what to do when a park-related accident occurs,” she added. “Together, we can work as a community to prevent any unfortunate accidents from happening.” FISCAL STRATEGY A number of MPs also sought clarification about the country’s fiscal strategy and position, as Singapore dug into its past reserves for a second consecutive year to fund Budget measures. MP Cheryl Chan (PAP-East Coast) expressed concern over national spending, asking if Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat will be outlining how and when these amounts would be returned to the coffers. She said that such spending is presently justified, but cautioned against thinking of the Budget as an “annual rite” with “goodies”, for instance. This is especially so against a backdrop of tighter government revenue and escalating costs, she said. “It is important that we first try to think how to stretch our existing resources, our every dollar, instead of cultivating a mentality that we have a reserve to dip into,” Ms Chan said. On the topic of borrowing, some MPs asked about the Government’s plans to issue bonds to fund major, long-term infrastructure under an upcoming legislation, the Significant Infrastructure Government Loan Act (SINGA). MP Saktiandi Supaat (PAP-Bishan-Toa Payoh) asked about the likelihood - in a worst case scenario where the borrowing limit is hit - of making an exception to the principle that a government will not pass a funding deficit to the next. In the name of inclusivity, Mr Saktiandi also suggested allowing the public to invest in any future green bonds or long-term infrastructure bonds by the Government. Meanwhile, MP Jamus Lim (WP-Sengkang) mooted extending the maturity of SINGA bonds to 50, or even 100 years. “This would lock in the currently very favourable low rates for a much longer period, as befitting truly long-term projects,” said Associate Professor Lim. He also suggested benchmarking the speed of debt issuance against prevailing growth conditions. One warning sign, he said, is when the interest rate begins to consistently outpace growth rates."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/budget-2021-green-bond-infrastructure-finance-invest-sustainable-1883071,Commentary: Here's how green bonds will take Singapore's reputation as a finance hub to the next level,"SINGAPORE: Fuelling the nation’s ambitions to transition into a low-carbon economy and to be a leading green finance hub in Asia and beyond, the Government announced it will issue green bonds for S$19 billion worth of infrastructure projects at the Singapore Budget 2021. These green bonds are significant given that ASEAN’s total green bond issuances from 2016 to 2019 was approximately only US$8.1 billion (S$10.8 billion), of which 55 per cent was contributed by Singapore. This move positions Singapore yet more firmly at the centre of the green bond market regionally, even as it compliments Singapore’s already prominent role as a regional hub for infrastructure financing. (Did the Budget 2021 make good on elevating Singapore’s sustainability goals? Listen to a climate scientist’s take.)    The year 2020 was a record for the global green bond market, with issuance of over US$269.5 billion, a shade up from 2019’s record of US$266.5 billion. The Climate Bonds Initiative, which sets standards for green issuers, expects a tenth consecutive year of growth in 2021, with global issuance between US$400 billion to US$450 billion for the year. 
  WHY GREEN BONDS? The aim of green bonds is to fund projects that have positive environmental benefit and they differ from conventional bonds particularly in relation to the use of the proceeds. The proceeds need to be focused towards financing (or refinancing) green-related projects including those which support the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. To promote the integrity of the green bond market, issuers should comply with established frameworks and guidance (such as the International Capital Market Association’s Green Bond Principles (“GBP”) or Climate Bond Initiative) which emphasise on use of proceeds, process for project evaluation and selection, management of proceeds and reporting. It provides guidance by way of a list or taxonomy of potential green projects too. For Singapore, the Budget 2021 initiative can lead to attracting investors looking for green investments, and green bond issuers, and will deepen market liquidity for green bonds. For governments, green bonds often offer a sizable pool of possible funding that could be accessed to fund much needed infrastructure projects and the greening of urban centres and assets within the country and regionally. 
  At a time when governments have spent significant sums on the response to COVID-19, green bonds offer an alternative source of patient funding. From an investors’ point of view, green bonds can be a source to achieve sustainability targets of the investment portfolio. However, there are often no pricing benefits when compared to conventional project financing. In addition, certification can increase the cost of financing a project through green bonds. Furthermore, revenue certainty becomes far more critical when considering green bonds against conventional infrastructure debt. 
  DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS Whilst it is a generally a good mechanism to finance green projects, the devil is in the details. There are challenges that need to be addressed in order to successfully issue green bonds including ensuring that it can stand up to scrutiny of it being indeed green and the reasonableness of the targets. Challenges are usually more project-specific and largely around finding the suitable projects for investment. Finding investors to buy green bonds is often not an issue. Structuring an infrastructure project to ensure it is investment grade can be challenging, particularly in the emerging markets across our region. Regulatory frameworks, effective risk allocation (which includes revenue risk, construction related risks, and political risk), transparent process and depth of capital markets are all fundamental issues that need to be addressed on any infrastructure project. Considering these are often barriers to conventional funding bankability, one may question ASEAN market’s readiness to fund broader infrastructure through green bonds. 
  CONSIDERATIONS BEHIND ISSUING GREEN BONDS Countries should focus on prioritising climate-focused projects while identifying current urban infrastructure assets that need investment to become cleaner – for example, transportation networks, aged buildings and climate-resilient infrastructure. Funding sustainability focused decarbonisation programmes or net-zero plans around new green buildings or sustainable urban centres are more easily achievable. One of the green projects identified to be financed as part of the Government’s announced green bonds plan is Tuas Nexus, Singapore’s first integrated waste and water treatment facility slated for completion in phases starting 2025. Other examples include Transport for London and Hong Kong’s MTR Corporation who have issued green bonds to help finance new low-carbon transit projects in Greater London and Hong Kong, respectively. 
  To access and launch green bonds more successfully, governments can focus on addressing potential risk exposures on individual projects. More so, as COVID-19 has exposed certain sectors of the infrastructure market’s lack of resilience to a significant drop in real demand – for example, airports. It is also important to continue to build transparency on the tracking and management of the funds until their full allocation to eligible assets and project funding. This would provide confidence in the environmental credentials of the government green bonds to international investors and the society, and help build trust. The creation of green bond indices and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) is also crucial in facilitating capital flows into the green bond space. Excellence in capacity and capabilities within the market to drive the projects is critical in order for projects to be successful. SINGAPORE POISED TO BE GREEN FINANCE HUB Singapore has developed a reputation as a leading financial services hub with effective governance, regulation, access to financial expertise, including sustainable finance expertise, verifiers and professionals. The Green Finance Action Plan developed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore is also a commitment inspiring testament to how serious Singapore wants to grow the green finance space, including the green bonds space. 
  The Singapore Government has been progressively ramping up its support in the sustainable finance space across the years including Green and Sustainable Bond Grant Scheme, the US$2 billion Green Investment Programme and the recently launched Environmental Risk Management Guidelines and consultation paper on the proposed taxonomy for Singapore-based financial institutions. In the Budget it was also announced that businesses looking to go green in Singapore can tap on the Enterprise Sustainability Programme and continued support schemes for energy efficiency and sustainability. Similar to how one buys into regular bonds, investors can choose to support a sustainability cause through direct investment into green bonds or green indices, or even green ETFs. 
  Despite some of the challenges noted in using green bonds as a form of finance, such building blocks position Singapore as a trusted hub for green finance, green business and green infrastructure. There exists a strong demand for green bonds and Singapore’s Budget 2021 recognises not only the appetite, but also the need to focus on pathways toward becoming a global city of sustainability.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/obsessions/vintage-second-hand-timepieces-watch-resellers-1882706,Brands are now selling their own vintage watches. Should you ditch third-party watch resellers?,"The words “second-hand” and “luxury” seem oxymoronic because you’d expect an item you pay so much for to not just be rare and well-made, but pristine. But such notions are now considered outdated in a world that is becoming increasingly preoccupied with pragmatism. Whether it’s the need to make room for newer, better things, or simply an issue of means (especially now with a recession hanging over our heads), there is no escaping the fact that the pre-owned market is booming, and it is extending its reach into luxury watches. 
  Desperate to maintain their air of prestige, watch brands have long shunned or ignored the grey and secondary markets, where steep discounts and unglamorous transactions ran rampant. But embracing it has done other luxury industries a whole lot of good. The car industry has been at it for decades and now, with brands like Gucci partnering luxury consignment marketplace TheRealReal, the fashion world is in on it too: Consumers really like good value. According to The Secondhand Opportunity in Hard Luxury report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG), last year’s pre-owned hard luxury market (primarily watches and jewellery) was estimated to be worth €21 billion (S$33.7 billion) worldwide and is expected to grow at eight per cent a year, faster than the luxury industry overall. 
  This is all well and good for brands wanting to capitalise on our bargain-hunting instincts, but what’s in it for us? The most obvious benefit of getting a pre-owned watch straight from the original manufacturer is the guarantee of authenticity. To be fair, reputable auction houses and upscale dealers like WatchBox, Chronext and Watchfinder ensure their goods are the real deal, too. 
  Watchfinder was actually doing such a good job that it was bought over by Richemont in 2018. But for those who aren’t savvy enough to know or find such avenues, going back to the brand is the surest and safest way. Having the brands take care of the sales experience also means the same plush buying environment. Online retail is fast, convenient and increasingly popular, especially with dealers like JeweLuxe and WatchBox even offering white-glove services, but being fussed over in an elegantly decorated boutique is not something you can replicate digitally. Richard Mille (RM) fans won’t have to sacrifice that experience now that the brand has opened The Value of Time boutique in Ngee Ann City, dedicated entirely to pre-owned Richard Mille watches. It also happens to be the first of its kind for the brand, and clients will be able to buy, sell and consign second-hand RMs in a posh space, punny name notwithstanding. Given the limited nature of Richard Mille timepieces, this also gives collectors a chance to acquire references they previously missed out on. A second chance with a second-hand watch is exactly what MB&F wants to offer you with its MB&F Certified Pre-Owned collection, launched in 2018. At the time of writing, only a HM No. 6 Titanium is left, with everything else including an LM101 in palladium, a HM4 Razzle Dazzle and even a Melchior clock already spoken for. F.P. Journe has also been offering its Patrimoine Service since 2016, so collectors can try their luck at getting their hands on Journe’s always-rare pieces. Currently available now are a Chronometre a Resonance from 2000 and a platinum Tourbillon Souverain from 1999 on the brand’s dedicated website. The brand also lists models that it wants to buy back. It’s not just small independents that are moving into this space. Cartier Vintage, an initiative that puts a selection of restored watches from the 1970s to the 2010s alongside the brand’s freshest novelties, recently arrived in Singapore after first launching in London and Paris. Available exclusively at Cartier’s flagship store at ION Orchard, the collection debuted with six timepieces, and five of them were sold on the first day. But there is an incentive for waiting for new Cartier Vintage drops instead of hoping for someone’s heirloom to pop up on Carousell. All watches from Cartier Vintage will come with an eight-year warranty, new authenticity certification and a nice new Cartier red box. Naturally this consistency is another reason shoppers will choose wares coming from the brands themselves. While authenticity may not be as big a worry as it used to be, the secondary market is still full of watches in varying states of use. One person’s definition of “lightly used” could differ drastically from another, and still won’t beat “fully refurbished”. If the watch goes back to the original workshops, buyers can be confident the brand’s precious image will not benefit from selling a piece that doesn’t return as good as new (as possible). Assurance extends to the conscience as well, since sustainability is an unintended but still very welcome side effect of a flourishing secondary market. With brands like IWC, Panerai and Breitling, as well as conglomerates like LVMH paying closer attention to eco-conscious products, it would make sense for them to eventually rope in more robust pre-owned concepts, too. It’s a lot more work for brands to have to seek out, authenticate and restore old products, so we’ll likely only see the rarer (and hence more expensive) pieces being offered this way, but it’s a great, if really late, start. Long-time collectors can keep their collections at reasonable numbers, first-timers can start theirs with slightly less intimidating price tags and more dependable provenance, and interest in watchmaking as a whole grows. In a circular economy, everyone wins."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/remarkableliving/kausmo-educating-singapore-diners-about-food-wastage-1882711,The young female duo bent on educating Singapore diners about food waste,"How often do we sit down at the table for a meal and wolf down everything without mulling over its provenance or means of production? In Singapore, two friends – Lisa Tang, 26, and Kuah Chew Shian, 28 – wanted people to think more about the food they eat, especially ingredients that are typically overlooked or discarded. So they started 16-seat private diner Kausmo in 2019, the name derived from the word “cosmos”. 
  Restaurant manager Kuah said, “It is derived from the word ‘cosmos’, which means a system of thoughts because we are a restaurant based on the concept of thoughtfulness.” Tang, who is the chef, added: “Chew and I are always for the underdogs. We really appreciate things that should be appreciated, but the mass majority does not.” The cosy restaurant, located in Shaw Centre, has an inviting atmosphere akin to entering a friend’s home. “This space is for sparking conversations about unnecessary food wastage and understanding more about our food system,” Tang enthused. Backed by the Les Amis Group, Kausmo serves a six-course omakase menu that is occasionally updated. It focuses on parts of proteins that may be underrated or less appreciated by people, such as pork collar. 
  Tang explained, “We serve it thick to appreciate how the different textures play in that piece of meat. You get collagen, fat and lean meat.” She and Kuah also find creative ways to repurpose fruits and vegetables that are usually rejected by retailers. For example, overripe and overstocked nectarines are cooked down and sent to a friend who runs a gelato shop to make into sherbets for Kausmo’s desserts. After attending a local culinary school, Tang went to the US when she was 23, where she worked at Primo, a full-circle, farm-to-table restaurant. After opening Kausmo in June 2019, she was nominated for the Rising Female Chef award at the World Gourmet Summit that year. The stint at Primo led Tang to better appreciate the vegetables and herbs Singapore has. “Ingredients like thyme and rosemary are actually growing in abundance as weeds overseas. But they appreciate it so much that they are able to export it out and allow many other people across countries to appreciate it,” said Tang. “So, why can’t we? Do we even know what we have here? There’s so much we have here that are gems, in terms of flavour, texture, and aesthetics. There is beautiful produce all around us.” The duo partnered Singaporean farmer Evelyn Eng-Lim to tap into her knowledge of native greens. Eng-Lim has been running a vegetable farm in Neo Tiew for the past 22 years, and is probably the only one to grow perennial kampung vegetables because “many Singaporeans don’t know how to eat (them)”, said Eng-Lim. Tang added, “This is one of the rare, organic and bio-diverse farms that focuses on native edibles that we really need in our land. [These plants] thrive in our climate effortlessly, so they require lesser resources like water and care to grow. They are not only nutritious, they are [also] very flavourful.” She cites examples such as the Tonkin Jasmine, which is mostly used in scrambled eggs and was often used by her grandparents in their cooking. Kausmo also gets fresh Java ginseng, wild pepper and ulam raja from the farm. They are used in dishes such as a frog congee served with java ginseng and preserved plum-dressed chilli. Kuah said, “It’s been quite a fulfilling experience. Kausmo is a labour of love and I think it really is because we put our heart into every aspect of this concept. It has been an incredible journey that we are very proud of.” Adapted from the series Remarkable Living (Season 3). Watch full episodes on CNA, every Sunday at 8.30pm.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/india-glacier-disaster-himalayan-dangers-climate-change-1883066,India's glacier disaster highlights Himalayan dangers,"CHAMOLI, India: Long before this month's deadly flash flood in a remote Indian Himalayan valley, Kundan Singh Rana knew that all the construction work in the fragile region would one day mean disaster. ""The rivers, mountains and trees are like our gods and any sacrilege will have consequences,"" Rana told AFP in his village, overlooking the hydroelectric project that was obliterated by what was believed to be a glacier collapse on Feb 7. ""The Rishi Ganga river and our mountains have been scarred beyond repair by human greed. This flood is God's retribution,"" the 43-year-old farmer said. Scientists may not share his belief in divine punishment, but they agree that the blame for this latest disaster which killed 60 people and left 150 others missing lies largely with human activity. The anthropogenic impact includes the shrinking of glaciers in the Himalayas, one of the regions hardest hit by global warming. 
  The recent disaster is thought by experts to have been caused by a chunk of glacier 15 football fields long and five across breaking off, bringing with it part of a rock face. This dammed up a small river high in the mountains until the mass of backed-up water broke through with awesome ferocity and speed. The roaring deluge of water, rocks and soil hurtled down a V-shaped valley, sweeping away homes, roads and bridges as well as around 200 people, many of whom have still not been found almost two weeks on. CLIMATE CHANGE AND DEVELOPMENT The latest catastrophe ""is clearly a fallout of climate change and in itself a tell-tale of our future"", HC Nainwal, one of the several glaciologists who visited the site, told AFP. In the Indian Himalayas, about 10,000 glaciers are receding at a rate of 30m to 60m per decade. The runoff can form glacial lakes which can then burst their banks in spectacular and destructive fashion. The other factor can be heard in the regular thuds of dynamite ringing through the valleys of Uttarakhand state, where the recent flood struck. Some of this explosive activity is for new roads to beef up the disputed border with China following last year's clash that left 20 Indian soldiers dead. An 800km highway is also being built to connect four religious sites - a pet project of Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But the biggest problem is the construction of hydroelectric plants across the vast network of Himalayan rivers, part of India's drive to boost renewable energy. More than 75 small and large power projects are operational in Uttarakhand and dozens more are planned - many without proper attention to the potential risks, experts say. NO TRUST IN THE GOVERNMENT Experts say that these projects make other devastating flash floods more likely, while also increasing the risk of landslides. The dangers were plain to see in 2013 when a flash flood killed 6,000 people in Uttarakhand and devastated the region. In its wake, India's top court appointed a scientific committee that recommended no more hydro plants be built in the area - advice which is being ignored. Locals in the area - home to a famous 1970s campaign to protect trees - say that they have seen none of the promised economic benefits of the development and that their concerns have been ignored. They launched a campaign in 2019 and petitioned a court over illegal sand mining and the dumping of muck in the Rishi Ganga river that they said was contributing to landslides and floods. But deforestation for infrastructure projects, sand mining and quarrying continues. ""We used to trust the government and believed that it was working for our welfare but that's not the case,"" Surinder Singh, 55, told AFP. ""Any dam or road that threatens our lives and the mountains will be fought tooth and nail."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/budget-2021-govt-review-trajectory-and-level-carbon-tax-outcome-next-years-budget-1883051,Budget 2021: Govt to review 'trajectory and level' of carbon tax; outcome at next year's Budget,"SINGAPORE: Singapore will review the ""trajectory and level"" of its carbon tax, and reveal the outcome at next year's Budget, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said on Tuesday (Feb 16). Speaking at the unveiling of Budget 2021 in Parliament, Mr Heng said that the review will be conducted in consultation with industry and expert groups. ""We will announce the outcome of the review at Budget 2022 to give time for businesses to adjust to any revision in the carbon tax trajectory,"" Mr Heng added. 
  Up until 2023, the carbon tax rate will be maintained at S$5 per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions as previously announced, Mr Heng said. ""This will provide businesses with certainty in the current challenging economic climate,"" he said.  ""An appropriate carbon tax level is one of the key levers to spur the reduction of our carbon footprint, promote industry innovation and green growth while maintaining Singapore's overall economic competitiveness."" 
  Announced at Budget 2018, Singapore's carbon tax rate has been set at S$5 per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions from 2019 to 2023. The Government said then that this would be increased to between S$10 and S$15 per tonne by 2030.  Since then, Mr Heng pointed out the effects of climate change have ""intensified"" and global momentum to address climate change has accelerated ""significantly"". He noted that countries’ climate ambitions have increased, with the number of countries with net-zero targets increasing from four at the end of 2017 to 57 at the end of last year. 
  ""On Singapore's part, we enhanced our 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution and submitted our 2050 long-term low emissions development strategy under the Paris agreement in March 2020,"" Mr Heng said. ""We are working towards achieving our long-term net zero aspirations as soon as viable. This House has acknowledged that climate change is a global emergency and has called on the government to take stronger climate actions."" Mr Heng noted that Singapore was in a ""new situation"" today. 
  ""As a responsible member of the international community, Singapore will be expected to do more, along with other countries as climate change issues take on greater gravity,"" he said.  There have been a number of calls from Members of Parliament for Singapore to increase its carbon tax, most recently at during a wide-ranging parliamentary debate earlier this month.  This debate followed a motion tabled by members of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Sustainability and the Environment to speak on climate change and its impact on Singapore."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-development-land-golf-courses-clementi-dover-forest-1883046,Could golf courses be the answer to some of Singapore’s development land needs?,"SINGAPORE: The redevelopment of golf courses could address some of Singapore’s land demands, but there are urban planning considerations that need to be addressed while doing so, experts told CNA. In a Parliamentary sitting on Feb 1, Members of Parliament Rachel Ong (PAP-West Coast) and Leon Perera (WP-Aljunied) both spoke about the need to preserve forests and how Singapore’s golf courses could factor in the equation. In her speech, Ms Ong noted that forests have “accumulative benefits” of stabilising carbon emissions over time, and Singapore must consider its forests as a “last resort”. Giving the example of the Clementi Forest and Ulu Pandan Forest, Ms Ong added that it would be “ecologically responsible” to consider utilising portions of the 1500 hectares across Singapore’s 17 golf courses, before reaching into the country's forest land.  “While future generations can choose to rebuild golf courses, forests that are now removed will take decades to grow and the connected biodiversity that we lose now may never return,” she said. 
  In his speech, Mr Perera noted that the land leases of seven of the eight golf clubs which were slated to expire between 2021 and 2023 have been renewed “to some extent”. “Given the importance of protecting pristine natural habitats like mature forests, can there not be more scope to review the land devoted to golf courses as a general planning parameter going forward, keeping in mind the fact that not everyone plays golf; the fact that there are available golfing options very close to Singapore; and the likelihood that golf is not a huge driver of inbound tourism,” said Mr Perera, pointing out that golf courses take up roughly 2 per cent of Singapore’s land area. Speaking to CNA, Assistant Professor Perrine Hamel from Nanyang Technological University’s (NTU) Asian School of the Environment noted that the redevelopment of golf courses could be a way forward for Singapore. “Golf courses occupy a small but not insignificant amount of space in our small island so they should be considered among the options for redevelopment,” she said. “Golf courses also have environmental impacts such as high water use and water quality impairment - especially if best management practices for landscape maintenance are not observed. However, good landscape management ... can alleviate these issues.” Dr Woo Jun Jie, who is a senior research fellow at National University of Singapore's (NUS) Institute of Policy Studies, noted that the large plot sizes of golf courses present the Government with a possible option for addressing its development needs, and housing in particular. “As Singapore continues to develop and the needs of its population grows, there may be a need to consider redeveloping more golf courses in order to serve the needs of the broader population, whether this is in terms of housing or publicly-accessible green spaces,” he said.  “Golf courses also require significant amounts of labour and resources to maintain … they do not necessarily contribute to environmental sustainability,” he added.  Singapore Nature Society vice-president Dr Ho Hua Chew said that while 300-400 hectares has been delisted, namely Keppel Golf Course, Jurong Country Club, Raffles Country Club and Marina Bay Golf Course, there is still a ""sizeable area"" of land being used for golf courses in Singapore. A ""liberal estimate"" would put the amount at over ""1000-plus"" hectares, about the same size as Pulau Ubin, he said. “This is not an intensive land use compared to HDB housing and the leases for the golf courses are long. It’s a situation where talking about land scarcity here sounds rather hollow,” he said. Dr Ho noted that for golf courses like Marina Bay, HDB housing or mixed housing should be considered as part of redevelopment plans. Should there be pressure for more HDB housing, using golf course land should be used rather than clearing more forests, he added. Speaking in Parliament last week, Minister for National Development Minister Desmond Lee had noted that the Government would have taken back more than 400ha of golf course land for redevelopment by 2030.  He pointed out that the land from Keppel Golf Course would be used to develop private and public housing. In addition, land from Jurong Country Club, Raffles Country Club, Marina Bay Golf Course (from 2024), and Orchid Country Club (from 2030) would be also used to meet ""other needs"", Mr Lee said. PROVIDING ECOSYSTEM SERVICES At the same time, Dr Hamel noted that golf courses can provide ecosystem services - benefits that people obtain from ecosystems - and support biodiversity. “From that perspective, golf courses are more beneficial than most urban landscapes: they provide support (for) biodiversity by providing habitat for species, they help reduce temperatures by providing shade and evaporating water, and of course they represent an amenity for golfers and people enjoying the greenery,” she explained.   “By converting golf courses into residential areas, (we) would lose these benefits.” The redevelopment of golf courses near to ecologically sensitive areas into residential areas could affect the environmental balance, she added. “They are not as good as forests and natural landscapes … But they are often much better than residential areas,” Dr Hamel said.  “Golf courses connecting areas of high biodiversity should be favored over those that do not connect biodiverse landscapes.” Professor Sing Tien Foo, who is the director of the Institute of Real Estate and Urban Studies at NUS, noted that courses near Singapore’s Central Catchment Nature Reserve may not be suitable for redevelopment. Courses in the vicinity include the Singapore Island Country Club’s Island and Bukit courses. “Even if they don’t allow it for golf course use, I think it is also not feasible for other development, because that is actually protected,” he noted. He noted that from the urban planning perspective, golf courses are sometimes planned in areas where development would otherwise be difficult. Giving the example of courses near airports, he explained that due to noise, residential development might not be ideal in such an area. “You need to tie in the development properly, and to also take into consideration the surrounding environments,” he explained. NUS Associate Professor Yun Hye Hwang noted that golf courses can be renewed or retrofitted to better work as buffer zones between nature reserves and urban areas. This can be in the form of natural parks or eco-friendly golf courses, she noted. 
  “While some golf courses could be used for residential development, it is probably wiser to redevelop them into public parks so that their benefits reach larger portions of the population while using other options for residential areas,” added Dr Hamel. Giving the example of Dover Forest, Dr Woo noted how it had grown from plantations and orchards, both of which are very heavily manicured and controlled spaces.  “Yet, Dover Forest is today home to a very diverse and self-sustaining natural ecosystem,” he pointed out. While golf courses remain an option, It is also important to look at other alternatives in the push for redevelopment, stressed experts. “It's important to consider other redevelopment options - for example, old industrial sites or roads and carparks. Overall, those provide less environmental benefits and most of them less social benefits than golf courses,” said Dr Hamel. Prof Hwang noted that there needs to be planning at the ""city scale"" of what Singapore needs.  “There may be some areas which can be redeveloped or developed immediately, because they have relatively less or lower ecological and biophysical impacts,"" she said.  ""We need to prioritise available lands through a systemic trade-off assessment by various aspects - ecological, environmental, economical, and socio-cultural benefits.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/climatechange/thailand-adaptation-wine-vineyard-granmonte-1883036,Adapting to climate change: How Thailand’s tropical wines are teaching the old world new tricks,"BANGKOK: The air that sweeps gently through the rows of vines in the GranMonte estate is cool. In the middle of winter here, on the flank of Khao Yai National Park, the temperature drops and grapes can flourish. The vineyard, northeast of Bangkok, is rimmed by mountains, giving this elevated valley shelter from damaging weather. It is a combination of good fortune and good planning that has helped winemaker and oenologist Nikki Lohitnavy transform this once cashew plantation into one of the region’s most sophisticated wine operations.  “We have a cool, dry winter and this part of Thailand has cold air that comes through from China and Vietnam. It’s a nice location to be growing grapes,” she said. It is not just the location that has lifted GranMonte to be one of Thailand’s most prominent vineyards, producing about 100,000 bottles of wine a year. Given the challenging climate, Nikki has tapped on advanced climate technologies and monitoring to get the best out of her plantations. The vineyard is her playground, where experimentation and analysis is a necessity to produce quality grapes far from their original habitats. Science and data is deeply engrained from crop to cork and this form of precision agriculture means even the vagaries of nature can be contended with. “Tropical viticulture is so new that I don’t think there’s any textbook on it. We found six new varieties that work here. We’re still experimenting with different rootstocks and clones,” she said.  Aside from their stock varieties like Syrah and Chenin Blanc, she has found success with other grapes, including Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, Durif, Viognier and Verdelho.  “When we understand the science behind it, we can adapt.” As the planet warms, it is the type of approach that could define winemaking around the world in coming decades. Climate change is making viticulture and winemaking increasingly problematic in places where grapes have been grown for generations, especially in Europe. Some areas are being affected more than others as regions become warmer, rain patterns shift and seasons become less predictable. For grapes, a most sensitive fruit, the impacts are being felt on the vine and in the bottle.  But viticulture and winemaking have never been simple in Thailand, a region where the mercury regularly soars and long dry spells can be punctuated by monsoonal rain. “This location is new latitude wine. It’s believed not to be suitable for making wine. But GranMonte has proved that it’s possible,” said Dr Teerakiat Kerdcharoen, an associate professor of physics at Mahidol University and a co-founder of Smart Farm Thailand. 
  USING DATA TO MANAGE THE VINEYARD Thailand is highly vulnerable to climate change. Already Nikki has seen the disturbances to the normal patterns that she, and millions of others involved in domestic agriculture, rely upon.  “It can be unpredictable in some years. Rain normally stops around mid-October but we had four different storms this October, which was unexpected. That made our work in the vineyard difficult,” she said. “What we’ve seen over the years is that the temperature is increasing and we’ve been harvesting at night instead of during the day for over six years now. We see more drought; 2015 was the worst year. We see more of that pattern of less rain that finishes later as well.” A decade ago, the business invested in a sophisticated smart farming system, allowing Nikki to monitor and record various metrics like UV, rainfall, humidity, evaporation and water requirements for vines at different stages of growth. The system continues to be upgraded and developed.  “We have sensors for the soil at different depths that can tell us when we have enough water or not. We also have leaf wetness sensors to work on disease prevention models right now,” she said. “We use it to plan our irrigation and this disease prediction is pretty new. We are the first to do it in Thailand and we think it will be useful for tropical viticulture in the future.”  Teerakiat, who coordinated with GranMonte to develop and install the smart farming system, says climate data is an underutilised tool in viticulture and agriculture more generally. He said most farms and vineyards in Thailand will only use technology to automate their processes or investigate problems. “We try to understand the climate. We try to understand the area where we grow. So we have to use data to manage the vineyard,” he said, explaining that even within GranMonte’s 16ha of vines, local temperatures can vary, making some parts of the estate more or less suitable for certain types of grapes. “Normally, people when they have a field plant all of the crops the same. They water them the same amount. They put fertiliser the same. But if you have the sensors and data you can tell that different parts of the field behave differently and you can adjust the resources. “I worry a lot because things are changing faster. In the next five years, the change in one year may be more than in 10 years in the past. It’s very shocking.”  
  TROPICAL LEARNING Thailand does not have a long history of winemaking, but it is developing a growing reputation, despite just a small number of vineyards in operation. Its relative success is turning the heads of producers in other parts of the world. Viticulturist and tropical winemaking expert Hans-Peter Hoehnen said as conditions get more difficult to predict and respond to in traditional growing areas, lessons could be learnt from tropical operations.  The German consults annually with another of Thailand’s large winemaking operations, Siam Winery. He also assists producers in his home country, and has noticed a growing convergence between the issues being faced. The types of challenges posed annually in the tropics are starting to appear in Europe, he said. “In Europe, we have to change. We can learn from the tropics. We will continue to grow grapes in these areas but under different circumstances,” he said.  He said that aspects of winemaking, such as levels of acidity, that have typically been taken for granted in France and Germany now need to be better understood and analysed, just like they are in Thailand. “We have to look more at the tropics to learn what they do with their grape processing. We really have to think about acid balance, seed ripening, skin ripening, ripeness of the tannins. We have to focus more on PH and acidity,” he said. “It was always easy in the past. That is over. If you do it the old way, you will end up with a wine that is very alcoholic and not very aromatic, because all the flavour burns out. Healthy grapes are no longer enough. You need to focus on other parameters.”  
  As more extreme weather events impact grape growing in Europe, Hoehnen says “normal work practices” in Thailand vineyards will need to be considered. That includes picking grapes earlier than usual and cooling down grapes in the winery before they are processed. He also believes that the research being done in Thailand, especially around tolerant cultivars, water stress and canopy management will prove to be useful resources for others in the future. “Now comes the learning curve, because the weather has changed. I always say, climate change ... winemaking change,” he said. “All of this is new knowledge. You can’t read it in a book.”  Nikki says there has been interest from overseas producers, interested in GranMonte’s formula for growing sensitive grape varieties, including their experience in bottling sparkling wine.  Before the COVID-19 pandemic, GranMonte would take on foreign interns to assist with their tropical wine knowledge, and Nikki is a regular in global and regional conferences. The growing list of awarded medals on the estate’s bottles bears testament to how that understanding is reaping results. “Most of the time, people just think that we are crazy,” she said. “But this is our home, growing grapes and making wine is something we are passionate about so that is why we like to do it and see it work.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/climatechange/malaysia-sabah-baju-laut-weather-patterns-sea-level-rise-1883016,"Sabah sea gypsies grapple with dwindling fish catch, sinking villages as climate change threatens way of life","KOTA KINABALU: As the sun began to set, fisherman Lan Tumpat docked his rickety wooden boat. The 30-year-old then hoisted his oar, a fishing rod and an empty pail onto the battered wooden planks in front of his home. “No fish today. The winds were blowing strong and I came back,” said Mr Lan, wiping sweat off his brow with a rag. “Not worth risking being capsized in the dark,” he added in broken Malay. Mr Lan lives with his wife and five children at the floating village of Kampong Tanjung Aru Lama, around 50m off the coast of Sabah’s capital, Kota Kinabalu. Like his father and grandfather, Mr Lan, a stateless sea gypsy, feeds his family by combing the South China Sea for grouper, red carp and catfish. However, he said fishing has become more hazardous by the day in recent years. “I’ve been fishing all my life. But over the last few years, the weather changes very quickly and winds are more unpredictable. There is more danger of capsizing,” said Mr Lan. Like the dozens of other sea gypsies who fish for food in his village, Mr Lan uses a small sampan he built himself and paddles with an oar. Sailing in the dark amid a storm is not an option for him.   Mr Lan is one of thousands of ethnic Bajau Laut people, or sea gypsies, whose families fled to Sabah in the 1970s to escape the war between the Philippine government and the independent movement by the Moro National Liberation Front, resettling in many parts of the state such as Lahad Datu, Semporna, Sandakan and even off the coasts of Kota Kinabalu. They live a nomadic lifestyle, fishing for sustenance and staying on stilt houses in coastal waters. Experts say that rising sea temperatures, brought on by global warming, and extreme changes in weather patterns have diminished their ability to fish for food. Additionally, rising sea levels in Borneo could also sink the Bajau villages, threatening their very existence. BAJAU LAUT FIRST TO FEEL IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE  Mr Laili Basir, a social activist who works closely with Bajau Laut communities along the eastern coast of Sabah, told CNA that the sea gypsies tend to bear the brunt of climate change because of their proximity to the ocean. “They are frontliners at the sea and for issues like (global warming, rising sea levels), they are impacted first,” said Mr Laili, who founded the HUGS project, a non-governmental initiative to educate and give out necessities to the Bajau Laut. Although Mr Laili is based in Pahang in peninsular Malaysia, he visits Sabah regularly to do humanitarian work. He noted that some Bajau have reported dwindling fish catch recently as the weather has become more unpredictable. “The Bajau are very adaptable to changes in the environment. Each fisherman typically needs to catch 1kg of fish every day to feed the family, as opposed to commercial fisherman who fish 10 times that amount,” said Mr Laili. “But over the last five years or so, the weather changes have been more extreme and this has made it difficult for them to fish in their small sampans,” added the 49-year-old. Malaysia’s latest biennial update report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change submitted in 2018 indicates that its temperature, rainfall and sea level have been rising for the past four decades, a trend that is projected to continue for the next 30 years. Average temperature in Malaysia is projected to increase by between 1.2 degrees Celsius and 1.6 degrees Celsius by 2050, the report states, leading to various implications such as extreme weather and unpredictable waters off its coasts. 
  Dr Serina Rahman, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute who has studied sustainable coastal development in Southeast Asia, noted that increasingly frequent changes in weather and wind patterns have impacted coastal communities in Malaysia, including the Bajau Laut. “Indigenous and fishing communities depend on safe seas to earn a living and these increasingly strong winds, changes in weather will affect their catch when they are at sea. So it then affects their food security and livelihoods,” said Dr Serina, who is based in Johor.  She pointed out that artisanal fisherman, including the Bajau Laut in Sabah are reporting more frequent cases of capsizing while trying to fish in uncertain weather conditions. Most Baju Laut fishermen are only fishing to feed their families and are unwilling to switch to commercial fishing boats, she also said. “These are not fishermen who can travel out further in big boats. They are their own bosses and traditional fishing is cultural heritage, a tradition, a ritual and a generational pride thing,” said Dr Serina. Mr Lan who lives in Kampong Tanjung Aru Lama, is an example. “Fishing and being a Bajau is my life. I will never change,” he said. “Moving to the city and finding another kind of work is not an option for me and my children.” SEA LEVEL RISE THREATENS HOMES Besides extreme weather, the Bajau Laut communities in Sabah also have to contend with rising sea levels, which could destroy their homes in the coming years. According to a report by Malaysia’s National Hydraulic Research Institute (Nahrim), sea levels have been rising by between 0.2mm and 4.4mm annually in the country since 2010 due to climate change. Nahrim added that this could lead to inundated coasts and affect around 8 million people. The report also said that among the areas with the highest sea level rise are along the east coast of Sabah, which could see an increase of between 0.4mm and 1.1mm. The towns expected to be worst hit are Tawau, Kudat, Lahad Datu, Sandakan and Kota Kinabalu, all of which have Bajau Laut communities living nearby. Associate Professor Haliza Abdul Rahman, who is with University Putra Malaysia’s department of environmental and occupation health, told CNA that sea level rise could impact coastal communities like the Bajau Laut by causing more frequent coastal flooding, coastal erosion, impeded drainage and submerging the land they live on. Mr Laili, the activist said some of the Bajau communities in eastern Sabah have begun to notice these changes. “Some of them have realised that their homes are getting closer and closer to the water. There are also some whose homes are already completely submerged,” said Mr Laili. “Whatever happens though, the Bajau are able to adapt. They will build their homes on higher stilts or move to an area less prone to flooding,” he said. However, not all Bajau Laut communities are able to move or act in accordance with rising sea levels.  A Bajau Laut fisherman who lives in Kampong Tanjung Aru Lama, who wanted to be known only as Janau, told CNA that he has noticed that the sea level has been getting higher over the last few years. He said that the higher tide has resulted in more flooding in the village, and washed trash from the surrounding areas to the homes. When CNA visited the area, there was plastic, metal and wooden trash surrounding the floating village. Janau said: “It’s not ideal but we just get on with life. We are not going to move because everything we need is here.” PUBLIC EDUCATION KEY TO CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION Assoc Prof Haliza said that there is a need to educate Bajau Laut communities on the causes and impacts of climate change. “Local attitudes toward the environment will play a central role in adjustments to climate change,” she said. “The capacity of societies to change both belief and behaviour regarding the use of the environment will be key in mitigating these risks,” Assoc Prof Haliza added. 
  Dr Serina stated that the situation with the Bajau Laut is “tricky” because of the fact that they are stateless, meaning that the government does not recognise their existence.  “Unfortunately they are undocumented and in Sabah, often treated as unwanted intruders to the state,” said Dr Serina. “Given this situation, they won't have any voice on any level. I'm not even sure that climate change issues are really high on their list of needs. What they need is regular schooling and education for the kids, healthcare and documentation."" She added: ""Things like environmental conservation and climate change barely come across their radar when they are struggling for survival.” 
  Another issue is language and communication, said Mr Laili, as the Baju Laut speak in their own language and struggle to grasp basic general knowledge like money.  “What we teach them is very basic things, how to read, to write, how to count money,” he said. “Once we break this communication barrier, we can talk about issues (like climate change) that could impact their future, and the lives of their next generations,” he added."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/green-plan-seeks-create-new-jobs-make-use-sustainability-competitive-advantage-singapore-1883026,"Green Plan seeks to create new jobs, make use of sustainability as 'competitive advantage' for Singapore","SINGAPORE: A green economy which will seek to create new jobs, transform local industries, and harness sustainability as a competitive advantage, will be part of Singapore's push for sustainable development. Named as one of the five key pillars in the Singapore Green Plan 2030 which was unveiled on Wednesday (Feb 10), the green economy will include a number of new targets, such as Jurong Island becoming a sustainable energy and chemicals park. The other four pillars of the Green Plan are entitled: ""City in Nature"", ""Sustainable Living"", ""Energy Reset"" and ""Resilient Future"". Described as a “whole-of-nation movement” to advance the national agenda on sustainable development, the Green Plan is spearheaded by the Ministries of Education, National Development, Sustainability and the Environment, Trade and Industry and  of Transport. It aims charts Singapore’s green targets over the next 10 years.  More details on the Green Plan will be released at the upcoming Budget announcement on Feb 16, as well as during the Committee of Supply debate in Parliament expected later this month. Under the green economy, Singapore will aim to become a sustainable tourism destination, a leading centre for green finance and services to facilitate Asia’s transition to a low-carbon and sustainable future, as well as a leading regional centre for developing new sustainability solutions, said the ministries in a press release. Singapore will also develop and trial new technologies for carbon capture, utilisation and storage, as well as study the potential of low-carbon hydrogen and other emerging technology pathways for decarbonisation. 
  When it comes to carbon intensive sectors, the plan will also seek to ensure that new carbon-intensive investments brought into Singapore are among the ""best-in-class"" when it comes to factors such as carbon efficiency and energy efficiency. As part of the green plan, the Government also said that it would review the Singapore's carbon tax by 2023. Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu had previously noted that the carbon tax was “central” to the country’s climate mitigation strategy, adding that it was the one of the “most comprehensive globally” at 80 per cent of total emissions. 
  “Our carbon tax framework has been tailored to our context, putting in place a fair, uniform and transparent price signal to incentivise emissions reductions,” she said. An increase of Singapore's carbon tax was suggested by a number of Members of Parliaments in a parliamentary sitting last week.  AN ""ENERGY RESET"" One of the key initiatives as part of Singapore's ""energy reset"" is the requiring of all new car registrations to be cleaner-energy models from 2030. The Government also hopes to more than double the targeted number of electric vehicle charging points from 28,000 to 60,000 charging points by 2030.  This builds on the announcement in last year's Budget where a series of measures, including additional incentives to purchase environmentally friendly vehicles, were introduced as part of Singapore's vision to have all vehicles run on cleaner energy by 2040. When it comes to sustainable towns and districts, the ministries reiterated the previously set 2030 target of reducing energy consumption in existing HDB towns by 15 per cent. 
  There are also plans to raise the sustainability standards of our Singapore's buildings through the next edition of the Singapore Green Building Masterplan. The masterplan will ""pave the way"" for a low carbon built environment, said the joint-ministry press release. Among other things, it will raise minimum energy performance requirements, as well as review the Green Mark scheme. On the green energy front, Singapore will aim to increase solar energy deployment by five times to at least 2 gigawatt-peak, which can meet around 3 per cent of its 2030 projected electricity demand and generate enough electricity to power more than 350,000 households a year. It will also continue to diversify its electricity supply with clean electricity imports. Other goals include promoting sustainable fuels for international trade and travel, as well as increasing solar deployment in Singapore. ""The comprehensive plan will strengthen Singapore’s economic, climate and resource resilience, improve the living environment of Singaporeans, and bring new business and job opportunities,"" said the ministries. ""It will influence all aspects of our lives, from how we live to how we work, and play, as we work together as a nation to make Singapore a greener and more liveable home."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/green-plan-2030-climate-change-singapore-carbon-emissions-1883031,Here’s what life could look like when the new Green Plan is realised in 2030,"SINGAPORE: When you wake up in the morning to get ready for work, you switch off the solar-powered fan in your bedroom and head to the shower.  Standing under newly replaced shower fittings that lighten the utilities bill, you consider heading up to the community garden on the roof of the HDB multistorey car park to grab some fresh tomatoes after your morning routine.  As you leave the bathroom and head to the kitchen to have breakfast, the smart LED lights in the house come on. Your children are getting ready to go to school on a cleaner-energy bus. At their carbon-neutral school, they will learn about climate change and compost their food waste for the school’s community garden.  Motion sensor lights in the common areas come alive as you leave the house for work and you make your way down to the dual bicycle racks where you parked your two-wheeler.  Next comes the 40-minute journey to your office. As you ride through park connectors and take in the greenery, you think about having a weekend picnic at the park 10 minutes away from your home.  Just as you arrive at your office housed in a super low-energy building, it starts to drizzle. You try to remember if you closed the windows before you left the house. The urban water harvesting system at your block collects the rainwater to recycle it for non-potable uses.  All this and more could soon be a reality for Singapore by 2030, with the unveiling of the Singapore Green Plan on Wednesday (Feb 10).  
  The plan charts Singapore’s green targets over the next 10 years, and is spearheaded by the Ministry of Education (MOE), the Ministry of National Development (MND), the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE), the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and the Ministry of Transport (MOT).  It also positions Singapore to achieve its long-term net-zero emissions goal “as soon as viable”, and strengthens the country’s commitments under the United Nations' 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and Paris Agreement, said the five ministries in a joint media release on Wednesday.  SCHOOLS AND TRANSPORT The plan laid out some new initiatives, building on Singapore’s current green goals.  One objective is to reduce the waste sent to the landfill by 30 per cent, aiming for a 20 per cent reduction by 2026, said the five ministries in the media release.  The Government aims for at least 20 per cent of schools to be carbon-neutral by 2030 “for a start”, with the rest of the schools to follow, working towards a two-thirds reduction of net carbon emissions from the school sector by 2030.  In schools, the Green Plan will be supported by the Eco Stewardship programme, to “strengthen the inculcation of informed, responsible and sustainability-conscious” mindsets and habits in youth.  
  Another initiative requires all new car registrations to be cleaner-energy models from 2030, and that the number of electric vehicle charging points be doubled by 2030.  Under the plan, Singapore will only purchase cleaner-energy public buses and encourage walking and cycling.  By 2030, the country hopes to achieve 75 per cent of mass public transport modal share. It also looks to expand the rail network from about 230km today to 360km, and triple cycling paths from 460km today to 1,320km.  
  The Green Plan also laid out some new targets for green spaces, water and solar energy.  Singapore hopes to double its annual tree planting rate between 2020 and 2030, to plant 1 million more trees across the island. The ministries hope to increase the land area of nature parks by over 50 per cent from the 2020 baseline.  By 2030, every household will be within 10-minute walking distance of a park. By 2035, Singapore hopes to add 1000 ha of green spaces.  Singapore also plans to develop new town concepts. For example, Tengah will have the first car-free HDB town centre.  WATER AND ENERGY With the plan, the Government aims to reduce household water consumption to 130 litres per capita per day.  Under the climate-friendly household programme, shower fitting replacements will encourage water conservation and water-efficient practices for households, said the authorities in the media release.  A mandatory water efficiency labelling scheme will also be implemented.  
  Under the 10-year HDB Green Towns programme, Singapore will introduce smart LED lighting that uses 60 per cent less energy than normal LED lighting, and double the total solar capacity on HDB rooftops by 2030.  The Government also aims to reduce energy consumption in existing HDB towns by 15 per cent by 2030.  Those who stay in HDBs can look forward to urban farms and community gardens on the top decks of multi-story carparks. New HDB towns will also be greener and more sustainable - Tengah town will have a centralised cooling system.  The Jurong Lake district will be developed as a model “sustainable mixed-use district” with district cooling, solar power deployment and super low-energy buildings.  The Green Plan will be a “living plan”, said the ministries, which evolves as they develop and refine Singapore’s strategies. It will take into account technological developments, and incorporate a “continuous national engagement” process.  The ministries will “actively involve” the public and other partners to further develop ideas and undertake relevant initiatives as part of this national engagement process. This will begin with a series of Green Plan Conversations this year to seek the views of Singaporeans and to explore potential partnerships. These sessions will be hosted by the ministers overseeing the Green Plan. Other engagements will also be planned throughout the year. More details on the Green Plan will be released at the upcoming Budget 2021 announcement on Feb 16, as well as during the resultant Committee of Supply Debates in Parliament. "

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/experiences/the-loco-group-adopt-a-tree-sustainability-1923531,"At this Singapore restaurant, you can adopt a tree to fund reforestation efforts","Want to play a part in helping to mitigate climate change? Independent restaurant group The Loco Group is giving diners the option to adopt a tree, which will fund reforestation efforts across Borneo’s endangered rainforests. The group, which announced its commitment to carbon neutrality in 2019, has launched a tree-planting initiative at Super Loco Robertson Quay. At this Mexican restaurant, patrons can adopt a tree for a one-time payment of S$6. The Loco Group will match every tree adopted by planting a new tree.   This initiative, led in conjunction with Swedish technology start-up Green Steps Group, will help fund reforestation efforts in Borneo, one of the world’s oldest rainforests recognised by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site for its biodiversity, critically endangered wildlife and indigenous people. 
   A post shared by GreenStepsGroup (@greenstepsgroup) Once a lush blanket of tropical rainforests, decades of extensive deforestation driven by illegal palm oil activity in the region have devastated the rainforest ecosystem’s ability to recover on its own, resulting in widespread erosion, flooding, wildfires, habitat loss for critically endangered species as well as a major loss of livelihood to indigenous communities relying on the forest for sustenance.  To date, 56 million hectares of forest have been lost, and only 24 per cent of the original forest cover remains. After purchasing a tree, guests are given a unique QR code that lets them view their adopted tree sapling on Green Steps Group’s digital platform.  Containing information about their sapling’s species, location, date and time of planting as well as the local farmer in charge of caring for that tree, guests will be able to see how their individual contributions have a far-reaching, sustained impact in giving the planet a fighting chance towards recovery. In response to queries from CNA Luxury, a representative from The Loco Group said that diners at Super Loco Robertson Quay can “adopt as many trees as they like”. However, “the adoption process will be carried out one tree at a time”. This initiative will be progressively rolled out at Super Loco Customs House and Lucha Loco in the coming months, the group said in a press release. Meanwhile, Super Loco Robertson Quay has also debuted a new carbon-conscious menu featuring regionally sourced seafood and an expanded selection of vegetarian options that make up 50 per cent of the menu. By scanning the QR code on the menu, guests are able to view the carbon footprint of each dish and its independent greenhouse gas emissions from the point of production in its country of origin to the distance travelled in Singapore. In addition, guests can also compare the difference between carbon footprints of plant-based proteins and animal proteins. ""As a food and hospitality business, we are proud to lead the conversation in our community about the true cost to the environment that our meal choices have,” said Will Leonard, general manager of The Loco Group. “With this project, we hope to show that a single action of doing something seemingly small as planting a single tree, scaled up to the community level will make an impact on the world we live in, and the one we leave for our children.” ""With this project, we hope to show that a single action of doing something seemingly small as planting a single tree, scaled up to the community level will make an impact on the world we live in, and the one we leave for our children.” – Will Leonard"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/solar-energy-singapore-panels-cloudy-unpredictable-electricity-1882996,Commentary: Why hasn’t solar energy in Singapore taken off in a big way after so long?,"SINGAPORE: In 2016, the Government issued its Climate Action Plan which included a commitment to reduce the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions by 36 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030, and for these emissions to reach a peak at around 2030. Early last year, it made a further commitment, aiming to halve the level of peak emissions by 2050 and achieve net-zero emissions “as soon as viable in the second half of the century”. Among other measures, this will require the country to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, notably in the production of electricity where more than 95 per cent is produced by natural gas. Singapore’s options for domestically generated low-carbon electricity are relatively limited. 
  There is insufficient wind for wind power, the rocks beneath us are not hot enough for commercially viable geothermal energy. Tidal and wave energy have theoretical potential but Singapore’s maritime space is too busy with shipping, and nuclear energy is considered too risky for Singapore even with today’s technology Therefore, solar energy is the most viable option and solar photovoltaics is the current prevailing technology. This why the Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing in October 2019 identified solar energy as one of the “Four Energy Switches”. Solar energy also improves the country’s security of energy supply as it is produced within Singapore. In contrast, all natural gas is imported. Listen to Philip Andrews-Speed also tackle how Singapore's import of electricity from Malaysia will work and its implications on CNA's The Climate Conversation:  SOLAR IS PICKING UP, BUT SINGAPORE’S AMBITIONS REMAIN MODEST Solar photovoltaic panels (or modules) consist of a number of cells composed of semiconducting materials that convert sunlight into electricity through what is known as the photovoltaic effect. Although the mass production of photovoltaic cells dates back 40 years, the extensive deployment of solar photovoltaic panels around the world only really started to pick up from about 2010. Since then the global installed capacity has risen 17-fold. One of the reasons for this recent surge of capacity is that the cost of photovoltaic panels has declined to about one-tenth of what it was in 2010. Singapore’s deployment of solar photovoltaic panels at significant scale started in about 2009 and accelerated from 2015. 
  By September 2020, the total installed capacity was 400 MWp (MWp is the power output of a solar power system which would be achieved under ideal conditions). But this is still only a tiny fraction of the country’s total power generating capacity of 12,600 MW. Furthermore, solar power is variable unless accompanied by energy storage and so it contributed only about 0.55 per cent of the country’s total electricity supply in late 2020.   The current objective is to boost the installed capacity of solar photovoltaics to 2,000 MWp by 2030. This would provide the equivalent of 4 per cent of Singapore’s electricity at today’s level of demand. But, of course, the country’s demand for electricity is likely to continue growing, not least as we electrify road transport. This leads to the question of why these ambitions are so modest. THE PROBLEM WITH CLOUD COVER The constraints to Singapore’s ability to host a substantial solar photovoltaic capacity arise primarily from the limited availability of two natural resources about which we can do little: Sunlight and space. 
  On top of these are a number of technological issues that can be progressively addressed. Although Singapore’s climate is relatively hot and the weather is usually sunny, the average intensity of solar radiation across a full year is not very high. Certainly it is 50 per cent higher than that in northern Europe where solar photovoltaic plays a significant role, notably in Germany. However, it is significantly less than that in northern China, and 30 to 40 per cent less than in the deserts of North Africa, the Middle East and Australia where vast solar photovoltaic arrays are being constructed. Singapore’s problem is cloud cover and humidity, as it is across much of Southeast Asia. In addition, the consistently high temperatures reduce the efficiency of photovoltaic cells. SINGAPORE DOESN’T HAVE ENOUGH SPACE Space is the second key constraint. Singapore lacks vast open spaces in which to build large solar arrays. Much of the land here is occupied by buildings, roads and protected green spaces. Today about one third of the country’s solar energy capacity sits on the rooves of residential buildings, while most of the rest is on public space developed by town councils and grass root units. Industrial buildings account for only just over 10 per cent of this capacity. Last year saw the publication of an updated roadmap for solar photovoltaic energy produced by a consortium led by the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS).  This detailed analysis concluded that the total usable space for solar photovoltaic panels amounted to just under 37 sq km. Of this, 62 per cent would be on buildings, both roof space and facades. The balance would be shared between temporary land-based installations (temporary because the land is zoned for other uses), floating installations on reservoirs and unused near-shore sea areas, and panels installed above land, canals and roads.   Costs will vary between the options, and none are cheap compared to installing arrays on large tracts of unused, open land. This is an important consideration given that Singapore runs a competitive electricity market. However, as the national price of carbon rises, the commercial viability of these options will improve. TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS The three technical constraints relate to cell efficiency, energy storage and grid integration. The efficiency of commercially available photovoltaic cells currently lies in the range 15 to 21 per cent.   What is also important is that some of the more efficient technologies lose less efficiency as temperatures rise. Looking to the future, we should expect new cell designs to have higher efficiency. As the total capacity of solar photovoltaics grows, energy storage becomes important. This is because solar energy varies during the day as well as from day-to-day. Although demand for electricity in Singapore is high from 9am to 5pm when the sun is at its highest, there is also a lower peak of demand in the evening when people return home from work and turn on their air conditioners and other electrical devices. 
  Batteries and other forms of energy storage will be increasingly needed as the country’s use of solar energy rises to provide electricity in the evenings. Energy storage will also help with integrating the solar power into the electricity grid. The variability of solar energy, from minute-to-minute as well as from hour-to-hour, can pose challenges to maintaining grid stability as the amount of solar power generated rises. This should not be a problem in Singapore due to flexibility of the gas-fired power stations, especially if they are backed up by energy storage systems, LIFESPAN OF SOLAR PANELS, EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE KEY UNCERTAINTIES Looking to the longer term, two other issues are relevant. First, the life span of solar panels is generally 20-25 years, if well maintained. This compares to 40 years for a gas-fired power station. The panels will then need to be replaced and the materials recycled. Less easy to manage will be possible effects of climate change. Temperatures in Singapore may continue rising which will lower the efficiency of the cells, cloud cover and humidity may increase, and the frequency of powerful storms may escalate. In summary, there are severe limits to Singapore’s ability to generate significant quantities of electricity from renewable sources, and this will not come without a cost. 
  Nevertheless, the Government is determined to make this effort. However, if the country wants renewable energy to supply a substantial share of its electricity, then this will have to be imported either from mainland Southeast Asia or from Australia.  This takes us back to the announcement in October 2020 by Mr Chan that Singapore would import electricity from Malaysia, starting with a two-year trial. While this is a nice start, access to substantial quantities of renewable energy will require drawing in hydroelectricity from Laos. Plans also exist to build a cable to bring solar energy from Australia to Singapore. As a result, Singapore will become increasingly dependent on imported renewable energy rather than natural gas for its electricity supply, though gas is likely to remain important for any years.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/singapore-clean-energy-oil-gas-shell-keppel-carbon-tax-climate-1882976,Commentary: Singapore's oil and gas sector should embrace transition to a green future with confidence,"SINGAPORE: The global energy transition is gaining pace.  This transition will open new opportunities in emerging growth industries in Singapore and trigger transformation for many sectors. Value pools will shift, creating economic opportunities for the nation. As an example, the transition from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles (EV) and battery manufacturing is an obvious opportunity.  Positive steps can already be seen in Hyundai’s recently announced US$400million investment to build an EV manufacturing facility in Singapore, capable of manufacturing 30,000 electric vehicles a year when completed at the end of 2022. Singapore’s Keppel Corporation, the world’s largest rig-builder, also recently announced that it will be pivoting from its rig business to clean energy. 
  CAN OIL AND GAS TRANSFORM?  However, the oil and gas industry faces significant pressures to transform — with over a century of operational history, and investments in global infrastructure and stock of assets in the trillions of dollars.  This is an industry with investment lifecycles often stretching over multiple decades. Decisions made now have significant financial impact for many years to come. In the face of the energy transition, oil and gas companies will need to transform their businesses.  A successful pivot will require decarbonisation of existing assets while leveraging new and emerging technologies.  It will also necessitate investment in new growth, partially financed by the operation of conventional assets.  Early moves in this arena can be seen by the likes of Shell, BP, and Total all pivoting towards renewable and green energy opportunities. The industry’s traditional strengths in complex project delivery, deep technical and technology expertise, and operational experience in challenging environments can provide a competitive edge to grow through transition. For example, with decades of offshore oil and gas development experience, the industry is well-placed to compete in offshore wind power, as evidenced by many oil and gas players investing in this space. 
  The industry’s technical expertise and legacy gas infrastructure places it in an advantaged position to scale hydrogen as a source of clean energy.  Oil and gas companies are also well-placed to scale large and complex carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) projects, particularly when carbon dioxide can be stored in depleted oil and gas reservoirs. Equally, it is well-positioned to collaborate and innovative across sectors on alternative low-carbon fuels for transport and adjacent technologies with the industry’s deep understanding and application of new technologies. 
  BUILDING ON EXISTING SKILLS AND CAPABILITIES In the long-run, oil and gas companies need to embrace a multi-technology approach for a successful transition. As they move towards low-carbon technologies, there will be a shift in the types of skills and capabilities the industry needs. Fortunately, oil and gas is an industry with a legacy of attracting deep technical expertise and talent.  Harsh and remote environments have required remarkable engineering prowess to access, develop, and process oil and gas resources, such as deep-water developments in waters up to 3km deep. While the energy transition drives a shift away from oil and gas, it also represents opportunities for expert industry talent. These skilled professionals can be redeployed in adjacent high-growth sectors such as low-carbon energies. As an example, advanced technical talent will be valuable in areas such as hydrogen production.  
  Here there is a need to overcome technical challenges to economically produce, store, and safely transport hydrogen to meet long-term demand.  Advanced mechanical, electrical, chemical, process, and instrument engineers from oil and gas represent existing talent with the skills that can be retrained and redeployed into building and operating the infrastructure required for a future hydrogen economy. 
  Redeploying oil and gas professionals to engage their skills in the emerging green economy addresses both the short-term need for talent in sustainable technologies and the long-term challenges of changing workforce demand in this key regional industry. As an example, Shell has partnered with the Singapore Shell Employees’ Union (SSEU) to set up a council focussed on retraining and upskilling employees for future roles as the company transitions its core business to be net-zero by 2050, aiming to cut its emissions in Singapore by around a third by 2030. More broadly, creating a sustainable landscape of long-term talent will require an end-to-end approach.  This begins with childhood education to increase awareness of environmental responsibilities and develop the foundations to actively address them as career opportunities in future years. Such an educational foundation will enable local industry to scale and embrace the necessary technologies as part of this energy transition while providing the backbone to design novel solutions that empower us to achieve Singapore’s green transition ambitions. Managing a jobs transition while balancing needs for existing industry talent against new technology talent will be critical.  This period of transformation will also create challenges for profitability, as investments required for long-term growth that reflect the energy transition could negatively impact short-term profitability. MAKING THE RIGHT MOVES IN SINGAPORE Government will play a crucial role in leading a successful transition. Cross-sector as well as sector-specific policies will be needed to drive effective change. Policies which help shape and steer the behaviour of businesses and consumers towards greener products and services will also be an important enabler. Recent enhancements to Singapore’s Energy Conservation Act are valuable steps along this journey. Mandatory energy management practices introduced in 2013 ensure companies must monitor, manage, and mitigate energy loss and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, saving 250 kilo-tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) from 2014 to 2018. Recently introduced enhancements set more stringent efficiency requirements for water-cooled chilled water systems in industrial facilities, a system which accounts for around 16 per cent of electricity consumed in these facilities. On Monday (Feb 1), Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu revealed in parliament that Singapore will launch a Green Plan that would be a major policy priority for the government in the coming years, with more details shared by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat during his Budget speech on Feb 16.  Therefore, the government remains an important catalyst to enable markets to deliver on this transition. Pricing carbon and other externalities into investment and purchasing decisions is one-way governments can do this. 
  Carbon pricing is expected to grow in importance over the coming decade, as sustainability considerations inform purchasing decisions, investments, and potential pricing measures. This will not only help signal the economy to deepen investment in low-carbon sectors but offer a framework that could be applied across the region. Today, carbon taxes in Singapore - applied only to high-emissions companies with GHG emissions over 2,000 tCO2e annually and priced at S$5 per tonne of emissions - are largely a mechanism to signal the path of travel for the future. Based on current estimates and experience from other countries, carbon pricing will need to gradually rise to a range of US$50 to US$80 to spur investments into emerging low-carbon technologies needed for a comprehensive climate transition.  Countries in the European Union, such as France, Norway and Finland, are now pricing carbon in the US$40 to US$70 range. SINGAPORE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE In the longer term, Singapore is well-positioned to help establish a viable carbon offset trading market for the region. Singapore is in a unique place when it comes to this global energy transition. Its own carbon emissions are relatively inconsequential at just 0.1 per cent of global emissions, yet its reputation as a respected global partner offers an opportunity to steer regional and global cooperation. The nation’s success as a global finance hub offers a valuable pathway to regional investment.  The Boston Consulting Group estimates that in Southeast Asia, up to 70 per cent of a 2 degrees Celsius path can be achieved with positive economic returns to the region at an investment rate of about 2 per cent of regional GDP into sectors such as energy, transport and infrastructure.  
  Financing from private and public sector sources will need to be mobilised to achieve this transformation. Singapore could be a pivotal partner in attracting, informing, and facilitating required investments. These investments could include a shared commitment to promising new technologies and building collaborative regional opportunities. It could include establishing market conditions to scale climate transition financing, with Singapore as a hub facilitating and encouraging green investment. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) recently introduced environmental risk management guidelines for banks, building environmental concerns into future investment and operational decisions.  The MAS has also announced it will invest US$2 billion in green investment funds in order to drive positive climate action. These are by no means exhaustive examples of climate-focused investment in Singapore.    If Singapore is to build an effective low-carbon future, we must invest in the skills, and the opportunities, together. That is the path to ensuring a more climate-positive future for the nation, and its economy.
