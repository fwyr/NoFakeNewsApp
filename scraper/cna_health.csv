Indeed, many of us have accepted that our crowning glory is pretty much governed by how lucky – or unlucky – we have been in the gene pool lottery. According to Jonsson Protein hair and scalp specialist Jonathan Lee, hair loss is relatively prevalent among Singaporeans, with men being more susceptible. “About 40 per cent of men experience some form of hair loss by the time they hit 30,” he said.  However, all hope (or hair) is not lost. Here, Mr Lee gets to the root of cultivating a healthy head of tresses.  PROTEIN: THE MAIN BUILDING BLOCK OF HAIR Did you know that hair comprises mainly protein? “Protein makes up 91 per cent of your hair structure – it contributes greatly to whether hair is thick and lustrous or not,” said Mr Lee.  The specialist noted that factors commonly associated with the hustle and bustle of modern life could exacerbate hair loss. ""Work-related stress and insufficient rest could lead to a lack of protein in your hair follicles and this may cause hair to become frail and brittle,” he said.  Having a protein-rich diet may not be enough to stem hair loss, he added. “In most cases, diet alone isn’t able to provide hair follicles with the necessary amount of protein for healthy hair growth. Most of the protein we consume does not reach hair and is instead used to support more essential body functions.” At Jonsson Protein, its Protein Hair Growth Treatment aims to circumvent this by delivering protein to the hair and scalp with the direct application of soy protein essence.  Mr Lee shared: “Developed using exclusive nanotechnology, protein from premium soybeans is hydrolysed and broken down into smaller molecules that penetrate the scalp and hair shaft more easily. With protein being more readily absorbed, the condition of hair improves.”  A BALANCED SCALP TYPE FOR HEALTHY HAIR Keeping the scalp clean and balanced is also key to having luscious tresses, said Mr Lee. “Scalp build-up can cause hair loss as dead skin, oil and sweat clog hair follicles. Many people turn to off-the-shelf hair care treatments and products to manage their hair issues, without realising that these topical products may not be absorbed when hair follicles are clogged,” he explained.  Mr Lee added that washing one’s hair daily in hot and humid Singapore is a must. “Besides using a scalp scrub regularly to remove excess skin cells, oil and dandruff, you can also include probiotics in your diet to boost your skin’s microbiome and help promote a healthy scalp,” he recommended.  At Jonsson Protein, customers are taken through a detailed hair and scalp scan and analysis before each Protein Hair Growth Treatment session. This is followed by a deep-cleansing hair wash that rids the scalp of impurities that may reduce the efficacy of the treatment. Soothing massage techniques boost the scalp’s absorption of the protein-rich formula while steam therapy promotes blood circulation and disinfects the scalp. To top it off, an ampoule containing vitamins is applied to the scalp for hydration and to stimulate microcirculation.  A BESPOKE HAIR TREATMENT  The treatment’s efficacy has found a fan in multi-hyphenate artiste Michelle Chong. “Regular treatments at Jonsson Protein help maintain the fullness and sleekness of my hair,” she said.  Ms Chong believes that Jonsson Protein’s customised service is what sets it apart. “The consultants ensure that they have an in-depth understanding of your hair condition at the beginning of each treatment.” According to Mr Lee, Jonsson Protein varies the core treatment strategy for its customers  based on their needs.  “For instance, for male hair loss, we use saw palmetto extract that prevents hair follicle miniaturisation and hair loss, thus prolonging the hair growth phase,” he explained. “In the case of female hair loss, we have found the incorporation of amino acid acetyl tetrapeptide-3 and red clover extract particularly effective. They prevent hair loss by repairing damaged hair follicles.” Television host Lee Teng is another advocate of the Protein Hair Growth Treatment. “I have only done five treatments and the results are obvious. I no longer have dandruff and some baby hair has started growing. My scalp is no longer oily at the end of a long day,” he said. Looking to explore protein treatments for your scalp? Jonsson Protein’s Protein Hair Growth Treatment is available at a promotional rate of S$28 with a bonus hair care set for the first 50 sign-ups. *Individual results may vary."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/pakistan-floods-august-major-health-crisis-climate-change-2911846,'Burning with pain': Pakistan floods threaten major health crisis,"SUKKUR: At a charity clinic in a southern Pakistani village, dozens of people affected by relentless rains and floods crowd around the door waiting to talk to a volunteer doctor. The village of Bhambro is in a poor district of Sindh province, hard-hit by record floods that have destroyed more than a million homes and damaged critical infrastructure including health facilities across the country. Bhambro is surrounded by vast stretches of flooded farmland, its streets full of mud and strewn with debris and manure - conditions ripe for outbreaks of malaria, cholera and skin diseases such as scabies. ""Skin diseases are the main problem here because of dirty, stagnant water and unhygienic conditions,"" said Sajjad Memon, one of the doctors at the clinic, which is run by the charity Alkhidmat Foundation. He used the flashlight on his mobile phone to examine patients, who were mostly reporting scabs and rashes on Tuesday (Aug 30). Many had made their way to the clinic walking barefoot through filthy floodwater and mud. ""My child's foot is burning with pain. My feet too,"" said Azra Bhambro, a 23-year-old woman who had come to the clinic for help. Abdul Aziz, a doctor in charge of Alkhidmat's clinics in the area, told AFP that cases of scabies and fungal infections were on the rise. Scabies outbreaks are common in crowded places with tropical conditions - such as flood relief camps and shelters - and can lead to severe itching and rashes, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Memon told AFP that many of the patients at the clinic could not afford to purchase shoes. The millions of people affected by the floods face major health hazards including potentially deadly diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, the WHO warned in a statement on Tuesday. Sindh province, in Pakistan's south, has been hit particularly hard, with vast swathes of land under water and many villagers forced to head to large cities for shelter, food aid and medical assistance. The health threat is even greater in areas such as Bhambro, where health services were already limited, and for the tens of thousands who are taking shelter in crowded relief camps. ""Ongoing disease outbreaks in Pakistan, including acute watery diarrhoea, dengue fever, malaria, polio and COVID-19 are being further aggravated, particularly in camps and where water and sanitation facilities have been damaged,"" the WHO said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/diabetes-blood-sugar-levels-wearable-glucose-monitor-no-prick-2901636,"How wearable, no-prick glucose monitors are changing the way diabetics manage their blood sugar levels","Whether it’s Type 1 or 2 diabetes, diabetics know the finger-prick blood test all too well. They have to frequently prick their fingers for blood samples and apply the blood to a glucometer to test their blood sugar levels and assess their insulin requirements.  The finger pricking may be more often for Type 1 diabetes, said Professor Tai E Shyong, an endocrinologist and director of the National University Health System's Centre for Chronic Disease Prevention and Management.  This is because Type 1 diabetes patients may need to adjust their insulin dose frequently, especially “if their blood glucose is poorly controlled or they experience frequent episodes of low blood glucose”, he said.  “On the other hand, patients with Type 2 diabetes, which is much more common, don’t really require continuous monitoring over the long term,” said Prof Tai.  Still, the frequency of the finger-prick test can come up to once or twice a week, or four times a day, said Dr Ester Yeoh, a senior consultant endocrinologist at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.  ""It’s not just the number of finger pricks,"" she said. ""When testing needs to be done in the middle of the night to monitor for hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar level), it can be troublesome and annoying for patients and caregivers,"" she said. Repeated finger pricking over the years can also cause the loss of sensation at the fingertips, said Satyaprakash Tiwari, the executive director of Diabetes Singapore, a non-profit organisation. ""There is also evidence that some users of prick tests sometimes skip them out of frustration and the mental drain of frequent testing."" Owing to those inconveniences, it is no wonder that some diabetics have adopted wearable prick-free devices that provide continuous glucose monitoring. But are their readings accurate? Do patients still have to fall back on the finger-prick test? CNA Lifestyle finds out from the experts.  WHAT IS A CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING SYSTEM AND HOW DOES IT WORK? The biggest difference that a continuous glucose monitoring or CGM system brings to the table for the user is that it doesn't require the use of lancets or finger pricking for blood samples. Rather, it detects the body's interstitial fluid – the fluid that surrounds cells in the body – to measure blood glucose. A CGM system such as the Abbott FreeStyle Libre sensor provides a glucose reading every minute of the day for up to 14 days. ""The finger-prick test provides only a snapshot of a user’s glucose level at a specific moment,"" said Tiwari. ""CGM, on the other hand, offers a constant flow of information in real time, enabling users and their caregivers to identify trends and patterns in their glucose levels,"" he said. To use, the sensor (about the size of the dollar coin) is worn on the back of the upper arm for 14 days to transmit real-time information on the patient’s glucose levels.  This data can be accessed via the app at any time – and as often as the patient wants – for up-to-date glucose readings as well as the last eight hours of glucose history. To obtain the readings (even over clothing), swipe a handphone that has the downloaded app over the sensor. There is also no need to remove the sensor in the shower or while exercising or swimming (it is water-resistant in up to 1m of water). After 14 days, users remove it from the arm and replace it with a fresh one without having to recalibrate the new sensor. ARE THE CGM READINGS THE SAME AS THE CONVENTIONAL GLUCOMETER’S? “The accuracy is similar between wearable CGM monitors and conventional glucometers,” said Prof Tai.  However, a CGM system doesn’t measure the glucose in blood, he emphasised. As mentioned earlier, it measures the glucose in the interstitial fluid, which is the fluid that surrounds our cells outside the blood vessels.  “These readings can be a little different, in part, because they measure different fluids,” he explained, “but also because it takes time for glucose to move from the blood to the interstitium when the blood glucose is changing. It takes 10 to 15 minutes before those changes are seen in the interstitial fluid.”   This is particularly so when the glucose levels are very high or very low, he said. “There can be differences between the measurements using wearables and conventional glucometers,” he said. Furthermore, “the wearables can also give errors in situations such as in patients on aspirin or Vitamin C”, as they can affect alter blood glucose measurements. SO DO PATIENTS STILL HAVE TO FALL BACK ON A GLUCOMETER? For those reasons mentioned earlier, most patients using wearables will still need to perform blood glucose testing using a conventional glucometer intermittently, said Prof Tai.  This is “particularly when there is a discrepancy between what they feel and what the wearable shows”, he said. For instance, if the patient feels that his blood glucose is low (signs such as tiredness, dizziness, hunger and trembling) but the wearable does not show a low glucose reading.  Or when the glucose level is supposed to rise very quickly (such as after drinking a sugar-loaded soft drink) but the reading the patient gets is still low as it takes time for the sugar in the blood to reach the interstitium, he said. HOW DO CGM DEVICES FIT INTO PATIENTS’ MONITORING EFFORTS? What Prof Tai commonly sees in his patients, particularly those with Type 2 diabetes, is that they use their CGM devices for a few weeks at a time. They do so to help them understand how their medication, along with their food intake and exercise, affect their blood glucose levels, he said.  “After a few weeks, they are able to figure out what they need to do in order to improve their blood glucose control and thereafter, if they are able to maintain those changes in medication or lifestyle, they may be able to stop the glucose monitoring,” said Prof Tai.  About 1 to 2 per cent of his patients use the wearable CGM devices. But the low take-up rate is likely owing to the cost, he said. “Although the cost of the sensors has declined significantly in recent years, few patients are able to afford the cost of using the sensors continuously.” “What is certainly true is that patients can monitor their glucose levels and manage their diabetes with much fewer finger pricks,” said Prof Tai. He added: “Some patients find that monitoring their glucose continuously using these devices helps them better understand the impact of their food and exercise on blood glucose. The advantage is that the wearables allow them to see the effects of various lifestyle choices almost immediately and they quickly learn what is best for them within the context of their own lives.” As for patients with poorly controlled blood sugar, tracking what happens over the course of the day with these devices can help healthcare professionals adjust their medication to improve their blood sugar control, he said.  WHO IS IT SUITABLE FOR? According to Abbott, the FreeStyle Libre sensor can be used by diabetics with Type 1 or 2 diabetes and as young as four years old. Users under the age of 18 will need the help of caregivers to manage and interpret the readings.   However, individuals with specific health conditions and concerns should consult with their doctors before using the wearable monitor. These include those who have implanted devices such as pacemakers. HOW DO I GET MY FREE CGM SENSOR?

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/surgical-n95-mask-suppliers-shopee-lazada-mask-restrictions-indoors-2908991,Some mask manufacturers in Singapore scale back production as restrictions ease,"SINGAPORE: As Singapore eases mask restrictions, mask manufacturers are scaling back production or pivoting to corporate clients. There used to be manufacturers in Singapore that produced surgical masks but this stopped more than 10 years ago. Many of the manufacturers CNA spoke to started making them because of a global face mask shortage at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. From Monday, Singapore lifted restrictions on wearing masks indoors, except on public transport and in healthcare settings. The requirement to wear masks outdoors was lifted on Mar 29.  Technology company Razer told CNA it will be slowing down its face mask production following the easing of mask restrictions.  Razer said it started making masks during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic due to the global shortage, and ""converted existing product manufacturing lines to make and donate face masks for immediate relief"". The company also started Singapore’s first fully automated mask production and packing line.  Some companies had already scaled back production when mask requirements outdoors were lifted earlier this year.  Director of AVS Technologies Kelvin Mun told CNA that the company already stopped production of face masks earlier this year, and fully shut down its mask manufacturing line in June. Everything lined up, he said, adding that the company’s raw materials for mask manufacturing were used up at around the same time it was due to renew its mask manufacturing licence with the Health Sciences Authority.  The company, which sells printing equipment, set up its mask manufacturing line in March 2020 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic because it could not buy enough masks for its own use.  “We saw that there was a short supply and everyone was panicking and they needed the masks. We thought that we could fill the gap to help supply the shortage,” Mr Mun said.  “It was a totally different thing (from our original business). It was difficult for us because we had to learn the new lingo from the medical side, all the requirements and paperwork that we were not used to.”  AVS Technologies said it sold its masks online and in army supplies shops, selling more than S$100,000 worth of masks per month at the peak of its production. The company has managed to sell off most of its stock, with just a few cartons of kids masks remaining. It plans to donate the masks or share the masks with staff who have children.  Managing director of 3P Medical Device Joseph Ong also said his company had scaled back production by about 40 per cent over the past six months. The company started producing masks in the first quarter of 2020, on top of Mr Ong’s other businesses. The company used to produce about 300,000 to 400,000 masks per month, and produces about 200,000 now. It currently has no plans to scale operations down further, as 40 per cent of its customer base is still made up of corporate customers. It also sells its masks with traditional Chinese medicine shops, hospital pharmacies, mom-and-pop stores, as well as online resellers like Shopee and Lazada.  “That was probably (because we were) anticipating when masks are no longer needed outdoors, there would come one day that the Government might announce that masks are no longer needed indoors,” he told CNA. “But generally, after two-and-a-half years, the public has two sides, or preferences. One side, they prefer not to wear. The other side, they will still continue to wear,” he said, adding that many people still do not feel comfortable going around without a mask. Singapore Technologies Engineering, or ST Engineering began domestic production of medical-grade surgical masks in mid-February 2020, and the masks were used in Singapore’s hospitals on the frontline against COVID-19.  At the time, Singapore had to restart its domestic production capabilities when one of its foreign suppliers could not fulfill its contractual obligations recently to produce surgical masks, then-Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said.  “Our medical-grade surgical mask business was set up with a clear objective, that is to help Singapore establish local mask manufacturing capabilities and strengthen mask supply chain resilience,” said ST Engineering.  In response to queries about whether the company would be stepping down mask production, ST Engineering said: “Our focus has always been on building a sustainable supply of medical-grade surgical masks and N95 masks for our healthcare and frontline workers, as well as local communities in need, and will remain so going forward.  “We have resilient capacity utilisation and business models which well address demand pattern changes.”  Meanwhile, Vital Shield told CNA it plans to maintain mask production or even scale up production if it secures more corporate clients. The company started manufacturing masks at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, adjacent to another cleaning company run by the team. The manufacturer initially saw demand for masks drop by about 10 per cent when the outdoor restrictions were first relaxed. But demand gradually clawed back as Singapore saw infection waves from different variants of COVID-19 and monkeypox, said its sales and marketing manager Mellissa Hau.  The company sells its masks on its website as well as on Shopee and Lazada. But since corporate orders make up about 65 per cent of its demand, the team plans to continue its current level of production. Many of its corporate clients are from industries that still require employees to wear masks, like in F&B or hospitality, said Ms Hau.  “We felt that masks were very expensive and their quality was not there. So we decided to do our own,” she added. “The first year, business was good because that was the start, and people were trying to find affordable and quality masks. After about one-and-a-half years, more competition came in, especially from overseas where the cost was very low … so we got affected a little.” This year, several players decided to shut down operations and focus on their other business, said Ms Hau.  “So the pie is bigger. Our share of the pie increases because some of the players have withdrawn from this industry.”  FairPrice Group, which runs NTUC FairPrice supermarkets, Cheers outlets and Unity pharmacies, said it was currently too early to comment on mask sales, since the eased restrictions were only recently announced.  “We will continue to monitor consumer demand and adjust our supply accordingly.”  Pharmacy chain Watsons said it had already “redone” its forecasting for stocks of face masks since wearing a mask was made optional at the end of March this year. “Currently, we hold an optimal level of stock; enough for current demand while we continue to monitor onward demand with the new rules soon to take place,” said the pharmacy.  Dairy Farm Group, which runs the Giant and Cold Storage supermarkets as well as Guardian outlets, declined to comment on its plans for its current stock of masks."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/singaporean-eating-habits-nutrition-literacy-expired-food-nutrition-labels-2894616,Singaporeans’ eating habits explained: We’re fine with expired food and ignore nutrition labels,"How well do you eat? No, we don’t mean how often you indulge in bubble tea, wagyu hotpot or the island’s most expensive nasi lemak – but rather, the quality of the nutrients you get from your food.  For all the access Singaporeans have to affordable hawker fare and world-class restaurants as well as our reputation as foodies (and might we add, three seasons of MasterChef Singapore that demonstrated Singaporeans can cook), we should be eating very well, right? Or at least know what to eat to be healthy, yes?  Maybe not. An online survey in May 2022 to assess Singaporeans’ nutrition literacy showed that although 76 per cent of the 1,000 respondents were diet-conscious during the pandemic, only 54 per cent thought that they were eating healthily most of the time.  “Based on my experience working with people to improve their health, a good 50 per cent of Singaporeans understand nutrition fundamentals, but the other 50 per cent have very minimal understanding of what food groups are and their functions for our body,” said Fiona Chia, the managing director of nutrition consultancy firm Health Can Be Fun.  Just how did Singaporeans fare in this nutrition literacy survey commissioned by Etiqa, which involved individuals between the ages of 18 and 64? We find out.  YOU KNOW WHAT THE BAD STUFF ARE BUT YOU AREN’T REALLY AVOIDING THEM While majority of Singaporeans might be aware that what they eat now could affect their health in the future (93 per cent), they weren’t quite taking the right action, according to the nutrition survey. Take, for instance, high-cholesterol foods: 43 per cent seldom or never avoided them; 34 per cent did the same for foods that are high in sugar or sodium.  Etiqa’s chief marketing officer Shirley Tan, who has a Masters in Gerontology and an interest in nutrition, had a few theories on why we just aren’t walking the talk. “There is the perception that healthier food has to fit certain criteria. For example, it has to be organic and this is only available at higher prices,” she said. Cost aside, poor eating habits that have been cultivated from young could be hard to kick. For example, fast food or dessert is often used as a reward for children, she said.  While our hawker culture has provided us with affordable and delicious food, they “usually are high in salt and oil and hence, are very unhealthy when eaten regularly”, said Tan.  And there are those who “prefer to live in the moment and enjoy what they want to eat now rather than think about the long-term effects of their dietary habits, often known as the You Only Live Once syndrome (YOLO)”, said Tan. THE OLDER YOU ARE, THE HEALTHIER YOU SNACK It’s no surprise that almost everyone snacks (98 per cent). The differentiation is in how often you snack. As it turned out, one in two were frequent snackers, who munched three times or more a week. Almost one third (28 per cent) snacked once or twice a week, while a fifth (21 per cent) did so less than once a week, according to the survey.  The three most common snack types were: Chips and crackers (59 per cent); chocolates, cakes and sweets (51 per cent); and nuts (45 per cent).  Also, the younger the respondents, the less healthy their snack choices, according to the survey: 80 per cent of those between 18 and 24 years old admitted they snacked on unhealthy snacks (low nutritional values but high in fat, sugar and calories) compared to 37 per cent of those aged 55 and over.  The older group would probably have undergone health screenings and received some health scares along the way, said Chia. “They also are more aware of old-age chronic health issues; hence, they would generally be more health-conscious and know that excessive and unhealthy snacking does not benefit them.” Furthermore, your digestion deteriorates with age, which makes your gastrointestinal system less capable of handling certain snacks, said Chia.  “Our digestion tends to slow down as our gastrointestinal tract loses its elasticity and function with age. Hence, oily, deep-fried, high-sodium and high-sugar foods may cause issues such as bloating, cramps and changes in bowel movement.” OLDER SHOPPERS AREN’T READING THE NUTRITION INFORMATION AS MUCH AS YOUNGER ONES When grocery shopping, close to half of the respondents will read either the health labels or the nutrition facts – but 30 per cent will ignore all the information. And in the latter group that doesn’t read, 42 per cent of them are Gen Z or those between the ages of 18 and 24.  Interestingly, slightly more younger respondents (25- to 34-year-olds) study the packaging of their food compared to those above the age of 45. It could be due to the increase in health and fitness enthusiasts in this group, said Tan, and they might pay more attention to the food they consume. As for why fewer older adults pay attention to the nutrition information, it could be an issue of poor eyesight, she said. Nutrition facts are often in fine print, which makes it difficult for those with bad eyesight to decipher.   Furthermore, reading the nutrition label can be challenging if we do not know what we need to look out for, said Chia. “Learning about food groups and their sources helps us to zoom in on key benefits that we derive from food.  “For example, in carbohydrate-rich foods, we should be looking out for dietary fibre,” she said. “In oils, we should be looking for lower saturated fat and higher mono or polyunsaturated fat content. For snacks, we should be looking out for sodium and total sugar level.”  If bad eyesight is thwarting your efforts to shop healthier, look for the more obvious health labels. For instance, a food with “lower sugar” or “reduced sodium” label is generally 25 per cent lower in sugar or sodium than its conventional counterpart, said Chia.  To be even savvier when comparing food, Chia suggested looking at the canning medium used: For example, canned sardines with a “reduced sodium” health label is a good pick. However, canned sardines in water that do not have a reduced sodium claim, may be even healthier than canned sardines in oil or tomato sauce.  YOU ARE LIKELY TO EAT EXPIRED CANNED FOOD  The survey found that more than half of Singaporeans (59 per cent) are willing to eat expired packed or canned food. Out of this lot, 34 per cent may do so if the food is one to three days past the expiry date, while 14 per cent will still eat the food if it is one week past. And 11 per cent may eat food that is over a week past.   According to Tan, there are a few reasons why Singaporeans may continue to consume food past the expiry date. One, they may be unaware of the health implications of consuming expired food.  “Few are aware of the health implications of consuming expired food,"" said Tan. ""As warned by health professionals, eating expired canned food brings infection risks from Clostridium botulinum, which are temperature-resistant bacteria that can cause paralysis and death."" Two, added Tan, they may base their judgement on the external appearance of the packaging or can, which may not be accurate indications.  Thirdly, consumers may “not know the difference between ‘expired’ versus ‘best before’ and ‘use by’ dates”, said Chia. “Food that is past its expiry date should not be consumed at all.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/many-people-mask-shopping-malls-first-day-eased-restrictions-2906686,Many people still masked up in shopping malls on first day of eased restrictions,"SINGAPORE: Many people were still wearing their masks in shopping centres and malls, despite the eased restrictions from Monday (Aug 29).  Among them was Ms Aminah Johari at NEX shopping mall in Serangoon who was unaware that restrictions have lifted. Still, Ms Aminah, who does part-time administrative work, maintained that she would continue to mask up until Singapore records fewer than 100 community cases per day. The 61-year-old said she felt concerned about the announcement as the numbers could increase as the year came to an end.  “Because as it is, they said cases might go up again at the end of the year and because some people, when they sneeze or cough, they do not cover their mouths (even) before the pandemic,” she said. Others, like Ms Aminah, were not aware that restrictions have lifted. CNA observed a middle-aged man in a retail store at City Square Mall asking why an employee was not masked up while in the changing rooms. The retail staff member could be heard explaining the new restrictions. As of Monday, indoor mask restrictions have been lifted across Singapore, except on public transport and in healthcare facilities. Masks are still required on the MRT, LRT and public buses as well as in indoor public transport facilities like boarding areas at bus interchanges and MRT platforms, but are optional on private transport modes like taxis and private hire cars.  When CNA visited shopping malls across Singapore on Monday, many people were still wearing their masks indoors, with only a handful walking around unmasked. When asked, those masked said they wore it out of habit or social responsibility.  There were more people unmasked at Changi Airport at lunchtime, many with luggage in tow.  Polytechnic student Lim Meng Loek, who was waiting for his friend at Changi Airport, told CNA he wore a mask because he was used to it.  “Now there is still COVID-19, it is not totally over. So I just continue wearing,” the 20-year-old told CNA, adding that he usually takes his mask off outdoors.  “Over time slowly … more people will take off their masks. For the first day, I just continue (to wear).” Mr Lim said that he has caught the virus at least three times, so he feels he has developed some immunity against COVID-19. Since he has hearing issues and wears a hearing aid, it is easier for him to understand people when they are speaking to him without wearing a mask. “(I take it off) only outside, in open spaces. For indoor spaces, I will see how, if there are fewer people I will take it off. But now we are in Changi Airport, there are a lot of foreigners coming in,” he added.  “For me, masks are very suffocating. If we can get back to normal and take them off that would be better - I can breathe properly and we can see each others’ faces.”  Homemaker Shaleen Agrawal, who was seen seated at Jewel Changi Airport, said that she kept her mask on in the airport area as many travellers still came in from other parts of the world.  She added that she wore her mask out of habit and will continue to do so in crowded areas. “When we heard the news we were so happy and excited but yet on the day we are allowed to take it off we still have it on,” the 45-year-old noted while laughing.  That said, Mrs Shaleen felt it was better to mask up. “It is for the protection of each other. I have kids in my family and I do not know whether you have elderly in yours. It is just the more responsible thing to do.”  According to a survey by YouGov conducted on Aug 25 and Aug 26, nearly half, or 48 per cent of the 1,046 respondents said they would always wear a mask in shopping centres. Sixty per cent of respondents said they would always wear a mask on private transport modes, and 58 per cent of them said they would always wear one at the airport or in train stations. Private transport modes and the airport also emerged as the top indoor places respondents felt uncomfortable visiting, now that wearing a mask is no longer required, the survey showed.  Singapore saw 1,361 reported COVID-19 locally transmitted cases on Sunday, according to figures from the Ministry of Health (MOH).  Others who went unmasked indoors on Monday told CNA that they would still mask up if others around them expressed their discomfort, or if establishments insisted that patrons wear masks.  At NEX, interior designer Thomas Seah said that a retail assistant had “shouted” at him for failing to mask up while in a shop selling beauty products. According to the 65-year-old, the retail employee claimed that his staff would get infected because of Mr Seah and that they would only change the regulations if they received a circular from the management.  It would be in circumstances like these that he would continue wearing a mask, Mr Seah said.  “People get nervous when I don't wear a mask, so it's more for psychological reasons (that I wear a mask). I don't want people to scream and shout,” he said.  Others like entrepreneur Preeti Darbari said that COVID-19 has become a part of life and that there are medications to treat it.  “I will take life as normal, and COVID-19 is like a flu, we should take it normally ... and not make a huge thing out of it so that the next generation of kids will start behaving normally again,” the 43-year-old said while unmasked in City Square Mall. She added that she did not want children to grow up “expressionless” behind a mask. Ms Christiana Martins, who is a mother of two, said she sent both her children aged five and seven to school without masks today. Ms Martins, who is from Brazil, had just left the gym in Tampines 1 and was not wearing a mask in the shopping mall. She told CNA she was looking forward to life returning back to normal with the lifting of indoor mask restrictions and observed that most of her older son’s classmates in Primary 1 came to school with their masks still on.  “Here in Singapore, we already have boosters and everything seems all right, I don’t think there will be any problems if you don’t wear a mask. I feel more free and I can breathe better, because after using a mask for so long this is so much better,” she added.  “I just felt a little bit uncomfortable because everyone was still wearing one,” said Ms Martins. After seeing everyone with their masks on in the shopping mall, she sent a message to her husband to confirm that restrictions would be lifted from today. “I don’t judge anybody, but it is funny because you start to feel uncomfortable because you look around and you are the unique one,” she said with a chuckle.  Polytechnic students Daniel Cheong and Isaac Tan, who are friends from church, spoke to CNA while queueing to order food at Tampines 1 - both were not wearing masks.  “I think what made me decide (to take it off) is hearing about the news, hearing about how it is safe now, there aren’t any spikes in infections or things like that, so I think I’ll just take off my mask,” said Mr Cheong, 19.  “The Government is doing a good job of containing the cases, so I guess for me, I feel safe to take it off.”  The two friends also observed that many people in the mall were still wearing their masks.  “It’s also because people are not used to taking off their masks at the moment because it’s a new rule and it has just been implemented today. I think definitely within the next few days people will start to take off their masks as they feel more safe and know the new rules better,” said Mr Cheong.  When asked how not wearing a mask indoors felt after more than two years of wearing one throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, 20-year-old Mr Tan said he felt “quite comfortable”. “Especially because Singapore is so hot. So when you sweat, the feeling in your mask just does not feel very good.”  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/covid19-pandemic-good-death-home-hospital-2903766,Commentary: COVID-19 pandemic changed what it means to have a ‘good death’,"REGINA, Canada: When considering what a “good death” is, most people in North America would likely say something along the lines of living to at least 75, and painlessly passing away at home in their sleep would constitute a good life and, most importantly, a good death. One of the key features of the “good death” narrative is being at home. So, what do we mean by home and how important is the idea or feeling of “being at home” to a good death? Home is more than just a structure. It is textures, smells, sounds and atmosphere. It is a sticky table that brings you back to your first day of school when you held your brother’s hand as you both walked to the bus or a smell that reminds you of the first time you baked cookies with your grandmother and danced around the kitchen singing along to Cher. Home is nothing, but everything, especially at the end of life. Death used to be treated as a public event, but as our society has become more individualistic, it has shifted to being a matter best dealt with in private by ritual specialists - like an embalmer or funeral director - and close family members. As the home is thought of as being the most intimate private space we inhabit, it should not be surprising that most people wish to seek “home” in the dying process. To die outside of home is seen to be a failure - a bad death. The pandemic changed the lives of many people. Isolated from friends and family, away from home, many people didn’t have access to a “good death” - especially those in care homes. So it is important to reflect back on this idea of a “good death” and how we understand what home and family mean. Since the 1920s and 1930s, the government has increased its control over funerals and end-of-life treatments. This became an even greater concern in the 1950s and 1960s, when advancements in medical care meant that people who would have previously had an “uncomplicated” death now found themselves entangled in, and dependant on medicine. With an ageing population and medical advancements, the reality is that as people age, they are likely to find themselves being put in the role of “patient"", where their death will be medically mediated. This means that even if they are able to be at home, their health is being medically determined, with the end result being that the amount of control they have over their own lives and final care has become complicated. The ideal narrative of living to 75 and passing away at home quietly and painlessly while asleep is becoming increasingly difficult to realise. The fear of not having a “good death"", by dying at home among family members, has become a very real concern - especially during the pandemic. Before COVID-19, people who lived in places like care homes would still be invited to gatherings or enjoy the occasional visit from a loved one. Their social death was isolating, but not devastating. During peak restrictions, senior living and care facilities were locked down. This resulted in family members feeling helpless and those living in care facilities feeling hopeless. The shutdowns, intended to keep them safe, caused many to long for a home that wasn’t restricted - some even opted to choose medically assisted death in the face of additional lockdowns. In the Netherlands, home is thought of as not just being a physical space, but is seen as a state of being in the family. Isolated from their families during the pandemic, many individuals found themselves no longer being in the family. The social death they were experiencing was felt to be far more painful than any fear or concern they had about their own biological death. As we reflect on what life means to us in this post-pandemic shuffle, we need to also contemplate what a “good death” is. For some, that may mean opting for quality of life and control over how, when, with whom and where it ends through end-of-life programmes. The pandemic will forever change how people understand what home and family means, what their role within the family and home is, and how to be in the family and in the home, in whatever form that may be, for their passing.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/mental-health-terms-slang-misuse-ocd-schizo-bipolar-stigma-2899846,Commentary: Saying ‘I’m so OCD’ when you’re not casts mental illnesses in a bad light,"SINGAPORE: As a junior medical officer, one of my main duties was to scribe for senior doctors when they interviewed patients. In trying to keep up with their pace, we would often truncate long words. This included diagnoses. For example, instead of writing cerebrovascular accident, we would use acronyms such as CVA. Likewise in my first psychiatric posting, other trainees and I would often replace schizophrenia with “Schiz” when writing notes. With time, using such abbreviations became habitual, resulting in us using these terms when we communicated the diagnosis verbally. It was not long before this caught the attention and, unsurprisingly, incurred the ire of our senior psychiatrists in the hospital. In that foregone era where medical audits were not the be-all and end-all, our seniors were upset with us for using short forms such as “Schiz”, either written or verbal, not because they were afraid that we would fail an audit, but because doing so was disrespectful. We learnt that as mental health providers, we must respect the diseases we treat and, even more so, the patients who are labouring under the immense debilitation of these unfortunate illnesses. Some shrugged off such terminology issues as unimportant and instead blamed the senior doctors for being ""anal"". I, however, took to the reasoning and have since joined the ranks of greying psychiatrists. Having been trained to utilise psychiatric diagnoses in the strictest and most accurate manner, it is often extremely jarring to hear them used flippantly by the public. Let us take obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) as an example. How often have you heard someone proclaim that they have OCD, or a family member or friend has it? Often what they are ranting about is that the person has somewhat of a relatively higher standard in being proper and clean. In contrast, the patient who meets the clinical criteria for OCD gets stuck in the shower for many hours, desperately wanting to leave yet being unable to do so until their washing ritual is performed perfectly in the right sequence. Studies have shown that derogatory terms and negative references to mental illnesses are commonly used in print, television and movies. Worryingly, even animations and cartoons have been found to portray mental illness in a negative light. Consequently, young children will be exposed to these negative terms growing up and believe it is linguistically appropriate to use them in such a manner. Memes making fun of OCD are abundant on the Internet. In a comedy podcast I heard recently, the comedian repeatedly called tech employees “autistic”.   Using mental health terms in these ways may seem innocuous at first glance; some may even argue that it is done merely for fun and humour. But this can cast mental illnesses and those who live with it in a bad light. More seriously, the resulting shame and social stigmatisation associated with having a psychiatric diagnosis is likely one of the the main reasons why they refuse to seek help and treatment. In the medical community, when a terminology becomes too stigmatised, we change the name to the diagnosis to protect those with the condition. Historical terms for intellectual disability, such as “imbecile”, “moron”, and “feeble minded”, were initially diagnostic terminologies. They became so heavily misused that they were replaced with terms such as “mental dullness”, “mental disability”, and later “special needs” and “mental retardation”. However, these terms likewise crept into casual usage and in time words like “retard” and “special needs” became an insult and no longer politically correct to use. In the last two decades, the preferred term has been that of “intellectual disability”. One cannot help but wonder when the euphemistic cycle will once again necessitate another change in nomenclature. Aside from OCD, another mental health term commonly tossed around is “bipolar”. It is often used casually to describe people who have mood swings, are ill-tempered or who simply like to change their minds a lot. I often have worried – but otherwise healthy - patients consulting me, anxious over about having “bipolar” symptoms when, in reality, they were experiencing passing mood swings. Actual sufferers of bipolar disorder don’t have the luxury of having passing mood swings. They have extreme mood states of either mania or depression that are sustained for a significant duration of many days to even months. The symptoms of mania or depression are often severely debilitating. In a manic phase, the patient is unusually elated, has an inflated sense of self, may be more confrontational, and have impulsive acts like overspending. The person may send out irrational messages to friends and family. When the manic phase subsides after several weeks, the patient regrets the impulsive actions, dives into severe low mood, and loses motivation. The person becomes withdrawn, not wanting to socialise and may have suicidal ideations. Depression is another often misused word. Feeling moody after watching a sad movie is world’s apart from what a person who actually has depression experiences - an intense sense of despair, hopelessness, loss of interest in everything around them and feelings of being a burden. Used as slangs, many of these terms may mean nothing more than normal quirks or personality traits in all of us. Yet this trivialises the difficulties and tribulations for people with or who had mental illnesses. Casual usage of these terms and the consequent watered-down definition of what these illnesses really are can sometimes also lead to some people medicalising life issues - that is to believe and attribute personal problems and failures in life to medical and psychiatric conditions. Some students, who are not doing as well in school as they may hope to, become adamant that they suffer from attention deficit disorder (ADD) as they match the casually posted description of the condition on online forums. Blaming the condition is not useful and detracts them from learning what they may require most: To manage their expectations and stress. On the extreme end of this side of the spectrum, some may even romanticise about having a mental health condition and jump onto the bandwagon of what essentially is a fad. When #PTSD started trending, many homemade TikTok videos of young folks having PTSD flooded the platform.   Several weeks later, it was #DID (dissociative identity disorder). For patients who actually have such mental health conditions, the stigmatisation, trivialisation and careless use of psychiatric diagnoses in our society’s everyday communication signals a lack of empathy from the people around them. It suggests to them that their community neither understands their conditions nor their suffering. As a mental healthcare provider, I do not feel that it is mine or the psychiatric community’s responsibility to decide or police what should be said or can be used. Who is to say that my choices of words do not encroach on or are offensive to other professionals? After all, how words evolve and how slangs arise is a complex issue. Today, many archaic psychiatric terms continue to survive only because they have slipped into our daily lexicon. “Anal stage” was a Freudian psychoanalytic term used to refer to the link between potty training and personality in adulthood, but we now use “anal” casually to describe rigid behaviours. “Paranoia” is an obsolete name of the psychiatric diagnosis of delusional disorder but is today acceptable as a word describing mistrust and suspicion. I am sure the incorrect and casual use of psychiatric diagnoses and terminologies simply reflects the ignorance of the users rather than any malice. While society is more willing than ever to talk about mental health issues rather than just sweep it under the carpet, these conversations are in my opinion usually superficial. Media continues to only focus on the unusual and sensational. We do not yet have a deeper appreciation of the symptoms, dysfunctions and treatment of these conditions.  As we have successfully accomplished with medical conditions like diabetes in Singapore, more must be done to educate the public and to improve mental health literacy in the population, especially for common disorders like depression and anxiety disorders. As individuals, we can strive to be more careful in choosing the terms we use, avoid problematic language, and in doing so do our part in not further stigmatising mental health conditions and diagnoses. It is only right that we learn to respect the health conditions - physical or psychological - that may afflict our family, our friends and ourselves.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/long-covid-19-symptom-cough-brain-fog-how-long-omicron-2901841,Commentary: It’s hard to tell how many people get long COVID,"OXFORD: In the weeks and months after a COVID-19 infection, some people develop a variety of symptoms, commonly referred to as long COVID. Fatigue is the most common, affecting a little over half of people with ongoing symptoms. Other common symptoms include shortness of breath, loss of smell, muscle ache and brain fog. Our understanding of why some people face ongoing symptoms after COVID-19 is still poor. And much like the varying nature of long COVID symptoms, the duration and intensity of symptoms differ from person to person. Notably, we’ve also had difficulty pinning down the precise prevalence of long COVID (that is, what proportion of people it affects). This has been a subject of considerable debate. But recently, a study published in The Lancet has been touted as providing the most reliable estimates to date on the prevalence of long COVID. Estimates of how commonly long COVID occurs generally range from about 5 per cent to 50 per cent of COVID-19 cases, depending on which study you look at. Patients who require admission to hospital for COVID-19 have tended to sit at the higher end of the spectrum. A lot of the variability in prevalence estimates earlier in the pandemic was related to inconsistent definitions of long COVID. To clarify this, and to make diagnosis easier, public health authorities including the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have introduced standardised definitions for long COVID. According to NICE, the term ""long COVID"" can be used to describe signs and symptoms that continue or develop beyond four weeks after a COVID-19 infection. This is further divided into “ongoing symptomatic COVID-19”, when symptoms last for more than four weeks but less than 12 weeks, and “post-COVID syndrome”, when symptoms continue beyond 12 weeks from infection. But in spite of these efforts, considerable variation in prevalence estimates has remained. Several other factors also likely affect reported prevalence figures across different studies. For example, results can be afflicted by a lack of consistent instruments or questionnaires to screen for long COVID. Further, not having a matched control group (a comparison group that didn’t have COVID), or information on patients’ symptoms before COVID, can be limiting. This information allows researchers to reliably link new symptoms to COVID-19 rather than other diseases. Meanwhile, vaccination status, treatments that reduce the risk of severe disease in COVID-19 patients (like antivirals) and the variant that caused the initial infection may all affect a person’s risk of long COVID. Finally, the timing of assessment also appears to be relevant. Recent data from the UK’s Office for National Statistics suggests that although four in five patients with long COVID have symptoms lasting for at least 12 weeks, only one in five continue to be symptomatic at two years. The recent study published in The Lancet includes data from more than 76,000 people in the Netherlands. The authors have made one of the first attempts to mitigate the various biases that have plagued earlier efforts to quantify long COVID prevalence. They used questionnaires which asked about a range of symptoms and gave these to participants at various time points before, during and after COVID-19 infection. They also compared participants to a control group who hadn’t been diagnosed with COVID-19 and were similar in age and sex. Of participants who had COVID-19, 21.4 per cent experienced at least one new symptom, or a symptom that had become significantly worse since before they had COVID, three to five months post-infection. Some 8.7 per cent of uninfected people followed over the same time period reported symptoms. On this basis, the authors suggest that 12.7 per cent of people who contract COVID-19, or one in eight, develop long COVID. The authors also ascertained a list of core symptoms associated with long COVID, including difficulty breathing, chest pain, heavy arms and legs, loss of sense of smell, feeling hot and cold, tingling in extremities, muscle ache and tiredness. While this study has advanced our understanding of the real-world prevalence of long COVID, there are some important limitations. The majority of patients were not vaccinated because most of the data was collected before the vaccine rollout began in The Netherlands. According to recent research, long COVID appears to be less common among people who are vaccinated. Meanwhile, most participants were infected with the Alpha variant. Studies have also reported a lower prevalence of long COVID among people recovering from infection caused by the currently dominant Omicron variant compared with the Alpha and Delta variants. So in the current context, the prevalence of long COVID in the general population may well be less than one in eight. Importantly, our understanding of the mechanisms that cause persistent symptoms and what makes people vulnerable remains fairly limited. Only additional research, dedicated funding support and greater recognition of the condition will improve the outlook for the millions of people afflicted by long COVID around the world.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/what-types-exercise-do-you-need-reduce-dementia-risk-2886761,What types of exercise do you need to reduce dementia risk?,"Experts had long believed that exercise could help protect against developing dementia. However, though they had observed a general pattern of reduced risk, studies on the subject had been small – and often conflicting – with little consensus on the type, frequency or intensity of exercise that might be best. “There’s no real clear prescription that we can provide for physical activity,” said Dr Joel Salinas, an assistant professor of neurology at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine, who specialises in treating people with dementia. But three major long-term studies released in recent months have attempted to characterise the types, intensities and durations of physical activity that confer the most overall protection against dementia. These studies, which followed thousands, and even hundreds of thousands, of people for years at a time, confirm that regular physical activity, in many forms, plays a substantial role in decreasing the risk of developing dementia. Vigorous exercise seems to be best, but even non-traditional exercise, such as doing household chores, can offer a significant benefit. And, surprisingly, it’s just as effective at reducing the risk in those with a family history of dementia. MANY FORMS OF EXERCISE CAN STAVE OFF DEMENTIA In the first study, published Jul 27 in the journal Neurology, researchers analysed the health information of 501,376 participants who did not have dementia in a British database called UK Biobank to establish links between physical activity and the risk of developing the disease. One of the main advantages of this database was that it had “very enriched data about the genetics” of the participants, said Dr Huan Song, a researcher at West China Hospital, Sichuan University, who was one of the study’s authors. This included a risk profile of participants based on whether they had genetic variants known to be associated with dementia, or whether they had immediate family members with the condition. At the beginning of the study, participants filled out detailed questionnaires about their participation in physical activities, such as playing sports, climbing stairs or walking, and whether they regularly walked or biked to work. They were also asked about various lifestyle factors, including how often they completed household chores. One of the major constraints of previous studies was that “the definition of physical activity is quite weak”, Dr Song said. “Some use the total amount, and some just focus on one mode of activity.” The British questionnaires offered specificity on exactly which activities participants were engaging in on a regular basis. Participants were followed for 11 years, during which time 5,185 developed dementia. The study found that, in participants who engaged in regular, vigorous activity, such as playing sports or working out, the risk of developing dementia was reduced by 35 per cent. Surprisingly, people who reported regularly completing household chores also experienced a significant benefit; they had a 21 per cent lower risk. “Some people work up quite a sweat when they are doing household chores,” said Dr Sandra Weintraub, a neurologist at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, who was not associated with this study. “It might be that if you do three hours of household chores, you are as good as if you did 30 minutes of aerobic exercise.” For Dr Salinas, who recommends that people aim for 150 minutes of moderate- to high-intensity exercise a week, the results strengthen the idea that regular moderate to vigorous exercise can promote brain health. Cultivating this habit of exercise “is likely to have a very profound synergistic effect”, he said. “You get a lot more bang for your buck in terms of helping to promote your own health through physical activity.” Perhaps most encouragingly, the association between physical activity and a reduced risk of dementia extended to participants who had a family history of dementia. “It’s very important to know that if you have a family history of dementia, you can use physical activity to reduce your risk,” Dr Song said. START BY DOING WHAT YOU LIKE BEST The second paper, published in early August in Neurology, compiled 38 studies to see which leisure activities were associated with a reduced risk of dementia. Altogether, the studies followed more than two million participants without dementia over at least three years, during which time 74,700 developed dementia. After controlling for age, education and gender, the researchers found that participants who exercised regularly – defined as engaging in activities such as walking, running, swimming, dancing, participating in sports or working out at the gym – had a 17 per cent lower risk of developing dementia compared with those who did not. This meta-analysis shows that dementia prevention is not limited to one activity, or even one type of activity. Given the diversity of physical activities that participants engaged in, “we recommend to people to do the exercise that you like”, said Le Shi, a researcher at Peking University and one of the study’s authors. When it comes to reaping the benefits of physical activity, it’s never too soon to start. In a third study published this month, researchers followed more than 1,200 children between seven and 15 for more than 30 years. Those with higher levels of fitness as children had higher levels of cognitive functioning in midlife, suggesting that establishing a lifelong habit of physical activity could be beneficial for brain health. Together, these studies suggest the ways we move our bodies on a daily basis could add up over time. They also solidify the notion that regular, lifelong physical activity, in all of its forms, goes a long way toward reducing the risk of dementia, even for people who are classified as high-risk. “Your brain is part of your body and is going to benefit from anything you do that is good for your general health,” Dr Weintraub said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/diet-food-brain-health-vitamin-keto-low-carb-fat-sugar-2901756,Commentary: Too little – or too much – of certain foods can be bad for the brain,"ANN ARBOR, Michigan: During the long seafaring voyages of the 15th and 16th centuries, a period known as the Age of Discovery, sailors reported experiencing visions of sublime foods and verdant fields. The discovery that these were nothing more than hallucinations after months at sea was agonising. Some sailors wept in longing; others threw themselves overboard. The cure for these harrowing mirages turned out to be not a concoction of complex chemicals, as once suspected, but rather the simple antidote of lemon juice. These sailors suffered from scurvy, a disease caused by a deficiency of Vitamin C, an essential micronutrient that people acquire from eating fruits and vegetables. Vitamin C is important for the production and release of neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers of the brain. In its absence, brain cells do not communicate effectively with one another, which can lead to hallucinations. As this famous example of early explorers illustrates, there is an intimate connection between food and the brain, one that researchers like me are working to unravel. As a scientist who studies the neuroscience of nutrition, I am primarily interested in how components of food and their breakdown products can alter the genetic instructions that control our physiology. Beyond that, my research is also focused on understanding how food can influence our thoughts, moods and behaviours. While we can’t yet prevent or treat brain conditions with diet, researchers like me are learning a great deal about the role that nutrition plays in the everyday brain processes that make us who we are. Perhaps not surprisingly, a delicate balance of nutrients is key for brain health: Deficiencies or excesses in vitamins, sugars, fats and amino acids can influence brain and behaviour in either negative or positive ways. As with Vitamin C, deficits in other vitamins and minerals can also precipitate nutritional diseases that adversely impact the brain in humans. For example, low dietary levels of Vitamin B3, or niacin – typically found in meat and fish – cause pellagra, a disease in which people develop dementia. Niacin is essential to turn food into energy and building blocks, protect the genetic blueprint from environmental damage and control how much of certain gene products are made. In the absence of these critical processes, brain cells, also known as neurons, malfunction and die prematurely, leading to dementia. In animal models, decreasing or blocking the production of niacin in the brain promotes neuronal damage and cell death. Conversely, enhancing niacin levels has been shown to mitigate the effects of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s and Parkinson’s. Observational studies in humans suggest that sufficient levels of niacin may protect against these diseases, but the results are still inconclusive. Interestingly, niacin deficiency caused by consumption of excessive amounts of alcohol can lead to similar effects as those found with pellagra. Another example of how a nutrient deficiency affects brain function can be found in the element iodine, which, like niacin, must be acquired from one’s diet. Iodine, which is present in seafood and seaweed, is an essential building block for thyroid hormones – signalling molecules that are important for many aspects of human biology, including development, metabolism, appetite and sleep. Low iodine levels prevent the production of adequate amounts of thyroid hormones, impairing these essential physiological processes. Iodine is particularly important to the developing human brain; before table salt was supplemented with this mineral in the 1920s, iodine deficiency was a major cause of cognitive disability worldwide. The introduction of iodised salt is thought to have contributed to the gradual rise in IQ scores in the past century. Not all dietary deficiencies are detrimental to the brain. In fact, studies show that people with drug-resistant epilepsy – a condition in which brain cells fire uncontrollably – can reduce the number of seizures by adopting an ultralow-carbohydrate regimen, known as a ketogenic diet, in which 80 per cent to 90 per cent of calories are obtained from fat. Carbohydrates are the preferred energy source for the body. When they are not available – either because of fasting or because of a ketogenic diet – cells obtain fuel by breaking down fats into compounds called ketones. Utilisation of ketones for energy leads to profound shifts in metabolism and physiology, including the levels of hormones circulating in the body, the amount of neurotransmitters produced by the brain and the types of bacteria living in the gut. Researchers think that these diet-dependent changes, especially the higher production of brain chemicals that can quiet down neurons and decrease levels of inflammatory molecules, may play a role in the ketogenic diet’s ability to lower the number of seizures. These changes may also explain the benefits of a ketogenic state – either through diet or fasting – on cognitive function and mood. Excess levels of some nutrients can also have detrimental effects on the brain. In humans and animal models, elevated consumption of refined sugars and saturated fats – a combination commonly found in ultra-processed foods – promotes eating by desensitising the brain to the hormonal signals known to regulate satiety. Interestingly, a diet high in these foods also desensitises the taste system, making animals and humans perceive food as less sweet. These sensory alterations may affect food choice as well as the reward we get from food. For example, research shows that people’s responses to ice cream in brain areas important for taste and reward are dulled when they eat it every day for two weeks. Some researchers think this decrease in food reward signals may enhance cravings for even more fatty and sugary foods, similar to the way smokers crave cigarettes. High-fat and processed-food diets are also associated with lower cognitive function and memory in humans and animal models as well as a higher incidence of neurodegenerative diseases. However, researchers still don’t know if these effects are due to these foods or to the weight gain and insulin resistance that develop with long-term consumption of these diets. This brings us to a critical aspect of the effect of diet on the brain: Time. Some foods can influence brain function and behaviour acutely – such as over hours or days – while others take weeks, months or even years to have an effect. For instance, eating a slice of cake rapidly shifts the fat-burning, ketogenic metabolism of an individual with drug-resistant epilepsy into a carbohydrate-burning metabolism, increasing the risk of seizures. In contrast, it takes weeks of sugar consumption for taste and the brain’s reward pathways to change, and months of Vitamin C deficiency to develop scurvy. Finally, when it comes to diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, risk is influenced by years of dietary exposures in combination with other genetic or lifestyle factors such as smoking. In the end, the relationship between food and the brain is a bit like the delicate Goldilocks: We need not too little, not too much but just enough of each nutrient.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/mask-indoors-mandate-low-risk-covid-19-ndr-2894711,Commentary: Low risk of getting COVID-19 from indoor places – even with masks off,"SINGAPORE: When Singapore first made it mandatory during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020 for people to wear masks any time they stepped out of their homes, many found it challenging to adopt the new practice.  Soon, they got used to it, and the reluctant wearing of masks became the norm – so much so that when Singapore lifted its outdoor mask mandate earlier this year, some said they felt ""awkward” taking off their masks, with many continuing to have them on out of habit. On Sunday (Aug 21), Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced in his National Day Rally speech that the mask requirement would be eased further. Masks will soon be optional indoors and required only on public transport and in healthcare settings. The decision to make mask-wearing optional in most indoor settings in this phase of the pandemic is not arbitrary. It reflects the timely recognition of the whole-of-government effort to empower the community with already well-informed risks and a high level of trust so people can make the best-informed choices for themselves and increase their sense of social responsibility to live with the virus. Community resilience during a public health crisis involves sustaining a fine balance between achieving a high level of general well-being and implementing evidence-based, targeted mandatory social restrictions to manage the public health threat. This timely empowering of trust in the community can help strengthen community resilience over time. It also serves to prepare Singapore to be stronger, together in facing future health threats. Mask-wearing has been instrumental in limiting COVID-19 transmission and outbreak clusters around the world, especially during the early phase of the pandemic when a vaccine was not yet available. Proper mask-wearing can reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection and other respiratory viruses, such as influenza, by at least 50 per cent, depending on the type of mask used and type of setting. Surgical masks and respirators (such as N95 or KN95, which are mostly used in healthcare settings) offer a greater reduction in risk of infection by up to 60 per cent and 80 per cent respectively, when well-fitted. But it is important to note that proper mask-wearing does not eliminate the risk of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, it is critical to practise multiple concurrent prevention measures, such as social distancing, frequent and proper handwashing, and vaccination to sustain a lower risk of infection. The risk of being exposed to COVID-19 in an indoor setting is highly dependent on several factors, which include ventilation, population density, duration of stay and type of activities involved. Indoor settings with a higher ratio of fresh air inflow to used air outflow, and higher flow rate into and out of the indoor setting, respectively, have been shown to lower the risk of exposure indoors. In addition, a lower density of people over a specific period of time and a shorter duration of stay (less than 15 minutes) within an indoor setting significantly reduce the risk of exposure. On the contrary, indoor settings where people interact vocally, such as through speaking, singing or cheering can increase the risk of getting the virus. With sustainable setting-specific herd immunity achieved due to the high population of vaccinees with boosters (79 per cent as of Aug 22), the risk of COVID-19 transmission in indoor settings has been significantly reduced. Accordingly, the likelihood of a susceptible individual (who has not been infected or vaccinated) being exposed indoors is also reduced. With highly accessible and available screening tools, such as antigen rapid test kits, as well as high compliance with voluntary testing and self-isolation upon testing positive among our community, the likelihood of a susceptible individual being exposed indoors will be even smaller. While the upcoming move to make mask-wearing optional in most indoor settings is very “refreshing” for many as we continue to learn to live with the disease, the risk of surges in COVID-19 incidence is still present. There is still a fundamental need to closely monitor evolving genetic variants of the virus using next-generation sequencing not just locally, but also regionally and globally. This would also provide insights into incidence trends over time to predict the transmissibility and severity of new variants so prompt action can be taken to manage and prevent future outbreaks. Epidemiologically, the risk of infection and severe COVID-19 disease would generally be higher among unvaccinated, elderly individuals with pre-existing co-morbidities or those who are immunocompromised than among young healthy adults who are vaccinated. Therefore, proper mask-wearing among these more vulnerable community groups or in settings like nursing homes, dialysis centres, community recreational centres for seniors and similar, particularly where activities involve active interaction with these highly vulnerable groups would still be highly recommended in indoor settings, in addition to the other preventive measures.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/brain-fog-long-covid-19-symptoms-memory-focus-2881341,"Poor memory, can't focus: Why do some people experience brain fog after COVID-19?","Joan (not her real name) feels like she has been living in a fog since recovering from COVID-19 a month ago. A brain fog, to be exact. “The other day, I was chatting with someone over coffee. I remember looking at her face and hearing her voice. But my brain was not understanding what she was saying,” recalled the 34-year-old marketing manager. “Quite often, I can’t find the words when I want to describe something.” Changes to Joan’s routine also trip her up. “I’m usually the one to pick up my son. That day, I forgot that my husband would take him home instead,” she said. “Work held me back a little and I rushed out of the office feeling flustered. Then, when I got to the preschool, I had a mild panic attack because I couldn’t find my son.”  Most of the time, life post-COVID-19 is like ""I’ve taken cough medicine that causes drowsiness but I can’t sleep it off”, she said of the sluggishness. “I can’t think fast. I take a while to make decisions, even what to eat for dinner.”  WHAT’S CAUSING THE BRAIN FOG? You might have heard of friends, colleagues and family members complaining of (or maybe you’re experiencing it yourself) similar mental fuzziness after recovering from COVID-19 – and you might wonder: What is going on? “Brain fog is a layman term that describes slow or sluggish thinking that affects the memory, concentration and/or mental clarity. It is a self-reported symptom, and the definition can vary between individuals and clinicians,” said Associate Professor Kevin Tan, a senior consultant with the National Neuroscience Institute’s Department of Neurology.  The phenomenon isn’t limited to only COVID-19, continued Assoc Prof Tan. The so-called brain fog “can be attributed to many other reasons such as pregnancy, menopause, and recovery from other infections and minor head injuries”, he said. “Plus, it is also a known side-effect of certain medications such as some chemotherapy.” But the big question remains: Why does the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, affect cognitive capabilities such as memory, focus and functions including planning and multitasking? “This is not well understood at present,” said Assoc Prof Tan.  “There are small, preliminary studies, which demonstrate that there is ‘brain shrinkage’ after COVID-19, but these findings need to be replicated more widely and linked with other evidence of how the virus may affect the brain.” Neuropsychologist Professor Kamini Krishnan, noted on the Cleveland Clinic website, that brain fog could be the result of a cytokine storm. During an infection such as COVID-19, the body floods the bloodstream with inflammatory proteins known as cytokines to target the virus. The downside though, it can mount an exaggerated immune system response that can lead to further inflammation in organs such as the brain.  WHO IS PRONE TO BRAIN FOG AND HOW LONG CAN IT LAST? You aren’t alone in this if your memory and attention span take a beating after recovering from COVID-19. “Estimates for the rate of such cognitive dysfunction after COVID-19 infection range from 22 per cent to 32 per cent of cases,” said Assoc Prof Tan, adding that there doesn’t appear to be any likely factors such as age and gender that might contribute to the brain fog. According to this study on more than 3,000 people from 56 countries, the onset of brain fog occurred in about 31 per cent of the respondents in the first week of COVID-19 symptoms. It worsened over the first three months, peaking in almost 67 per cent of the participants, before decreasing in the following months. By the seventh month, about 55 per cent of them experienced cognitive dysfunction.  Brain fog is part of long COVID, which are symptoms that drag out over months. Furthermore, “people who have been in the ICU or required more severe forms of treatment tend to experience more brain fog,” said Prof Krishnan.  The reason could be, these patients often also experience other symptoms that can affect their mental acuity such as trouble sleeping, elevated stress levels or a significant change in their diet, she said. Still, it doesn’t mean you’re off the hook if your symptoms were mild: The memory lapses and difficulty in focusing may still occur, according to a German study that recruited 136 participants with an average age of 30 to play a brain game.  Nearly 40 per cent of them had recovered from COVID-19 but did not require hospitalisation, while the rest had not had COVID-19. It was found that the COVID-19 group did not do as well in areas that required attention as the other group. They also performed “significantly worse” on memory tasks.  The silver lining was, when the researchers followed up with the participants, their recovery in memory was noted within six months, whereas their attention improved within nine months of being infected.  “Symptoms often improve over time,” said Assoc Prof Tan. “However, this can take weeks to months because as with any infection, recovery can vary greatly between individuals.” WHAT CAN YOU DO TO LIFT THE FOG? Exercise may play a role in improving cognitive functions, especially aerobic ones such as running and cycling, according to Harvard Health. The increased capacity to transport oxygen to the brain could boost ""the number of blood vessels and synapses, increasing brain volume"". And if being social, playing games, engaging in crafting activities and reading were found to help seniors stave off mild cognitive impairment in a study, gathering some friends for a board-game night might also be the mental stimulant you need to lift the brain fog.   However, there isn't a magic formula that specifically targets the mental fuzziness caused by COVID-19, said Assoc Prof Tan, though you can't go wrong getting adequate sleep, eating a healthy, balanced diet, and avoiding smoking and stress. “Consider seeing your family doctor if your memory or cognitive issues significantly affect your daily activities and function, such as your ability to work,” said Assoc Prof Tan. “Medical help should focus on finding a cause as an individual with brain fog following COVID-19 may have other reasons for cognitive impairment to begin with.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/women-libido-sex-drive-men-couple-marriage-housework-caregiving-burden-2889266,Commentary: Don’t blame women for low libido. Sexual sparks fly when partners do their share of chores,"MELBOURNE: When a comic about “mental load” went viral in 2017, it sparked conversations about the invisible workload women carry. Even when women are in paid employment, they remember their mother-in-law’s birthday, know what’s in the pantry and organise the plumber.  This mental load often goes unnoticed. Women also continue to do more housework and childcare than their male partners. This burden has been exacerbated over the recent pandemic (homeschooling anyone?), leaving women feeling exhausted, anxious and resentful. As sexuality researchers, we wondered, with all this extra work, do women have any energy left for sex? We decided to explore how mental load affects intimate relationships. We focused on female sexual desire, as “low desire” affects more than 50 per cent of women and is difficult to treat. Our study, published in the Journal of Sex Research, shows women in equal relationships (in terms of housework and the mental load) are more satisfied with their relationships and, in turn, feel more sexual desire than those in unequal relationships. Low desire is tricky to explore. More than simply the motivation to have sex, women describe sexual desire as a state-of-being and a need for closeness. Adding to this complexity is the fluctuating nature of female desire that changes in response to life experiences and the quality of relationships. Relationships are especially important to female desire: Relationship dissatisfaction is a top risk factor for low desire in women, even more than the physiological impacts of age and menopause. Clearly, relationship factors are critical to understanding female sexual desire. As a way of addressing the complexity of female desire, a recent theory proposed two different types of desire: Dyadic desire is the sexual desire one feels for another, whereas solo desire is about individual feelings. Not surprisingly, dyadic desire is intertwined with the dynamics of the relationship, while solo desire is more amorphous and involves feeling good about yourself as a sexual being (feeling sexy), without needing validation from another. Our research acknowledged the nuances of women’s desire and its strong connection to relationship quality by exploring how fairness in relationships might affect desire. The research involved asking 299 Australian women aged 18 to 39 questions about desire and relationships. These questions included assessments of housework, mental load – such as who organised social activities and made financial arrangements – and who had more leisure time. We compared three groups: Relationships where women perceived the work as equally shared equal (the “equal work” group); when the woman felt she did more work (the “women’s work” group); and when women thought that their partner contributed more (the “partner’s work” group). We then explored how these differences in relationship equity impacted female sexual desire. The findings were stark. Women who rated their relationships as equal also reported greater relationship satisfaction and higher dyadic desire (intertwined with the dynamics of the relationship) than other women in the study. Unfortunately (and perhaps, tellingly), the partner’s work group was too small to draw any substantial conclusions. However, for the women’s work group it was clear their dyadic desire was diminished. This group was also less satisfied in their relationships overall. We found something interesting when turning our attention to women’s solo desire. While it seems logical that relationship inequities might affect all aspects of women’s sexuality, our results showed that fairness did not significantly impact solo desire. This suggests women’s low desire isn’t an internal sexual problem to be treated with mindfulness apps and jade eggs, but rather one that needs effort from both partners. Other relationship factors are involved. We found children increased the workload for women, leading to lower relationship equity and consequently, lower sexual desire. Relationship length also played a role. Research shows long-term relationships are associated with decreasing desire for women, and this is often attributed to the tedium of over-familiarity (think of the bored, sexless wives in 90s sitcoms). However our research indicates relationship boredom is not the reason, with the increasing inequity over the course of a relationship often the cause of women’s disinterest in sex. The longer some relationships continue, the more unfair they become, lowering women’s desire. This may be because women take on managing their partner’s relationships, as well as their own (“It’s time we had your best friend over for dinner”). And while domestic housework may start as equally shared, over time, women tend to do more household tasks. Same-sex couples have more equitable relationships. However, we found the same link between equity and desire for women in same-sex relationships, although it was much stronger for heteronormative couples. A sense of fairness within a relationship is fundamental to all women’s satisfaction and sexual desire. Our findings suggest one response to low desire in women could be to address the amount of work women have to take on in relationships. The link between relationship satisfaction and female sexual desire has been firmly established in previous research but our findings explain how this dynamic works: Women’s sense of fairness within a relationship forecasts their contentment, which has repercussions on their desire for their partner. To translate our results into clinical practice, we could run trials to confirm if lowering women’s mental load results in greater sexual desire. We could have a “housework and mental load ban” for a sample of women reporting low sexual desire and record if there are changes in their reported levels of desire. Or perhaps women’s sexual partners could do the dishes tonight and see what happens.

The singer and mother of two has been battling colorectal cancer for the past eight years. According to Chinese news media, she suffered three relapses over the years and has undergone almost 70 rounds of chemotherapy treatment.  A former legislator, Yu was on the way to a political conference when he received news that his daughter’s condition had taken a turn for the worse on Thursday (Aug 18). The 74-year-old told Taiwanese reporters that she has been drifting in and out of consciousness. ""She gestured to me and begged me to let her go. But how could I bear to do so?” he said in tears.  When asked for his response, the singer said, ""I told her no and she gestured to me again to say 'please, just let me go'. How could I be so cruel?""  Yuan-chi's manager told reporters that she is suffering from hydronephrosis, a swelling of the kidneys due to a build-up of urine. Yu Tian's wife, fellow veteran singer Li Ya-ping, was also seen in tears at the hospital, Apple Daily Taiwan reported.  In Jul, Li divulged that doctors told her that nothing more could be done, and that her daughter was at a critical stage. The cancer cells have spread to other parts of her body, rendering chemotherapy useless.  ""Her thigh and calves are about as thick as our arms now. It really breaks my heart,"" Li said. Yu Tian, who became a household name in the Taiwanese entertainment scene with the 1977 Mandarin classic Under the Banyan Tree, suffered a mild stroke last year.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/can-you-pass-10-second-test-balance-training-impacts-longevity-and-quality-life-2883186,Can you pass the 10-second test? Balance training impacts longevity and quality of life,"Len Kaplan began having difficulty walking in a straight line when he was in his 50s. Scoliosis combined with compressed discs in his back were causing his balance to deteriorate. “Physical therapy, regular exercises, just wasn’t getting the job done. I needed something different,” Len, now 80, said. Around that time Len and his wife, Ginny, took a cruise with twice-daily tai chi classes. Ginny, 77, said they loved Tai Chi – which consists of slow, controlled movements and deep breathing – so much they found a class in nearby Yorba Linda, Calif, when they returned home. The habit stuck. Len and Ginny have now been taking Tai Chi and balance classes regularly for more than 15 years. Len is able to easily walk in a straight line and his balance has improved. Last September while visiting Greece, Len and Ginny decided to hike the nearly 100 steps to the top of the Acropolis. Up they went, over slippery, uneven steps with no hand rails. They made it to the top and were rewarded with ancient ruins and sweeping views of Athens below. “At my age I know people who would go, ‘Oh no, I’ll stand at the bottom in the parking lot and take pictures, thank you,’” Ginny said, “but how fun is that?” Balance training is an important but often-neglected skill, one that impacts both our longevity and our quality of life, beginning around age 40. A study in June by a Brazilian team found that 20 per cent of the 1,700 older adults tested couldn’t balance on one leg for 10 seconds or more. And that inability to balance was associated with a twofold risk of death from any cause within 10 years. If you have tried out the one-legged test (with a wall or chair nearby for safety) and didn’t pass, don’t panic. It’s never too late to start working on balance training, even if you can pass the 10 second test, especially if you’re over age 50. This doesn’t have to mean handstands and acrobatics. In fact, you can start at home without any equipment. WHAT THE 10-SECOND TEST CAN (AND CAN’T) TELL US Falls are the second leading cause of unintentional injury deaths worldwide, yet doctors don’t have an easy way to check balance, like they do blood pressure or pulse. In this test, which can be done in less than a minute, the patient gets three attempts to do a 10-second one-legged stand on either leg. “The idea here was just to come up with a really simple test that might be an indication of a person’s ability to balance,” said Dr Jonathan Myers, a professor at Stanford University, researcher at the Palo Alto VA Health Care System and an author of the balance study. He said the inability to perform this task was powerfully predictive of mortality. In the study, one in five people could not manage it. “With age, strength and balance tend to decrease and that can result in frailty. Frailty is a really big thing now that the population is aging,” Dr Myers said. Balance problems can be caused by a variety of factors, many of them age-related, said Dr Lewis Lipsitz, a professor of medicine at Harvard University and the director of the Marcus Institute for Aging Research at Hebrew SeniorLife. When your vision is affected by cataracts, or the nerve signals from your feet to your brain slow down, this makes it more difficult to balance. While it’s impossible to prevent all types of age-related decline, you can counteract the impact on your balance through specialised training and building strength. “There’s a downward spiral of the people who don’t go out, who don’t walk, who don’t exercise, who don’t do balance training, and they become weaker and weaker. And muscle weakness is another important risk factor for falls,” he said. Researchers have previously connected balance and strength with mortality, finding that the ability to rise from the floor to a standing position, balance on one leg for 30 seconds with one eye closed and even walk at a brisk pace are all tied to longevity. But no test is perfect. Dan Layne, who runs the Center for Balance, where Len and Ginny study tai chi, said the Brazilian paper caused a stir in his classes, which include balance and fall prevention. Many of his students, whose ages range from 30 to 105, tried it and failed. They approached him, worried. “I’ve got a lot of people that can’t balance for 10 seconds, but their balance control is fine. They’re not falling and they’re living long lives,” Layne said. Even if your vision is impaired, or your coordination is affected by arthritis, you can improve your balance – at any age. “The body is very adaptive. And if one pathway doesn’t work to maintain your balance, by training other pathways in the body and the brain you can overcome some disabilities,” Dr Lipsitz said. BALANCE-ENHANCING ACTIVITIES Balance training goes hand-in-hand with strength training. The stronger the muscles in your legs, glutes, feet and core, the better your balance. You can improve your balance by taking tai chi or yoga classes, but weight training, dancing, rock climbing or aerobics classes are also excellent ways to work on your balance skills. “Really any type of exercise seems to help with balance and fall risk,” said Dr Avril Mansfield, a senior scientist at KITE-Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, who specialises in movement science. But some forms of exercise are better than others. If your only movement is walking on a smooth surface, with no side-to-side movement, it’s not going to significantly improve your balance, said Dr Rachael Seidler, a professor in the Department of Applied Physiology and Kinesiology at the University of Florida. If you really want to improve your balance, Dr Seidler said, you’ll get the most benefit focusing on several specific exercises. So how do you get started? Fortunately, most balance training doesn’t have to require any special equipment, and you can start at home. As with any new exercise programme, be sure to talk to your physician first, and have a chair nearby to grab onto if you feel unsteady. Try these five balance exercises two to three times a week, gradually increasing the difficulty as you feel comfortable and start to improve your strength. SINGLE-LEG STANCE Stand behind a chair, holding on with both hands. Lift one leg off the ground, bending the lifted knee toward your chest and stand on one leg for five seconds. Repeat five times, then do the same with your other leg. Too easy? Hold onto the chair with one hand, release both hands or try closing your eyes. BODY-WEIGHT SQUATS Stand with feet hip distance apart, toes forward. Bend your knees and lower yourself until your thighs are parallel to the floor, keeping your weight in your heels. Extend your arms in front of you if you need help with balance, or squat lower if it’s too easy. Repeat 10 times. Hold a dumbbell to add to the difficulty. BIRD DOG Start on your hands and knees, back flat. Lift one leg straight behind you and lift the opposite arm straight in front, so you are balancing on one knee and one hand. Hold for five to 10 seconds, then repeat on the other side. LATERAL LEG LIFTS Stand behind a chair, holding on with both hands. Lift one leg to the side, trying to keep your body as still as possible. Repeat with the other leg, five times per side. Increase the intensity by holding the leg up longer or letting go of the chair. TANDEM STANCE Stand up straight and put one foot directly in front of the other, with your heel touching your toe. Keep equal weight on both feet, knees slightly bent. Hold for 30 seconds, then switch feet, repeating three times. Close your eyes to make it more difficult. By Hilary Achauer © The New York Times"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/how-turn-night-owl-early-bird-here-step-step-guide-2882921,How to turn a night owl into an early bird? Here is a step by step guide,"Good sleep is hard to come by. According to the US federal government, more than one-third of adults routinely fail to get a healthy amount of sleep, defined as a minimum of seven hours a night. If your night owl tendencies are ruining your sleep, there are steps you can take to become more of a morning person. The first thing to keep in mind is that your bedtime to some extent is influenced by your genetics. Everyone has a personal biological rhythm, or chronotype, that determines their optimal time to fall asleep and wake up. Studies show that there are many genes that nudge some of us to be morning people, some of us to be night owls, and others to fall somewhere in between. One study published in the journal Nature Communications, for example, analysed the sleep habits of nearly 700,000 people and identified a large number of genes that play a role in whether someone is a morning person or not. On average, people who carried the highest number of genetic variants for “morningness” tended to fall asleep and wake up about half an hour earlier than people who carried the fewest. Just because you’re currently operating as a night owl doesn’t mean you are destined to burn the midnight oil. It’s possible you stay up past your optimal bedtime because of distractions. Many people who might naturally fall asleep around 10 pm, for example, end up staying up until midnight to work, surf the web or binge on Netflix. That makes it harder to wake up in the morning. But you can become more of a morning person by focusing on your morning routine. First, decide what time you’d like to wake up. Then, get out of bed at exactly that time each day – regardless of how tired you are – and get some sunlight. Sunlight tells your brain that it’s time to be awake. Studies have found that morning light can advance your circadian rhythm, which will help your body adjust to an earlier schedule. As your body gets used to starting the day earlier, you’ll naturally begin to fall asleep earlier in the evenings as well. Ideally, you should step outside in the morning and engage in exercise or some other activity that makes you alert. “A brisk walk outside in the morning is a pretty good way to start telling your internal clock that it’s time to do this,” Dr Rosen said. If it’s dark out when you’re aiming to wake up or you can’t quite make it outside, then consider trying bright light therapy, which involves turning on a special lamp for about 30 minutes each morning as you go about getting ready for the day. In this scenario a regular table lamp or overhead light will not do the trick. You want to use a light therapy lamp because they’re designed to mimic outdoor light. A typical light therapy lamp will cost you between US$70 (S$96) and US$160. While sunlight exposure first thing in the morning is critical, you should try to get plenty of sunlight during the day as well, as this will also help to shift your clock in the right direction. Then, in the evening, try to minimise your exposure to artificial light. It’s fine to use dim lights, lamps and reading lights, but you should try to avoid exposure to devices that emit blue light – computers, fluorescent lights, television screens, smartphones – within two to three hours of the time you’d like to fall asleep. Studies have shown that blue light exposure at night can disrupt your sleep and suppress melatonin, the hormone that helps to regulate sleep. Researchers have found that blue light can throw off your circadian clock, making it harder for you to become a morning person. Another thing that can help is taking a very low dose of melatonin, which you can find at most pharmacies, said Dr Sabra Abbott, an assistant professor of neurology in sleep medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, in Chicago. Dr Abbott recommends taking no more than a half milligram about one hour before bed. It’s important to keep the dose low so that it clears your system quickly. “We’re trying to provide a little signal that it’s the beginning of nighttime,” Dr Abbott said. “But we want it out of your system by the end of the night because melatonin at the end of the night can push your clock later and will make the problem worse.” If you follow these steps, you should start to feel increasingly sleepier at earlier times in the evening, allowing you to fall asleep and wake up earlier. But whatever you do, make sure that you stick to your new routine – including on the weekends. Consistency is crucial. “If you’re getting up early for work and going to bed early, then you have to keep doing the things that got you there,” Dr Rosen said. “If there’s a party on the weekend and you stay up late or you start watching Netflix late at night, then you will undo everything you just did, and you’ll have to start all over.” Some people have a condition known as delayed sleep phase syndrome, which is akin to being an extreme night owl. They tend not to fall asleep until well after midnight, and they can easily sleep through the morning. This condition is most common among young people, affecting roughly 7 to 16 per cent of adolescents and young adults. The behavioural changes mentioned above can help if you think you have this disorder. But if you find that it’s still disrupting your ability to work, go to school or function on a daily basis, then it might be a good idea to contact a sleep specialist.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/covid-flu-rsv-children-sick-cough-virus-2889066,Commentary: COVID-19 has created an ‘immunity debt’ towards common infections in our children,"SINGAPORE: COVID-19 has been a big disruption to the world. Pandemic response measures not only helped keep the coronavirus at bay, but also had the effect of curbing the spread of other respiratory illnesses like the common cold and influenza.  But as restrictions are relaxed or lifted with the widespread use of vaccines and antivirals, several viruses and bacteria are now making a comeback. It makes sense that measures targeted at preventing COVID-19 reduced the spread of infections transmitted via respiratory droplets. People stopped travelling, worked from home, wore masks and stayed in when unwell. Combined data from KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH), Singapore General Hospital and National University Hospital showed that most non-COVID-19 respiratory viruses nearly disappeared by April and May 2020, when Singapore went into a ""circuit breaker"" period. With the reopening in phases in late 2020, some respiratory viruses gradually returned, though not at pre-pandemic levels, since mask-wearing in public continued.  Amid concerns about the Delta and Omicron variant waves in the second half of 2021 and early months of 2022, healthcare professionals saw non-COVID respiratory illness levels drop again after response measures were tightened and subsequently come up when eased. Similar effects were seen overseas. Also, the usual flu seasons were absent.  The return of respiratory viruses is not surprising to healthcare experts.  The first ones to return, in late 2020, were the rhinoviruses and enteroviruses which usually cause mild common colds. Then, early 2021 saw a reappearance of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and some parainfluenza viruses, both of which may cause more serious illness in young children, such as bronchiolitis or croup, which has a distinctive barking cough. What is surprising is the unusual pattern of activity of viruses that usually have a predictable seasonality.  In Australia, the United States and Europe, waves of RSV infections were recorded outside the traditional winter months. Several countries, at some point, reported that RSV waves were stretching the capacity of children’s hospitals that were already under pressure from COVID-19. Another observation was that RSV infections occurred in older children, whereas before the pandemic, children less than one-year-old were mostly affected. In some locations, the numbers of RSV infections even surpassed those of COVID-19 paediatric infections at times. What might explain these changes? Due to all the pandemic response measures, young children, including those born during the pandemic, have had much less exposure to common respiratory viruses than same-age children in pre-pandemic years.  This created an “immunity debt” towards previously common infections, meaning that the lack of exposure to viruses and bacteria during the pandemic left children more susceptible to various infections.  Can we expect to see other respiratory illnesses make a comeback? Probably. Influenza viruses (there are A and B strains) nearly disappeared during the pandemic, and only a small number of influenza infections were observed again in the first half of 2022, according to data from KKH. These numbers are expected to rise in the second half of 2022; Australia is currently experiencing a substantial rise in influenza infections, and international travel is likely to bring this to Singapore soon. Before the pandemic, KKH regularly diagnosed bacterial respiratory infections, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae (which causes pneumonia predominantly in children) and Bordetella pertussis (the agent of classical whooping cough). These infections also disappeared during the 2020 circuit breaker and have not reappeared up until mid-2022. Parents may also be concerned about children getting multiple infections. In June, Singapore recorded the first paediatric COVID-19 death in a one-and-a-half-year-old boy who had COVID-19, RSV and enterovirus infections. With Singapore recording a seven-day moving average of 3,750 COVID-19 cases (as of Aug 18) and yet another Omicron subvariant, various respiratory viruses are also returning with relaxation of some of the earlier pandemic measures. What does this all mean for us in Singapore? Respiratory viruses have been with us for a very long time and are part of what helps train our immune systems and those of our children. It is their absence, rather than presence, that is an unusual state. Their return after the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic should be seen as part of the return to normality. But we should still take precautionary measures and stay vigilant, due to the possibility of severe illnesses in some children and vulnerable adults. This means we should take good care of ourselves and our children and seek medical care if infections look to become more serious. Signs to look out for in children are worsening or persistent fever, lethargy or drowsiness, persistent cough, breathlessness, chest pain, poor oral intake, poor urine output, or seizures.  It is also recommended that we keep our influenza vaccinations up to date. Anyone above six months of age can obtain their influenza vaccination at their local general practitioner (GP) clinic or polyclinic. COVID-19 may have changed the way we think of and live with viruses, and we should keep up some of the habits we have picked up along the way.

When early humans first picked up stone tools 2.5 million years ago, it set us down the evolutionary path that equipped us with broader fingertips, according to Dr John Hawks, a biological anthropologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. These were better suited for grasping stones than gripping branches. Over time, those fingertips got even broader and soon, nails began to replace claws.  So, essentially, your nail is a flattened claw, according to Dr Hawks. (Incidentally, your pet dog’s or cat’s claws are also made of keratin like your nails). And while you may no longer need to climb trees and dig holes, you now require fine motor movements to separate pages in a book or pick out singular strands of hair. And that’s where your fingernails come in handy. As for your toenails, think of them as reinforced caps that protect your toes’ sensitive tips.  YOUR NAILS’ ANATOMY Your nails are well supplied with blood and can even maintain the blood flow when you’re gripping something very tightly. And as hard as these keratin coverings feel, they are as sensitive as your fingertips owing to an intricate network of nerves underneath each nail. Here’s a closer look at your nails’ anatomy:  Nail root: Also known as the germinal matrix, this is the nail factory. You might see a glimpse of it as a white, crescent shape found at the base of the nail known as the lunula, but it actually extends several millimetres into the finger.  Nail bed: Otherwise known as the sterile matrix, the nail bed contains blood vessels, nerves and melanocytes that produce pigment. Healthy nail beds look smooth and do not have ridges or splits. Nail plate: This is the actual nail and consists of translucent keratin.  Cuticle: That’s the thin bit of skin covering the nail plate that manicurists push back. It is also known as the eponychium. Paronychium: This refers to the fleshy folds on both sides of the nail. It is where hangnails, ingrown nails and paronychia, a skin infection around the nail, occurs.  Hyponychium: This is the area underneath the nail, where the keratin ends and the skin of your finger begins. It is also where it hurts a lot when you clip your nail too short. As for the growth rate, fingernails grow faster than toenails, said Dr Chuah Sai Yee, a senior consultant with National Skin Centre: An average of 3.47mm a month for fingernails. The nails on your dominant hand are also said to grow faster as it is thought that its risks of injury and trauma are higher and the body naturally sends more blood and nutrients for repair.  But in general, the pinkie’s growth rate (3.08mm a month) is the slowest, said Dr Chuah. Conversely, the fastest grower is the nail on your middle finger.  As for the toenails, they grow at a much slower rate: A monthly average of 1.62mm. The nail on the big toe is the quickest growing with an average of 2.10mm a month, she said. TREAT YOUR NAILS RIGHT Your nails are subjected to a lot of wear on a daily basis such as typing, biting, picking, using drying hand sanitisers, getting gel polish done, stubbing your toes on furniture, wearing ill-fitting footwear or even accidentally slamming a drawer or door on your fingers. We can’t name all the damage and injuries that hurt your nails but here are some common ones you might have encountered and how long you can expect your nails to heal: Accidentally stubbing your little toe on furniture is more common than you care to acknowledge. “The little toe is the most prone to injury because of its location on the outside of the foot,” said Dr Chuah. In most cases, it is normal to experience some bruising and even some blood under the toenail, she said. The same damage can also be sustained from ill-fitting footwear such as hiking boots or running shoes that are too small, or even getting your fingers slammed in the drawer or door. It can be painful, swollen and red initially but these signs will abate, said Dr Chuah.  But if the pain is severe and does not go away, see the doctor immediately, especially if it is difficult for you to walk or put weight on the foot – you might have a broken toe, she said. Most of the time, the bruising is mild and doesn’t require treatment as “the blood will gradually be resorbed by the body”, said Dr Kong Yan Ling, a dermatologist with Dermatology & Surgery Clinic. “If the bleeding is severe, the pressure from the collection of blood may cause the nail to lift off the nail bed”. Damage control: If the pain persists, Dr Chuah suggested the RICE method: Rest, ice, elevation and compression by bandaging it. “Most bruises will clear up within a couple of weeks,” she said. In the meantime, wear open-toe footwear during the healing process to prevent further damage, she added. However, if the bleeding is severe or extensive, see a doctor “as the blood would need to be drained via a simple medical procedure called trephination”, said Dr Kong. “This would help to relieve the pressure on the nail bed and reduce the pain experienced.”  In fact, the doctor may also advise to remove the nail if it is badly damaged. “Following the removal of the nail, the doctor will inspect the nail bed for cuts, which would require stitching if present,” said Dr Kong. How long to heal: In the worst-case scenario, where your entire nail is ruined, you can expect to take an average of four to six months to grow a new one completely from the cuticle to the tip, said Dr Chuah. A toenail can take up to 18 months to completely regrow, said Dr Kong. These painful situations on the big toe tend to occur more frequently in those with sweaty feet, according to the UK National Health Services (NHS). Older people may also be prone to ingrown toenails because toenails thicken with age. A number of factors can make you more prone to the situation such as angling the cut of your toenails down the sides (it can encourage the toenail to grow into the skin), ill-fitting footwear and socks, injury (stubbing your toe or dropping something heavy on your toe) or just genetically predisposed to curved toenails. You'll know you have an ingrown toenail when putting on your shoes is painful. It feels tender, swollen or even hard. There may also be pus, bleeding or skin growing around the toe. Damage control: If there isn't an infection (no warmth, pus, redness and swelling), try soaking your feet in warm water for 15 to 20 minutes, three or four times a day, advised Healthline. Then, push the skin away from the toenail edge with a cotton ball soaked in olive oil. After that, apply an antiseptic cream to prevent infection. But do not pick at your toenail or cut it, advised the NHS. And certainly don't wear tight, pointy shoes; wear wide, comfy shoes or sandals instead. If this home remedy doesn't work after trying it for a few days to a few weeks, see a doctor, noted Healthline. Similarly, get medical help if the pain worsens or if you find it difficult to walk or even wear shoes. If there is infection, surgery to remove the toenail may be required and sometimes, only the part that digs into your skin is removed. Complete removal is sometimes done when the ingrown toenail is caused by nail thickening triggered by a fungal infection. How long to heal: For partial nail removal, it could take two to four months for your toenail to grow back, according to Mayo Clinic. Toenails take about 12 to 18 months to grow back, said Dr Chuah. If you love the shiny, crisp look of freshly manicured or pedicured nails that lasts and lasts, you would have tried gel polish. But they have their downsides though: Gel polish can damage your natural nails in more ways than one. For starters, leaving it on for too long can make the polish harder to remove, said Dr Kong. “The manicurist might end up having to scrape and peel the polish off more forcefully. This will, in turn, cause more damage to the nails.” Two, “as your nails grow, the extra weight of the gel polish can pull them off the nail bed, resulting in separation of the nails from the nail beds”, she said. Three, the frequent application and removal of gel polish can cause weakened and unhealthy nails, “which present as chipped, peeling and thin nails, dryness and also white spots on the nails”, said Dr Kong.  Damage control: Don’t keep the gel polish on for more than two weeks, said Dr Chuah. “Some may recommend one week’s break from eight weeks of back-to-back gel nails to allow your natural nails to rehydrate and repair the underlying structure.” During your nail polish holiday, apply a moisturising product such as petroleum jelly or cuticle oil to your nails and cuticles several times daily, she advised. “This will minimise brittleness and help prevent your nails from chipping.” This is also the time to trim down your nails as nails damaged by gel polish tend to be brittle, said Dr Kong. “Trimming them down to a manageable length will prevent them from breaking off. Use a nail buffer to ensure that the nail edges are even, as uneven ridges can be prone to tears.” How long to heal: In the worst-case scenario, where your entire nail is ruined, you can expect to take an average of four to six months to grow a new one completely from the cuticle to the tip, said Dr Chuah. A toenail can take up to 18 months to completely regrow, said Dr Kong. Onychoschizia refers to split, brittle, soft or thin nails, according to the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology website. The condition is more common in women as they may be more exposed than men to the nail-damaging chemicals at the manicurist’s and in household cleaning products. Ageing can also cause fingernails to become dull and brittle. It can also be caused by disease (hypothyroidism and Raynaud’s syndrome) or vitamin deficiencies (iron deficiency is the most common) but those are rare, noted the website. “One tip is that if the fingernails split but the toenails are strong, an external factor is the cause.”  Damage control: Trim off the detached nail and file down sharp or irregular edges, advised Dr Kong. “Apply a thin layer of moisturising product, such as petroleum jelly, and cover the finger with a bandage to protect the nail bed until the new nail has grown out.” Meanwhile, watch for signs of infection such as increasing pain, swelling, redness or fever, she added. “Be extra careful if you have underlying diabetes or peripheral arterial disease as these conditions predispose you to infections that can result in loss of the finger if left untreated.” Some people may turn to nail glue to patch up the situation, said Dr Chuah, but she advised using with caution. “While it may work for most people, some may be allergic to the glue (most contain acrylates). Acrylates are chemicals that commonly cause irritant and allergic dermatitis.” How long to heal: On average, about three to six months to completely replace the fingernail, said Dr Kong.  The degree of damage would determine whether the nails can regain their health, said Dr Kong. “In cases where the biting is severe, the detached nail may no longer be able to reattach to the nail bed, resulting in a shorter and/or narrower nail bed, or a phenomenon known as the ‘disappearing nail bed’,” she said.  That’s not all the damage. You can also cause infections in the skin around the nail, which can present as redness, swelling, pain and pus discharge from the nail fold, said Dr Kong. “Germs, which cause infections like gastroenteritis, can be transmitted from the fingers directly into the mouth. Dental problems like teeth fractures and gingivitis can also occur.” “So, it’s important to ensure that you stop biting your nails as soon as you realise it’s a problem,” added Dr Chuah. “The good news is, for the majority of individuals, once they stop biting their nails, they will return back to normal.” Damage control: Trim your nails short, so that you will not feel like biting them as much, suggested Dr Kong. To further discourage the nail biting, apply bitter-tasting nail polish.  While letting your nails gradually heal and grow back, keep your nails and cuticles well moisturised by applying a moisturising product like petroleum jelly or cuticle oil, she said. How long to heal: You can expect a slight regrowth of the nail within days after the biting ceases, said Dr Kong. “However, how long the full recovery takes depends on how badly damaged the nail is. If the entire surface of the nail is destroyed, it will take about three to six months for the complete regrowth of the fingernail. If the damage was less extensive, the time taken would be shorter.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/sick-ill-symptoms-diagnose-google-search-health-2883361,"Commentary: Hey, Dr Google. My head is pounding, what's wrong with me?","BURNABY, Canada: Virtual healthcare was adopted more widely during the COVID-19 pandemic, with many people accessing healthcare providers remotely. However, easy and convenient access to technology means some people may choose to bypass healthcare and consult Dr Google directly, with online self-diagnosis. Here is a common scenario: Picture someone sitting at home, when suddenly their head starts pounding, their eyes start to itch and their heart rate rises. They reach for their phone or laptop to quickly Google what can possibly be wrong. It’s possible that the search results could offer accurate answers about the cause of the person’s symptoms. Or the search might erroneously suggest they’re well on their way to an early death. As a researcher in the virtual care domain, I’m aware that online self-diagnosis has become very common, and that technology has shifted the way healthcare is delivered. Online health information took on a new importance during the pandemic, when using online sources to assess COVID-19 symptoms and self-triage was encouraged. However, the act of self-diagnosis online is not new. In 2013, it was reported that more than half of Canadians polled said they used Google search to self-diagnose. In 2020, 69 per cent of Canadians used the Internet to search for health information, and 25 per cent used online sources to track their fitness or health. Virtual care and online self-diagnosis share some beneficial traits, such as the convenience of not having to schedule an appointment, saving travel time to the doctor’s office and avoiding waiting rooms. However, the key difference between virtual care and Googling symptoms is that there is no direct communication with a physician when self-diagnosing online. Some may choose to self-diagnose because they feel it gives them greater control over their health, while others may find it helps them better communicate symptoms to their physician. Some patients may fear misdiagnosis or medical errors. Over time, people can get better at diagnosing using the Internet. Online sources can provide information and support for a specific medical condition. They may also be useful for people with ongoing symptoms who have been unable to get a diagnosis from healthcare professionals. Using the Internet to learn more about a condition after being diagnosed by a healthcare provider may be useful and may decrease the stress of a diagnosis if the sites consulted are trustworthy. However, trying to select credible sources and filter out misinformation can be an overwhelming process. Some information found online has little to no credibility. A study focusing on the spread of fake news on social media found that false information travelled faster and wider than the truth. The risks of using online health resources include increased anxiety and fear. The term cyberchondria can be defined as someone experiencing a high amount of health anxiety from searching symptoms on the Internet. Self-misdiagnosis is also a danger, especially if doing so means not seeking treatment. For example, if a person confidently self-diagnoses their stomach pains as the stomach flu, they may hesitate to believe their doctor’s diagnosis of appendicitis. There is also a risk of becoming so certain that one’s self-diagnosis is correct that it is difficult to accept a different diagnosis from a healthcare professional. Misdiagnoses can even be very serious if it results in failure to detect a possible heart attack, stroke, seizure or tumour. Further risks may include increased stress on both the patient and doctors, ineffectively taking or mixing medications and increased costs for treatments or medicines that may not be necessary. Social media has given people a voice to share personal health-related remedies and stories. The number of active social media users in Canada has increased by 1.1 million since 2021. This raises the question of how people may be influenced by what they see online and if it may affect health choices. In 2018, a Canadian Internet use survey examined reports of the negative effects of using social media. It revealed more than 12 per cent of users reported feeling anxious or depressed, frustrated or angry, or envious of the lives of others. Conversely, social networks have also enabled people with mental health problems to feel unity by sharing experiences and support. However, this may also have contributed to self-diagnosis (and potentially self-misdiagnosis) of mental health issues, such as anxiety and personality disorders. This can put people at physical and mental risk if it results in inappropriate treatments. The reality is that online self-diagnosis cannot be prevented. But those consulting Dr Google should be aware of the potential risks, confirm information found online with a healthcare provider and ask healthcare providers for credible online sources of information about their diagnoses.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/nutrition-labels-drinks-high-sugar-fat-2883631,"Nutrition labels for drinks high in sugar, saturated fat to be rolled out in practical manner: MOH, HPB","SINGAPORE: The implementation of Nutri-Grade labels for freshly prepared drinks will be done in a ""practical"" manner, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Health Promotion Board (HPB) said on Tuesday (Aug 16). In a letter to The Straits Times' Forum page, MOH director of epidemiology and disease control Chow Wai Leng and HPB director of policy and strategy development Terence Ng noted concerns from operators. These concerns came after Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said last week that food and beverage outlets will be required by the end of 2023 to include nutrition labels on their menus indicating drinks that contain higher levels of sugar and saturated fat. This new requirement will also apply to freshly brewed drinks from coffee shops, freshly squeezed juices and bubble tea. ""Similar to other jurisdictions that have introduced mandatory labelling, we will consider applying measures to only larger establishments at the start, while exempting smaller establishments serving freshly prepared beverages,"" Dr Chow and Mr Ng said. Not all establishments will be required to use laboratory analysis to determine the sugar and saturated fat content of their beverages, they added. ""It is acceptable to grade the beverage by estimating the sugar and saturated fat content from the amount of individual ingredients added into the beverage,"" the letter read. Dr Chow and Mr Ng said that more details of the measures will be released in the future. Advertising prohibitions will also apply to drinks with the highest level of sugar and saturated fat content, Mr Ong said on Aug 11 at the opening ceremony of the 19th International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis Congress. These measures aim “to help consumers make more informed, healthier choices, reduce the influence of advertising on consumer preferences and spur industry reformulation”. MOH announced in December last year that pre-packaged drinks will include Nutri-Grade labels by the end of 2022. The four-level grading system is based on the sugar and saturated fat content in beverages. It will be colour-coded – A (dark green), B (light green), C (orange) and D (red), with A being the category with the lowest sugar and fat thresholds. Drinks that are graded C or D must have their labels on the front of the package, MOH said. If sold online, or from a vending machine or a buyer-facing automated beverage dispenser, the image of the Nutri-Grade mark must be displayed according to the regulations. Advertisements are also prohibited for grade D drinks in most cases."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/food-myths-alkaline-water-vegetables-rice-fruits-2866921,Will eating veggies before rice help you lose weight? Is alkaline water really good for you? Common food myths explained,"Want better digestion and feel less bloated? Eat fruits on an empty stomach, not after a meal. Need to lose weight? Eat your vegetables first before the rice. Want to beat cancer? Drink alkaline water.  Do these nuggets of so-called nutrition advice sound familiar to you? They might have been doled out by that colleague who heard it from her aunt or served up by the algorithm as you’re mindlessly scrolling through your social media feed. No matter the source, you might have been intrigued at some point in your life – especially if you’re facing a medical issue and understandably want to improve your health: Do they actually work?  Knowing how your stomach works can help you to form healthy eating habits, according to Dr Melvin Look, a consultant surgeon in gastrointestinal, laparoscopic and obesity surgery as well as the director of PanAsia Surgery. For starters, the food that you eat is temporarily stored in the stomach, where it is “broken down and mixed with stomach acid and enzymes”, he said.  As food continues to enter the stomach, an exit valve called the pylorus gradually allows the partially digested food to be released into the small intestine, where it is further digested and where nutrients are absorbed, said Dr Look. “The stomach can hold between 2 litres and 4 litres of food and liquids before it is fully distended,” he said, explaining that it is the stomach’s stretching that signals to the brain that you are full.  But if you wolf down your meal, there is a chance you’ll end up eating more than you should. That’s because your stomach and brain take time to register fullness – about 15 to 20 minutes, said Jaclyn Reutens, a clinical and sports dietitian, and founder of Aptima Nutrition & Sports Consultants. This is why you should spend at least 15 minutes to finish your meal as “the difference can be significant”, she said.  THE SCIENCE BEHIND THE MYTHS The adage ""you are what you eat"" is certainly subscribed to by many, including dietitians, nutritionists, doctors and the researchers behind this study, who found that food can even regulate mood. But are you how you eat your food in sequence? And what about other nutrition advice such as getting one of those purifiers that converts tap water into “health giving” alkaline water? Here’s a look: If you’re trying to reduce your calorie intake, should you eat your economy rice or nasi padang in this particular sequence? Don’t be so quick to write off this one yet.  “Eating vegetables at the start of the meal might ensure a lower intake of the other food groups. It may help you get full faster and stay full longer,” said Bibi Chia, the principal dietitian at Raffles Hospital's Raffles Diabetes and Endocrine Centre. “When you are full, there is a possibility that the intake of carbohydrates from rice or noodles is lower.”  Added Reutens: “There are studies showing the overall caloric intake of a meal is lower when vegetables are consumed first. So, for those are looking at weight loss, this could be an easy thing to do”. For diabetics and those with glucose metabolism issues, eating your stir-fried kailan or salad first can also avoid spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels, said Dr Look, which can otherwise happen when you eat carbohydrates first. Indeed, a study found that carbohydrates were digested slower and required less insulin because of the fibre in vegetables. The greens-before-carbs approach had even been recommended for the prevention of cardiovascular problems by the researchers.  But if you’re thinking juicing the vegetables might be more palatable and give you the same benefits, think again. It is the fibre that contributes to the feeling of fullness and lowers blood glucose levels, said Reutens, citing a study that compared the satiety effect of fibre using apple juice, apple puree and apple.  “It was found that apple juice, with no fibre, had the least satisfaction and the highest increase in blood glucose levels. This was followed by apple puree and apple,” she said. “They did the same test on oranges and grapes and the responses were similar. This suggests that the removal of fibre results in faster ingestion and absorption, decreased satiety, and disturbed glucose homeostasis.”  “There isn’t a perfect time to eat fruits,” said Chia. “It has also not been proven that eating fruits will cause bloating for healthy individuals.” Dr Look agreed: “There are many food myths about when the best time is to eat fruit. And most of these myths have been debunked by good science and common sense”.  In fact, slowing down the stomach emptying isn’t a bad thing, said Dr Look. “They may help you feel full for longer if you are on a weight-loss diet. Taking fibre-containing fruit after a meal can also reduce the rise in blood sugar that happens immediately after eating.” The only time you might consider avoiding fruits is if you have been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and advised so by a doctor, said Chia. IBS affects nearly one in 10 people in Singapore and causes patients to have overly sensitive nerves in the bowels.  And here is where fermentation in the stomach and gas production get twisted to create this food myth: There are indeed fruits (and many other foods) that contain “FODMAPS”, which stands for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols. Simply put, these are sugars that are not completely digested or absorbed in those who are affected, such as individuals with IBS.  For these patients, fruits such as apples and pears that contain sorbitol (a form of FODMAPS) can cause gas and bloating, said Reutens. “But that is not because of fermentation,” she said. “There is no truth that fermentation can occur in the stomach as the gastric juices are so acidic, the chances of any micro-organisms surviving in there (to facilitate fermentation) are low.”  To reiterate, the avoidance of foods high in FODMAPS is only required if you have been diagnosed with IBS, as highlighted by the Monash University, which has formulated the FODMAPS diet for those who need it. It is actually not a bad idea to drink some water before tucking into a meal for several reasons. One, water is highly important for digestion, said Reutens. “It is the carrier of digestive enzymes and the transport medium for nutrient absorption.” You’ll also need water for soluble fibre to aid in waste elimination.  Two, your body frequently confuses thirst with hunger, especially for those who do not drink enough water. “At the start of the meal, it is good to be well-hydrated, so that there is a lesser chance of overeating,” said Reutens.  “Drinking water before a meal can signal for the digestive enzymes to be produced,” she said. “Saliva is made from water and it helps to moisten the food and make it easier to chew and swallow.” Chia even advised to drink water both during and after meals to aid with digestion. “There is no concern with water ‘diluting’ the gastric juices.” Try drinking a glass of water before a meal. “You will still be able to eat,” said Reutens, “and in fact, it helps to prevent overeating.” Or you can also have soup with your meal. ""Just make sure the soup is not too salty,"" she said. Otherwise, you may get thirsty and end up drinking so more water, you won't have the space in the stomach for the food. If you have gastro-oesophageal reflux disease or GERD, limit the amount of water with your meals as the liquid can “push up the gastric juice closer to the oesphageal sphincter and aggravate the condition”. For this group, drink water 30 minutes before the meal, advised Reutens. One of the biggest contentions of all has to be your water’s pH. So why the purported importance of alkaline water? For context, the pH scale ranges from zero to 14. A pH reading of 7 is neutral, while anything below 7 is acidic. Conversely, any reading above 7 is alkaline. Meanwhile, human blood has a pH range of 7.36 to 7.45, which makes it slightly alkaline.  Now, here’s where the alkaline water proponents come in: If you drink water that is acidic, you’ll create too much acid in your blood and pave the way for all sorts of health issues ranging from cancer to osteoporosis.  But can alkaline water be counted on to do so much for your health? And what exactly is it? “Alkaline water is essentially water containing added compounds such as calcium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium and/or sodium bicarbonate. Its pH is around 8 or 9,” said Dr Look.  “Tap water can range from 6.5 to 8.5, or even slightly acidic, depending on the country you are drinking it from,” he said. In Singapore, the tap water has an average pH of 8.2, which makes it alkaline to begin with.  “There are many claims that alkaline water can neutralise acid in your bloodstream and, in turn, prevent heart disease, osteoporosis and cancer,” said Dr Look. “So far, these claims have not been backed by scientific evidence.”  He added: “It may also be a hard thing to prove as the gastric acid in your stomach will likely neutralise any amount of alkaline water before it can have an effect on the body.” Reutens has also debunked some of the commonly held myths. “It is believed that tumours grow faster in acidic environments but the truth is, tumours create the acidic environments,” she said. “And while many high-quality clinical studies do reflect the link between red meat and cancer, it is not because of the acidic nature of these foods,” she said. “However, advocates of alkaline water purport that theory.” Moreover, said Dr Look, your kidneys and lungs already work very efficiently to keep your blood and body fluids at a very stable pH. In fact, alkaline water isn't without its downsides; it should be avoided by patients with kidney disease, he said. “Alkaline water can also cause side effects such as indigestion and dry, itchy skin.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/sleep-tips-hot-weather-singapore-2866936,Sleepless in Singapore: How to get a good night’s sleep when the weather is so hot,"High temperatures can wreak havoc on sleep. Under ideal conditions, your body temperature starts to fall by a couple of degrees about one to two hours before bedtime — and it continues to decline while sleeping, said Dr Leslie Swanson, an associate professor of psychiatry in the Sleep and Circadian Research Laboratory at the University of Michigan.  This internal cooling effect helps us achieve the deep, restorative stage of sleep known as slow-wave sleep. But “when the ambient temperature is high outside, it prevents our body temperature from falling as quickly,” Dr Swanson said.  This not only makes it harder to fall asleep, but it can also cause frequent awakenings. While it may be difficult to drift off when you and your room are warm, there are things you can do to snooze more soundly. DO WHAT YOU CAN TO COOL DOWN YOUR BEDROOM “We tend to get more deep sleep in a cool bedroom,” said Philip Gehrman, a clinical psychologist at the Penn Sleep Center at the University of Pennsylvania.  He even noted that “for some people, once summer hits and they crank up the AC, they sleep better because they’re keeping their bedroom cooler than they would in spring or fall”. GET THE AIR IN YOUR ROOM MOVING If you don’t have access to air-conditioning, use a fan to help the air circulate in your room. Increasing the airflow across the surface area of your body helps to offload heat, said Dr Justin Fiala, a pulmonary critical care and sleep medicine specialist at Northwestern Medicine. STAY HYDRATED If you can’t lower the temperature of your room, your body will turn to another method for cooling you down: Sweating. Keep some water by your bedside to make sure you can replenish the liquid you’re losing. USE LIGHTWEIGHT BEDDING The best way to help your body regulate its temperature is to use a light sheet or summer comforter, Dr Fiala said. Make sure it’s one you can easily move around under, so you can kick out a limb to help cool down. AVOID A COLD SHOWER RIGHT BEFORE BED Cold water will help your body lower its temperature, but it is unlikely to help you with the quality of your sleep. Cold water can be a shock to the body, which might keep you awake longer.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/alzheimers-disease-dementia-diagnosis-memory-loss-family-history-2856866,What if getting Alzheimer’s Disease is my destiny?: Children of patients fear their own future diagnosis,"At school pickup, Janet Perez always looks for the neon orange backpack that makes her six-year-old son, Jayden, so easy to spot. But on a recent spring afternoon in Perris, California, she couldn’t find him.  Her first response was primal: Someone had kidnapped him. Then she tried to remember what he had been wearing and realised she wasn’t sure if she had dropped him off that morning.  A familiar dread washed over her: Was it happening? Was her forgetfulness an early sign that she had her mother’s illness, Alzheimer’s disease? Ten long minutes after she arrived at school, Jayden appeared. He had been in the bathroom. Perez then remembered that her sister had brought him to school that morning; she had been watching their mother. Even though a nurse practitioner has since attributed her memory lapses to stress, the fear of forgetting looms large over Perez. “What if this is my destiny, and this is what’s going to happen to me?” she asked on a recent morning as she sat beside her mother, Rita Perez, with whom she has lived since 2019.  The younger Perez began caring for her mother after the 74-year-old widow started leaving her stove burners on and grew so paranoid that she was barricading her bedroom door with a chair.  Since then, the family has watched Rita Perez, a woman who once owned a beauty salon, steadily lose the ability to do her own hair or brush her own teeth. In a wheelchair much of the time, she no longer recognises Perez, or her four other children. Perez, 35, would be an extremely young person to have Alzheimer’s — in most cases, symptoms appear after age 65 — and no one else in her large Mexican-American family has the condition.  Still, she knows the impact of dementia, an umbrella term for many illnesses that cause the deterioration of brain function, in her community. It afflicts Hispanic older adults nearly twice as often as their white counterparts, according to a recent study in JAMA, the influential medical journal. With her mother’s decline, and her own memory lapses, Perez often lies awake at night circling around what is, for her, the darkest thought of all: What if, one day soon, she forgets who Jayden is? In the US, Alzheimer’s disease affects 6.5 million adults over 65 years old; by 2050, that figure is projected to nearly double, according to the Alzheimer’s Association, the leading advocacy organisation for those with the disease.  But thanks to expanded awareness of the illness, the most common form of dementia, it regularly ranks in consumer polls as one of the most feared diseases. Among relatives who have watched the disease’s progression in a loved one, the perceived threat can be even greater, research has shown. In some cases, they become hypervigilant about monitoring their own memories, each forgotten name or lost set of keys seemingly a sign of something more serious. Shannon Spindler, a 47-year-old library assistant whose father has the disease, which killed his own father, started to cry recently when she misplaced a book. Oh dear God, is it coming for me? wondered the Springfield, Mo., resident. Each birthday brings 51-year-old Mark Applegate closer to 65, the age when his mother was diagnosed. She’s now in hospice, sleeping most of the time. While Mr. Applegate, an IT director from Bolivar, Mo., is not thinking about Alzheimer’s constantly, “it’s in the back of my mind that it’s already in the process for me,” he said. For Amber Barber of Lebanon, Ore., it’s the image of her 77-year-old father on his deathbed last year that haunts her, as does her fear that she’ll be next. “I don’t have memory problems, but the scary thing for me was watching how fast he went,” said the 46-year-old, a programme management director at a software consulting company. “I don’t want to have my kids watch me starve to death,” she added. Certainly not everyone with a family history of Alzheimer’s lives in fear of it. But for those who do, the worry can be overwhelming. Cristiane Passarela, a licenced mental health counsellor at NYC Cognitive Therapy, has seen clients hyperventilate with the worry that they have the same disease as a relative. “The worst is when they come to us and they cannot function,” she said. When people report suffering from worsening memory and cognition, and tests don’t reveal any deterioration, the complaints are collectively referred to as subjective cognitive decline. These self-reported symptoms can be early signs of Alzheimer’s disease, but long-term follow up suggests that, a lot of the time, they aren’t. “You get the people who reframe their fear into a positive by doing lifestyle activities that may be a benefit to them,” said Dr David Wolk, professor of neurology at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Penn Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. But fear can also make it harder for currently healthy people to enjoy their lives right now. How do you live well despite what may — or may not — be to come? DON’T OVERESTIMATE YOUR OWN RISK People who have at least one close relative with Alzheimer’s have a higher risk of dying from the condition, according to a study that examined residents of Utah using a genealogy database. Still, the majority of people with a family history of Alzheimer’s won’t develop the disease. Genetics play a more significant role for those with early-onset familial Alzheimer’s, a rarer form of the disease that appears before age 65 and affects only one to two percent of the general population. Half of the children with a parent who has the condition will also develop the disease, which a genetic test can detect. However, the greatest risk factor for the most common form of the disease, late-onset Alzheimer’s, is not family history; it’s simply getting older. Above age 85, it affects a third of adults. Many doctors caution against genetic testing, which isn’t the most accurate way to predict or confirm the diagnosis of late-onset Alzheimer’s. People with a family history of Alzheimer’s can benefit by reminding themselves, “I may be at slightly increased risk, but it doesn’t mean I am necessarily going to get this,” said Dr Kristine Yaffe, professor of psychiatry, neurology, epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco. “I may get other things, I may live to be 100 and may be fine.” For those who notice persistent memory lapses, the next step may be an evaluation. “You should only go to see the doctor if you have the feeling that this is a sustained change,” said Dr Frank Jessen, a researcher with the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Germany, who studies subjective cognitive decline.  Consider checking in with your provider “only if it’s a sustained feeling that your memory isn’t well-functioning anymore over several months and maybe your family also notices it”, Dr Jessen said. Getting screened can often ease the fear, doctors say. Many treatable health issues — such as thyroid problems, urinary tract infections, vitamin deficiencies, depression and changes in medication — can mimic Alzheimer’s. Anxiety itself can affect memory, with the forgetfulness stoking yet more anxiety. “It creates a bit of a vicious cycle,” Dr Wolk said. When an evaluation reveals Alzheimer’s, early diagnosis allows patients to participate in clinical trials and make lifestyle changes to potentially slow the disease’s progress. They can also get their financial, legal and personal care plans in order, and share their wishes with loved ones. TURN FEAR INTO POSSIBLE PROTECTION Perez first realised the toll her mother’s illness had taken on her three years ago, when she barely recognised herself in a photo.  Exhausted by the idea of losing her mother, she had bags under her eyes and had grown more sedentary, contributing to her borderline high blood pressure. She had been so focused on the well-being of her mother and son, she had neglected her own. “I was going to let this ruin me,” she said. Instead, she decided to quit drinking and began to exercise regularly. Addressing so-called “modifiable risk factors” like high blood pressure, low physical activity and frequent alcohol consumption can possibly prevent or delay up to 40 per cent of dementia cases, according to a 2020 report by the Lancet Commission on dementia, prevention and care, which identified and ranked 12 factors associated with lowering one’s risk for cognitive decline. Correcting any hearing loss and quitting smoking are also high on the list. Notably, there is not much evidence that vitamins or dietary supplements help improve cognition or prevent dementia; data on diet is limited but suggests that a heart healthy diet, like the Mediterranean diet, can be protective. Experts place special emphasis on staying cognitively active throughout life: Learning to play an instrument, travelling to new places, or simply doing stimulating work — “engaging your brain in any way,” said Dr Gill Livingston, lead author of the Lancet Commission report and a professor of psychiatry of older people at University College London.  Alzheimer’s is characterised by both loss of synapses, which are the connections between nerve cells, and nerve cell death throughout the brain. Researchers believe that ongoing learning may prepare the brain to better withstand these changes.  Stimulating activities “might act almost as a buffer”, Dr Yaffe said, although she has patients who have taken every possible preventive measure and still developed the disease. ENGAGE IN THE LIFE YOU HAVE NOW When dealing with any recurring fear, “part of it is accepting a certain powerlessness and lack of control exists”, said Dr Timothy Scarella, instructor in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. “That is particularly true with Alzheimer’s: You might get this despite your best efforts.” Worrying about it in the meantime can take away from a person’s enjoyment of their healthy years. As is true for many other kinds of worry, psychologists recommend a basic mindfulness practice. Many activities qualify: Meditation, prayer, movement like yoga or qigong, or even hiking or walking — anything that encourages slowing down and observing the present moment, without judgement or shame. When a fear causes significant distress or interferes with daily life, professional guidance may be needed. When Passarela, the mental health counselor, sees clients who are convinced they are experiencing Alzheimer’s symptoms, she challenges that thought: What evidence do you have that the thought is true? What evidence do you have that it’s not true? Through therapy, Barber, the software consulting manager in Oregon, has learned tools to manage her worry. Sometimes, she will take a walk around her neighborhood. If the thoughts persist, she writes them down to acknowledge what she’s experiencing. Then she pushes the paper aside, as a physical sign she’s moving on. When Perez is anxious, she prays the rosary, and a calm settles over her. Recently, she realised that alongside the pain that has accompanied her mother’s illness, there have been unexpected gifts. Whatever happens in the future, she’s healthier now, thanks to lifestyle changes that her mother — and her mum’s illness — have inspired, Perez said. “Even if she’s not mentally here, she’s still helping me.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/walking-after-meal-improved-health-2862996,Why even 2 minutes of walking after a meal will improve your health,"Walking after a meal, conventional wisdom says, helps clear your mind and aids in digestion. Scientists have also found that going for a 15-minute walk after a meal can reduce blood sugar levels, which can help ward off complications such as Type 2 diabetes. But, as it turns out, even just a few minutes of walking can activate these benefits. In a meta-analysis, recently published in the journal Sports Medicine, researchers looked at the results of seven studies that compared the effects of sitting versus standing or walking on measures of heart health, including insulin and blood sugar levels. They found that light walking after a meal, in increments of as little as two to five minutes, had a significant impact in moderating blood sugar levels. “Each small thing you do will have benefits, even if it is a small step,” said Dr Kershaw Patel, a preventive cardiologist at Houston Methodist Hospital who was not involved in the study. VERY LIGHT WALKING REDUCES BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS  In five of the studies that the paper evaluated, none of the participants had pre-diabetes or Type 2 diabetes. The remaining two studies looked at people with and without such illnesses. Participants were asked to either stand or walk for two to five minutes every 20 to 30 minutes over the course of a full day. All seven studies showed that just a few minutes of light-intensity walking after a meal were enough to significantly improve blood sugar levels compared to, say, sitting at a desk or plopping down on the couch. When participants went for a short walk, their blood sugar levels rose and fell more gradually. For people with diabetes, avoiding sharp fluctuations in blood sugar levels is a critical component in managing their illness. It’s also thought that sharp spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels can contribute to developing Type 2 diabetes. Standing also helped lower blood sugar levels, although not to the degree that light walking did. “Standing did have a small benefit,” Aidan Buffey, a graduate student at the University of Limerick in Ireland and an author of the paper, said. Compared to sitting or standing, “light-intensity walking was a superior intervention,” he said. That’s because light walking requires more active engagement of muscles than standing and uses the fuel from food at a time when there is a lot of it circulating in the bloodstream. “Your muscles will soak up some of that excess glucose,” said Jessie Inchauspe, author of the book Glucose Revolution: The Life-Changing Power of Balancing Your Blood Sugar.  “You still had the same meal, but the impact on your body will be lessened,” she added. WALKING WITHIN 60 TO 90 MINUTES AFTER EATING DELIVERS THE BEST RESULTS  Although light walking at any time is good for your health, a short walk within 60 to 90 minutes of eating a meal can be especially useful in minimising blood sugar spikes, as that is when blood sugar levels tend to peak. Inchauspe also recommended getting up to do housework or finding other ways to move your body. This short amount of activity will also enhance other dietary changes that people may be making to help control their blood sugar levels. “Moving even a little bit is worthwhile and can lead to measurable changes, as these studies showed, in your health markers,” Dr Euan Ashley, a cardiologist at Stanford University who was not associated with the study, said. MINI-WALKS ARE MORE PRACTICAL DURING THE WORKDAY  Buffey, whose research focuses on physical activity interventions in workplace environments, noted that a mini-walk of two to three minutes is more practical during the workday. People “are not going to get up and run on a treadmill or run around the office,” he said, but they could get some coffee or even go for a stroll down the hallway. For people working from home, he suggested a short walk around the block between Zoom meetings or after lunch. The more we normalise mini-walks during the workday, Buffey said, the more feasible they will be. “If you are in a rigid environment, that’s when the difficulties may come.” If you cannot take those few minutes to take a walk, Dr Ashley said, “standing will get you some of the way there.” The benefits of physical activity are never all or nothing, Dr Patel said, but instead exist on a continuum. “It’s a gradual effect of more activity, better health,” he said. “Each incremental step, each incremental stand or brisk walk appears to have a benefit.” By Rachel Fairbank © 2022 The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/monkeypox-name-stigma-who-transmission-vaccination-2876321,Commentary: Why doesn’t monkeypox have a new name yet?,"MELBOURNE: As monkeypox vaccination programmes roll out and health authorities release information about how to reduce the spread of the virus, progress on another aspect of the outbreak is lagging: Its name. On Jun 14, the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the agency was ""working with partners and experts from around the world on changing the name of monkeypox virus, its clades and the disease it causes"". This followed a letter signed by 29 scientists around the world calling for a non-discriminatory and non-stigmatising name for the virus. More than eight weeks later, nothing has changed yet. Between mid-May and Aug 10, 31,425 cases of monkeypox have been reported in 82 countries that historically have not reported cases of the virus. During the same period, 375 cases have been reported in seven countries that have historically reported monkeypox. While the focus has been on changing the name of monkeypox, it is the names of the two main clades (organisms derived from a common ancestor) that are most geographically discriminatory. They are currently named the Congo Basin (or Central Africa) clade and the West Africa clade. In 2015, the WHO, in consultation and collaboration with the World Organization for Animal Health and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, identified best practices for the naming of new human diseases. These conclude: Naming of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, did not include the name of the pathogen. But it did comply with the other criteria and, fortunately, was not called Wuhan disease or China virus. The WHO is not directly responsible for naming or renaming viruses, clades of viruses and the diseases those viruses cause. Naming virus species is the responsibility of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Monkeypox is a member of the orthopoxvirus family and related to smallpox, which was eradicated in 1979. Unlike other bugs, such as parasites like malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and bacteria like “golden staph” (Staphylococcus aureus), there is still not a consistent system of assigning binomial (two words) Latinised names to viruses. A subcommittee of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses is in the process of finalising a proposal for new binomial names for all the poxviruses, including monkeypox. Most viral conditions have different names for the disease it causes and the virus itself. In the case of the novel coronavirus causing the current pandemic, the short name of the disease is COVID-19, while the virus is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Monkeypox is not a new virus; it was discovered in 1958. While on the face of it, the name monkeypox does not seem stigmatising (other than to monkeys), some have pointed out that monkeys are rarely associated with the Western world, and this association with the Global South could be seen as problematic. The word monkey has also been employed in racist slurs against people of colour. Monkeypox is also a misnomer because monkeys are not its natural host, which is probably in rodents. The name of the virus was given because it was first identified in laboratory monkeys in Copenhagen. However, there is a problem with the names of the virus’s clades. The two main clades are named after West Africa and the Congo Basin, the latter causing more severe illness. This contravenes the WHO’s efforts to avoid naming viral diseases after countries or continents. Unfortunately, many media outlets use photos of Africans, often children, with the tell-tale rash. This heightens perceptions that this is an “African disease” that has escaped to the Western world. Despite the WHO naming criteria announced in 2015, the agency has been unable to change the name of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), caused by a camel coronavirus. In fact, one of the largest outbreaks of MERS was in South Korea. One of the main reasons given for not changing the name is that it could disconnect future researchers from research papers written over more than five decades. This seems a weak argument because it is almost certain that future researchers will be aware of the original name. Another challenge is that the name would need to be changed in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) which is used around the world for medical billing and clinical epidemiology studies. There is an apparent consensus among virologists that the new name will be something like Orthopoxvirus monkeypox. “That’s certainly the majority proposal at this stage,” according to the chair of the poxvirus subcommittee of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. This is not much of a change and is inconsistent with WHO’s naming criteria. There is, however, more optimism the two clades could shed their geographic names to something like clades 1 and 2. During the long process of changing its name, the prevention and control of monkeypox remain the same: This needs close engagement with communities most affected by the virus – men who have sex with men. It is crucial to prevent stigma and discrimination, not because of the name of the virus itself but those who are most vulnerable to infection.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/freshly-prepared-drinks-nutri-grade-nutrition-label-2023-sugar-fat-content-2873951,"Nutrition labels required by end 2023 for freshly prepared drinks that are higher in sugar, fat content","SINGAPORE: Food and beverage outlets will by end of 2023 be required to include nutrition labels on their menus indicating drinks that contain higher levels of sugar and saturated fat. These include freshly brewed drinks from coffee shops, freshly squeezed juices and bubble tea.  ""Our latest measures will require the outlets selling these drinks to label on their hard and softcopy menus beverages higher in sugar and saturated fat with the Nutri-Grade mark,"" said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung on Thursday (Aug 11). Calling such drinks a “growing source of sugar in Singaporeans’ diets”, Mr Ong said the Health Ministry is working towards publishing these measures in the middle of next year and have them implemented by end-2023. “Advertising prohibitions will also apply to these freshly prepared beverages with the highest level of sugar and saturated fat content,” said Mr Ong, who was speaking at the opening ceremony of the 19th International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis Congress. He added that these measures aim “to help consumers make more informed, healthier choices, reduce the influence of advertising on consumer preferences and spur industry reformulation”. “While we cannot avoid the sugar in juices and sugar cane drink, we can enjoy coffee, tea, Milo and bubble tea with less sugar content,” he said. “I hope more Singaporeans will realise that less sugar will bring out the natural flavours of the drinks and we may well find them even more enjoyable ... More importantly, it keeps us healthy, and staves off a very scary disease in diabetes.” In December, MOH announced that pre-packaged drinks such as soft drinks, juice and milk will be required to carry the new Nutri-Grade labels by the end of 2022. The four-level grading system is based on the sugar and saturated fat content in beverages. It will be colour-coded – A (dark green), B (light green), C (orange) and D (red), with A being the category with the lowest sugar and fat thresholds. Drinks that are graded C or D must have their labels on the front of the package, MOH said. If sold online, or from a vending machine or a buyer-facing automated beverage dispenser, the image of the Nutri-Grade mark must be displayed according to the regulations. Advertisements are also prohibited for grade D drinks in most cases. Mr Ong said on Thursday that the measures for pre-packaged drinks have “brought about a very positive response from the demand and supply sides of the industry” since they were announced. For example, producers have “significantly reformulated their beverages” ahead of the effective date of the measures for pre-packaged drinks. “Preliminary data shows that the median sugar level of pre-packed beverages has been reduced from 7.1 per cent in 2017 to 4.7 per cent in 2021,” he said. Sales of pre-packaged drinks graded C or D have also fallen from 63 per cent in 2017 to 40 per cent in 2021. Sales of drinks with less than 5 per cent sugar content have increased from 37 per cent to 60 per cent over the same period. “These shifts are as significant as those recorded in the UK, which has implemented a sugar tax, and much more stringent regulation of the market,” he said. “It shows that, in our market, by providing the right information in the right way, our industry and consumers are sophisticated and health-conscious enough to respond positively, and that is encouraging. ""Encouraged by these developments, MOH and HPB (Health Promotion Board) will step up our efforts to reduce sugar intake from freshly prepared beverages."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/new-langya-henipavirus-china-layv-35-cases-shrews-shandong-henan-2871681,New Langya virus infects 35 people in eastern China; likely transmitted from shrews,"SINGAPORE: A total of 35 people in China have been infected with a new virus which can be transmitted from animals to humans, according to a report by researchers in China, Singapore and New Zealand. The Langya henipavirus (LayV) was discovered during recent surveillance of people with fevers who had a recent history of animal exposure in eastern China. The correspondence published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Aug 4 said the virus was first identified in a throat swab sample from one patient.  Subsequent investigation identified 35 patients with ""acute LayV infection"" in the Shandong and Henan provinces. Twenty-six of these patients were found to be infected with Langya henipavirus only and experienced symptoms such as fever, fatigue, cough, headache, nausea, vomiting and muscle aches. Most of them were farmers.  Following a survey of wild small animals, the researchers said the virus was ""predominantly detected"" in shrews, a finding which suggests that the animal may be ""a natural reservoir"" of the virus.  There has so far been no evidence of human-to-human transmission. ""There was no close contact or common exposure history among the patients, which suggests that the infection in the human population may be sporadic,"" said the researchers, adding that the sample size was too small to determine the status of human-to-human transmission. The Guardian reported that the Langya henipavirus was first detected in late 2018 in Shandong and Henan. It was only formally identified by scientists last week.  Belonging to the genus henipavirus, other viruses under the same family include the Hendra virus and the Nipah virus. These viruses are known to infect humans and cause fatal disease.   The Nipah virus is carried primarily by certain types of fruit bats and pigs. It can also be transmitted directly from person to person as well as through contaminated fruit.  According to Chinese state media Global Times, the cases of Langya henipavirus so far have not been fatal or very serious. Citing Professor Wang Linfa from the Emerging Infectious Diseases Programme at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore, who was involved in the study, the report said that there was no need to panic.  However, Prof Wang added that there is still a cause for alert as many viruses that exist in nature have unpredictable results when they infect humans.  CNA has contacted Prof Wang and Duke-NUS Medical School for more information. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/blood-donation-stocks-improve-moderate-levels-red-cross-hsa-2866121,Blood stocks improve to 'moderate levels' following donation appeals,"SINGAPORE: Blood stocks in Singapore have improved to “moderate levels” after recent appeals that resulted in more than 10,000 donors stepping forward, said the Singapore Red Cross (SRC) and the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) on Monday (Aug 8). Health authorities in Singapore said in early July that stocks of A+ and O+ blood had run low. Health Minister Ong Ye Kung appealed for donations, saying major elective surgeries requiring those two blood units were at risk of being postponed. In an update a week after, Mr Ong said that blood donations in Singapore saw a 45 per cent increase after the appeal but more blood was still needed, as the stocks for all blood types were still not at healthy levels.  Since the two appeals, more than 10,000 donors - representing all blood groups - had come forward to donate blood, said SRC and HSA in a joint press release. “Among them, about 21 per cent were first-time donors and about 15 per cent were youth donors.”  The authority needs to collect about 400 units of blood every day to meet daily needs.  “Reduced donations during long weekends, school holidays and festive holidays, as well as sudden increases in blood usage, can cause the blood stock to dip,” it added.  “Your blood donations have saved many of us. Every pack of blood makes a difference, and I thank all donors, regardless of your blood group,” said Ms Amirah Arman, 27, who receives a blood transfusion every three weeks.  Born with a genetic blood disorder - Beta Thalassemia Major - her body is unable to reproduce red blood cells. She has been receiving monthly blood transfusions since she was seven years old.   ""As blood has a short shelf life of six weeks for red cells and seven days for platelets, we would like to seek the continued support of blood donors,"" said the authorities adding that it hopes to seek the continued support of blood donors to donate at least twice a year. ""This will ensure that there is always sufficient blood for patients in Singapore."" Those who are interested to donate blood may visit giveblood.sg to check their eligibility and make an appointment. Residents can also walk into any blood bank or community blood drive to donate."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/world-first-synthetic-mouse-embryo-implications-humans-2864286,Commentary: World’s first ‘synthetic embryo’ - why this research is more important than you think,"MELBOURNE: In what’s reported as a world-first achievement, biologists have grown mouse embryo models in the lab without the need for fertilised eggs, embryos, or even a mouse – using only stem cells and a special incubator. This achievement, published in the journal Cell by a team led by researchers from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, is a very sophisticated model of what happens during early mouse embryo development – in the stage just after implantation. This is a crucial stage: In humans, many pregnancies are lost around this stage, and we don’t really know why. Having models provides a way to better understand what can go wrong, and possibly insights into what we may be able to do about it. What’s particularly interesting about the newly published model is its very complex structure; not only does it mimic the cell specification and layout of an early-stage body plan – including precursors of heart, blood, brain and other organs – but also the “support” cells like those found in the placenta and other tissues required to establish and maintain a pregnancy. The earliest stages of pregnancy are difficult to study in most animals. The embryos are microscopic, tiny clusters of cells, difficult to locate and observe within the uterus. But we do know that at this stage of development, things can go awry. For example, environmental factors can influence and interfere with development, or cells fail to receive the right signals to fully form the spinal cord, such as in spina bifida. Using models like this, we can start to ask why. However, even though these models are a powerful research tool, it is important to understand they are not embryos. They replicate only some aspects of development, but not fully reproduce the cellular architecture and developmental potential of embryos derived after fertilisation of eggs by sperm – so-called natural embryos. The team behind this work emphasises they were unable to develop these models beyond eight days, while a normal mouse pregnancy is 20 days long. The field of embryo modelling is progressing rapidly, with new advances emerging every year. In 2021, several teams managed to get human pluripotent stem cells (cells that can turn into any other type of cell) to self-aggregate in a Petri dish, mimicking the “blastocyst”. This is the earliest stage of embryonic development just before the complex process of implantation, when a mass of cells attach to the wall of the uterus. Researchers using these human embryo models, often called blastoids, have even been able to start to explore implantation in a dish, but this process is much more challenging in humans than it is in mice. Growing human embryo models of the same complexity that has now been achieved with a mouse model remains a distant proposition, but one we should still consider. Importantly, we need to be aware of how representative such a model would be; a so-called synthetic embryo in a Petri dish will have its limitations on what it can teach us about human development, and we need to be conscious of that. No embryonic modelling can happen without a source of stem cells, so when it comes to thinking about the future use of this technology, it is vital to ask – where are these cells coming from? Are they human embryonic stem cells (derived from a blastocyst), or are they induced pluripotent stem cells? The latter can be made in the lab from skin, or blood cells, for example, or even derived from frozen samples. An important consideration is whether using cells for this particular type of research – trying to mimic an embryo in a dish – requires any specific consent. We should be thinking more about how this area of research will be governed, when should it be used, and by whom. However, it is important to recognise that there are existing laws and international stem cell research guidelines that provide a framework to regulate this area of research. In Australia, research involving human stem cell embryo models would require licensing, similar to that required for the use of natural human embryos under law that has been in place since 2002. However, unlike other jurisdictions, Australian law also dictates how long researchers can grow human embryo models, a restriction that some researchers would like to see changed. Regardless of these or other changes to how and when human embryo research is conducted, there needs to be greater community discourse around this subject before a decision is made. There is a distinction between banning the use of this technology and technologies like cloning in humans for reproductive use, and allowing research using embryo models to advance our understanding of human development and developmental disorders that we can’t answer by any other means. The science is rapidly advancing. While mostly in mice at this stage, now is the time to discuss what this means for humans, and consider where and how we draw the line in the sand as the science evolves.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/lofi-girl-uninterrupted-noise-music-help-people-focus-2864196,Commentary: How listening to uninterrupted noise helped millions to focus,"SAN FRANCISCO: Who among us isn’t depressingly familiar with the constant tug of war between putting off tasks that require focus, and, like a moth to a flame, being drawn to distraction? Sometimes we blame ourselves, cursing our tendency to procrastinate. But we should give ourselves a break. We’re living in an unprecedented age where billions of dollars have been made by machines designed to tempt us away from doing what we had planned to do. These thoughts are hardly new. But something happened recently, which - ironically - has captured no small amount of attention and provided me with a glimmer of hope that the internet that has rewired our minds could also be used to untangle them. Last month, YouTube suddenly suspended Lofi Girl, a music live-stream that had been broadcasting, uninterrupted, for about 20,843 hours - more than two years - gathering 660 million views in the process. The takedown was due to a false copyright claim and was later reversed. But such is Lofi Girl’s popularity that its fans were, briefly, bereft. Why? Lofi Girl is a nonstop playlist of “lofi beats”, set to a video animation of a student working at her desk. Lofi (low fidelity) beats are soft hip-hop rhythms with no vocals, optimised to engender calm and focus. The images of the student, made by Colombian artist Juan Pablo Machado, are also vital to the channel’s purpose. As day passes into night, the cityscape changes, a cat wags its tail, and Lofi Girl keeps writing as the beat goes on. For Emma Winston, an ethnomusicologist at the University of London who has studied Lofi Girl, its appeal is that it is “cosy and calming and often designed to sound analogue and aged, like it’s from a past era that may or may not have actually existed”. Central to the channel’s function, she says, is a chat window alongside the video where users leave positive “you-got-this” comments for one another, which is rare on sites like YouTube. “That can offer a sense of companionship, but it’s one that’s very low pressure - you can enjoy the music completely alone, nobody needs to know you’re there, but you can still feel co-present with others in a space.” Winston has observed that while many types of music thrive on the Internet, lofi beats is, uniquely, a genre created because of the Internet to answer the cravings of those who, like me, aren’t seeking silence but peace. “There’s very little going on in the sonic range we associate with excitement,” says Reed Arvin, a record producer based in Nashville. “We call that range ‘bright’. Lofi Girl’s music isn’t just musically mellow, it’s sonically mellow.” Also mellow is the way Lofi Girl rejects some of the core mechanisms underpinning the business models of Big Tech. Its continuous playback deprives YouTube of any moments in which to serve up new content and ads designed to send users down the so-called rabbit hole. Winston likens the stream to “a still point” in the storm of content that demands our attention from all sides. Lofi Girl also provides a more satisfactory answer to suggestions that we should simply ignore digital distractions. Tyler Lok, a fan from Salt Lake City, says the effect of the Internet on our minds is that interruptions can only be turned “off” if something else is “on”. “We occupy ourselves with stimulation constantly . . . to the point that our brains begin to lose the ability to be bored,” says Lok. “Streams (like Lofi Girl) allow us to stay plugged into digital stimulation and still get some work done.”"

How to spot 'medical gaslighting' and what to do about it,"Christina, who lives in Portland, Maine, said she felt ignored by doctors for years. When she was 50 pounds heavier, her providers sometimes blamed her body size when she discussed her health concerns. One instance occurred weeks after she had fallen off her bike. “My elbow was still hurting,” said Christina, 39, who asked that her last name be withheld when discussing her medical history. “I went to my regular primary care doctor and she just sort of hand-waved it off as ‘Well, you’re overweight and it’s putting stress on your joints.’” Eventually, Christina visited an urgent care centre, where providers performed an X-ray and found she had chipped a bone in her arm. The experience of having one’s concerns dismissed by a medical provider, often referred to as medical gaslighting, can happen to anyone. A recent New York Times article on the topic received more than 2,800 comments: Some recounted misdiagnoses that nearly cost them their lives or that delayed treatment, leading to unnecessary suffering. Patients with long Covid wrote about how they felt ignored by the doctors they turned to for help. Lately, the problem has been drawing attention – in both the medical community and the general public – for disproportionately affecting women, people of color, geriatric patients and LGBTQ people. For example, studies have found that women are more likely than men to be misdiagnosed with certain conditions – like heart disease and autoimmune disorders – and they often wait longer for a diagnosis. And one group of researchers discovered that doctors were more likely to use negative descriptors like “noncompliant” or “agitated” in Black patients’ health records than in those of white patients – a practice that could lead to health care disparities. “Gaslighting is real; it happens all the time. Patients – and especially women – need to be aware of it,” said Dr Jennifer H Mieres, a professor of cardiology at the Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell and co-author of the book Heart Smarter for Women. Here are some tips on how to advocate for yourself in a medical setting. WHAT ARE THE SIGNS OF GASLIGHTING? Gaslighting can be subtle and isn’t always easy to spot. When seeking medical care, experts recommend watching for the following red flags. “I always tell my patients that they are the expert of their body,” said Dr Nicole Mitchell, the director of diversity, equity and inclusion for the obstetrics and gynaecology department at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California. “We work together to figure out what’s happening and what we can do about it. It really should be a shared decision making.” WHAT CAN YOU DO TO ADVOCATE FOR YOURSELF? Keep detailed notes and records: Dr Mitchell recommended keeping a journal where you log as many details as possible about your symptoms. Her suggested prompts include: “What are your symptoms? When do you feel those symptoms? Do you notice any triggers? If you have pain, what does it feel like? Does it wax and wane, or is it constant? What days do you notice this pain?” In addition to your notes, keep records of all of your lab results, imaging, medications and family medical history. It is analogous to seeing your accountant at tax time, Dr Mieres said: “You certainly do not show up without receipts.” Ask questions, then ask some more: Prepare a list of questions that you would like to ask ahead of your appointment, and be prepared to ask other questions as new information is presented. If you aren’t sure where to start, Dr Mitchell recommended asking your doctor this: “If you were me, what questions would you ask right now?” Bring a support person: Sometimes it can help to have a trusted friend or relative accompany you, particularly when discussing a treatment plan or difficult medical issue. When people are ill, scared or anxious, it can facilitate “brain freeze,” Dr Mieres said. “We stop thinking, we don’t hear adequately, we don’t process information.” Speak with your support person to clarify their role and discuss your expectations, she added. Do you want them to take notes and be a second set of ears? Or do you primarily need them there for emotional support? Are there times where you might prefer that your friend or relative leave the room so that you can discuss private matters? Focus on your most pressing issue: Providers are often short on time, and the average primary care exam is only 18 minutes long, according to a study published in 2021. DrMieres recommended taking 10 minutes before your appointment to jot down bullet points that concisely outline the reason for your visit so that you can communicate with your doctor efficiently. Pin down next steps: Ideally, you should leave your appointment feeling reassured. Tell your provider that you would like to understand three things:the best guess as to what is happening; plans for diagnosing or ruling out different possibilities; and treatment options, depending on what is found. If you’re still being ignored, what are your options? Switch providers: A study using data from 2006 and 2007 estimated that approximately 12 million adults were misdiagnosed in the United States every year and about half of those errors could be harmful. If you are concerned that your symptoms are not being addressed, you are entitled to seek a second opinion, a third or even a fourth. But in many cases that may be easier said than done. It’s not always quick or simple to find another specialist who takes your insurance and has immediate appointments available. If possible, try to get an in-network referral from your current doctor. For example, you can say: “Thank you for your time, but I would really like to seek another opinion on this. Could you refer me to another specialist in your area?” If you don’t feel comfortable asking your doctor for a referral, you can also speak with a patient liaison or nurse manager. Alternatively, you can ask friends and family, or call your insurance company to find someone in-network. Reframe the conversation: If you decide to stick with your current provider, but that person doesn’t appear to be listening, DrMieres recommended that patients try redirecting the conversation by saying something like:“Let’s hit the pause button here, because we have a disconnect. You’re not hearing what I’m saying. Let me start again.” Or, alternatively: “I’ve been having these symptoms for three months. Can you help me find what is wrong? What can we do to figure this out together?” Look to support groups: There are support groups for a multitude of conditions that may provide useful resources and information. Tami Burdick, who was diagnosed in 2017 with granulomatous mastitis, a rare, chronic, inflammatory breast disease, found help from an online support group for women with the same condition. Initially, she was referred to an infectious disease specialist who dismissed a breast biopsy found to contain bacteria. “I developed horrible, painful abscesses that would open and drain on their own,” Ms Burdick, 44, said. In her search for answers she conducted extensive research on the disease. And from the support group she learned of a gene sequencing test that could identify potential pathogens. Ms Burdick asked her surgical oncologist to order the test and discovered she had been infected with a specific microorganism associated with granulomatous mastitis and recurrent breast abscesses. It took seven months of investigating, but she finally had an answer. To help other women, she self-published a book about her experience in collaboration with her oncologist. “If the infectious disease specialist had looked further into it,” she continued, “perhaps I could have started antibiotics right away, then and there, and never have required surgery.” Appeal to a higher authority: If you are being treated in a hospital setting, you can contact the patient advocacy staff, who may be able to assist. You might also address the problem with your doctor’s supervisor. Finally, if you are dissatisfied with the care that you’re receiving, Dr Mitchell said, you may consider reporting your experience to the Federation of State Medical Boards (for US patients). “Any instances of abuse, manipulation, gaslighting, delaying diagnoses – those are reportable events that providers need to know about,” Dr Mitchell said. “Doctors need to be held accountable.” By Christina Caron © 2022 The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/synthetic-embryo-breakthrough-growing-human-organs-far-2861886,'Synthetic embryo' breakthrough but growing human organs far off,"PARIS: Stem cell scientists say they have created ""synthetic embryos"" without using sperm, eggs or fertilisation for the first time, but the prospect of using such a technique to grow human organs for transplantation remains distant. The breakthrough was hailed as a major step forward, though some experts said the result could not fully be considered to be embryos and warned of future ethical considerations. In research published in the journal Cell this week, scientists at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel described mouse stem cells self-assembling into embryo-like structures in the lab. The research built upon 2018 research that had a bundle of mouse stem cells self-organised into something resembling the beginnings of an embryo - but with far fewer cells. The Weizmann team led by Palestinian stem cell scientist Jacob Hanna went much further. They started by collecting cells from the skin of mice, then made them artificially return to the state of stem cells. The stem cells were then placed in a special incubator, which continuously moved to mimic a mother's womb. The vast majority of the cells failed to form anything. But 50 - 0.5 per cent of the 10,000 total - collected themselves into spheres, then embryo-like structures, the researchers said. After eight days - around a third of the 20-day mouse gestation period - there were early signs of a brain and a beating heart, they added. They were described as 95 per cent similar to normal mouse embryos. ""The embryo is the best organ-making machine and the best 3D bioprinter - we tried to emulate what it does,"" Hanna said in a Weizmann statement. While they were the most advanced synthetic embryo-like structures ever grown, some scientists not involved in the research warned against calling them ""embryos"". ""These are not embryos,"" French stem cell scientist Laurent David told AFP. ""Until proven otherwise, they do not result in a viable individual capable of reproducing,"" he added. He preferred to call them embryoids, the name for a group of cells that resemble an embryo, emphasising that they showed only the very beginnings of organs. However, David welcomed the ""very convincing"" research, which he said could allow further experiments to understand exactly how organs form. Hanna said the team's ""next challenge is to understand how stem cells know what to do --= how they self-assemble into organs and find their way to their assigned spots inside an embryo"". If human organs could one day be grown in a lab, it could provide life-saving transplants to thousands of people every year without the need for donors. There has been progress in this new field - several years ago researchers managed to develop an artificial intestine in the lab that could be implanted into a mouse. For humans, however, such organ implants remain science fiction. Still, Hanna has founded a company, Renewal Bio, that aims to find a way to use the technology for therapeutic purposes. Researchers not involved in the study said it was very early to consider using such a technique for humans. Alfonso Martinez Arias of Spain's Pompeu Fabra University said the breakthrough ""opens the door to similar studies with human cells, though there are many regulatory hoops to get through first and, from the point of view of the experiments, human systems lag behind mouse systems"". And aiming to get similar results from human cells will likely open an ethical can of worms. ""Although the prospect of synthetic human embryos is still distant, it will be crucial to engage in wider discussions about the legal and ethical implications of such research,"" James Briscoe of Britain's Francis Crick Institute said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/biden-covid-19-positive-rebound-antiviral-paxlovid-2858171,"Commentary: Why do some people, like President Biden, who take Paxlovid get 'rebound' COVID-19?","BRISBANE: For many people with COVID-19, their recovery isn’t linear. United States President Joe Biden is one such person – he continues to test positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and has experienced the return of a “loose cough”. He returned a positive “rebound” test on Saturday (Jul 30), only days after testing negative for COVID-19. President Biden was treated with the antiviral Paxlovid, in the hope this would allow him to recover faster and reduce his risk of severe disease. Paxlovid is a combination treatment that uses two different antivirals: Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir. Nirmatrelvir works to prevent the virus replicating. It does this by stopping a viral enzyme called a protease. SARS-CoV-2, like many viruses, rely on proteases to “activate” them. Without the protease, the virus replication cycle cannot be completed and the virus can not become active. So rather than “killing” the virus, it stops new “active” virus particles from being made. Ritonavir is a “boosting agent” which prevents the metabolism of nirmatrelvir, meaning it stays in your system for longer. Ritonavir has been used in low doses to boost the effectiveness of other protease antivirals in infections such as HIV. Paxlovid treatment involves taking two nirmatrelvir 150mg tablets and one ritonavir 100mg tablet, together, every 12 hours for five days. Like all antivirals, it’s important to start the course of Paxlovid as soon as possible after a diagnosis of COVID. This needs to be within five days of the onset of symptoms, so it can reduce virus replication and therefore reduce the spread of the virus in the body. In a clinical trial, Paxlovid showed an 89 per cent reduction in the risk of hospitalisation and death. There were no recorded deaths among those who received treatment. Compared to people in the study who didn’t receive the drug, Paxlovid treatment also reduced the viral load when measured on day five of the study. Rebound is when a person appears to have recovered and “cleared” the virus, meaning they test negative on the very sensitive PCR test and have no symptoms. Then a few days later, they test positive again or symptoms return. Rebound is not specific to people who have taken Paxlovid – it can also happen to others with COVID-19 who didn’t receive any drug treatments. A study that is yet to be peer reviewed has also found that patients’ symptoms and viral load can worsen after an initial period of improvement in some cases. While this is not true “rebound” it does suggest the course of infection may not be linear. There have now been increasing reports of rebound effects in people who were treated with Paxlovid, including President Biden. Biden finished his five-day course of Paxlovid and tested negative to the virus. Three days later, he tested positive. Why and how rebound happens is still not exactly known. What we do know is Paxlovid stops the virus in a person’s body from replicating. It doesn’t kill the virus already there. For that, we need the body’s immune system. One theory is that a five-day course is not long enough to suppress the virus replication to allow the immune system to kick in and kill the virus. Or perhaps the timing of when treatment starts affects how the immune system kicks in. Another theory is the drug is not being taken as prescribed. Research into the cause of Paxlovid rebound is ongoing. A recent study of rebound after Paxlovid in 11,000 people, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, found that seven days after treatment, 3.53 per cent of participants had rebound positive PCR tests and 2.31 per cent had rebound symptoms. After 30 days, 5.4 per cent tested positive and 5.87 per cent had symptoms. So just because you’ve received SARS-CoV-2 antiviral treatment, does not automatically mean you’re “cured”. While scientists and doctors are in the early stages of investigating Paxlovid rebound, early reports indicate rebound tends to be mild. Symptoms that return are commonly sniffles, sore throat or a cough. There are very few reports of severe rebound cases requiring hospitalisation and no reports on rebound resulting in death that I’m aware of. It’s important to remember that if you still have symptoms you might still be infectious. Guidelines across Australia make it clear if you have ongoing symptoms after your isolation period, you need to take care not to spread the virus. However, a person in rebound – even if they’re symptom-free – might also be able to spread the virus. So is Paxlovid doing what we need? If your goal is to prevent severe disease, hospitalisation and death in high-risk people, then Paxlovid is doing a great job. However, if you want to shorten the duration of your symptoms, maybe Paxlovid isn’t the wonder drug we hoped for.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/tics-twitching-blinking-leg-shaking-tourette-syndrome-reasons-2846721,"Excessive blinking, facial twitching, leg shaking, involuntary swearing: What causes such behaviours?","Here’s a question: Are you bouncing your leg (or legs) up and down while reading this? You’ve probably been told before to stop as it is unbecoming, distracting to others (you’re shaking the table!) and for those with a proclivity for superstitions, you’re jolting luck and fortune away.  The leg shaking habit may be borne out of boredom or anxiety, and “is typically not caused by an underlying medical condition”, said Dr Xu Zheyu, a senior consultant with the National Neuroscience Institute’s (NNI) Department of Neurology.  Having said that, Dr Xu noted that there are medical conditions that may induce some lower limb action, such as hyperthyroidism and Parkinson's disease. However, the nature of the movement is quite different to the habitual leg shaking.  For example, in hyperthyroidism, the shaking or tremors are experienced throughout the body and more so in the arms and hands – and not just the legs, she said. Patients with Parkinson’s disease may also experience foot or leg tremors but again, the movement is quite different as it is more subtle and rhythmic.  “Some patients may experience restlessness and jerking of the legs at night. This could be due to restless leg syndrome and may require attention if there is significant fatigue in the daytime,” said Dr Xu.  Otherwise, there is no need to see a doctor for habitual leg shaking, she added.  “VERY EXHAUSTING” Tics, on the other hand, are a completely different matter and are involuntary. “Tics are stereotypic repetitive movements (motor tics) or sounds (vocal tics) that interrupt normal muscle activity or speech,” said Dr Shermyn Neo, a consultant with the NNI’s Department of Neurology.  While habitual leg shaking could be a way to work off nervous energy, tics can instead be triggered by anxiety. And it doesn’t only concern the legs. In some individuals, the repetitive movements can manifest as “abnormal, involuntary facial movements known as facial tics”, said Dr Mohammad Tauqeer Ahmad, a neurologist with Gleneagles Hospital.  Added Dr Neo: “Motor tics can also involve various body parts, including the neck, limb and trunk muscles”.  Furthermore, tics can be classified as “simple” (excessive blinking, shrugging or grunting) or “complex” (grimacing or the tendency to use obscene words), explained Dr Neo. “When there are multiple motor tics accompanied by one or more vocal tics, a diagnosis of Tourette syndrome (TS) may be made.”  It is a situation that Billie Eilish, 20, lives with. The singer was diagnosed with TS when she was 11 and has mentioned that the tics are “very exhausting”.  The award-winning artiste told David Letterman on the Netflix show, My Next Guest Needs No Introduction, that the tics abate when she's performing. And while some specific tics have disappeared over time, others still occur regularly. ""I never don't tic at all because the main tics that I do constantly, all day long, are like, I wiggle my ear back and forth and raise my eyebrow and click my jaw ... and flex my arm here and flex this arm, flex these muscles,"" she said.  ""These are things you would never notice if you're just having a conversation with me, but for me, they're very exhausting."" THEY MAY BEGIN WITH EXCESSIVE BLINKING In most cases, such as Eilish's, the primary tics begin in childhood below age 18, said Dr Neo. And males are about four times more likely to be affected by TS than females, she said.  “There are no estimated figures of patients with tics or TS in Singapore, possibly due to cultural differences in seeking medical care. But the global prevalence ranges from 0.4 per cent to 3.8 per cent."" Typically, the tics tend to start with eye blinks at around the ages of five to six and may progress to involve the rest of the face and neck. The tics generally peak in severity at around age 10 and by age 16, “more than half of TS patients may have minimal or mild tics”, she said.  Facial tics also occur mainly in males and show up between the ages of six and 12, said Dr Tauqeer of this uncommon condition in Singapore. They, too, tend to disappear on their own.  As for tics that crop up in adulthood, they are usually reprisals of childhood-onset tics, said Dr Neo. But if there isn’t a childhood history of tics, it is important to look for secondary causes, she said. The patient may be on certain medications that have brought on the tics or has developed a neurological disorder.  For instance, hemifacial spasm, caused by an irritated facial nerve, can result in involuntary facial movements that mimic tics. “It can present as the twitching of half the face due to involuntary contractions of muscles around the eyes and mouth,” said Dr Neo. However, the exact cause of tics is unclear. “Studies have demonstrated differences in brain volumes and brain network connections in patients with tics compared to those without,” said Dr Neo.  There may also be a genetic link, she said: Multiple genes that have “small effects” have been demonstrated, and up to 50 per cent of TS patients have a family history of tics. Studies on twins have also suggested a genetic predisposition.  WHAT ARE THE TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR TICS? Not all tics need to be medically treated. “An indication to treat a tic disorder is when it interferes significantly with daily life,” said Dr Neo. Explained Dr Tauqeer: “The majority of the time, the tics are precipitated under stressful situations. So up to an extent, it is not wrong to say they can be mitigated by certain destressing techniques. Many patients may not need medication. Rather, the tics will improve on their own with age”. Dr Neo agreed that tics usually occur and “worsen under conditions of stress, excitement or fatigue”. And like in Eilish's situation, the tics ""may decrease with distraction while the patient is concentrating on mental or physical tasks”. But even if you are able to cope with the tics, you should get yourself examined by a doctor if you haven’t yet. “What is important is that we must investigate to find out any structural causes through scans, and functional causes through electrophysiological testing,” said Dr Tauqeer.  It is also to rule out “overlapping medical conditions like obsessive-compulsive behaviour, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or any behavioural or learning disabilities”, said Dr Neo, which a significant proportion of TS sufferers have. “While most tics are benign, some motor tics can be harmful, with patients exhibiting self-injurious behaviour.” The mainstay of treatment includes education, counselling, physiotherapy, medications to control symptoms and local botox injections, said Dr Tauqeer. Cognitive behaviour therapy may also be accessed by patients through self-help websites such as www.tichelper.com, said Dr Neo.  In some cases, deep brain stimulation may be used, said Dr Tauqeer, where electrodes are implanted in certain areas of the brain to produce electrical pulses and regulate abnormal impulses.  Patients can also seek support from Tourette Syndrome Singapore or SPD, a charity that helps individuals with disabilities and also raises awareness of and supports those with tic disorders in Singapore."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/malaysia-health-tobacco-anti-smoking-bill-referred-parliament-committee-khairy-2852566,Malaysia’s anti-smoking Bill referred to parliamentary committee for further deliberation,"KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia’s Lower House has postponed a vote on the Bill that seeks to ban smoking and vaping for those born from 2007 and onwards. The Control of Tobacco Product and Smoking Bill 2022 will instead be referred to a parliamentary special select committee for further scrutiny, said Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin in wrapping up the debate on Tuesday (Aug 2).
 
""As a minister I have to take this issue seriously. For laws that are important like this, we wouldn't want to be forced to support or pass before an in-depth refinement,"" he said. 
 
He said he wanted the Bill to get support from parliamentarians from all sides of the divide. 
 
“There is no perfect law in any legislature but let it be as good as it can be. Don’t let perfect be the enemy of good either,” he said. The committee has to prepare a statement on its suggestions to improve the Bill within a month, or no later than the first day of the next parliament meeting, the minister said later when tabling a motion to bring the Bill to the committee.
The next meeting is scheduled to begin on Oct 26.  
 
While most of the parliamentarians who debated the Bill on Monday and Tuesday agreed with the ban in principle, they said there is a need for the Bill to be fine-tuned.  
 
The Bill proposed a ban on the sale of cigarettes, tobacco and vape products to anyone born in the year 2007 and after, hence it is dubbed a “generational endgame”.  
 
The proposed law also bans those born after 2007 from buying, possessing, or using tobacco and other related products. Shopkeepers and retailers are also not allowed to display tobacco products, smoking devices as well as their substitutes. Currently, tobacco can only be sold to those aged 18 and above. The Bill aims to reduce the prevalence of smoking among Malaysia’s population to below 5 per cent by 2040. The prevalence of smoking was 21.3 per cent in 2019, according to the National Health and Morbidity Survey.  Mr Khairy said last week in a Twitter video that the country had to spend RM6.2 billion (US$1.4 billion) in 2020 to treat three diseases caused by smoking – lung cancer, heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This cost was expected to increase to RM8.8 billion by 2030, he said, adding that the tax collected from the tobacco industry yearly was about RM3 billion. In his speech tabling the Bill for second reading on Monday, Mr Khairy said that it is time for a brave and radical approach to stem the problems caused by smoking. “If we knew what we knew about smoking 50 years ago, there is no way we would have allowed it to be sold, just like a ban on drugs. Now is the time to do something,” he said. Mr Khairy said according to the Asean Tobacco Atlas Malaysia factsheet, about 27,000 deaths in the country yearly were attributed to smoking. He also stressed that the regulations will not affect those smokers who are above 18 years old. “We will not disturb you. You can smoke until you die. We just want to stop the cycle of smoking among a new generation,” he said. Mr Khairy also said that the problems caused by smoking are compounded with devices such as e-cigarettes and vapes. “From 2015, these devices entered the Malaysian market and until now the number of users of these devices among children and teenagers has increased,” he said, adding that they are not regulated enough under existing laws. The ministry made several changes to the Bill on Monday after discussions with the Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) on Women, Children and Social Development and the PSC on Health, Science and Innovation. Standard fines in the Bill have been reduced from RM5,000 to RM500, with the addition of community service in lieu of a fine. There will be no body searches for anyone under 18 and no punishment for possession for all related offences, Mr Khairy added. “This Bill is too important not to get broad bi-partisan support,” he said. During the debate, some MPs hailed the Bill as a game changer while some felt that parts of the Bill could be construed as an infringement of personal liberty. Padang Rengas MP Mohamed Nazri Abdul Aziz, for instance, said on Monday that the Bill was discriminatory and that people could bring the case to court in the future. “We have to think carefully about this. Freedom of choice is very important to everyone,” he said.   Kuching MP Yii Lee Wuen said the Bill has to be reviewed extensively by a special select committee to ensure safeguards to prevent the laws from being abused. Dr Yii, who is also the chairman of the Parliamentary Special Select Committee of Health, Science and Innovation, said in a statement that there are concerns about implementation gaps, possible loopholes and overreaching enforcement powers. Among others, provisions in the Bill grant enforcement officers the powers to enter any premises and seize baggage, he pointed out. Enforcement officers also have the power to conduct a body search on people suspected of possessing any tobacco products, he added. “This is disproportionate and open to abuse especially when there is inconsistent enforcement from different agencies,” Dr Yii said. "

Researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in the city of Daej aeonsouthwest of Seoul have developed an electronic tattoo ink made of liquid metal and carbon nanotubes that functions as a bioelectrode. Hooked up to an electrocardiogram (ECG) device or other biosensor, it can send a readout of a patient's heart rate and other vital signs such glucose and lactate to a monitor. The researchers eventually aim to be able to dispense with biosensors. ""In the future, what we hope to do is connect a wireless chip integrated with this ink, so that we can communicate, or we can send signal back and forth between our body to an external device,"" said project leader Steve Park, a materials science and engineering professor. Such monitors could in theory be located anywhere, including in patients' homes. The ink is non-invasive and made from particles based on gallium, a soft, silvery metal also used in semiconductors or in thermometers. Platinum-decorated carbon nanotubes help conduct electricity while providing durability. ""When it is applied to the skin, even with rubbing the tattoo doesn't come off, which is not possible with just liquid metal,"" Park said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/malaysia-smoking-ban-people-born-2007-khairy-parliament-bill-reduce-cancer-2844891,"Malaysia’s smoking ban proposal aims to reduce cancer risk, but the Bill divides opinion","KUALA LUMPUR: There is a voice prosthesis in Shamsul Rizal Ramli’s throat in place of his voice box, the organ involved in producing sound, swallowing and breathing.   He had to undergo a total laryngectomy in October 2014, after he was diagnosed with stage three laryngeal cancer, a disease that is linked to smoking. “The device always reminds me of my mistake with cigarettes. It is a lesson that the danger of smoking is real and very horrible,” the 46-year-old officer with the education department told CNA in an interview via WhatsApp messages. Mr Shamsul could not speak as he was recovering from an operation to fix an issue with his prosthesis, which has to be changed every one to two years to prevent the risk of infection.  “I was using another device called the electrolarynx that is less likely to spoil and does not need to be changed so often, but you sound like a robot. With a prosthesis, you sound more human,” the father of three said. Mr Shamsul first tried smoking when he was 15 and became a serious smoker when he started working. Back then, he used to smoke up to three packs of cigarettes per day. He stopped smoking for almost a year in 2009 but eventually, he could not resist the temptation of taking a puff until his cancer diagnosis.     “I did not stop out of willingness but rather because of the disease,” he said.  As a cancer survivor, he fully supports the Ministry of Health’s initiative to reduce smoking via the Tobacco and Smoking Control Bill 2022, which seeks to ban the sale of tobacco and related products for those born in 2007 and after.  Dubbed the Generational Endgame (GEG), the Bill was presented in the Lower House on Jul 27 for its first reading by Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin. The second and third readings of the Bill are expected to be held on Monday (Aug 1). If lawmakers approve of the Bill, Malaysia will be the second country in the world to enact a tobacco generational endgame legislation, after New Zealand. While the Bill is backed by health-based advocates and groups, the tobacco industry is attempting to push back.     The smoking of tobacco and tobacco products is linked to the development of many chronic or non-communicable diseases, including heart disease, cancer and chronic lung disease. In Malaysia, smoking is estimated to kill around 20,000 people annually, with many more affected due to disease complications. The Ministry of Health has previously said that 22 per cent of all cancer-related deaths in the country are related to tobacco.  Unsurprisingly, the Bill received huge support from health advocacy groups, with 43 associations led by the National Cancer Society of Malaysia (NCSM) saying that the law is a breath of fresh air to solve the social, health and economic problems caused by smoking.  “The lives and future of the people must take precedence,” they said in a joint statement.     NCSM president Saunthari Somasundaram told CNA that tobacco is linked to at least 15 different types of cancer.  “All those tracts that have direct contact with tobacco smoke have a certain percentage linked to cancer. You are talking about mouth cancer, tongue cancer, oropharyngeal cancer, voice box cancer. It goes down to your stomach and intestines,” she said. “Then it gets absorbed into the bloodstream and it can then go into different organs. You are talking about kidney, prostate, ovarian cancers,” she said, adding that 80 per cent of lung cancer cases alone are linked to tobacco use.  Dr Saunthari said that nicotine, which is addictive, has its own unique properties that are harmful.  “Once you are addicted to a substance, it’s no longer a personal choice. Our bodies need the substance. It becomes the chemical that is making the choices, and not you as a person,” she said. Mr Khairy said in a Twitter video that the country had to spend RM6.2 billion (US$1.4 billion) in 2020 to treat three diseases caused by smoking – lung cancer, heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This cost was expected to increase to RM8.8 billion by 2030. Mr Khairy also said that the tax collected from the tobacco industry yearly was about RM3 billion.  “RM6 billion to treat vs RM3 billion in revenue from the tax. Do the maths. The country is suffering a big loss,” he said.  Mr Khairy also said that patients with lung injuries caused by electronic cigarettes or vaping can spend up to RM150,000 for 12 days of treatment in hospital. Mr Shamsul, the former smoker who lost his voice box, said he does not wish for anyone to go through the same suffering.  “I learned it the hard way. I almost died because the cancer had become big and almost covered my respiratory tract,” he said. “Today I need a device to speak. My life has become much more complicated compared to before. That’s why I don’t want anyone to feel the pain that was caused by smoking,” he said.  According to the National Health and Morbidity Survey by the ministry’s Institute for Public Health over the years, the prevalence of smokers among Malaysia’s population has dropped marginally from 23.1 per cent in 2011 to 22.8 per cent in 2015 and to 21.3 per cent in 2019.  Currently, tobacco is not allowed to be sold to those who are under the age of 18. The secretary-general of the Drug Prevention Association of Malaysia (Pemadam) Burhanuddin Disa said that most people who misused drugs in the country started with smoking first. Mr Burhanuddin used to work with the Ministry of Education, dealing with students who misused drugs.   “One hundred per cent of them started with cigarettes before moving on to drugs. Today, syabu (methamphetamine) is the most misused drug, but the start was the same. Prevention is better than cure, and maybe future generations would also be prevented from misusing drugs,” he said.  Under the Bill are clauses that prohibit the sale of cigarettes, tobacco and vape products to anyone born in the year 2007 and after.   Any individual found guilty of this can be fined not more than RM20,000 or jailed for not more than one year or both for their first offence. Individuals guilty of subsequent similar offences can be fined up to RM30,000 or given a jail term of not more than two years, or both. A company guilty of the first offence, meanwhile, can be fined between RM20,000 and RM100,000 or jailed for two years, while further similar offences can see them fined between RM50,000 and RM300,000 and jailed for up to three years. Originally, the ministry had planned to ban the sale of tobacco and related products for those born after 2005 but Mr Khairy announced that this would be changed to 2007 after hearing views during stakeholder engagements. He said this would allow more time for community education, a robust implementation plan and ramped-up enforcement.   The proposed law also bans those born after 2007 from buying, possessing, or using tobacco and other related products, with those found guilty of doing so liable to a fine of up to RM5,000.   Shopkeepers and retailers are also not allowed to display tobacco products, smoking devices as well as their substitutes. The proposed law also prohibits advertisements of tobacco products or substances. Other aspects of the law address matters such as the registration, import, production, distribution, packaging and labelling of tobacco and related products. Mr Khairy also said in his video that with the new law, the e-cigarette or vape industry can be regulated, something that was supported by industry players.       “We can make sure that the vape liquids being sold are controlled properly, lab-tested so you don’t get sick,” he said, adding that the authorities are expecting to collect around RM500 million of taxes on vape. Dr Helmy Haja Mydin, who is the technical advisor for the ministry’s initiative, told CNA that the Bill aims to reduce the prevalence of smoking to below 5 per cent by 2040. This is outlined by Malaysia’s obligation to the articles under the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), which the country ratified in 2005. The Bill has met with resistance from the tobacco industry.  British American Tobacco (Malaysia) Bhd managing director Nedal Salem said in a statement that the proposed ban is effectively a prohibition and has never been tested in the real world. He said the proposed policy lacked any scientific evidence of effectiveness and is likely to be detrimental to the country's health agenda. ""While BAT Malaysia commends the Minister of Health's proactive stance in reducing the health impact of smoking but disagrees that prohibition is the way to achieve it. ""The prohibition will fuel the illicit tobacco market, which already accounts for almost 60 per cent of tobacco sold in Malaysia and, accordingly, will have negative consequences for public health,"" Mr Nedal said in a statement on Jul 25. Several vape industry players said they are against the outright ban of vaping for those born after 2007. Mr Rizani Zakari, the president of Malaysian Vape Industry Advocacy (MVIA), said the policy should not be implemented in haste as many are confused about it. ""Many who did not attend the engagement session with the Minister of Health recently do not agree with the GEG policy, especially small and medium entrepreneurs in the vape industry. This matter needs to be reviewed because it will have an impact on local entrepreneurs,” he said in a statement on Jul 26.  Mr Ibrahim Morni of the Malaysian Vaping Movement said many in the industry fully support the implementation of vape regulations but the policy is drastic because it bans the vape industry in the future. “We urge that regulations be introduced first and meanwhile, the decision regarding GEG for the vape industry be reviewed,"" he said in a statement on Jul 26.  It remains to be seen if the Bill would receive the two-thirds majority support needed in order to become law in the Lower House.  The Parliamentary Special Select Committee of Health, Science and Innovation said that while it agrees with the principle of the Bill, it also acknowledges the different concerns raised by stakeholders.  Committee chairman Kelvin Yii Lee Wuen recommended that the implementation of the Bill be postponed by three years to cover individuals born after 2008 in order to strengthen preparations for effective implementation. Mr Yii, who is also Kuching MP, said there are concerns over the enforcement power issues in the Bill, especially when it involves juveniles and children. “The power to inspect, possibly body check and punish a child for possession must be heavily controlled to prevent abuse. That is why the guidelines for enforcement must be very clear and specific on this to ensure the vulnerable are not victimised by the law, especially the poor,” he said in a statement on Jul 28.  Dr Helmy, the technical advisor who is also a respiratory physician, said the main challenge is to ensure that lawmakers are not swayed by arguments and misinformation spread by the tobacco industry. “For example, there is a persistent attempt to link any form of tobacco control measures with an increase in illicit cigarettes. This is misleading, as the latter needs to be addressed by improved governance and enforcement, and is not caused by policies per se,” he said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/migraines-headaches-new-treatment-2844171,How migraine treatments have become more effective over the years,"If you don’t suffer from migraine headaches, you probably know at least one person who does. Nearly 40 million Americans get them – 28 million of them women and girls – making migraine the second most disabling condition in the world after low back pain. Several studies have found that migraine became more frequent during the pandemic, too. I get migraine headaches, but thankfully they’re more bizarre than excruciating. Every few weeks, ocular migraine clouds my vision with strange zigzagging lights for a half-hour; and once or twice a year I get attacks that cause temporary memory loss. (One came on while I was grocery shopping, and I couldn’t remember what month or year it was, what I was there to buy or how old my kids were.) Despite its ubiquity, research on migraine has long been underfunded. The National Institutes of Health spent only US$40 million (S$55 million) on migraine research in 2021; by comparison, it spent US$218 million researching epilepsy, which afflicts one-twelfth as many Americans.  Why is this devastating condition so woefully understudied? “It’s a woman’s disease,” explained Dr. Robert Cowan, a neurologist and a former director of the Stanford Headache Program. In other words, he said, sexism almost certainly plays a role in medicine’s apathy toward the condition. The good news is that over the past several years, the medical establishment has become more interested in the issue, and a handful of new treatments for migraine have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Some of them are quite promising. Here’s what migraine sufferers should know about today’s treatment landscape. Recognize the symptoms of migraine and get a diagnosis. Far too many people with migraine suffer in silence. “Fewer than 30 per cent of people suffering with migraine seek medical advice, and only some of those patients will receive an appropriate migraine treatment,” said Dr. Santiago Mazuera, a neurologist at the Sandra and Malcolm Berman Brain & Spine Institute in Baltimore. Migraine is a neurological disorder and it differs from garden-variety headaches. People are likely to suffer from migraine if they have had at least five headache attacks in their lives, each lasting between four and 72 hours, and if the pain fulfills two out of these four criteria: It throbs or pulsates; it is on one side of the head; it is moderate to severe; it worsens with activity. Also, these attacks must cause either nausea or sensitivity to light and sound. If you think you might have migraine, see your primary care practitioner, Mazuera suggested. “There is better understanding of migraine within the primary care community in recent years and more knowledge about the newer treatments,” he said. But if you’re not getting the help you need, you might want to see a headache specialist or neurologist, said Dr. Seniha Ozudogru, a neurologist at Penn Medicine. People with migraine are also at increased risk for other disorders, including heart disease, stroke, epilepsy, anxiety and depression. Try lifestyle changes and first-line treatments to start. If you have migraine, consider keeping a headache diary, or downloading a migraine app, to identify possible triggers. Women, for instance, often have migraine pain right before their period; it can be treated in a variety of ways, including with an estrogen patch, Cowan said. Other common migraine triggers include stress, too much or too little sleep, caffeine, alcohol, weather changes, certain foods, dehydration, light and particular smells, according to the American Migraine Foundation. Often, triggers are partial and additive: You might not get a migraine attack after drinking one glass of red wine, but a glass of red wine and a bad night’s sleep might do it, Cowan said. A headache diary can also help you identify your triggers and figure out if you have chronic migraine, which is defined as having headaches on 15 or more days per month for more than three months, and when at least eight of those headaches have migraine-like features. Based on your symptoms and their frequency, your doctor may recommend a preventive migraine treatment to stop the headaches from starting. These types of medicines include antidepressants like amitriptyline, blood pressure medications such as propranolol and epilepsy drugs including valproate, Cowan said. The problem with these drugs is that often “they have nasty side effects,” Cowan said, so they aren’t always recommended or tolerated. I briefly took propranolol to control my migraines, but every time I exercised, I felt lightheaded and faint. Your doctor might suggest taking medication at the onset of migraine to ease your symptoms, in addition to or instead of preventive treatments. For treatment of migraine after onset, doctors have long prescribed triptans – drugs such as sumatriptan that reduce inflammation and constrict blood vessels – and anti-inflammatory pain medications such as ibuprofen. But these methods don’t always work either, and triptans can cause side effects like nausea and dizziness. If you can’t get relief, discuss new treatments with your doctor. Over the past five years, a handful of new drugs and devices have been approved for prevention and acute treatment of migraine. Many of these drugs block the activity of a pain-related protein called CGRP, Ozudogru explained. These include, for migraine prevention, monoclonal antibodies that are periodically injected or administered intravenously. There are also pills, called gepants and ditans (with brand names like Nurtec ODT, Ubrelvy and Reyvow) that can be taken at the onset of migraine to block the activity of CGRP. Rimegepant (Nurtec ODT) has been approved by the FDA to both prevent and treat migraine, Ozudogru said, which is notable because most drugs do only one or the other. These drugs don’t seem to have significant side effects, Cowan said – though they can cause mild nausea – yet they aren’t usually prescribed until after a person has tried several first-line treatments. That’s in large part because the new drugs are expensive, he said. Ozudogru said some doctors are also cautious about trying the latest treatments because they are so new, and nobody can say how safe they are over the long term. Among other things, CGRP helps the body heal from strokes, so drugs that inhibit CGRP activity might hinder recovery in someone who has a stroke, she said. Another medication that has been approved to treat chronic migraine in particular is the cosmetic drug Botox. It is injected into areas around the head and neck and is thought to work by blocking chemicals that carry pain signals to the brain. “I like Botox a lot,” Cowan said. But, he added, “not everybody can tolerate being stabbed in the head 31 times, even with a tiny needle.” Usually, too, Botox treatment is repeated every 12 weeks. Several medical devices have also been approved in recent years to manage migraine. “These have good data,” Cowan said, and they are ideal for people who can’t tolerate medicines or are pregnant. Gammacore, a hand-held device, targets the vagus nerve in the neck. Nerivio, a smartphone-controlled device worn on the arm, uses electrical signals to disrupt pain pathways. Cefaly stimulates the trigeminal nerve on the forehead, and Relivion stimulates the trigeminal and occipital nerves.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/chocolate-health-benefits-wellness-2837256,Is chocolate actually good for you and what are the health benefits?,"Chocolate has a long and illustrious reputation. Made from cocoa, which is derived from the beans of the cacao tree (whose scientific name translates to “food of the gods”), it was used by some of the earliest Mesoamerican cultures as food, medicine, ritual offering and perhaps even currency. It’s no less valuable in modern times; the global chocolate market grew by nearly 20 per cent between 2016 and 2021, with an approximate revenue of US$980 billion in 2021, according to the market research firm Statista. Taste surely plays a role in chocolate’s popularity, but you may have also heard that this delectable treat is good for your health. How does this perception stack up against the science? “Cocoa is clearly good for you,” said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and professor of nutrition at the Tufts Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy. “Whether chocolate is good for you or not depends on how much cocoa is actually in it, and what else is in it.” Cocoa beans are packed with fibre and “loads of phytonutrients,” Dr. Mozaffarian said, referring to the natural chemicals found in plants. Cocoa is thought to contain about 380 different chemicals, among them a large class of compounds called flavanols that have attracted significant research interest for their potential health benefits. But it’s less clear how many flavanols and other phytonutrients you need to improve health, or whether your chocolate bar of choice contains enough of them to do so. And experts have differing opinions on this point. Milk chocolate typically contains about 20 per cent cocoa, Dr. Mozaffarian said, though the cocoa content can vary. (The Food and Drug Administration requires milk chocolate to contain at least 10 per cent cocoa, but some milk chocolate bars contain as much as 50 per cent or more.) Dark chocolate usually contains more cocoa than milk chocolate, but it can also vary greatly, so check labels carefully, he said. For possible health benefits, he recommended choosing dark chocolate that is at least 70 per cent cocoa. Many small, short-term human trials, have found that dark chocolate or standardized cocoa supplements or drinks can modestly lower blood pressure and improve blood cholesterol and the health of blood vessels in adults. And some longer term observational studies have found that those who eat more cocoa might have a lower risk of certain cardiovascular diseases, Dr. Mozaffarian said. In a systematic review published in February in the journal JAMA Network Open, Dr. Mozaffarian and his colleagues examined how certain foods and nutrients were associated with heart health conditions. They found “probable or convincing evidence” that eating chocolate was linked with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, estimating that an average daily intake of just 10 grams, or about one-third of an ounce of chocolate, was associated with a 6 per cent reduction in the overall risk of cardiovascular disease. But these types of estimates are based on observational studies, which have important limitations, said Dr. JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. These studies can only identify correlations between eating chocolate and health; they can’t prove that chocolate causes benefits — people who eat more chocolate may be different in other ways that affect their health, Dr. Manson said. Observational study findings have also been inconsistent. Some have found no benefit, and others have found that those who eat chocolate habitually or more frequently are more likely to gain weight, she pointed out. Such studies also don’t often account for the different types of chocolate, which can vary in their cocoa content. And the sugar, fat and calorie count might negate any health benefits from the cocoa. To address some of these shortcomings, Dr. Manson and her colleagues conducted a large, randomized trial of more than 21,000 older adults in the United States. Half of the participants were given a cocoa extract supplement containing 500 milligrams of cocoa flavanols, and the other half were given a placebo. Results of the study, called the COSMOS trial, were published in June in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. After following the participants for 3.6 years, the researchers found that while – when compared with the placebo group – the cocoa supplement group was not statistically less likely to have cardiovascular events including heart attacks and strokes, they did have a 27 per cent reduction in cardiovascular deaths. Dr. Manson called these results “promising signals for heart protection,” though she emphasized that another trial is needed to confirm the findings before translating them into recommendations for cocoa flavanol intake. Importantly, the COSMOS trial did not give participants chocolate, but rather concentrated capsules of cocoa extract produced by chocolate-maker Mars, which also partially funded the study. To get the same amount of bioactive cocoa flavanols from chocolate, a person would have to eat close to 4,000 calories of milk chocolate or 600 calories of dark chocolate per day, Dr. Manson said, noting that a large proportion of flavanols can be destroyed during chocolate processing. Chocolate is “a wonderful treat, but to perceive it as a health food, I think it has its limitations,” Dr. Manson said. Much of the research, including her own, on the potential health benefits of chocolate and cocoa has been funded by chocolate companies such as Mars, Dr. Manson said. “These trials are expensive,” and government funding for nutrition studies in general is limited, she added. Research suggests that the results from food industry-sponsored studies, including those on chocolate, are more likely to be favourable to the companies funding them, though Dr. Manson said that Mars was not involved with the design or analysis of the COSMOS trial. For his part, Dr. Mozaffarian is persuaded by the existing research that dark chocolate containing 70 per cent or more cocoa is likely beneficial for heart health, even if it contains less flavanols than tested in the COSMOS trial. “Eating a small amount of dark chocolate every day is probably really good for us, and it will make you happy, because it tastes good,” he said. Dr. Mozaffarian said he does not receive any funding from the chocolate industry, but he did admit one conflict of interest when it comes to this particular food. “My conflict is that I do love dark chocolate,” he said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/pilates-exercise-health-benefits-flexibility-2830031,Is Pilates really as good as everyone says and should you try it?,"After Shari Berkowitz was injured during a live dance performance onstage, doctors told the actress that one wrong move could leave her paralysed for life. She had suffered three herniated discs in her neck, with one bulging into her spinal column. Months of physical therapy got her out of the danger zone, and then she discovered Pilates. Though excellent doctors and physical therapists got her through the initial healing, she said Pilates gave her “strength and confidence in my ability to move – the confidence that I could move again,” she said. The workout led to her full recovery and inspired her to become a Pilates instructor and studio owner herself. “Pilates was so transformative for me, when I see a client start to develop that same physical and emotional strength,” she said, “it’s extremely satisfying.” Berkowitz is not the only Pilates devotee to speak about the workout’s transformative powers. Many studios tout a quote attributed to its founder, the German boxer and strongman Joseph Pilates, that declares: “In 10 sessions, you feel better, 20 sessions you look better, 30 sessions you have a completely new body.” While no workout can offer us a new body, devotees say the low-weight resistance training can help our current bodies in important ways, strengthening the core muscles around the spine. Pilates first gained widespread attention in the late 1990s, as celebrities like Madonna and Uma Thurman touted its benefits, and aerobics enthusiasts sought a lower impact option. But a few years ago, the workout appeared to be on the decline. Doomsayers predicted a “Pilatespocalypse,” as newer and sweatier fitness trends, like spinning and boot camps, exploded. But thanks in part to the pandemic, many people’s exercise priorities have shifted from intense, calorie-burning workouts to activities that also foster a mind-body connexion, said Cedric Bryant, the president and chief science officer of the American Council on Exercise. Pilates is once again booming. Most market researchers don’t track it separately from yoga, but the International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association ranked it as the most popular gym activity for women. It now includes a wide array of offerings, from small private studios with one-on-one instruction and national Pilates franchises to app-based virtual classes and amped up “power” Pilates. So, is it worth trying to incorporate Pilates into your fitness routine? And what flavour is right for you? If you’re intrigued by the workout, here’s what you need to know. What is Pilates? A Pilates workout is often performed on a mat or in a chair and includes many strength and flexibility exercises found in other forms of resistance training. “There’s nothing mysterious about Pilates,” said Alycea Ungaro, owner of New York City’s Real Pilates and the author of several guides to the method. But there are a few elements that make Pilates unique. First, the method encourages participants to focus on breathing and cultivate a mind-body connexion, paying particular attention to how all movement stems from the core. Exercises are repeated in sets that strategically work the muscles without exhausting them. Many Pilates workouts also incorporate special equipment, including spring-based resistance machines designed to support the spine and target specific muscle groups. The most popular machine, called the “reformer,” looks like a small bed frame with a sliding platform hooked up to a system of springs, ropes and pulleys. While no workout can offer us a “whole new body,” scientific research does support an array of impressive health benefits. Studies suggest Pilates may help to improve muscle endurance and flexibility, reduce chronic pain and lessen anxiety and depression. Who can benefit from Pilates? The short answer is: everyone. Really. Pilates can be tailored to a spectrum of fitness goals, ages and abilities – professional dancers, athletes, pregnant women, octogenarians looking to improve their balance. “Anybody can do it,” said Carrie Samper, the director of Pilates education for Equinox. “You don’t have to be 25 and a Cirque du Soleil dancer. You can be 85 and start doing Pilates.” While doing Pilates will bring rewards on its own, some people approach it as a complement to other physical activities. “It really taught me how to move my body,” said Chris Robinson, a martial artist and owner of the San Diego-based studio Pilates and Sports. “And I found I could apply that education to anything.” Physicians and physical therapists often recommend Pilates as a path to rehabilitation for people recovering from injury. “It can serve as a bridge back to more normal activity,” said Dr Bryant. It can also help reduce one’s odds of becoming injured, he said, because of its ability to improve core stability, balance, flexibility and posture. “We know that when those are inadequate, you increase your risk for a variety of musculoskeletal and joint injuries.” Pilates can also benefit women who are pregnant or postpartum by safely strengthening the core and conditioning the pelvis. “It’s a great way to strengthen your pelvic floor without doing hundreds of Kegels,” said Sarah Clampett, a physical therapist and the head of clinical operations for Origin, a Los Angeles-based health company. “Anyone with pelvic floor issues or dysfunction would benefit from Pilates.” What can’t Pilates do? Traditional Pilates is not a cardiovascular workout. “The more advanced a person is, the more cardio-like it is,” said Ms. Berkowitz, who now trains instructors through her online studio, The Vertical Workshop. “But you’re never going to get to the point where you are really challenging your cardiovascular system.” It isn’t equivalent to lifting heavy weights, either. “There are limitations to how much strength it builds,” said Samper. “It’s not the same thing as doing trap bar deadlifts or bench presses. You’re not going to build that same muscle, because you never do Pilates movements to exhaustion.” It’s also not the best workout for catching up with a friend or watching TV. “You have to be really present and pay attention to where your body is in space and what it’s doing, and not everyone wants to do that,” said Samper. Without that level of concentration, you likely won’t reap as many benefits – and could risk injury. So how often should you do it? The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention advises adults to devote 150 minutes to moderate-intensity aerobic activity and two days to strength training weekly. Pilates would fall into the latter. But while you will see benefits from doing Pilates once or twice weekly, exercise experts agree that the ideal is three times a week. That’s the “sweet spot,” said Samper. Is there such a thing as too much Pilates? Not really, if you mix up the way you practise. “If you find that it’s the thing that kind of floats your boat, there’s nothing wrong with doing it as many as five times or more a week,” said Dr Bryant. What type of Pilates is best for you? Not all workouts that call themselves “Pilates” are created equal. Experienced Pilates instructors generally recommend starting with one-on-one or small group training sessions, so you can learn the basics. “The ideal situation is to be in the studio,” said Robinson. “You have all the apparatus to help you and an instructor to guide you.” But for a lot of people, he said, that’s just not feasible. Individual training sessions often start at US$75 or more per session, while virtual classes can be a fraction of that. “There’s still a lot to be gained virtually, if that’s all you can do,” said Robinson. “You know, some Pilates is better than no Pilates.” The method you connect with can depend on your specific goals and needs. “If you’re a healthy person and you don’t have any musculoskeletal issues – you just want a good workout – absolutely, go join a gym Pilates class,” said Carrie Lamb, a master instructor for the national Pilates company Balanced Body and physical therapist in Golden, Colo. But if you’re recovering from an injury or dealing with chronic pain, you may benefit from a more intimate environment. For people looking for a workout that helps them achieve both cardio and muscle-building goals, consider checking out newer, hybrid Pilates offerings that speed up classical movements and promise to get your heart pumping. Finding the right instructor is crucial. To benefit most from Pilates, seek out “a well-trained and qualified instructor” who puts clients’ safety first, said Dr Bryant. As Pilates has become more popular, more people with very little training are marketing themselves as Pilates instructors. “There are some people who will tell you that they teach Pilates, and they’ve gone to a weekend class,” said Dr Lamb, while others “have gone through comprehensive training and spent hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars to learn.” Before you sign up for any form of Pilates, cheque out the credentials of the instructor, and look for someone who has completed a certification programme that requires at least 400 hours of training as well as continuing education, said Dr Bryant. Ask the prospective instructor how they can help you meet your specific goals. Find someone who will carefully listen to you and understand you as an individual, said Dr Bryant, “as opposed to being the expert who’s going to tell you what you need.” By Danielle Friedman © 2022 The New York TimesThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

It can also help reduce one’s odds of becoming injured, he said, because of its ability to improve core stability, balance, flexibility and posture. “We know that when those are inadequate, you increase your risk for a variety of musculoskeletal and joint injuries.” Pilates can also benefit women who are pregnant or postpartum by safely strengthening the core and conditioning the pelvis. “It’s a great way to strengthen your pelvic floor without doing hundreds of Kegels,” said Sarah Clampett, a physical therapist and the head of clinical operations for Origin, a Los Angeles-based health company. “Anyone with pelvic floor issues or dysfunction would benefit from Pilates.” What can’t Pilates do? Traditional Pilates is not a cardiovascular workout. “The more advanced a person is, the more cardio-like it is,” said Ms. Berkowitz, who now trains instructors through her online studio, The Vertical Workshop. “But you’re never going to get to the point where you are really challenging your cardiovascular system.” It isn’t equivalent to lifting heavy weights, either. “There are limitations to how much strength it builds,” said Samper. “It’s not the same thing as doing trap bar deadlifts or bench presses. You’re not going to build that same muscle, because you never do Pilates movements to exhaustion.” It’s also not the best workout for catching up with a friend or watching TV. “You have to be really present and pay attention to where your body is in space and what it’s doing, and not everyone wants to do that,” said Samper. Without that level of concentration, you likely won’t reap as many benefits – and could risk injury. So how often should you do it? The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention advises adults to devote 150 minutes to moderate-intensity aerobic activity and two days to strength training weekly. Pilates would fall into the latter. But while you will see benefits from doing Pilates once or twice weekly, exercise experts agree that the ideal is three times a week. That’s the “sweet spot,” said Samper. Is there such a thing as too much Pilates? Not really, if you mix up the way you practise. “If you find that it’s the thing that kind of floats your boat, there’s nothing wrong with doing it as many as five times or more a week,” said Dr Bryant. What type of Pilates is best for you? Not all workouts that call themselves “Pilates” are created equal. Experienced Pilates instructors generally recommend starting with one-on-one or small group training sessions, so you can learn the basics. “The ideal situation is to be in the studio,” said Robinson. “You have all the apparatus to help you and an instructor to guide you.” But for a lot of people, he said, that’s just not feasible. Individual training sessions often start at US$75 or more per session, while virtual classes can be a fraction of that. “There’s still a lot to be gained virtually, if that’s all you can do,” said Robinson. “You know, some Pilates is better than no Pilates.” The method you connect with can depend on your specific goals and needs. “If you’re a healthy person and you don’t have any musculoskeletal issues – you just want a good workout – absolutely, go join a gym Pilates class,” said Carrie Lamb, a master instructor for the national Pilates company Balanced Body and physical therapist in Golden, Colo. But if you’re recovering from an injury or dealing with chronic pain, you may benefit from a more intimate environment. For people looking for a workout that helps them achieve both cardio and muscle-building goals, consider checking out newer, hybrid Pilates offerings that speed up classical movements and promise to get your heart pumping. Finding the right instructor is crucial. To benefit most from Pilates, seek out “a well-trained and qualified instructor” who puts clients’ safety first, said Dr Bryant. As Pilates has become more popular, more people with very little training are marketing themselves as Pilates instructors. “There are some people who will tell you that they teach Pilates, and they’ve gone to a weekend class,” said Dr Lamb, while others “have gone through comprehensive training and spent hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars to learn.” Before you sign up for any form of Pilates, cheque out the credentials of the instructor, and look for someone who has completed a certification programme that requires at least 400 hours of training as well as continuing education, said Dr Bryant. Ask the prospective instructor how they can help you meet your specific goals. Find someone who will carefully listen to you and understand you as an individual, said Dr Bryant, “as opposed to being the expert who’s going to tell you what you need.” By Danielle Friedman © 2022 The New York TimesThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/monkeypox-patients-symptoms-treatment-lesions-2844326,What is it like to have monkeypox? Patients share their experience,"It started with a bad headache in mid-June. Bumps then began appearing on her face and chest. “I had a big zit on my forehead and a bunch on my nose bridge as well as my cheek. Which I thought was weird because I don't usually have breakouts like this,” said the woman, who goes by the name Kyrie Fluffins on TikTok. She requested to remain anonymous for this article. Speaking to CNA on Wednesday (Jul 27), Kyrie, who is based in California, said she initially suspected that she had COVID-19 as some of her friends tested positive for the virus recently. But her tests came back negative. The bumps continued to spread to other parts of her body including her back, legs and scalp. Then her eyes started to itch. Alarmed, she went to see a doctor, who said that she might have monkeypox and told her to get tested. “I just shut down, it was like getting delivered really bad news. It was really depressing and scary especially because they told me there's no cure,” she said. “They said since it’s a viral infection, all I can do is to let my system ride it out, do its thing and fight it off naturally. “It was so disheartening to hear that there's no medicine that you can take to make it go away.” While waiting for test results to confirm she had the disease, she also developed a secondary infection of cellulitis – a common bacterial skin infection that causes redness, swelling and pain – on her left elbow. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), other complications include bronchopneumonia, sepsis, pneumonia, encephalitis, confusion and infection of the cornea with ensuing loss of vision. Kyrie is still not sure how she contracted monkeypox, though she suspects she could have caught it during a massage at a spa or by sharing food with her friends. A viral disease, monkeypox can be transmitted through contact with bodily fluids, lesions on the skin or on internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth or throat, respiratory droplets and contaminated objects.  Human-to-human transmission is limited, with the longest documented chain of transmission being six generations, according to WHO. This means that the last person to be infected in this chain was six links away from the original patient. Monkeypox is related to smallpox but its symptoms, while similar, are often less severe and last between two and four weeks. Those who are infected usually experience fever, headache, muscle ache, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills, lethargy and rash. However, patients CNA spoke to also reported symptoms such as sensitivity to light and prolonged diarrhoea. Currently, there are no specific proven or safe treatments or vaccines available for monkeypox. Treatment is typically symptomatic and supportive, which means it can only help to relieve some symptoms. Vaccines and antiviral medication are also being developed and studied for use in the prevention and treatment of monkeypox. With her infection going on for more than a month now, Kyrie said it has impacted her health as well as her quality of life. New lesions are still appearing on her body and she continues to grapple with exhaustion and itchy eyes. A software engineer, she used to do yoga every day and was generally healthy. Since contracting monkeypox, she has lost a lot of weight and gone down at least one dress size. “When I got sick, I was just in bed for weeks and I had to take a lot of time off work. And I'm still not fully recovered,” Kyrie said. “It is very confusing because at first (the doctors) told me that the lesions would be gone within a week and to just wait for the lesions to crust over and fall off – which I did and new skin grew underneath – but then they came back. As of day 31 of my infection, I’m still getting new lesions. “It feels never-ending."" For 40-year-old Maxim Sapozhnikov, who tested positive for monkeypox on Jun 21, his infection appeared to be milder. Based in Milan, the founder and CEO of creative production agency Fashion To Max said he experienced symptoms including headaches, a low-grade fever and lesions. He isolated himself for 19 days. “I had about 10 lesions, with the biggest one on my (index) finger. I also had a couple on my chest, a small one on my face that went away quite quickly, my legs and one in an intimate area,” he said. “I had back pain that lasted for one to two days. But if you’re asking if this is the worst (infection or illness) I’ve experienced so far – then I would say, for me, it was fine in general, it wasn't the worst for me.” No new lesions appeared after the first week and Mr Sapozhnikov said he has since recovered. WHO’s external situation report published on Jul 25 said that the global outbreak of monkeypox has grown to more than 16,000 cases, including five deaths. While cases remain heavily concentrated in Europe, the five deaths were reported in African nations. On Wednesday, Singapore reported its 11th case of monkeypox since June, a 32-year-old Singaporean man who tested positive two weeks after developing a fever. Of the 11 cases, five are imported and six are local. None of them are linked. Health Minister Ong Ye Kung previously said that MOH does not recommend the mass vaccination of Singapore’s population against monkeypox, given the self-limiting nature of the disease. With data showing that the global monkeypox outbreak appears to affect mostly men who have sex with other men, it has sparked concerns about stigma and discrimination towards some communities. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Jul 21 – the largest to date – found that of 528 confirmed infections diagnosed between Apr 27 and Jun 24 this year, 98 per cent were gay or bisexual men, and 95 per cent were suspected to have caught the disease through sexual activity. The WHO’s latest situational report found that 5,470 of the 5,561 cases – or 98 per cent – with reported sexual orientation identified as gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. Of the 4,614 cases with reported HIV status, 1,873 cases – or 41 per cent – were HIV-positive. However, public health experts stress that the spread of monkeypox is not just limited to sexual activity or sexual orientation. The disease can also be transmitted through close contact as well as contact with bodily fluids, which means that it is possible for the virus to infect people who have sex with people of the opposite sex and through kissing. For Kyrie and Mr Sapozhnikov, who shared their experience with monkeypox on their social media accounts, the existing stigma surrounding monkeypox initially made them hesitant to do so. “Because of the stigma, people are just afraid to tell anybody and actually, it was the same for me,” said Mr Sapozhnikov. “When I got it, it was very scary. And a month ago, you can imagine there wasn’t a lot of information about monkeypox and there wasn’t anyone one social media talking about their experience, so I decided to do it. “Now there are probably about 40 over people around the world who have come out to share their experience and talk about it. When you see somebody who is going through the same thing as you and sharing their experience, you feel like you’re not alone and also learn how they deal with this, where to go for help and what to do,” he added. As for Kyrie, she initially started taking videos of her lesions to show her doctor the progression of her spots. However, after being denied antiviral treatment, she eventually decided to turn to the online community for support. “I didn't know what to do and I received no help from my doctors. People kept saying it's a gay disease and I'm a straight woman,” she said. “So I started posting and then people started reaching out and saying that they have the same thing and that they had been denied testing as well,” she said, adding that people also shared recommendations to relieve symptoms. “To see people who are going through the same thing and get support is a good thing but, it is such a heavy illness to carry in the sense that it’s very exhausting both emotionally and physically.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/noisy-neighbours-health-problems-2835881,"Noisy neighbours are more than just a nuisance, they can also cause health problems","If you live in a Housing Development Board (HDB) flat, you might sometimes wonder what your neighbours get up to based on the sounds they make.  What could they possibly need to do that requires them to drag heavy furniture across the living room every day? Why does it sound like a stampede above you when it’s already past midnight? And why would they need to carry out home improvement manoeuvres such as drilling and hammering every single weekend when it’s not even 9am yet?  We may never know the answers. But one thing’s for sure: We are getting more and more fed up with noisy neighbours. Complaints relating to noise from fellow residents have increased by about 25 per cent, from 2,500 cases a month in 2020 to 3,200 cases a month in 2021, revealed National Development Minister Desmond Lee in response to a parliamentary question on Feb 14.   MORE THAN A NUISANCE Noisy neighbours are more than a nuisance, according to a report published in the journal Applied Economics in April 2022. They may also cause health problems, said Assistant Professor Fan Yi from the National University of Singapore’s Department of Real Estate, who conducted the study with London School of Economics’s Associate Professor Diana Weinhold.  The study is based on a longitudinal survey (from 2008 to 2013) of over 5,000 Dutch adults to investigate the relationship between self-reported sleep disruption and health. The findings suggested that the combination of neighbour noise and sleep disruption could lead to ill health.  “While neighbour noise has traditionally been viewed as more of a nuisance than a public health issue, growing evidence of the health costs associated with disrupted sleep should prompt serious discussion among policymakers and urban planners,” said Asst Prof Fan.  “Noise control becomes even more vital in a dense urban environment like Singapore, where over 95 per cent of households reside in flats or apartments,” she said. WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF NOISE ON HEALTH? Nobel Prize winner Robert Koch said in 1910 that, “One day, man will have to fight noise as fiercely as cholera and pest”. Fast forward to 2022 and he was spot on. It certainly doesn’t sound good when noise, such as the ones created by neighbours, is regarded as the “new secondhand smoke” in a study published in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America.  Singapore is noisy. The average noise levels of the residential areas in bigger, busier cities such as Shanghai (57 decibels or dB), Hong Kong (60dB), Seoul (61dB) and London (66dB) are lower than Singapore’s 69.4dB, according to a 2017 study conducted by National University of Singapore researchers.  This noise level exceeds the National Environmental Agency's recommendation of no more than 67dB per hour on average. It is just a little shy of the World Health Organization’s guideline of 70dB – which is a level equivalent to a washing machine in use. And it is a level that can cause you to feel very annoyed.  You may think that our natural environment is already noisy (think bird calls, gusty winds, leaves rustling), so even without your neighbours’ contributions, it is a noisy world we live in. But other than loud events such as thunderstorms and earthquakes, sounds in nature are actually low and register just between 20dB and 30dB, according to the study.   And for good reason, too. In nature, loud noise often indicates danger and causes “fight or flight” responses, mentioned the same study. “Noise causes almost instantaneous increases in blood pressure and pulse”, and releases stress hormones. In other studies, noise has also been found to cause inflammation of the vascular lining, which can be a precursor to cardiovascular disease.   In another study, inadequate, interrupted or poor-quality sleep created by noise is associated with a multitude of ailments, including anxiety, obesity, depression, hypertension, diabetes, dementia and increased mortality. And it has been proven in studies that noise, particularly night-time noise, is associated with an increased incidence of arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction and stroke.  Even when the noise is not loud enough to wake you up from sleep, it may still cause electroencephalogram changes and result in increases in heart rate, according to a study on sleep disruption due to hospital noises. Changes in heart rate may be an indicator for long-term cardiovascular health.  And it’s not only heart and blood pressure issues that can crop up when noise interferes with sleep, said Asst Prof Fan. Studies have found evidence that sleep duration can “interact powerfully with both inflammatory processes and the immune system” and that sleep quality could be “linked to a variety of undesirable health outcomes in people, including problems of the bone and joint problems and lung disease”, she said. BAD “VIBES” AND OTHER FACTORS THAT WORSEN NOISE’S EFFECTS While there are recommended noise limits for the bedroom (about 30dB or the level of a whisper, according to the WHO), none exists when it comes to vibrations, which can be caused by renovation works, loud KTV speakers or even the passing MRT train.  “A few studies found that vibration does have negative impact on health. Similar to noise exposure, vibration exposure will cause sleep disturbance and disturbance of concentration, either presented alone or in combination with noise,” said Asst Prof Fan. In fact, vibrations, regardless of noise, “were found to have a significant impact on perceived poor sleep, lead to greater difficulty falling asleep and cause more tiredness in the mornings” in this study.  What about the effects of the living conditions (such as small or dark dwellings) on people’s susceptibility to noise’s ill effects? Those factors are “unlikely to be first-order drivers of the observed correlations between sleep disturbance and health outcomes”, according to the report that Asst Prof Fan co-authored. However, the study did note that “individuals who are more easily disturbed are indeed more likely to experience ill health across most of health conditions”.  The duration and loudness of the noise certainly matter. “The loss of healthy life years in respect to noise exposure was discussed by the WHO, and they published a report indicating noise limits according to health effects. Combined with the guidelines proposed by previous research, we can observe decibel threshold for some ill heal effects,” said Asst Prof Fan. For example, being exposed to eight continuous hours of noise that exceeds 30dB is likely to cause sleep disruption. The damage escalates when both the duration and loudness are higher; for instance, being exposed to 24 hours of noise over 70dB will cause hearing loss, said Asst Prof Fan.  “When the day-evening-night noise level exceeds 40dB, it may cause annoyance. When the Lden (a descriptor of noise level over a whole day) exceeds 45dB, people may suffer disturbance of concentration and interference with learning. When Lden exceeds 53dB, more severe ill effect such as cardiovascular disease may occur,” said Asst Prof Fan.  In Singapore, the Community Advisory Panel has been set up to engage members of the public to establish “community norms” when it comes to noise as well as facilitate mediation and decision-making at the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal. And if you're in the unfortunate situation of living with a noisy neighbour, you could bring your case to the Community Mediation Centre, which is overseen by the Ministry of Law. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/neurofibromatosis-1-nf1-brown-spots-skin-genetic-cancer-2833466,What it’s like for this 27-year-old to live with brown spots and growths all over her body,"I grew up with brown spots and skin lesions all over my body. When I was younger, the doctors said the brown spots, which were the size of 20- and 50-cent coins, would go away over time. But they didn’t. Instead, they became more pronounced at areas such as my stomach, chest and back, as compared to my face, hands and legs. They weren’t painful and I didn’t think that it could be serious, although it made me feel very self-conscious in primary school. When I went swimming, I would make sure to wear a T-shirt and shorts over my swimsuit. Then, in primary five, I heard my doctors mention a condition called neurofibromatosis 1, also known as NF1 – and it hit me that the brown spots could be linked to a medical condition. Neurofibromatosis is a genetic condition that manifests as skin pigmentation in the form of light brown spots, and nerve tumours that can grow on or under the skin.   In Secondary 3, I became even more self-conscious about the brown spots and skin lesions. It was very hard to explain to people what they were – I just wanted to hide in my own bubble. BEING SELF-CONSCIOUS ABOUT HER APPEARANCE  As women, we are always self-conscious about our appearance, and the pigmentation and skin lesions make me more so. Going to the beach is beyond my comfort zone – I can never picture myself in a swimming costume. I still need the security of my “comfort clothing”, which are typically T-shirt and shorts, and I avoid going swimming.  I would also avoid wearing revealing clothes and make sure that I wear enough to cover the areas I feel more self-conscious about. What it is: NF1 is part of a group of genetic conditions called neurofibromatosis, said Associate Professor Joanne Ngeow, Senior Consultant at the Division of Medical Oncology, and the head of Cancer Genetics Service at the National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS).  As a whole, NF is a highly under-diagnosed condition in Singapore, said Assoc Prof Ngeow. Aside from NF1, the most common form, there are two other types of NF – NF2 and schwannomatosis.  Risk factors: Assoc Prof Ngeow said that about half of all NF cases inherit the condition from their parents, while the other half is a result of a spontaneous mutation of the NF1 or NF2 genes during conception. All individuals who have NF have a 50 per cent chance of passing it onto their children. It does not skip generations, and can affect both males and females from all ethnicities.  People with NF1 also have an increased risk of cancers, such as breast cancer and brain cancer. Incidence rates in Singapore: NCCS’ Cancer Genetics Service currently manages about 30 families with NF1. “We expect the incidence rate of NF1 individuals to be 1:3000 in our local population, similar to that of other populations globally,” said Assoc Prof Ngeow.  Symptoms: Only a physician can make a formal diagnosis of NF1, and the patient must meet two or more of the following criteria:  “The severity of symptoms can range from extremely mild to severe, and can vary within individuals of the same family as well. There is no way to predict who will have a mild case or who will develop more serious symptoms, but the majority of individuals (60 per cent) usually experience minor symptoms,” said Assoc Prof Ngeow.  Screening, management and treatment: There is no cure for NF, she said, but the symptoms can be managed; and the sooner it’s done, the better the outcome.  “As NF1 can affect different parts of the body… doctors and healthcare professionals from different specialties may be involved in the care of NF1 patients, which may include dermatologists, neurologists, ophthalmologists, orthopaedists, oncologists, cardiologists and genetic counsellors,” said Assoc Prof Ngeow.  She added that anyone who has features suggestive of NF should consider further assessment with a genetics service. You can ask your primary doctor for a referral for genetic counselling, to confirm the presence of a genetic condition within the family, if any. It usually involves a one-time blood test. Depending on the symptoms and signs associated with NF1, screening and treatment include annual physical and eye examinations, the option of surgically removing benign nerve tumours and surveillance for children with a type of skin lesion called xanthogranulomas. WORRYING ABOUT CANCER Within the last two to three years, I’ve begun to notice lumps on my arms, back and chest, which worry me.  Then, in late 2021, I developed severe aches in my shoulders and neck. The pain got so bad that I had difficulty lifting my left arm, which is my dominant arm. I went to the Accident & Emergency Department, where doctors found that an artery in my neck was inflamed and compressing on a nerve.  The neurologist told me that the nerve was too near the spinal cord – so surgery (to relieve the pressure in the artery) was not suitable. I was prescribed medication to manage the pain and bring down the inflammation of the artery, and had to undergo physiotherapy to rebuild my muscle. Thanks to the medication and physiotherapy, the pain went away after a few weeks, and my left arm went back to normal.  However, the neurologist suspected that the inflamed artery could be due to NF1 and advised me to go for genetic testing at NCCS. Until then, while I was aware that my condition could be NF1, it had never been officially diagnosed.  I went for genetic testing in February this year, hoping to understand the underlying cause of the different conditions I’ve had since young, including dyslexia and a rare vascular disorder which reduces blood flow to the brain. The genetic test confirmed that I have NF1, just as what my parents and I have long suspected.   The genetic counsellor explained that because it’s a genetic condition, there’s a 50-50 chance of my passing on the NF1 gene to my future children. My parents don’t have the condition, so my NF1 was caused by a spontaneous gene mutation during conception.  She also explained the possibility of more medical problems. As NF1 can cause tumours to grow on the nerves in the spinal cord, brain or other parts of the body, these growths can sometimes become cancerous – so those with NF1 have an increased risk of cancer, including breast and brain cancer.  FINDING ACCEPTANCE AND LIVING BRAVELY I am 27 years old and currently single. I have no plans for marriage yet, although I’d be lying if I say that I don’t worry about my brown spots – there are certain times in a relationship where I feel self-conscious about them.  In my past relationships, I have never been shamed for the brown spots, and I know that the right partner will not shame me for it. I live a pretty normal life, even with NF1. I work as a digital marketing specialist, and I enjoy activities with my friends and family. I have many things to be thankful for, including my family, who has always been supportive. My parents and siblings have never made me feel different, and because of that, I have felt very loved. Having that psychological and emotional support has been very helpful.   After the diagnosis, I feel more empowered as I now know what to expect, and can better manage the symptoms and what to look out for. My own acceptance of NF1 has allowed me to feel more comfortable about it – it’s believing that you are more than just your appearance. You don’t want the world to only like you for the way you look.   The doctors told me that while most patients with NF1 will have normal lives, it’s important to look out for growths, such as when they start to pop up, or when they get bigger or abnormally large. These abnormalities are signs to look out for that may point to cancer. And since the compressed nerve incident, I’ve also had to avoid strenuous activities and not carry heavy items to avoid triggering the artery.  The thing about having NF1 is you don’t really know what’s going to happen – the severity of symptoms can range from extremely mild to severe, and there is no way to predict who will have a mild case or who will develop more serious symptoms. Over the years, I’ve learnt to be more gentle with myself. There’s little I can control – growing up with many medical conditions helped me find freedom and joy in life, as I learnt to take things as they come, and trust that all will be well.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/monkeypox-singapore-10th-case-2836666,Singapore reports 10th case of monkeypox infection,"SINGAPORE: Singapore on Tuesday (Jul 26) reported one more case of monkeypox infection, bringing the total number of cases in the country since June to 10. The patient is a 28-year-old Taiwanese man who lives in Singapore and recently returned from Canada, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in an update on its website.  He first developed symptoms on Jul 22, including a fever, headache, muscle aches and pain. He subsequently also developed a rash, said MOH. The man sought medical attention on Tuesday and was admitted to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases the same day, said the ministry. He is in stable condition and contact tracing is ongoing. The man's infection is not linked to any of the earlier monkeypox cases. Monkeypox is a viral disease that is typically self-limiting, with patients recovering within 14 to 21 days. Those who are infected usually experience fever, headache, muscle ache, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills, lethargy and rash. Of the 10 monkeypox cases announced in Singapore since June, five are imported and five are local. None of the cases so far are linked. On Monday, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said that MOH does not recommend the mass vaccination of Singapore’s population against monkeypox, reiterating the ministry’s stance on the viral disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) on Saturday declared the monkeypox outbreak a global health emergency."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/japans-emperor-emeritus-akihito-diagnosed-heart-failure-condition-improved-2835751,"Japan's Emperor Emeritus Akihito diagnosed with heart failure, condition improved","TOKYO: Japan's Emperor Emeritus Akihito, father of the current emperor, received a diagnosis of heart failure last month, but his condition has improved under treatment, an official at the Imperial Household Agency (IHA) said on Tuesday (Jul 26). Akihito, 88, stepped down in 2019 in the first abdication of a Japanese emperor for two centuries, saying that he was not sure he was still up to the demands of the job. Heart failure is a condition in which the heart muscle does not pump blood as well as it should and can be treated. It differs from a heart attack where blood flow to the heart is suddenly blocked. Akihito was diagnosed with heart failure due to a faulty heart valve at the end of June and has been undergoing treatment with medication and through restricting activity and fluid intake since then, an IHA official said. Akihito was diagnosed with heart failure due to a faulty heart valve and has been undergoing treatment with medication and through restricting activity and fluid intake since then, an IHA official said. He began to show symptoms in June and the diagnosis was made this month, according to the official. ""Currently he is living life as usual,"" the official added. Akihito, the son of Hirohito, spent much of his reign working to heal the wounds of a war waged across Asia in his father's name, as well as bringing the monarchy closer to ordinary citizens. He marked the 70th anniversary of World War II's end in 2015 with an expression of ""deep remorse"", a departure from previous remarks, that was seen by some as an effort to cement a legacy of pacifism under threat from conservative Japanese nationalists. ""Looking back at the past, together with deep remorse over the war, I pray that this tragedy of war will not be repeated and together with the people, express my deep condolences for those who fell in battle and in the ravages of war,"" he said on Aug 15, 2015, the 70th anniversary of the war's end. A scientist by avocation, Akihito was the first heir in the Japanese imperial family to marry a commoner, Empress Emerita Michiko, whom he met on a tennis court. The two have three children, including Naruhito, the current emperor. Akihito and Michiko were warmly regarded for their role in comforting the public in tough times, as when they knelt to talk to people at shelters after disasters, an action seen as bringing them closer to the people. Akihito also made an unprecedented TV address to the nation after a March 2011 earthquake and tsunami sparked a nuclear crisis and devastated much of north-east Japan, leaving nearly 20,000 people dead. Heart failure describes a gradual weakening of the heart muscle and is a very common diagnosis, particularly among the elderly, said Gautam Deshpande, a doctor of internal medicine at St Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo. ""It's a very, very liveable condition,"" said Deshpande. ""It's absolutely not surprising for an on-the-go guy and at 88 years old."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/gut-microbiome-transplant-stool-pill-gut-health-2821256,Your poop in capsules: Why this could be the key to solving your future health problems,"Pardon the language but getting your shit together is quite literally what you can do to safeguard your health. Yes, we are talking about human faecal matter – the stuff that you wouldn’t think twice about when you press the flush button.  The same waste that your body produces can now be extracted, processed and banked – and used as a gut microbiome transplant, much like how an organ transplant is performed to replace a failing heart, kidney or liver.  The service that analyses and processes your gut microbiome is now available in Singapore and is offered by AMILI; cryopreserving it for future use is offered by Cordlife.  But why would you need to have a gut microbiome transplanted, you ask? Don’t you already have a microcosm of organisms living inside you, which is why you’re taking probiotics and gut-friendly food such as kombucha, yoghurt and kimchi to keep it balanced?  WHAT IS A GUT MICROBIOME? To answer that, we’ll have to journey into the gut, where you’ll find 30 trillion to 400 trillion micro-organisms such as bacteria, fungi and viruses. These tiny bugs as well as their genes and environment (that is, your gastrointestinal tract) collectively make up the gut microbiome.  “Gut microbiome” is sometimes interchangeably used with “gut microbiota” but there is a difference. The latter refers to just the micro-organisms themselves, and doesn’t include their genomes and environmental conditions.  About 90 per cent of the microbiota in your gastrointestinal tract, which includes the mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine and anus, is made up of bacteria. In fact, there are three to 100 times more bacteria in the gut than there are cells in the human body.  The majority of these single-celled micro-organisms prefer to live in the lower portion of this real estate; it is less acidic and the pace of life is literally slower here than, say, the stomach and small intestine.   WHAT DO THESE GUT MICROBES DO? Your overall microbiota may be tiny (they weigh about 200g in total; comparatively, your heart weighs about 300g) but don't let the lack of heft undermine its importance. In fact, the gut microbiome is regarded as a “supporting organ” because “it plays so many key roles in promoting the smooth daily operations of the human body”, according to Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health. For one, complex carbohydrates such as fibre and starches need the help of the microbiota’s enzymes to get digested. Thanks to these guys’ help, the fermentation of indigestible fibres produces short chain fatty acids that play an important part in “possibly the prevention of chronic diseases, including certain cancers and bowel disorders”, according to Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health. In addition, the same website noted that these fatty acids “may be useful in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea”. A healthy gut microbiome will also protect you from harmful microbes that enter your body through eating or drinking contaminated food or drinks.  “Recent research suggests that microbiota is linked to not only digestive diseases, but also other diseases such as liver disease, cardiovascular disease, obesity, allergies, diabetes and mental disorders,” said Dr Jeremy Lim, the CEO and co-founder of AMILI. The more diverse your microbiota (there are approximately 300 to 500 bacterial species in your gut), the better it is for you. In many studies, trouble typically arises when the microbiota’s diversity decreases. In patients with neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, research has found that their gut microbiome is not as diverse and rich as those from healthy individuals.  Another example is the link between the lack of gut microbe diversity and obesity. When scientists gave mice intestinal microbes from lean and obese human twins, and fed them the same amount of food, those that received bacteria from the heavier twins developed more body fat and a less diverse community of microbes in the gut. The lean mice, on the other hand, had gut microbiomes like the Amazon rainforest.  WHY DO WE NEED TO “BANK” OUR GUT MICROBIOME? Like your fingerprints, everyone has a unique gut microbiome. But unlike your fingerprints, the tiny community in your gut can change – and sometimes, for the worse. Your microbiome starter kit actually comes from your mother’s birth canal during your delivery (if it’s a caesarean section birth, it’ll be through skin contact) and her breast milk. As you grow and increase your interaction with more people and more environments, your personal collection of microbes expands. By age three, your gut microbiota would already be similar to an adult's.  But your microbiota doesn’t stay the same for the rest of your life. Your environment, diet and lifestyle all have an effect on these inhabitants. For instance, the use of antibiotics, eating more highly processed food and being more hygiene-conscious (especially during the COVID-19 pandemic) can affect your gut residents. “The microbiome changes with time and is affected by medication, diseases and ageing,” said Tan Poh Lan, the group CEO and executive director of Cordlife.  This is where saving the best version of your microbiome for future use comes into play. It serves as insurance should you get an infection that requires antibiotics, which could kill off both the good and bad microbes in your colon, and create the opportunity for the bad ones to enter your body and take over.  WHAT DISEASES CAN A GUT MICROBIOME TRANSPLANT HELP? Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile for short) infection (or CDI) gets a mention as it is the most common cause of infectious diarrhoea in healthcare settings globally. In Singapore, the incidence rate is 3.2 out of 1,000 admissions and is more common in males and patients above age 50, according to a study on patients from Singapore General Hospital.  According to the Mayo Clinic, ""people not in care settings or hospitals also can develop CDI. Some strains of the bacterium in the general population may cause serious infections or are more likely to affect younger people"". In fact, some individuals carry C. difficile bacteria in their intestines; they don't get sick but can spread the bacteria. The potentially deadly CDI wreaks havoc on the colon. At its worst, it can lead to life-threatening sepsis in the large intestine; even at its mildest, the infection can give you ""watery diarrhoea three or more times a day for more than a day"", noted the Mayo Clinic website. CDI often occurs four weeks after completing a course of antibiotics, when whatever infection the antibiotics were meant to exterminate, has also wiped out the gut microbiome. Without your body’s sentry, bad bugs such as Clostridioides difficile find their way in. What makes CDI a notable adversary is that it has a high relapse rate – about 20 per cent of cases, according to Harvard Health Publishing. “The risk of yet another relapse is even greater in the weeks following treatment for a recurrent CDI,” noted the website.  Since treating recurrent CDI with antibiotics would enable a relapse, gut microbiome transplant (GMT) or faecal microbiome transplant is used instead. “GMT is a widely accepted treatment for recurrent CDI, with cure rates of up to 90 per cent,” said Dr Lim, who added that GMT is only used on CDI patients currently.  “However, there are more than 290 clinical trials to establish the role of the gut microbiome in over 60 conditions, including allergy, immune system functioning, metabolism, autism and dementia,” he said.  HOW IS THE PRESERVED STOOL USED? Your banked stool would be defrosted and prepared for use in a way best recommended by your doctor. And there are a few ways the GMT can be carried out: Via colonoscopy, nasogastric tube, enema or oral capsules containing the GMT material, said Dr Lim.  If colonoscopy is used, the endoscope is inserted to the predetermined section of the colon and the GMT material is then squirted around the walls of the intestine. “The actual stool transplant is usually completed in under 10 minutes,” he said, while the patient rests still for 90 to 120 minutes. “GMT capsules are even simpler and can be taken in a clinic setting after which patients can simply go home. As the microbiota materials are encapsulated in pill form, they have no taste or odour.” According to Dr Lim, it is optimal to use one’s own GMT but it can also be donated to a family member.  HOW IS THE STOOL PROCESSED? HOW MUCH DOES IT COST? There are two rounds of assessment to clear. First, a health history questionnaire (those with certain infectious diseases or health conditions may not be eligible); then, stool and blood samples are taken for analysis.  After passing the screening, you will be given another stool collection kit – this time, a more elaborate one that prevents stool decomposition and allows for temperature control. This sample will be the one that is preserved, and it should be free of blood, mucus and urine. The Bristol stool score should be less than 5.  At the lab, the stool is filtered to remove any food debris, then concentrated and placed in a sterile bottle that can prevent freezing damage. Once done, the bottle's exterior is disinfected and the bottle is transported to the cryopreservation lab for preservation at around -80 degrees Celsius.  You can expect to pay S$5,500 (before GST) for 10 years of storage, inclusive of screening. “Once stool samples are banked and frozen, a person’s gut microbiome should be viable for a lifetime,” said Tan. “We are only offering 10 years of storage because this is a new service. We will review the number of storage years to offer as the service matures.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/thyroid-disorder-hypothyroidism-hyperthyroidism-symptoms-treatment-2806936,Thyroid disease: Women are 5 times more likely to get it than men - here's how to spot the signs,"Five years ago, when she was a 21-year-old student, Lee Mun Ling came down with a niggling flu that wouldn’t go away – a rare occurrence as she seldom fell sick. At the hospital, the doctors suspected dengue fever and so a blood test was carried out. The results were negative for dengue, but they uncovered other problems. For one, her blood pressure was sky-high even though she had no heart disease. Also, her heart rate was through the roof. Alarmed, the doctors put her in the trauma ward and performed more tests. Lee said: “Eventually, they told me I had hyperthyroid caused by Graves’ disease, an autoimmune condition.”  After two years of daily oral medication to control her over-active thyroid, she was healthy for a year. But then she had a relapse. “The medication failed to fix the problem the second time round. And so the doctors suggested radioactive iodine treatment, which is basically to kill the thyroid gland,” she said.    WHAT IS THYROID DISORDER? Dr Kathleen Sek, an endocrinology consultant with National University Hospital as well as the Fast and Chronic programmes at Alexandra Hospital, explained that the thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped organ located at the base of the neck. It makes, stores and releases thyroid hormones into the blood, hence regulating metabolism. “Thyroid hormones influence how fast the body produces and uses energy. Your brain, heart, blood vessels, liver, muscles, skin and reproductive system all require thyroid hormones to function normally,” she said.  A disorder can occur when there is an abnormality in the gland’s structure, such as a growth, or in the amount of hormones it secretes.  Though thyroid disorder can take different forms, Dr Sek said the two most common ones are hyperthyroidism – where the thyroid gland releases too much thyroid hormones – and hypothyroidism, where it doesn’t produce enough of it. Between the two types of disorders, she felt hypothyroidism is likely more common – an observation shared by Dr Adoree Lim, an endocrinology consultant at Singapore General Hospital.  “We do not have local data on the prevalence of all thyroid conditions in Singapore. However, we expect them to be similar to that in many other parts of the world,” said Dr Lim.  In the United States, said Dr Sek, it is estimated that 1.2 per cent of the population have hyperthyroidism, while up to 5 per cent have hypothyroidism.  THE CAUSES OF THYROID DISORDER There are various triggers for thyroid disorder, the most common of which, said Dr Sek, are autoimmune disorders. “Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system produces antibodies against normal tissue in the body. It is not known why this happens, but there appears to be a genetic link, and thyroid disorders commonly run in the family,” she said.  Dr Lim explained that hypothyroidism is often due to the autoimmune disorder known as Hashimoto’s disease, while hyperthyroidism results from Graves’ disease. She said: “With Hashimoto’s disease, antibodies produced by our own white blood cells target the thyroid gland, gradually destroying its ability to produce thyroid hormone.  “As for Grave’s disease,  the antibodies overstimulate the thyroid gland, causing it to produce too much thyroid hormone.” WOMEN ARE MORE AT RISK: THYROID DISEASE SYMPTOMS TO WATCH FOR Although thyroid conditions can occur in both men and women of all ages, Dr Sek said women are five times more likely to get thyroid disorders compared to men. In addition, hyperthyroidism more commonly afflicts younger women. Signs of hyperthyroidism include weight loss despite a good appetite, often feeling hot or anxious, a fast pulse, tremors, and frequent bowel movements.  Baddariah binte Mohd Karim, a 42-year-old mother-of-three, recounted experiencing these exact symptoms barely a year after the birth of her third child.  “My hands trembled all the time, I was sweating a lot, passing motion often and losing weight. Because my heart was beating so fast, I had difficulty sleeping, which then resulted in fatigue. When my blood test results came back, they showed my thyroid level was seven times higher than normal,” she said.  Hypothyroidism has the opposite symptoms. The body’s metabolism slows down and individuals may put on weight despite a reduced appetite, feel cold and tired, or be constipated. They may also experience dry skin, hair loss and leg cramps.  In addition to all the above symptoms, which are common to both genders, Dr Sek said women may also experience abnormal menstrual periods, have difficulty conceiving or have recurrent miscarriages. You may also notice swelling or a lump in your neck, which could be a sign of both hyper- and hypothyroidism – although doctors would also look out for other symptoms such as tremors, and weight and appetite changes in the diagnosis. However, Dr Lim noted that many of these signs are not specific to thyroid disorder and may be experienced by otherwise normal individuals.  “The best way to diagnose both hyper- and hypothyroidism is by performing a blood test which measures the levels of the thyroid hormone and the antibody known as TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone),” she advised.  Such was the case for 44-year-old Celine Tan, who had a bout of mild hypothyroidism in her early twenties. “I was lethargic and had slight hair thinning and weight gain. But the symptoms were mild so it was almost impossible to guess the problem. They were also very generic and could be due to other ailments,” she said. Thinking it wasn’t serious, she didn’t see a doctor.  “It was only when I was in Canada for a student exchange that I went to the university doctors because I was feeling so out of sorts. They quickly diagnosed that I had thyroid issues,” said Tan.  HOW THYROID DISEASE IS TREATED Dr Lim said there are three main ways of treating hyperthyroidism: Oral medication, radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, or thyroid surgery. All three methods work to decrease the production of thyroid hormones. She elaborated: “During RAI therapy, a small dose of radioactive iodine is ingested and absorbed by thyroid cells – the only cells in our body that take up iodine. The radioactivity destroys the thyroid cells slowly over time.” Thyroid surgery involves removing most of the thyroid gland. Dr Lim explained that the treatment is recommended if the swelling of the gland is big and cosmetically unattractive for the patient. It is also used if there is a concern about cancer in the thyroid. For hypothyroidism, patients are treated with supplements of the thyroid hormone, thyroxine. “This is given as a small pill daily, has very few side effects and almost no allergic reactions. Once the dose of thyroxine you require has been established, it is usually stable for life except during pregnancy,” she said.  As low levels of thyroid hormone during pregnancy may harm the baby or cause miscarriages, the doctor will have to adjust the dosage of thyroxine. THYROID DISORDER TREAMENT: KNOCK-ON EFFECTS AND IMPLICATIONS Both Dr Sek and Dr Lim said that adverse effects from anti-thyroid medication are rare, though not unheard of. But it is long-term or untreated thyroid disorders that are the real causes for concern.  “Untreated hyperthyroidism can cause abnormal heart rhythms such as fast, irregular heart rate, heart failure in the long run, or a severe, dangerous form of hyperthyroidism known as a thyroid storm. It can also worsen osteoporosis,” said Dr Lim. For women planning to have children, Dr Sek emphasised that it is essential to ensure normal thyroid function prior to conceiving.  She warned: “Poorly controlled maternal hyperthyroidism is associated with miscarriage, pregnancy-induced hypertension, prematurity, low birth weight, intrauterine growth restriction, stillbirth, thyroid storm and maternal heart failure.”  Maternal hypothyroidism, too, needs to be well managed, she added. “Otherwise, it has been linked to an increased risk of adverse pregnancy complications, such as premature birth, low birth weight, pregnancy loss and lower offspring intelligence quotient.” Even RAI treatment and thyroid surgery, while seeming to nip the problem of hyperthyroidism once and for all, can have wider implications.  Dr Lim said both these treatments carry the risk of causing hypothyroidism instead.  “This happens because too many thyroid cells are destroyed or most of the gland is removed, so there is insufficient thyroid hormone produced,” she explained. Although she said hypothyroidism is easily diagnosed and treated with thyroid hormone replacement, some patients do report difficulties during their adjustment period. Baddariah said her metabolism became very low after RAI treatment, causing her to feel sluggish easily. She also experienced brain fog and mood swings. Similarly, Lee said she felt unmotivated and had no energy to carry out many normal activities, while her yoyo-ing weight added to feelings of mild depression.  “Although the doctors did advise me of the potential side effects, I had a hard time adjusting after undergoing RAI therapy. I was under the impression the side effects would be mild, but they turned out more severe than I expected,” she said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/tinnitus-ringing-buzzing-sound-ears-deep-sleep-brain-2775176,Commentary: Sleep may be the key to understanding and treating tinnitus,"OXFORD: Around 15 per cent of the world’s population suffers from tinnitus, a condition which causes someone to hear a sound (such as ringing or buzzing) without any external source. It’s often associated with hearing loss. Not only can the condition be annoying for sufferers, but it can also have a serious effect on mental health, often causing stress or depression. This is especially the case for patients suffering from tinnitus over months or years. There’s currently no cure for tinnitus. So, finding a way to better manage or treat it could help many millions of people worldwide. One area of research that may help us better understand tinnitus is sleep. There are many reasons for this: First, tinnitus is a phantom percept. This is when our brain activity makes us see, hear or smell things that aren’t there.  Most people only experience phantom perceptions when they’re asleep. But for people with tinnitus, they hear phantom sounds while they’re awake. The second reason is that tinnitus alters brain activity, with certain areas of the brain (such as those involved in hearing) potentially being more active than they should be. This may also explain how phantom percepts happen. When we sleep, activity in these same brain areas also changes. Our recent research review has identified a couple of brain mechanisms that underlie both tinnitus and sleep. Better understanding these mechanisms – and the way the two are connected – could one day help us find ways of managing and treating tinnitus. When we fall asleep, our body experiences multiple stages of sleep. One of the most important stages of sleep is slow-wave sleep (also known as deep sleep), which is thought to be the most restful stage of sleep. During slow-wave sleep, brain activity moves in distinctive “waves” through the different areas of the brain, activating large areas together (such as those involved in memory and processing sounds) before moving on to others.  It’s thought that slow-wave sleep allows the brain’s neurons (specialised brain cells which send and receive information) to recover from daily wear and tear, while also helping sleep make us feel rested. It’s also thought to be important for our memory. Not every area of the brain experiences the same amount of slow-wave activity. It’s most pronounced in areas we use most while awake, such as those important for motor function and sight. But sometimes, certain brain areas can be overactive during slow-wave sleep. This is what happens in sleep disorders such as sleepwalking. A similar thing may happen in people with tinnitus. We think that hyperactive brain regions might stay awake in the otherwise sleeping brain. This would explain why many people with tinnitus experience disturbed sleep and night terrors more often than people who don’t have tinnitus. Tinnitus patients also spend more time in light sleep. Simply put, we believe that tinnitus keeps the brain from producing the slow-wave activity needed to have a deep sleep, resulting in light and interrupted sleep. But even though tinnitus patients have less deep sleep on average than people without tinnitus, the research we looked at in our review suggests that some deep sleep is hardly affected by tinnitus. This may be because the brain activity that happens during the deepest sleep actually suppresses tinnitus. There are a couple of ways the brain may be able to suppress tinnitus during deep sleep. The first has to do with the brain’s neurons.  After a long period of wakefulness, neurons in the brain are thought to switch into slow-wave activity mode to recover. The more neurons in this mode together, the stronger the drives for the rest of the brain to join in. We know that the drive for sleep can get strong enough that neurons in the brain will eventually go into slow-wave activity mode. And since this especially applies to brain regions overactive during wakefulness, we think that tinnitus might be suppressed as a result of that. Slow-wave activity has also been shown to interfere with the communication between brain areas. During deepest sleep, when slow-wave activity is strongest, this may keep hyperactive regions from disturbing other brain areas and interrupting sleep. This would explain why people with tinnitus can still enter deep sleep, and why tinnitus may be suppressed during that time. Sleep is also important for strengthening our memory, by helping to drive changes in connections between neurons in the brain. We believe that changes in brain connectivity during sleep are contributing to what makes tinnitus last for a long time after an initial trigger (such as hearing loss). We already know that the intensity of tinnitus can change throughout a given day. Investigating how tinnitus changes during sleep could give us a direct handle on what the brain does to cause fluctuations in tinnitus intensity. It also means that we may be able to manipulate sleep to improve the well-being of patients – and possibly develop new treatments for tinnitus.  For example, sleep disruptions can be reduced and slow-wave activity can be boosted through sleep restriction paradigms, where patients are told to only go to bed when they’re actually tired. Boosting the intensity of sleep could help us better see the effect sleep has on tinnitus. While we suspect that deep sleep is the most likely to affect tinnitus, there are many other stages of sleep that happen (such as rapid eye movement, or REM sleep) – each with unique patterns of brain activity.  In future research, both the sleep stage and tinnitus activity in the brain could be tracked at the same time by recording brain activity. This may help to find out more about the link between tinnitus and sleep and understand how tinnitus may be alleviated by natural brain activity.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/you-wont-live-longer-diet-or-exercise-alone-says-study-2825406,You won’t live longer by diet or exercise alone says study,"Health food or exercise alone isn’t enough to prevent chronic disease, new research shows. Contrary to popular belief, you can’t outrun the toll of a poor diet – and healthy eating, on its own, won’t ward off disease. Most people know that working out and eating well are critical components of overall health. But a sweeping study published this week in the British Journal of Sports Medicine suggests that hitting the gym won’t counteract the consequences of consuming fat-laden foods, and mainlining kale can’t cancel out sedentary habits. “Sensationalised headlines and misleading advertisement for exercise regimens to lure consumers into the idea of ‘working out to eat whatever they want’ have fueled circulation of the myth about ‘exercise outrunning a bad diet,’” the study authors wrote. Previous as well as a few human ones have backed this up, suggesting that, at least in the short term, strenuous exercise can counteract the effects of overeating. So an international team of researchers examined data from nearly 350,000 participants collected from the UK Biobank, an enormous medical database with health information from people across Britain, and followed up over a decade-long period. The study participants, median age 57, were healthy at the outset of the study, meaning they were not diagnosed with conditions like cardiovascular disease, cancer or chronic pain. Analysing self-reported questionnaires, the experts broke people’s diets down by quality. For instance, high-quality diets had at least 4.5 cups of fruit and vegetables per day, two or more servings of fish per week, less than two servings of processed meats per week and no more than five servings of red meat per week. The study did not measure discretionary foods like soft drinks or desserts, said Melody Ding, the lead author of the study and an associate professor at the University of Sydney. The researchers also measured activity levels using responses from another questionnaire that asked about the total minutes participants spent walking and engaging in moderate physical activity, like carrying light loads or biking at a steady pace, and vigorous physical activity that lasted more than 10 minutes at a time. The authors wrote that it was the first study to examine diet and exercise alongside both general mortality and specific lethal diseases, like cancer. Not surprisingly, people with both higher levels of physical activity and better quality diets had the lowest mortality risk. Overall physical activity levels were associated with a lower mortality risk, but those who regularly engaged in vigorous exercise – the kind that makes you break a sweat – had a particularly lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality. And even just 10 to 75 minutes per week made a difference. Regardless of your diet, Dr Ding said, “physical activity is important. And whatever your physical activity is, diet is important.” “Any amount of exercise is protective,” said Salvador Portugal, a sports health expert and assistant professor in the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at NYU Langone Health who was not involved in the study. But you can’t rely solely on your workout to maintain good health, he added. These findings underscore what many doctors have seen in practice, said Dr Tamanna Singh, co-director of the Sports Cardiology Center at Cleveland Clinic who was not involved with the study. For instance, she said, there are many components of heart health, and “optimizing one thing is not going to necessarily improve your cardiovascular risk.” She sees patients who classify themselves as amateur or professional athletes and are shocked when they suffer cardiovascular events, she said, without considering their diet. “Often they’ll come to me after an event and say, ‘I work out so much. Why did I have a heart attack?’” On the flip side, even those with the most nutritious diets in the study saw considerably worse outcomes without some form of regular fitness regimen. That doesn’t mean people can’t treat themselves after a workout, Dr Singh said. (She’s a marathon runner herself, and she looks forward to nachos after a long run.) “If you are, for the most part, intentional about what you put into your body and intentional with how you move your body, you’re doing enough.” The study highlights the importance of viewing food and exercise as components of holistic health, Dr Ding said, instead of calculating how many miles can “cancel out” a cookie. “It’s not just about burning calories,” she said. “We need to shift that thinking.” By Dani Blum © The New York Times Company The article originally appeared in The New York Times.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/weekend-exercise-requirement-days-activity-health-benefits-2828891,Commentary: Only have time to exercise during weekends? It’s better than nothing,"MIDDLESBROUGH, England: We’re all told time and again just how important it is to exercise for good health. But with our busy schedules, finding the time to work out is often easier said than done. For many of us, the weekend is the only time we can get to the gym or go for a run. UK exercise guidelines suggest that adults should do at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise (or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise) a week for good health. But debate is growing around the issue of whether or not you can still get the benefits of exercise if you squeeze it all in on a weekend (sometimes called “weekend warrior” exercise) instead of spreading it throughout the week. This is what a recent study sought to find out. They found that weekend warrior exercise still has many benefits to health – with the study showing people who only exercise two days a week had lower risk of premature death from any cause, compared to people who do not exercise. But they also found that spreading your workouts throughout the week was associated with the greatest benefits for your health. To conduct their study, the researchers looked at more than 60,000 adults aged 40 and over. Data on the participants was collected by the Health Survey for England and the Scottish Health Survey between 1994 and 2012. Participants were also asked about their exercise habits. Participants were then categorised as being a “weekend warrior” (meeting recommended activity guidelines over a minimum one to two days per week), “regularly active” (meeting recommended activity guidelines over a minimum of three days per week), “insufficiently active” (exercising less than recommended) or “inactive”. Using data from the surveys and The British National Health Service Central Registry for Deaths, the authors then compared how many from each category had died during the study. Weekend warrior exercisers had a 30 per cent lower risk of premature death from all causes compared to inactive people. Risk of death from cardiovascular disease was also around 40 per cent lower, while risk of death from all types of cancer was around 18 per cent lower compared to those who were inactive. Of course, regularly active people had the best health overall – and had a 5 per cent lower risk of premature death from any cause compared to weekend warriors. This finding is consistent with previous research, which suggests the more exercise you do, the more beneficial it is to your health. But this is only true up to a certain point – with research showing that doing more than five times the minimum recommended weekly activity (the equivalent of around 12.5 hours of moderately exercise, or just over six hours of vigorous activity) has no added benefits. It’s well-known that exercise improves our cardiorespiratory fitness, which is important for making sure our heart and lungs function effectively. Not only does this allow us to exercise longer and more intensely, it also improves other aspects of our health – such as lowering blood pressure. This is also likely the reason research shows people who exercise regularly have lower risk of premature death from any cause. Exercise also lowers body fat and reduces inflammation, which may all explain why physical activity reduces risk of death from cancer. But research shows that how often you exercise is also important for improving and maintaining fitness. In fact, as little as 72 hours between workouts is enough for “detraining” to happen. This refers to the partial or complete loss of training adaptations (such as better cardiovascular function) that happens when we stop exercising. While some detraining is likely to happen in people who only exercise on weekends, consistently training – even if it’s only on weekends – will still lead to adaptations that are good for health. While this research gives hope to those who can’t exercise regularly, it must be interpreted with caution. The study has limitations, as acknowledged by the authors. The data was self-reported by participants, some of whom may have embellished the amount of exercise they really did. Also, the amount of exercise participants reported on only referred to the amount they did in the four weeks prior to the interview, which might not actually represent how much they did for the duration of the 20-year study. The researchers also excluded the physical activity a person did as part of their job. This is relevant as it can also contribute to lower risk of death from disease. The key message from this study is that doing some physical activity is better than doing nothing. So if you can only get your workouts in on weekends, you’re still likely to have better health compared to someone who does not exercise regularly. But the more regular physical activity you can do, the better. Exercise, combined with a proper diet, is essential for good health. Adding in resistance training (such as weight lifting) alongside cardio may help further boost the benefits of exercise on your health.

Don’t try to get it out yourself, says a doctor","What should you do if a cockroach crawled inside your ear? We don’t know about you, but our reaction would be to get it out now!  That was exactly what a young woman in Singapore did when a sizeable cockroach (about 4cm) got into her ear while she was sleeping. In the TikTok video she posted, she recounted initially feeling its legs tickling the outside of her ear and when she “whacked it really hard”, it escaped into the only opening it could find: Her ear. Her first instinct was to run into the bathroom, fill a bottle-cap full of mouthwash and pour it into her ear. Luckily for her, the mouthwash did manage to drown the cockroach, she said, but she could still hear the “crackling” of the insect’s remains.  So she tried to pull out the dead bug out with a pair of tweezers. She recounted in a TikTok video: ""Yo guys, like, I broke it into, like, pieces. So when some of it came out right, the white guts came out, and like the skin of the cockroach – the f******, like oh my god, the brown shell came out"".  The rest of the cockroach was removed “leg by leg” at the hospital using specialised tools, she said.  MY EAR IS BUGGED! So how common is this scenario? Apparently, it's not as rare as you think.  “I’ve seen a few such cases and they tend to occur during sleep,” said Dr Lim Keng Hua, an otorhinolaryngologist and ENT specialist at Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre’s Ear, Nose Throat, Head & Neck Surgery. “The most recent was a man who came into the A&E late last year with ear pain. He was sleeping on the floor and a cockroach crawled into his ear.” If you ever find yourself in such a situation, don’t try to get the bug out yourself as much as you’re dying to, said Dr Lim.  “When an insect such as a cockroach crawls into a dead end such as your ear, it can’t reverse. It is very likely to play dead and stay still,” he said.  You won’t be the only one panicking in such tight situations. “If you touch the cockroach with tweezers, it will scramble. Then, it’s likely to cause damage to the eardrum and ear canal. You want to prevent the insect from moving.” Moreover, your home tweezers are not going to be very useful as specialised tools such as micro-forceps and suction tools are used for such extractions, according to Dr Lim. Even with such tools, the cockroach is often removed in two or three pieces, “sometimes more”, he said.  And certainly don’t pour anything into the ear, least of all, mouthwash. “We use alcoholic ear drops to kill the insect and prevent it from moving” and although mouthwash can contain alcohol, it is not a suitable solution for pouring down the ear, said Dr Lim.  Home remedies such as olive oil or baby oil are not advised either. “The oil makes everything slippery, which makes it harder to extract the insect,” said Dr Lim. Instead, keep your ear dry. Your best move? Go to the A&E, pronto. If a general practitioner's clinic is nearer to you than a hospital’s A&E, get yourself there. Before leaving, take a painkiller to help you with the ear pain, advised Dr Lim.  ""It is an emergency and you should get yourself medically checked,"" he said, even if the pain has subsided. ""Any organic material left in the ear canal can lead to infection."" Sometimes, though, that itchy, scratchy feeling that makes you suspect the worst could be caused by your earwax. “Remember that your ears are self-cleaning. When the wax ‘rolls’ out of the ear canal, it may feel itchy,” said Dr Lim. "

And since Beyonce credited her fierce, post-twins bod in 2018 to a 22-day vegan diet, the image of the superstar performing at Coachella might still be on your shopping list when you’re at FairPrice picking up groceries.  You don’t have to look further than your very own smart phone or tablet to know the immense influence celebrities hold over us. Chances are, you’re already following a couple of famous people on social media, or regularly checking in on their podcasts or livestreams.  Suffice it to say, celebrities can exert a tremendous amount of influence on “the knowledge we retain, the attitudes we adopt and the decisions we make, including those that affect our health”, according to this study. Take, for instance, former NBA basketball player Earvin “Magic” Johnson’s HIV-positive announcement in 1991. It altered the narrative that the infection was only limited to drug users and homosexuals.  When actress Angelina Jolie wrote about her elective double mastectomy in The New York Times in 2013, the number of screenings for the BRCA1 gene increased months later. Singer Selena Gomez’s ongoing journey to better health highlights what it means to live with lupus – and what the autoimmune disease is, in the first place, including her kidney transplant. On the flip side, the health information that celebrities dispense has also been criticised for being biased or could lead to irrational behaviour. Beyonce, for example, was called out by experts for advocating a restrictive diet, while Jolie’s op-ed led some women, who weren’t suitable candidates, to seek double mastectomies.  One thing, though, is that lesser-known chronic illnesses (heard of ankylosing spondylitis?), which are long-term medical conditions that require treatment over long periods of time, often years, get discussed and demystified. And in doing so, it lessens the stigma and provides the support to those who are also in the same boat. In that spirit, here’s a look at some famous people and the health issues they grapple with. MARTINE CAJUCOM-HO, 38, INFLUENCER Diagnosis: Ramsay Hunt syndrome Like Justin Bieber, the Filipino “it” girl was also diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome – two years before the Canadian singer. What made it worse for the mother of one was that the symptoms showed up on the morning before the planned caesarean section of her daughter Penelope.  “The morning before my planned Caesarian (sic) birth to Penelope, I woke up with the left side completely paralyzed. I was brushing my teeth and noticed the water just spilling out and that I was unable to blink. I thought I might be having a stroke actually,” the co-founder of eyewear brand Sunnies Studios posted on Instagram Story. “I was rushed to the doctor and was then diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt Syndrome (aka shingles/adult chicken pox).”  Cajucom-Ho shared that she was part of the “unlucky bunch with more severe nerve damage” and that she would “never have the same motor function” of her face again. Despite seeing many western and eastern doctors, specialists and physical therapists, “I have been told to expect that I will never be able to smile the same again or have the same facial mobility”. But the creative director isn’t about to let her inability to smile get in her way of returning to her life: “It’s been a weird and reflective journey rebuilding my confidence and feeling comfortable looking at myself in the mirror and even being on camera again but I’m working towards that every day.” HYUNA, 30, SINGER Diagnosis: Vasovagal syncope Fans of the K-pop singer already knew that something was wrong when HyunA aka Kim Hyun-ah postponed the release of her single Good Girl as well as her full studio album in August 2020. A year before, the I’m Not Cool singer had taken to Instagram to talk about her health situation that is vasovagal syncope.  Vasovagal syncope occurs when the part of your nervous system that regulates heart rate and blood pressure malfunctions in response to a trigger, according to Mayo Clinic. These triggers can be as innocuous as the sight of blood, extreme emotional distress, standing for long periods of time, heat and even straining during a bowel movement. Although there isn’t a treatment for vasovagal syncope and it is harmless, the falling could result in injuries.  HyunA, who has been receiving treatment for depression and panic disorder since 2016, thought the fainting episodes were “a symptom of my panic disorder too and ignored it”. She’d also kept her medical conditions under wraps for fear that her career would end if the public knew. “I wanted to be on stage but I was worried that if I kept falling, if people knew that I’m sick, then maybe they wouldn’t want to have me perform,” she wrote on Instagram. The decision to come clean about her health (perhaps buoyed by the deaths of fellow K-pop stars Sulli and Goo Hara) was met with empathy and support from her fans. On the South Korean talk show Yoo Hee-yeol's Sketchbook a year after disclosing her situation on social media, HyunA shared that “many people cheered me on”. “There were many people who empathised with me and shared that they felt the same way as I did.""  LAY ZHANG, 30, SINGER-RAPPER Diagnosis: Haemophilia The EXO member is said to have haemophilia, which is an inherited bleeding disorder. It occurs when the blood lacks a clotting factor (either Factor VIII in Haemophilia A or Factor IX in Haemophilia B) and is a lifelong condition that affects more males than females. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), haemophilia occurs in about one of every 5,000 male births.  The gender bias has to do with the chromosomes. The blood disorder is caused by the haemophilia gene found on the X chromosome, which both sexes carry. More specifically, males only have one copy of the X chromosome (XY), whereas females have two copies (XX).  Here’s where the number of X chromosome matters: A male only has to inherit an affected X chromosome to develop haemophilia, while a female has to inherit two copies; if she only has one affected X chromosome, she’ll be a carrier and can pass on the affected X chromosome but will not develop haemophilia herself.  The Chinese singer-rapper has not confirmed that he does indeed have haemophilia, although fans have surfaced pictures and videos of him bleeding on stage. Losing large amounts of blood is, of course, not a good thing following external injuries or surgery – least of all, internal bleeding, which can occur in the joints (chronic joint disease and pain) and in the head and brain (seizures, paralysis and even death).  That’s not all the trouble for those with haemophilia. According to the CDC, patients who are treated with factor concentrates to help control bleeding episodes, often develop an antibody known as an inhibitor. Over time, the body mistakes the factor for a foreign substance and tries to destroy it with an inhibitor, rendering the treatment ineffective.  For this reason, patients receiving factor treatments are required to be tested yearly for inhibitors. Various inhibitor treatments are available and the right one can be prescribed by the specialist.  LADY GAGA, 36, SINGER-SONGWRITER Diagnosis: Fibromyalgia  If you’ve watched the Netflix documentary, Five Foot Two, you’d have caught Lady Gaga aka Stefani Germanotta struggling with pain caused by fibromyalgia in several scenes – all of which, she said, stemmed from her broken hip in 2013.  In one segment, where she is getting massaged, the Born This Way singer said that if she got depressed, her body would go into a full-body spasm. The singer was also shown crying with pain on the couch just as she was about to perform for Tony Bennett’s birthday.  While rehearsing for the Super Bowl 51 halftime show, she had to pause and scream into a pillow as someone works on her hip. In a doctor’s office, Gaga admitted: “I have chased this pain for five years”. (The documentary debuted in 2017, so it has been 10 years to date.) Fibromyalgia is often associated with muscular pain, joint stiffness and fatigue as well as anxiety and depression, according to HealthXChange. The causes of fibromyalgia are unclear but the symptoms can be triggered by emotional or physical stress as seen in Gaga’s case.  As debilitating as the syndrome is, fibromyalgia is somewhat controversial as 87 per cent of rheumatologists in Southeast Asia believe that it is a mixture of medical and psychological illness; 9 per cent think fibromyalgia is primarily a psychological illness.  “Fibromyalgia is also often misunderstood by the people around the patient,” said Dr Tan Kian Hian, the director of the Pain Management Centre and a senior consultant at Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Anaesthesiology, on HealthXChange. “In fact, family, friends and colleagues may not believe that the patient is actually sick.” But sufferers would be glad to know that “fibromyalgia is increasingly being recognised as a medical condition”, said Dr Tan.  Still, that doesn’t make diagnosis easy as the symptoms vary widely from patient to patient. “Many medical conditions, like low thyroid hormone levels, muscle diseases and cancer, can also cause pain in different parts of the body,” said Dr Tan.  Treatment is another challenge – there is no medicine specifically for fibromyalgia. Painkillers and antidepressants may be prescribed, and lifestyle changes such as adopting moderate exercise, healthy eating and stress management may further help patients to cope. Some sufferers may also opt for alternative therapies such as acupuncture and massage.  DAN REYNOLDS, 35, SINGER  Diagnosis: Ankylosing spondylitis Imagine Dragons may be known for hits such as Believer and Thunder but not so when it comes to health matters. So when frontman Dan Reynolds picked up the microphone in England's Leeds Arena in 2015, fans weren’t expecting what he said next.  “I have something called ankylosing spondylitis (AS). It’s an autoimmune disease. I’ve never spoken about it because, to be frank with you, I’ve been embarrassed. And tonight, I’m gonna share it because there’s probably other people out there who suffer from it, too,” said Reynolds.  In an interview with Healthline, the lead singer said: “I was diagnosed with AS in my early 20s, so I’ve been dealing with [it] quite a while. It’s been a frustrating process and also educating for me, I guess. Not a lot of people know about it. It’s super hard to pronounce. It’s such a hidden disease that hasn’t been in the mainstream”.  The initial signs surfaced when Reynolds was hiking along a canyon in Los Angeles; he'd felt a deep, stabbing pain in his thigh joints and hips. “It made no sense. I had no point of injury,” he told Healthline. “Over the next week, it got worse and worse. At nighttime it was bad. Then, in the morning, I would have bad morning stiffness for hours, to the extent where I wouldn’t want to get out of bed.”  A year later, the doctors still had no answer for him – until a rheumatologist finally diagnosed him with AS. He was 24 then. AS is an arthritic condition that affects the joints of the spine and causes inflammation, severe pain and stiffness in the back, according to the National Arthritis Foundation (NAF) in Singapore. As it progresses, the inflamed spinal joints may fuse together and lock the spine in a bent position. Sometimes, other joints such as the hips and knees may also be affected.  According to the NAF, the first signs of AS are pain and stiffness in the lower back, especially in the morning when getting out of bed. “This is quite different from back strain which is better after rest. As the condition progresses, the pain can affect the entire spine and last the whole day,” noted the website.  The cause of AS is still unknown, highlighted the NAF, although there is a strong link to the HLA-B27 gene. “Generally, AS affects one in 1,000 people, mainly young people from the ages of 15 to 35. Men are 10 times more prone to develop the condition than women.” Like fibromyalgia, there is no treatment for AS. Medication to manage the pain and inflammation is usually used. Good posture, physiotherapy and swimming are also recommended to help reduce the stiffness and strengthen the back. "

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/what-prosopagnosia-brad-pitts-face-blindness-condition-2802736,"What is prosopagnosia, Brad Pitt's ‘face blindness’ condition?","The actor Brad Pitt said in a recent interview that he has prosopagnosia, a rare neurological disorder commonly referred to as face blindness. While Pitt, 58, has never been formally diagnosed with the condition, he said in an interview with GQ that he had struggled for years to recognise people’s faces. In 2013, he told Esquire that his inability to recognise people’s faces had become so severe that he often wanted to isolate himself as a result. “That’s why I stay home,” he said. The Times spoke to experts about the symptoms and causes of the condition and treatments for it. WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF PROSOPAGNOSIA? The condition is not related to memory loss, vision impairment or learning disabilities, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Prosopagnosia is only face blindness, not colour blindness or overall visual impairment, said Dr Borna Bonakdarpour, behavioural neurologist at Northwestern Medicine. It is not the same as forgetfulness or sometimes struggling to find the right word. Prosopagnosia varies in severity; some people with the condition may have trouble recognising a familiar face, like a friend or family member, while others may not even be able to identify their own reflections. Some people may be unable to differentiate between faces and objects. There’s also evidence that suggests people with prosopagnosia may become chronically anxious or depressed because of the isolation and fear that come with the condition. Navigating basic social interactions with prosopagnosia can become fraught, and some people avoid contact with family members and other loved ones out of fear that they will not be able to properly recognise or address them. WHAT CAUSES PROSOPAGNOSIA? People with prosopagnosia tend to fall into two categories: Those who are born with the condition, and those who acquire it later on in life. Research suggests that congenital, or lifelong, prosopagnosia is less common, although estimates show that as many as one in every 50 people may struggle with some lifelong form of the condition, and scientists theorise that it may run in families. “There doesn’t seem to be any obvious structural abnormality” in the brain for those born with the condition, said Dr Andrey Stojic, director of general neurology at the Cleveland Clinic. Because there aren’t clear brain lesions in people with congenital prosopagnosia, scientists aren’t sure what causes it. People who acquire prosopagnosia later in life, by contrast, may have lesions in the brain as a result of a head injury or trauma. People can also acquire the condition after strokes or as they develop Alzheimer’s disease, Bonakdarpour said. IS THERE A TREATMENT FOR PROSOPAGNOSIA? There is no treatment for the condition, Bonakdarpour said, but there are ways to manage it. People with prosopagnosia often focus on features like hair color, walking style or voices to tell people apart. Neurologists typically diagnose prosopagnosia through a series of tests to assess a person’s ability to remember and recognise faces. It can be a lengthy process, as doctors often take pains to assure a patient’s face blindness is not a symptom of a wider degenerative neurological condition. Many people with the condition, like Pitt, will not end up with a formal diagnosis. “Many of the challenges he’s describing, the problems he has, are not atypical for folks who experience it,” Stojic said. “It be can relatively debilitating for people,” he added. “It’s hard for other people to understand.” By Dani Blum © 2022 The New York TimesThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/sleep-apnoea-cognitive-impairment-dementia-brain-health-2731716,Commentary: Treating sleep apnoea can improve memory in people with cognitive decline,"SYDNEY: There is increasing recognition of the important role sleep plays in our brain health. Growing evidence suggests disturbed sleep may increase the risk of developing dementia. I and University of Sydney colleagues have published a new study showing treating sleep apnoea in older adults with mild cognitive impairment can improve memory, but not other areas of cognition, in the short term. As there is no current treatment or cure for dementia, increasing efforts have focused on developing novel approaches to slow its progression. Mild cognitive impairment is the stage between the expected cognitive decline of normal ageing and the more serious decline of dementia. In mild cognitive impairment, the individual, family and friends notice cognitive changes, but the individual can still successfully carry out everyday activities. Mild cognitive impairment is associated with an increased risk of developing dementia in subsequent years. Researchers believe this is the optimal time to intervene to help prevent a future dementia diagnosis. Finding new ways to slow cognitive decline in those with mild cognitive impairment is therefore important. Sleep optimises the ability of our brains to stabilise and consolidate newly learned information and memories. These processes can occur across all the different stages of sleep, with deep sleep (also known as stage 3 or restorative sleep) playing a key role. We also now know the glymphatic system, or the waste management system of the brain, is highly active during sleep, especially during deep sleep. This process allows waste products, including toxins, which our brain has built up during the day to be cleaned out. Toxins in the brain include beta-amyloid, one of the key proteins in the development of Alzheimer’s disease. Disturbing sleep could disrupt this cleaning process and lead to more accumulation of beta-amyloid in the brain. The important role of sleep in these vital processes has led to the investigation of whether sleep disruption, including sleep disorders, could be associated with changes in our cognition when we age and a possible link to the development of dementia. Sleep apnoea is estimated to affect 1 billion people worldwide. In Australia, 5 per cent to 10 per cent of adults are diagnosed with the condition. Sleep apnoea causes the throat (also called the upper airway) to close either completely (an apnoea) or partially (a hypopnoea) during sleep. These closures or obstructions can range from ten seconds up to one minute and can lead to a drop in blood oxygen levels. To start breathing again, a short awakening occurs without the individual being aware. In a person living with severe sleep apnoea, this process can happen 30 times or more an hour, causing very fragmented sleep. People with sleep apnoea may snore, toss and turn, and others may notice them stopping breathing, choking or gasping for air during sleep.  These repeated disruptions to sleep can cause sleepiness and reduce alertness during the day which, for some people, leads to difficulties performing tasks. The sleep fragmentation, as well as the drops in blood oxygen at night time, are a double blow in dementia risk. Studies have shown sleep apnoea to be associated with a 26 per cent increase in the development of cognitive impairment, as well as greater amounts of beta-amyloid in the brain. However, it is not clear if treating sleep apnoea could reduce this risk. The gold-standard treatment for sleep apnoea is continuous positive airway pressure therapy, commonly known as CPAP, in which a mask connected to a pump blows continuous air down the upper airway, keeping it open.  When the machine is being used it stops the airway from closing. It is not known whether treating sleep apnoea will reduce the risk of dementia. Our new research, however, shows CPAP could be beneficial for memory in the short term. Our study aimed to understand whether treating older adults with both sleep apnoea and mild cognitive impairment could improve thinking and memory skills in the short term. The trial assessed the effect of CPAP treatment on memory and thinking skills compared to no treatment. This was a crossover study, which means all participants had both CPAP and no treatment during the trial, but at different times.  Some had CPAP first, then swapped. The others had no treatment first, then swapped. Trained staff helped participants get established with the therapy, and after using it for three months, participants underwent a series of cognitive tests. The researchers found that compared to not treating sleep apnoea, thinking skills were not improved with CPAP, whereas some improvements in memory were observed. This suggests treating sleep apnoea could potentially improve outcomes in the short term, but it is unknown whether it would have any impact on long-term cognitive decline. A previous study suggested CPAP could slow cognitive changes over one year in older adults with mild cognitive impairment and sleep apnoea. However, studies of longer duration are needed before we can say what the long-term effects look like. Camilla Hoyos is a Research Fellow at the University of Sydney.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-insider/lost-speech-accident-how-aphasia-patient-regain-voice-2792151,A motorcycle accident left him with aphasia. He’s now fighting to regain his speech,"SINGAPORE: When Nicholas Tan woke up after a six-day induced coma, he wanted to tell his parents: “Daddy, Mummy, love me.” But no matter how hard he tried, he could not put it into words. “No voice,” he tells CNA Insider simply, six years after his motorcycle skidded on Tampines Expressway. He was 33. Meanwhile, his parents desperately tried to find out how he was doing. “We said, ‘Nicholas, give us a thumbs up if you’re in pain.’ Then he put his hand up, so we realised he could hear us, but he just couldn’t express himself,” said his father, Peter Tan. “We felt helpless.” What Nicholas had — and still has — is aphasia, a communication impairment that occurs after a brain injury, such as from a stroke, infection or tumour growth. His accident in 2016 led to a head injury resulting in three strokes. Aphasia is a communicative disorder arising from damaged neural pathways in the brain, which means thought cannot connect to language instantaneously. Afflicted persons have difficulties in speaking, reading and writing as well as in understanding spoken and written language. Indeed, in the first few months following his accident, Nicholas could barely remember his ABCs, much less form words, says his 67-year-old father, a private-hire driver. Before that, Nicholas, the eldest of six sons, was an entrepreneur running an up-and-coming Thai food and delivery business. “He was after his first million dollars,” says Peter, adding that people had not heard of players like GrabFood back then. “Nicholas was a go-getter.” His hobbies included fishing and playing football, recalls his mother, Pauline Tan. When asked what he misses most about the old him, Nicholas, now 40, says: “Miss, no. Memories, yes. Dance, then drink. Fun. “Last time, many things I do. But accident, then … all the time things don’t do, then depressed.” There are times when Nicholas shuts his eyes and puts his hand to his head in the middle of a conversation. This is how Pauline knows to wait. “(People with aphasia) need that dignity to know that, given time, they’d be able to come up with (the words),” says the 65-year-old early intervention teacher. Something like asking Nicholas where he wants to go can be distilled into a simple reply for us, she cites, “but in the early stages, it’s very overwhelming (for him)”. After 30 seconds to a minute, he might find the right word or simply say, “forget already”. That is when she will offer him some options. Pasir Ris? Tampines? A nod will affirm his thoughts. His former speech therapist Evelyn Khoo, 45, likens aphasia to the experience of being in a country where you do not speak the language. “Let’s say you don’t speak Japanese, and you go into a cafe where the menu is entirely in Japanese script. The server speaks to you in Japanese — you have no means to respond to him,” she says. “That’s how a person with aphasia feels, (only) the tip of the iceberg.” She stresses that it is not, however, an intellectual disorder. “It’s purely a language disorder where the person has difficulty comprehending language, speaking words … And sometimes they have reading, writing and spelling problems.” Going by the local stroke registry in 2019, Evelyn, who runs non-profit organisation Aphasia SG, estimates that more than 3,000 individuals in Singapore develop aphasia due to stroke alone every year. There is a spectrum of severity, from mild aphasia to severe impairment of language abilities, she adds. She has also seen patients as young as early 20s. There are two broad categories of aphasia and several types within these groups. Expressive aphasia, or Broca’s aphasia: It occurs when the part of the brain responsible for speech production is damaged. Affected persons may understand speech and know what they want to say but have difficulty forming the words. Receptive aphasia, or Wernicke’s aphasia: It occurs when the area in the brain responsible for language comprehension is damaged. Affected persons will find it harder to understand words, whether written or spoken. They may speak in complete sentences, but the words are often gibberish, and they do not realise they are not making sense. Nicholas Tan has a mix of expressive and receptive aphasia, according to speech therapist Evelyn Khoo. Speech therapy can help to improve the condition. With intervention, some people fully recover or at least recover a large part of their communication abilities. Evelyn and Nicholas met in 2018 at the Abilities Beyond Limitations and Expectations (Able) rehabilitation centre. His goal then was to read simple signs and relearn his numbers, and he worked hard for it, she says. He learnt again to recognise the alphabet and the associated sounds of each letter. He did drills to recognise numbers — writing down and saying each one. “We started with single digits and then tens, and then hundreds, thousands,” says Evelyn. It was, as Peter describes, like going back to kindergarten. At home, Nicholas practised reading aloud with the help of apps like Constant Therapy and did it “religiously”, adds Evelyn. The “long, arduous process” took almost a year, she recalls. “At the end of it, he could read short paragraphs. Kudos to him — he never gave up.” Today, she often cites Nicholas as a case study for other patients struggling with numbers. “He’s super with numbers. I’m so impressed,” she says. “In terms of communication, I find that he’s more confident and more fluent.” There is now a lot less guesswork involved when speaking to him, says Peter. “He’s able to say, like, four- to five-word phrases. And we’re able to fill in the blanks. We know exactly what he wants.” Nicholas’ parents, for their part, have learnt to speak slowly and simply to him. “We make an effort to ask him how his day was, and he’ll try to communicate … in very simple sentences. Then he’ll ask me, ‘Mummy leh?’” says Pauline. “I’ll take the opportunity to tell him stories … He’ll kind of enjoy that conversation.” He will withdraw, however, when there is too much talking and noise around him. So at family gatherings, Peter reminds his other sons: “Slow down for your eldest brother, and have one-to-one contact with him so that he can join in and feel like a part of the family.” When Evelyn met Nicholas for the first time, she was “a bit troubled” by his isolation from people his age. She “quite often” hears of patients losing friends now that their ability to communicate has been impaired. They might feel uncomfortable when people around them are talking too fast, or lack the confidence to reach out to others, she says. On the flip side, some friends might drift apart owing to their discomfort with communicating with a person with aphasia, or to a lack of topics of conversation. WATCH: Life with aphasia: I lost the ability to communicate, now I’m fighting to regain it (8:25) Persons with aphasia struggle to talk about “abstract concepts like emotions”, Evelyn says. They might want to have more in-depth conversations but “don’t have the language for it”. “It’s very, very challenging for persons with aphasia to express something that isn’t seen when they’re already struggling with concrete stuff,” she notes. That is why she started Aphasia SG and its Chit Chat Cafe in 2018, for people with aphasia to gather monthly and chat with one another in a safe space. While it is not therapy, it might help them to “process some of the emotions that they have, in their own way”, says Evelyn, who feels strongly about “the lack of access to mental health for this population of patients”. Before the pandemic, the cafe operated as a pop-up where members could meet friends and volunteers over food and drink. Then they met virtually once a week until the monthly Aphasia SG gatherings resumed this May. Nicholas was excited to once again chat in person with people his age. They exchanged questions like “What happened to your leg?” or “You (had a) stroke, eh?” and listened patiently. Silence is not awkward but appreciated here. Trained volunteers also help to elicit responses and facilitate conversations, especially for folks with more serious conditions. “They may have no words, but it doesn’t mean we treat them like nobodies,” says Evelyn. “The facilitator will still find ways and means (of getting them to) respond.” For example, facilitators could ask yes-no questions or ask for gestures like a thumbs up. Sometimes music helps. As “Top of the World” by the Carpenters was played to close the cafe session in May, the floor burst into song. “With aphasia, it’s the left side of the brain that’s impacted,” says Evelyn. “But music and rhythm tap the right side of the brain … so we’re using a different neural pathway to facilitate verbal expression.” “Once the music is turned on, it’s like — voila! The speech comes on.” Besides the cafe, Aphasia SG also runs a choir programme with elements of musical therapy. It helps participants to practise phonetics, word-finding and pronunciation in a fun way. “We have participants who have severe expressive aphasia; they can’t really speak fluently in a single sentence,” says Evelyn. “But when they sing, they sound very fluent, and it gives them a lot of confidence.” Evelyn’s team is also experimenting with art therapy to provide more mental health support for persons with aphasia. What they hope for most of all, though, is more awareness, she says. “We want to let people know that there are individuals with communication problems walking amidst us. Please be patient, please be kind when you meet someone who has this difficulty.” 1. Do not fill in the blanks for them Give them time to find the words they want to say. Evelyn suggests counting down 10 seconds before speaking. “Sometimes the word is on the tip of their tongue. They just need a bit more time,” she says. 2. Be natural, and use body language to show empathy Do not use baby talk. And communicate your interest in what the person has to say. “When someone loses the ability to communicate, (his or her) confidence is taken away,” says Evelyn. Encourage individuals to take their time, she adds. 3. Be prepared to write or draw Visual cues can help people with aphasia to better understand what you are saying, says Evelyn. Writing or drawing can also facilitate word retrieval for some affected individuals. For example, one individual she knows will fingerspell in the air to help arrive at the word he wants to say. For the Tans, Nicholas’ accident was “devastating”, but his recovery and journey with aphasia has given them a fresh perspective. “Friends who know about Nicholas’ condition would ask me, ‘How’s Nicholas nowadays?’ And I always tell them, ‘Well, I’ll never get back the old Nicholas,’” says Peter. “What I have now is a new Nicholas. Thank God I have this new Nicholas.” Even after his accident, he remained fiercely independent, says Pauline, tears in her eyes. “I believe if he could, he’d tell me he’s sorry that he met with this accident, that he doesn’t want to be a burden to us.” Six years on, what Nicholas wants to say — and can say — to his parents is: “Love, uh, love Mummy and Daddy, uh, for persevering, persevering all the while.”"

More blood is still needed, however, as the stocks for all blood types are still not at healthy levels yet, he added. More than 1,700 donors - representing all blood groups - stepped forward to donate their blood over the past four days, said Mr Ong said in a Facebook post. “This is a 45 per cent increase from our usual collection – a strong sign of unity and support from everyone,” he said. However, he added that blood stocks are “not at healthy levels yet”, with those for the negative blood groups such as A-, B-, O- and AB- “currently running low”. “So if you are an eligible blood donor, please come forward,” Mr Ong said. In his post last week, Mr Ong said that stocks of A+ and O+ blood were running low and that major elective surgeries requiring those two blood units were at risk of being postponed.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/two-pig-heart-transplants-succeed-brain-dead-recipients-2805636,Two pig heart transplants succeed in brain-dead recipients,"Surgeons at New York University (NYU) have successfully transplanted genetically engineered pig hearts into two brain-dead people, researchers said on Tuesday (Jul 12), moving a step closer to a long-term goal of using pig parts to address the shortage of human organs for transplant. The hearts functioned normally, with no signs of rejection during the three-day experiments in June and July, they said at a news conference. The experiments followed the death in March of a 57-year-old man with terminal heart disease who made history two months earlier at the University of Maryland as the first person to receive a genetically modified pig heart. The reasons why his new heart eventually failed are still unclear. NYU procured the hearts from pigs engineered by Revivicor and screened them for viruses using an enhanced monitoring protocol, the researchers said. The hearts showed no evidence of a pig virus called porcine cytomegalovirus that was detected in the blood of the Maryland man and may have contributed to his death. The pigs had four genetic modifications to prevent rejection and abnormal organ growth and six to help prevent incompatibilities between pigs and humans. NYU researchers also transplanted pig kidneys into two brain-dead recipients in 2021. For now, they believe xenotransplantation is safer in brain-dead recipients than in living patients and also more informative because biopsies can be done more often. More-frequent testing provides tremendous detail, said Dr Robert Montgomery, director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute, and a recipient of a heart transplant at NYU. ""We were able in real time to capture everything that was going on during that 72-hour period,"" he said. The procurement, transport, transplant surgery, and immunosuppression were all performed the same way as in typical human heart transplants, the researchers said. ""Our goal is to integrate the practices used in a typical, everyday heart transplant, only with a nonhuman organ that will function normally without additional aid from untested devices or medicines,"" said Dr Nader Moazami, surgical director of heart transplantation at NYU Langone. The 72-hour experiments produced preliminary data, leaving many questions to be answered before starting human pig heart trials, he added."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/fish-increase-risk-cancer-melanoma-benefits-omega-2746081,Commentary: Don't be so quick to take fish off the menu after possible link to higher cancer risk,"NEWCASTLE, Australia: You wouldn’t expect fish and melanoma to be in the same headline – but they were last month. Researchers in the United States reported a higher risk of developing melanoma, a common type of potentially deadly skin cancer, in people who ate a relatively large amount of fish. The researchers speculated that their results may be due to the levels of contaminants in some fish species – especially fatty fish.  These contaminants include polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) – synthetic chemical pollutants used as equipment coolants, lubricants and paint additives. PCBs are commonly found in the environment and can cause cancer in humans. But a detailed look at the research shows the findings don’t necessarily mean we should all be cutting fish from our diets for fear of skin cancer. The headline comes from a published study that followed more than 490,000 adults in the US for more than 15 years and checked cancer registry databases to see how many melanomas occurred within that same group of adults. Researchers classified melanomas as “in-situ”, meaning on the skin surface, or “malignant”, meaning they had spread deeper. They also asked study participants about how much fish they usually ate using a reliable food frequency questionnaire. People in the study reported how often they ate fish and their portion sizes of fried fish or fish sticks, non-fried fish, or seafood such as flounder, cod, shrimp, clams, crabs or lobster. They also reported how much and how often they ate canned tuna, including both water- and oil-packed tuna. The average amount of fish those in the study ate varied from 20g or less per week (equivalent to the size of half a matchbox) up to about 300g a week. Among the lowest fish eaters, there were 510 cases of in-situ and 802 cases of malignant melanoma over the 15 years, compared to 729 and 1102 respectively in the highest fish-eating group.  This means that the rates were 28 per cent and 22 per cent higher for both melanoma in-situ and malignant melanoma for those who ate the most fish compared to the least. Looking at specific types of fish, there was a higher melanoma rate among people who ate more tuna and non-fried fish. Interestingly, there was no association with fried fish intake.  While that appears counter-intuitive, it is likely due to the very small intakes of fried fish – ranging from less than one up to 7g a day (equivalent to one heaped teaspoon). Although the researchers adjusted their analyses for factors that could affect results – such as physical activity, smoking, family history of cancer and alcohol intake – the adjustment for daily UV exposure was only based on the average UV index for the suburb they lived in.  This means there was no adjustment for UV exposure related to a person’s occupation. They also did not have information on the melanoma risk factors such as mole count, hair colour, history of severe sunburn or individual sun-related behaviours. This study does not prove eating fish causes melanoma. This is because it’s a “cohort study”, meaning people were observed over time to see whether they developed melanoma or not. There was no intervention to feed them specific amounts of fish, which would not have been practical to do over 15 years anyway. Researchers did measure a range of behaviours at the beginning of the study (or “baseline”), such as dietary intake and physical activity levels. But these could have changed over time. So the results are based on observation rather than cause and effect. This doesn’t mean observational results should be ignored, though. Fish, especially fatty fish such as tuna, can contain contaminants such as mercury and PCBs. This could contribute to the findings that eating more fish is associated with a higher rate of both malignant melanoma and melanoma in-situ (skin cancer). PCBs are readily absorbed into the body, accumulating in fat stores and staying there for years. The role of contaminants that may be present in some fish needs to be considered further. A 2017 study of more than 20,000 Swedish women evaluated PCB exposure – potentially from fatty fish – and the incidence of melanoma. After four and a half years of follow-up, researchers reported four times the risk of malignant melanoma for those women with the highest PCB exposure via their diet compared to the lowest. However, this study also reported the intake of omega-3 fats found in fish and identified that among the women with the highest intake, there was an 80 per cent lower risk of melanoma, even after they adjusted for levels of dietary PCB exposure.  This could explain why a 2015 systematic review of case control and cohort studies found that higher fish intakes seemed to protect people from a malignant melanoma of the skin in some, but not all, studies. For lots of other health reasons, including lowering your risk of heart disease or death from all causes, we should keep eating fatty fish such as salmon, tuna and sardines.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/dementia-brain-donation-research-family-pledged-2763066,Dementia stole his golden years. His family donated his brain for research so others wouldn't suffer too,"SINGAPORE: In the advanced stages of the late Albert Yip’s dementia, his family signed his brain away.  The Yip family pledged his brain for donation just before he died in 2020 at the age of 73, in hopes that contributing to brain research would mean fewer people would go through the same suffering they did.  Mr Yip retired from being a taxi driver before he started showing signs of dementia in 2018. He would lose his way while out buying food or sending his grandchildren to school. And he wouldn’t pick up his phone when his family called.  Mdm Violet Ow, his wife, chalked up this carelessness to his “usual behaviour”, the 71-year-old told CNA in Mandarin. But a visit to the doctor’s in early 2019 revealed that her husband had, in fact, been suffering from dementia for five to six years.  The news hit their close-knit family hard, shared Mdm Ow’s daughters, Vince and Vivian Yip. Vince, who lives with her own family, felt “a little bit guilty” that she hadn’t spotted signs of her father’s deterioration.  “It didn’t occur to me until my mum and I brought him to the polyclinic. He wasn’t even able to answer, even basic things the doctor was asking, like what year it was. That’s when I realised how severe it was,” said the 44-year-old, who works in business development.   As Mr Yip’s dementia worsened in the later half of 2019, he “turned into a totally different person”. Even the doctors said so, recalled Mdm Ow.  Vivian said her late father was generally mild-mannered, and although he could be quick-tempered on occasion, he never lashed out at the family. “But (with dementia), we see him getting frustrated. There was one incident that really scared my mum because he suddenly just shouted. Very, very loud, and very, very angry. We were having dinner and he suddenly lost it. But that person is not him,” said the 46-year-old, who works in human resources.  While Mr Yip spent his days at the Alzheimer’s Disease Association (renamed Dementia Singapore in 2021), the centre had to be shut during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Staying home resulted in communication problems with his family.  “There was a point where we didn’t want him to move around because he was not very stable. So we had a wheelchair. I know he didn’t like sitting there, and he just wanted to keep getting up. He kept asking: ‘Why are you doing this to me?’” said Vivian, tearing up.  “We had to tie him down. Which is … it’s painful to do this."" And then Mdm Ow came across an article on brain donation in Chinese-language newspaper Lianhe Zaobao. She thought it would be a good idea to register her husband as a brain donor, and her daughters had zero reservations too.  In September 2020, just two months before his death, Mr Yip was registered with Brain Bank Singapore (BBS), the first tissue bank in Southeast Asia dedicated to the repository of human brain tissue to study various neurological disorders. Neurological disorders affect the brain, spine, muscles and nerves. They include diseases such as dementia, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and motor neurone disease.  As of Jun 1 this year, BBS had 172 registered brain donors. Four registered donors have since died and their brains were donated. “When I came across the brain donation article, I thought about how my husband already has dementia. What if, in the next 10 years, there are more people above 65 who have the same condition? What if our next generation also has this?” said Mdm Ow.  “I’m unlikely to benefit (from the donation of my husband’s brain), and so are my children. But my grandchildren might benefit from medication or research that is done on the brain to cure dementia.”   “Anyway, after you die, you don’t have any more use. Of course, most people think that you must retain your ‘complete’ body, but that’s a waste,"" her daughter Vivian added. ""Who knows, my tiny contribution could help. What is important is the present. After someone passes, what’s left?”   Mdm Ow also believes her late husband would have willingly signed up to be a brain donor, as he believed in helping others in whatever ways he could.  “When my brother said, ‘Now he doesn’t have a brain’, I told him, ‘Well, he doesn’t need a brain!’” she said, with a chuckle.  Interested individuals need to be above 21 years old.  ​​BBS is not able to accept donors who have infectious diseases like HIV, hepatitis and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease to prevent transmission to researchers who study these human biological materials, said Dr Joan Sim from BBS.  Additionally, brain donation will not be able to proceed if there is a delay of more than 48 hours after death, because “there will be degradation of the tissues which makes them not useful for in-depth research studies”, she added. Brain donation is also not possible when a patient on life support has been declared brain dead, due to the extent of tissue damage. Brain donation can help with early detection and diagnosis, as there is often a “window” period for some neurodegenerative disorders like dementia where medication, therapy and rehabilitation can help with the symptoms at an earlier stage, noted Dr Adeline Ng, a senior consultant of neurology at the National Neuroscience Institute (NNI) and deputy director at BBS.  It also “allows patients and their families more time to plan for the future”, she added.   Studies have shown that Asian and Caucasian brains present different clinical symptoms in the same neurological disorder, although its reasons are still unclear, said Dr Ng.  There are also demonstrated differences in brain structure between different Asian ethnic groups, so collecting a repository of brain tissue from these groups is important, she added. Brain donation can also help doctors better understand mental illnesses.  “Much like Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, psychiatric disorders are inherently difficult to study unless we have access to the affected brain tissues,” noted Dr Jimmy Lee, a senior consultant with the Department of Psychosis and Research Division at the Institute of Mental Health.  Being able to study brain tissue will “provide insights into why individuals are affected differently” by the same psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia, major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder, added Dr Lee.  After all, different individuals could display “more severe symptoms” or respond differently to similar treatment. Illustrating how current research into the brain has helped doctors understand neurological diseases better, Dr Yeo Tianrong added that it is now possible to “simultaneously interrogate thousands of genes” from the brain of someone with Alzheimer’s disease to work out which genes have been “turned on” and which have been “turned off”.   Researchers can even do that with each individual cell within brain tissues, providing them “a signature of how the cells in the brain have been changed by the disease”, said the senior consultant of neurology at NNI and deputy director designate at BBS.  Dr Yeo said studies have also shown that cells in the immune system may be “potentiating brain injury” by making neurons more vulnerable to dying.  “(This is) an important insight … so drugs which target immune cells, rather than cells in the brain, are now being considered for clinical trials to slow down or stop dementia.” One very real hurdle to persuading more people to sign up is that brain donation is separate from the Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), which Singapore citizens and permanent residents are automatically included in. And this separation “can be a challenge (to) any individual’s beliefs”, said Dr Sim, a manager at BBS.  Brain donation also does not fall under the Medical (Therapy, Education and Research) Act.  As brain donation to the BBS is “only used for the purpose of biomedical research and is not used for transplantation or medical education”, brain donation is included under the legislation of the Human Biomedical Research Act and Human Tissue Framework.  Interested individuals have to complete a consent form with BBS to register as a brain donor. “It is harder for people to understand the impact of brain donation for the benefits of biomedical research, as such work is long term and takes years to generate discoveries for better treatments for future generations,” added Dr Sim.  “BBS tries to overcome this challenge of an individual’s belief by raising awareness that there are no cures for brain disorders like dementia, motor neuron disease and psychiatric conditions to date. The management of symptoms that interfere with daily lives relies on current drugs which may not be very effective.” Neurologically speaking, the lack of research done on the brain can be mainly attributed to the “complexity of the human brain and the inaccessibility of the brain for biomedical research”, added Dr Yeo.  Even though the advancement of technology in MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) has allowed doctors to gain insight into the brain’s structure, he noted that these measures are still “surrogates” of the actual brain and disease processes.  Misconceptions about brain donation and taboos surrounding death continue to persist.  For starters, there is the myth that brain retrieval takes place at the forehead, said Dr Sim from BBS. This misconception often stokes fear in a grieving family that brain donation “would disfigure the deceased’s face or result in their hair being removed”, making it difficult to have an open-casket funeral.  “This is not the case. The face remains untouched as the brain is retrieved from the back of the head, stitched up neatly afterwards and the area is covered by the deceased’s hair … to ensure minimal effect on the appearance of the body,” explained Dr Sim.  “Neatening up of the cut will also be done by BBS’s engaged casket company before the body is returned to the family for the funeral. Open-casket funerals can proceed as normal.” Death also remains a taboo subject in Singapore, added Dr Sim. “Therefore, while individuals may be interested to register as brain donors, it can be challenging to discuss their end-of-life plans and wishes with their family or loved ones.” But when such open conversations take place during the process of drafting their wills and Advanced Care Planning, it allows the individual to “reflect on the legacy they want to leave behind”, she said.  Brain donation is then seen as a “natural next step” in ensuring they can continue to make a difference in the lives of future generations after they pass on.  “It is difficult to imagine the depths of frustration caused by neurodegenerative conditions which do not have a cure currently, such as dementia, Parkinson’s disease and motor neuron disease, unless you or a loved one has suffered from one,” said Dr Sim.  Several donors have shared that “they want something good to come from their illness”, she added. By donating their brain for research, they hope to “help find a cure for or even prevent other patients from suffering these brain disorders”. This, too, is the philosophy that guides the Yips. Being able to contribute to the future is their way of doing their best in the present. “It is not about that change happening in this life,” said Vince.  “Having gone through this process, it's just about sharing our experience. Not only the caregivers’ pain, but also what my dad went through. He was about to retire and had dementia rob him of everything else, of whatever remaining years he could have had,” she added.  “It’s something that you wouldn't want anybody to go through.”"

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/monkeypox-singapore-first-local-case-2792906,Singapore confirms first local case of monkeypox infection,"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed the first local case of monkeypox infection in Singapore. The patient is a 45-year-old male Malaysian national who resides in Singapore. MOH said the man tested positive for monkeypox on Wednesday (Jul 6).  ""He is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and his condition is stable,"" MOH said in a media statement on Wednesday.  The man is not linked to the imported case announced by MOH on Jun 21, it added. The man first developed lower abdomen skin lesions on Jun 30 and subsequently experienced fatigue and swollen lymph nodes on Jul 2.  He developed fever and a sore throat on Jul 4 and sought medical attention where initial tests for other possible medical conditions were done. ""When these tests returned negative, he was subsequently conveyed to NCID on 6 July, where he was isolated for further assessment,"" said MOH.  As of Wednesday, three close contacts - two housemates and one social contact - have been identified. All close contacts will be placed on quarantine for 21 days from their last contact with the case. Contact tracing is ongoing, said MOH.  Monkeypox is a viral disease that is caused by infection with the monkeypox virus. It is typically a self-limiting illness where patients recover within two to four weeks.  ""A small percentage of those infected can fall seriously ill or even die. Those particularly vulnerable to complications are young children, pregnant women or immunocompromised individuals,"" said the ministry.  It added that the risk to the general public remains low as transmission requires close physical or prolonged contact.  MOH said it will continue to monitor the monkeypox situation closely and calibrate its preparedness and response measures as needed. ""Members of the public are encouraged to exercise personal responsibility by monitoring their personal health and maintaining good hygiene, especially during travel,"" it added. ""They should also avoid close contact with other individuals known or suspected to be ill with monkeypox infection."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-hospitalisation-increase-cut-back-elective-procedures-ong-ye-kung-2790141,"COVID-19 hospitalisations 'increased quite significantly', hospitals to cut back on elective procedures: Ong Ye Kung","SINGAPORE: The number of COVID-19 cases hospitalised has “increased quite significantly” to nearly 700, and hospitals have started to cut back on non-COVID and elective procedures, said Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung on Tuesday (Jul 5).  Mr Ong was responding to a supplementary question from MP Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Yio Chu Kang) about whether hospitals would be cutting back on elective procedures due to the wave of COVID-19 infections.  “The number of hospitalisation cases has reached almost 700 now, so it has increased quite significantly. This is as compared to the height of the Omicron wave earlier this year, where we had about 1,700 hospitalisation cases,” he added.  “At that time we cut back (business-as-usual) by 15 per cent. So we have now started to trigger some cutback of (business-as-usual), mostly electives, and the cutback is about 4 per cent.”  At the peak of the earlier Omicron wave, Singapore saw about 18,000 new COVID-19 cases daily. Tuesday's COVID-19 caseload is expected to be more than 12,000, about 10 per cent more than Tuesday last week, said Mr Ong in his initial response in Parliament.  ""There are indications that we are near the peak, if not at the peak, and we should be relieved that the number this week did not double from last week. Otherwise, we'll be at 24,000 or 22,000 this week,"" he said. In his earlier response to Mr Yip about whether the healthcare settings are ""adequately equipped"" to handle the next wave, Mr Ong said the key to managing the next wave is to ensure that Singapore’s hospital capacity is “not overly stressed”. This includes ensuring high vaccination and booster coverage, as well as making sure healthcare institutions and facilities are prepared and ready to ramp up capacity if there are increased admissions, he added.  “Our hospitals remain ready to ramp up dedicated (intensive care unit) and isolation bed capacity should there be an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients who require hospitalisation,” said Mr Ong.  There are also “sufficient beds” in the COVID-19 treatment facilities for serious cases that do not need hospital care, he said, adding that such COVID-19 treatment facilities are about 25 per cent occupied. The facilities were “recently consolidated” from more than 2,000 beds to about 1,300 beds, with a “higher manning ratio”, said the Health Minister. This makes it easier to transfer patients from hospitals to the facilities without a “significant drop” in levels of care, he added.  However, public hospitals continue to face “high demand” from non-COVID-19 patients. “Over time, we hope more of our (COVID-19 treatment facilities) can be multi-purpose isolation and treatment facilities, for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients,” added Mr Ong.  The COVID-19 treatment facility at Sengkang Community Hospital has been “reconfigured” to this new model, and the authorities will explore converting other facilities, said the Health Minister.  In anticipating the wave of infections, Mr Ong said the Government maintained the indoor masking requirement even when cases were “low and stable” in order to “moderate the infection rate” when the new wave arrived. “If we still want to reduce the infection rate even further, more stringent safe management measures will need to be implemented. And that means reintroducing things like group sizes, capacity limits and masking outdoors,” he added.  ""We cannot rule out these steps if we are hit with a serious infection wave, but as far as possible, we should avoid them, especially if we are reasonably confident that our hospital capacity can hold up, and that we are determined to live with COVID-19 and continue our journey of endemicity."" Mr Yip also asked if hospitals have been able to hire new staff for the wave of COVID-19 infections, to replace the wave of manpower that left the healthcare sector.  “Manpower indeed is a challenge,” said Mr Ong, adding that the current attrition rate is comparable to what hospitals saw in 2019.  “In February there was a slight spike after bonuses (were) received, but otherwise the latest number month-on-month is comparable to what we experienced 2019 pre-COVID,” said the Health Minister.  “Having said that, it is increasingly difficult to hold on and to recruit foreign nurses because with COVID-19 being a global pandemic, hiring of nurses is a matter of international competition.”  Singapore has its “fair share” of healthcare talent, said Mr Ong, noting that courses in schools are often oversubscribed.  “But our cohort size is limited. Our healthcare demand is growing, so therefore, we must be able to accept that over time we have to recruit more foreign nurses from different sources,” he added.  This includes being able to train these talents and pay them competitively, said the Health Minister.  “The good ones over time should be able to be part of our community, become (permanent residents) and live with their family here, go to local schools here,” he continued.  “I think this is the only way for us to not just weather through this wave, but as our population gets older, that profile or that size of our healthcare workforce will have to increase, and we have to tap on both a strong local pipeline as well as foreign recruitment.”  "

These subvariants have a ""significant growth advantage"" over the earlier BA.2 subvariant, he added. “This wave, however, arrived slightly earlier than the July and August timeframe that we anticipated,” the Health Minister said. “For this current wave, our assessment is that it will not be as severe as the Omicron wave we experienced earlier this year. This is because many more of us have gained stronger immunity, either through booster shots or recovery from infections,"" he added. “This will significantly impede the circulation and transmission of the BA.4, BA.5 viruses.”  At the peak of the earlier Omicron wave, Singapore saw about 18,000 new COVID-19 cases daily. Tuesday's COVID-19 caseload is expected to be more than 12,000, about 10 per cent more than Tuesday last week, he said, adding that Tuesday is ""always the day where cases spike up"".

Otherwise, we'll be at 24,000 or 22,000 this week,"" he said. In a supplementary question, Mr Ang asked about the percentage of recent COVID-19 infections caused by the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.  Of all current infections, about 50 per cent are from the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, said Mr Ong.  ""It has been doubling every week. Started at 3 per cent, then 5 per cent, then 8 per cent, then 16 per cent, 30 per cent last week, this week 50 per cent, next week I would expect it to be 70 to 80 per cent. It is clearly a more dominant subvariant compared to BA.2.""  In response to a question from MP Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Yio Chu Kang) if healthcare settings are ""adequately equipped"" to handle the next wave, Mr Ong said the key to managing the next wave is to ensure that Singapore’s hospital capacity is “not overly stressed”. This includes ensuring high vaccination and booster coverage, as well as making sure healthcare institutions and facilities are prepared and ready to ramp up capacity if there are increased admissions, he added.  As of noon on Monday, there were 631 people in hospital, with 74 requiring oxygen supplementation and 14 in the intensive care unit. “Our hospitals remain ready to ramp up dedicated ICU and isolation bed capacity should there be an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients who require hospitalisation,” said Mr Ong.  There are also “sufficient beds” in the COVID-19 treatment facilities for serious cases that do not need hospital care, he said, adding that such COVID-19 treatment facilities are about 25 per cent occupied.

""We cannot rule out these steps if we are hit with a serious infection wave, but as far as possible, we should avoid them, especially if we are reasonably confident that our hospital capacity can hold up, and that we are determined to live with COVID-19 and continue our journey of endemicity.""

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/vaping-e-cigarettes-smoking-health-risks-2775261,Health experts debunk myths on vaping: Does it really help smokers quit? What chemicals are you inhaling?,"When it comes to cigarette use, its association with lung disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer and congenital deformities is well-documented. Even if you aren’t aware, pick up any cigarette pack and you’ll see graphic images of one of those medical conditions printed on it.  E-cigarettes or vapes, on the other hand, are marketed openly on social media platforms and messaging apps as colourful accessories. The fruit-scented plumes that the battery-operated vaporisers (also known as vape pens, electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes, and electronic nicotine delivery system or ENDS devices) produce are also mistakenly perceived as less harmful than the acrid odour of cigarette smoke, even though vaping has been linked to sometimes fatal lung disease. Vaping is banned here in Singapore. Anyone found guilty of possession, use of or purchase of e-vaporisers could get fined up to S$2,000, and those found importing or selling them risk fines of up to S$10,000 and up to six months' jail.Controversially, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorised the sale of three vaping products to adults last October to help smokers quit or reduce their cigarette use. ""The FDA determined that the potential benefit to smokers who switch completely or significantly reduce their cigarette use, would outweigh the risk to youth,"" it said. ARE SINGAPOREANS SECRETLY USING VAPING TO QUIT SMOKING? But what about the situation in Singapore? Are adult smokers here using vaporisers on the sly to help them kick the smoking habit?  “There is no available data as vaping is illegal in Singapore, making people not forthcoming,” said Dr Puah Ser Hon, a consultant with Tan Tock Seng Hospital’s (TTSH) Respiratory & Critical Care Medicine.  One thing’s for sure: More vaping offences have been recorded over the years. Citing recent statistics from the authorities, Dr Kenneth Chan, a consultant respiratory physician with Respiratory Medical Associates, said that the number has almost tripled from close to 2,500 in 2019 to more than 7,500 in 2021. “This statistic highlights the prevalence of the activity and its growing trend despite the ban,” he said. Dr Chan added: “I don’t keep track of how many vapers I’ve seen in my clinic, but it is common enough for me to ask my patients about a vaping habit routinely.” Grace Chew, a senior pharmacist at Guardian, has also noted the reluctance of customers to reveal if they are indeed using the devices. However, the pharmacists do get asked “general questions” by one out of every seven customers, she said. IS VAPING AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO HELP YOU KICK SMOKING? Despite the FDA's reasoning and some research supporting its position, other studies have found “very low certainty evidence” that e-cigarettes are the way to give up cigarette smoking in the short term. Neither is there “enough evidence to determine if e-cigarettes are a safe and efficacious means of smoking cessation in the long term” (more than 12 months), said a study published by the American Journal of Health Promotion. “The available data on the use of e-cigarettes as a means to quit cigarette smoking has been inconclusive, with some data showing some degree of improvement in quit rates, while other studies showed no benefit,” said Dr Puah.  “In one study, although there was an improvement in quit rates, there was prolonged usage of e-cigarettes and there is still no long-term data on the effects of regular inhalation of vaporised fumes through an ENDS device,” he said.  WHY IS VAPING SEEN AS LESS HARMFUL, THOUGH ALSO DANGEROUS? For one, users tend to consider vaping as less addictive than regular smoking. It does not help that the e-liquid or vape juice that is vaporised by the e-cigarette comes in candy-like flavours. “The aerosol inhaled from e-cigarettes may have nice smells and flavours. It might be perceived in the same vein as sweets or breath fresheners,” said Chew.
Moreover, you don’t have to burn anything to vape, unlike smoking cigarettes, she added. And since there is no burning involved, which people tend to associate with the creation of cancer-causing carcinogens, vaping is “regarded as less harmful”. “Without having to light up, it is convenient to vape undetected anywhere,” she said. But no matter how you smoke it, these devices still produce nicotine, said Leslie Chua, a senior pharmacist with TTSH. “Nicotine is a known addictive chemical and has been found to lower the threshold for addiction and a gateway drug to marijuana and cocaine. It has also been shown to affect brain development.” The same misconception could also come from being told that the nicotine used is “extracted and purified from raw tobacco, hence their perception that there are fewer toxic chemicals compared to cigarettes”, said Dr Chan.  VAPE JUICE CONTAINS THC AND VITAMIN E ACETATE – WHAT DO THEY DO? Other than nicotine, an outbreak of lung injuries and deaths associated with vaping in the US in 2019 has identified two other chemicals as dangerous: Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and vitamin E acetate. THC is the “main psychoactive compound in cannabis that produces the associated ‘high’ feeling when consumed”, said Dr Puah.  “THC’s use in vaping has gained popularity in many parts of the world. This is fuelled by companies that market their THC-containing products with purported benefits for sports or personal wellness. However, it is actually cannabinol or CBD that shows potential for various medically indicated uses,” he said. As for vitamin E acetate, it is an oily chemical usually used to dilute THC, said Chua. “THC vaping cartridges that are sold commercially are usually formulated with such oils to improve its consistency.”  But here’s where the “vitamin E” part of the name might dupe users into regarding it as benign or even beneficial. While it is fine to apply vitamin E acetate on skin or ingest it as a supplement, it is another matter to inhale it.  Case in point: The US’s aforementioned spike in the vaping-related condition dubbed “e-cigarette or vaping product use associated lung injury” or EVALI. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found vitamin E acetate in the lungs of patients who vaped, and the chemical was strongly linked with shortness of breath, cough and chest pain that saw more than 2,800 hospitalised and 68 dead.  Resisting the urge to light up is probably one of the hardest things to do when you are trying to quit smoking. “But remember that the urge won’t last forever and will likely pass within 5 to 10 minutes,” said June Lim, Tan Tock Seng Hospital’s senior psychologist. Here are some tips from her: OTHER CHEMICALS FOUND  No matter how vaporiser manufacturers market them, e-liquids or vape juices contain cancer-causing substances such as formaldehyde, benzene, carbonyls, and other volatile organic compounds, as well as toxic heavy metals like lead, nickel and tin, said Dr Chan. “The potential long-term effects of e-cigarette consumption still require more medical research, so it should not be taken lightly.” Here’s a look at the list of chemicals that are commonly found in e-cigarettes:  And that’s just the tip of the iceberg before the e-liquid is burned. “E-liquids have been shown to contain at least 100 chemical compounds,” said Chua. That number may be lower than the 7,000 chemicals that conventional cigarettes produce, but that’s because you haven’t started up the vaporiser yet.  “More compounds are usually detected in the aerosol produced as new chemicals are generated during the vaporisation process,” said Dr Puah. “Although e-cigarettes may seem to produce fewer chemicals, almost all of the known chemicals emitted by e-cigarettes are known to be potentially harmful compounds and pose a general health risk to both the users and their loved ones.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/canada-hospital-emergency-rooms-perfect-storm-covid-19-staff-2787536,Canada's emergency rooms bear the brunt of a 'perfect storm',"TORONTO: Health authorities across Canada have cut the hours of hospital emergency departments and urgent care clinics in recent weeks, a move that in some cases may extend through the summer, due to a surge in patients and staff shortages. The situation, clinicians say, is tied to a resurgence of viral infections such as COVID-19 among adults and children and a push by others to seek care delayed by the pandemic, and exacerbated by the high number of healthcare workers who are sick or burned out. The strain has led to scenes of clogged hospital hallways and overflowing clinic waiting rooms, hours-long waits for inpatient care and occupancy rates of more than 100 per cent at children's hospitals. It also has rekindled debate about systemic problems in the government-funded healthcare system. On Thursday (Jun 30), the Perth and Smiths Falls District Hospital in eastern Ontario announced that its emergency department in Perth would be closed from Saturday to Thursday due to a COVID-19 outbreak affecting its staffing. ""It's like the four horsemen of the apocalypse all descending on us in health care at once,"" said Alan Drummond, a family and emergency physician based in the town, which is home to about 6,000 people. Drummond, who spoke with Reuters before the closure was announced, sees patients waiting 20 hours to be admitted, a situation that can lead to a deterioration in their condition or even medical errors. He blames the situation on years of inadequate funding of hospital beds and community care. While hospitals in small towns and cities in Canada do sometimes reduce their hours, it is rarer for regional health hubs to do so. Ontario's health ministry would not say how many hospitals in the province, Canada's most populous, are affected by partial or temporary closures, but said it has taken measures to address the issue, including retaining nurses and other healthcare workers. ""Sometimes hospitals must make the difficult decision to close their emergency departments temporarily so that operations can continue throughout the rest of the hospital,"" a ministry spokesperson said. Hospitals in Quebec, the country's second-largest province, New Brunswick and Manitoba also have partially shut departments or temporarily cut hours for anywhere from a couple of weeks to a number of months, according to statements from the hospitals. In Kingston, Ontario, the Hotel Dieu Hospital's Urgent Care Clinic reduced its hours over the Canada Day long weekend. A spokesperson for the Kingston Health Science Centre described the move, which began on Friday, as a planned one-time reduction, but added it was expected that ""staffing shortages and the current surge in patient volumes will continue throughout the summer"". Children have been hard hit by the healthcare crunch as youngsters with no prior exposure to a number of viruses succumbed to illness during the spring as many people abandoned face masks used to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa, the nation's capital, ran at between 110 per cent and 120 per cent capacity for weeks in May and early June. Occupancy was a record high for the month of May, a spokesperson said. Low staffing and surging patient loads is ""kind of like that perfect storm,"" said Katharine Smart, a pediatrician who is the president of the Canadian Medical Association. Canada has the fourth-lowest number of funded acute care beds per capita among countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, according to the OECD, and the Commonwealth Fund ranked Canada's health system second-last among 11 rich countries. Some blame underfunding of the healthcare system dating back to the 1990s, when Canada's federal government cut spending to get the country's deficit under control. Others, such as the right-leaning Fraser Institute, say the government-funded system itself is the root cause of the problems, suggesting moving toward a privately-paid model. Canada may have little time to waste. Rami Rahal, a vice president at the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, said there is a danger that cancer illness and deaths could worsen in the country due to lengthy periods in which screening was skipped or delayed and treatment postponed. ""We can't hire our way out of this crisis,"" he said. ""We have to find innovative ways of delivering care."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/stress-immune-system-2774581,Stress can age your immune system – here’s what you need to do about it,"By now, most people know that stress can take a serious toll on mental and physical health. And when that stress is prolonged, studies suggest, it can increase the risk of certain health conditions like asthma, ulcers, heart attack and stroke. Now, new research suggests that certain types of stress can even age your immune system. Using an existing body of data, researchers looked at survey responses from a nationally representative sample of more than 5,700 adults in the United States ages 50 and older, and cross-referenced them with immune cell counts from participants’ blood.  The survey asked respondents about their experiences with social stressors like job strain, chronic stress, stressful life events, everyday or lifetime discrimination (including sexism or ageism) and traumatic life events. The team found that higher levels of reported stress were associated with older immune system profiles. The findings were published in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. WHAT THE FINDINGS SUGGEST  As your immune system ages, your body has a less coordinated response to new threats because it produces different types of immune cells in different proportions than it does when you are younger, said Eric Klopack, the lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher of gerontology at the University of Southern California.  At the same time, older, more worn-out immune cells tend to dominate over newer, more agile ones, resulting in a less robust immune response. Until now, no one has fully investigated the relationship between social stress and immunological function, at least not with this granularity, said Matthew Yousefzadeh, who researches ageing at the University of Minnesota and was not involved with the new research.  And while the new study is limited in that it only looked at a few kinds of immune cells — specifically the T cells CD4 and CD8 — Yousefzadeh said that they are a pretty good indicator of immunity robustness. “It’s sort of a peek underneath the hood of the car and how well you’ll do with the infections,” he said. The new research touches on a timely concern amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. “I think a lot of people right now are looking at ways to rejuvenate or stimulate or boost the immune systems, particularly with ageing,” Yousefzadeh said. And so any information on how immune ageing works, or how it might differ for certain people, is valuable for public health. WHAT YOU CAN DO  While the researchers found that certain forms of social stress were linked with changes in participants’ immune cells, Klopack cautioned that experts don’t fully understand how one influences the other. When they statistically controlled for behaviours like smoking or drinking, some of those associations with immune ageing “went away or were reduced,” he said, suggesting that those behaviours may have played some role in the ageing of their immune systems.  One way to prevent immune cell ageing, then, Klopack said, may be to be mindful of unhealthy habits. Studies like this one make visible what people who endure discrimination and trauma already intuitively know, said Renee Eddy, a psychotherapist based in New York City: Stress takes a tangible toll on physical health. Mitigating those effects requires taking stock of your emotions, Eddy said. Everyone is affected by stress differently, she said, so the ways they process it can vary too.  Focusing on what brings you joy, and where you can find social support, can help. That may mean pursuing hobbies, spending time with loved ones, or unplugging from work or social media when you can. Mindfulness practices, exercise and healthy eating habits can also help you feel good physically, which in turn can make you feel good mentally, she added. If you experience social stressors on a daily basis — whether at work, in your social life or at home — think about what you can control to keep them in check, Eddy said.  If a friend’s political views are consistently causing you anguish, can you limit your contact with them or change your social circle? If a work colleague is putting you down because of your age, would it help to confront them about it?  Looking at the full context of where and how stressful situations manifest in your life is the first step in deciding how you can move forward. Of course, there will be situations that you cannot control, Eddy added, but the more you can do to better understand their effect on you, the more you can do to help alleviate them. There is a lot more to uncover, Klopack said. The new study looked at older, mostly white adults, at one point in time, relying on self-reported stress levels. Scientists don’t know how stress affects the immune systems of younger people, or how changes to immune systems may persist. One thing to remember, however, is that the biggest thing “that contributes to immune aging is just ageing,” said Idan Shalev, a bio-behavioural health scientist at Pennsylvania State University who studies the effects of stress across life spans.  So the strategies for warding off immune ageing are usually the same ones that will ward off the effects of ageing in general: Following a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, limiting or avoiding smoking and drinking, and getting good sleep.  “Having social supports is also very important, like family, friends,” Shalev said, since loneliness can also affect the immune system. We should all be implementing those good habits right away, he added, and not just waiting until you’re close to retirement. Another way to interpret this new study, Yousefzadeh said, is that social stressors like trauma and discrimination can affect life expectancy. But while there is much research interest in rejuvenating our immune system, science has yet to find a way to reverse ageing, he added. So it’s important to do everything you can to keep your immune system robust, he said, because once things decline, you cannot really go back to how things were.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/tiktok-doctors-fake-news-debunk-myths-2782516,Health myth busters: Meet the medical experts fighting bogus science on TikTok,"“I’m willing to bet you know at least one girl that’s using steroids every single day,” starts a young man in a TikTok video. He stares into the camera, continuing his big, yet notably false, reveal: “One in three girls these days is taking the birth control pill, and believe it or not, the birth control pill is actually an analog of the bodybuilding steroid nandrolone.” Another face swiftly crowds the screen. Dressed in a white lab coat, debunker Mustafa Dhahir, a practicing pharmacist and medical student based in Australia, interrupts the video with his own commentary: “One of the most annoying things when it comes to busting misinformation is that the people who spread the misinformation use hints of truth to spread their lies.” Dhahir explains what a steroid is and then goes point by point to illustrate why the original video – which claims oral contraception causes a medley of symptoms, including changes in sexual attraction – is inaccurate. “This guy is simply using scare tactics,” Dhahir tells the viewer, noting that there are many birth control options with varying sets of side effects. Dhahir is part of a growing cohort of scientists, physicians, health care professionals and academics who debunk health misinformation on TikTok by “stitching” videos, which involves clipping existing videos into new ones and then offering one’s own input. While social media platforms including TikTok have developed systems to flag vaccine misinformation, an ocean of other dubious health claims often go unscrutinised – except when individual users like him, who have actual medical knowledge, push back. “Misinformation impacts medical decisions and health,” said Dhahir, who began responding to false claims on TikTok at the start of the pandemic and has since amassed 9.5 million likes on his videos. He has debunked claims that contraception makes women infertile, that only “natural” medicine can be trusted and that Tylenol is linked to autism. The work is often draining. Unqualified influencers posting misinformation far outnumber the experts debunking it, who are often harassed by other users for their efforts. “For every large creator who is genuinely evidence-based, you’ve got 50 or 60 big creators who spread misinformation,” said Dr Idrees Mughal, a Britain-based physician with an additional masters in nutritional research, whose account, @dr_idz, has 1 million followers. He debunks fad diets, unsupported claims that food ingredients are “cancer-causing” and the myth that certain vegetables contain harmful “toxic” chemicals. Misinformation is so ubiquitous that Mughal said he is tagged in 100 to 200 videos a day from users requesting that he debunk claims. “People are looking for genuine science-based, evidence-based creators,” he said. FERTILE GROUND FOR PSEUDOSCIENCE Misinformation is widespread on all of the major social media platforms, but TikTok’s audio capabilities can give false claims particular longevity. Bits of misinformation clipped and saved as what TikTok calls sounds “operate like viral chain messages,” according to a 2021 blog post from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a London-based center that researches disinformation and extremism online. Even if a video is taken down, the original audio often survives in the work of users who have already borrowed it for their own content. TikTok has enacted policies to flag such content, including adding informational banners to COVID-19 vaccine content, but one ISD study of more than 6,000 videos related to the vaccines found that 58 per cent lacked banners. When it comes to combating health misinformation in general, all social media platforms face a daunting task, given the sheer volume of inaccurate posts. In a statement, TikTok wrote, “We work diligently to take action on content and accounts that spread misinformation, while also promoting authoritative content about vaccines through our COVID-19 information hub.” When asked if TikTok was addressing general health misinformation, the company replied that ​​it both removes violations of the platform’s policies and works “with credible voices to elevate authoritative content on topics related to public health.” Abbie Richards, a misinformation and disinformation researcher and research fellow with the Accelerationism Research Consortium, an organisation aimed at understanding and addressing the threat of extremism, said TikTok’s video format was also advantageous in spreading conspiracies. Creators speak directly into the camera as if they are on a video call with the viewer. “It feels more authentic than disembodied text,” Richards said, which can make it seem more credible. YouTube, which is still a far larger video destination than TikTok and also has audio capabilities, does not necessarily create the same sense of intimacy. Timothy Caulfield, the Canada research chair in health law and policy at the University of Alberta, studies misinformation on social media and said that research had shown that a powerful personal anecdote, testimonial or narrative could overwhelm people’s ability to think scientifically. Coupled with creative visuals, “those elements have made it a very consumable and powerful way to spread misinformation,” he said. Pseudoscience creators have built on the inherent velocity of social media platforms with tactics of their own. Many use shock and fear to make bogus health claims seem more urgent and credible. One video that Mughal debunked claimed that many people unknowingly have parasites living in their gut that cause chronic illnesses and that the solution is buying “parasitic cleansing kits.” Then there is “science-washing,” a term debunkers use to describe how pseudoscience creators deploy scientific-sounding language to weigh in on health issues, cherry-pick studies to support false claims or cite studies that seem relevant but are not. In TikTok’s beauty circles, Michelle Wong, a cosmetic chemist who runs Lab Muffin Beauty Science, a blog and social media accounts that explain the science behind skin care and cosmetic products, has made a new career out of fighting misinformation. She often encounters creators who take ingredients out of context, sometimes conflating topical use with ingestion – an important distinction, as consumers do not drink their moisturisers. Wong also sees pseudoscience creators who back up false, fearmongering claims about sunscreen with white papers the creators either do not have full access to or do not understand. “That in itself is quite convincing, because very few people are actually going to look up every single paper listed,” she said. The lack of science literacy online was partly what inspired Katrine Wallace, a public health researcher and a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, to start debunking inaccurate content on TikTok. At the start of the pandemic, she noticed that users were debating whether COVID was even real, and she has since debunked videos stating that COVID vaccines cause death within six months, for example, and that microscopic worms or parasites are found in surgical face masks. That topic recirculates every six months, she said in an interview, adding, “People are obsessed.” Viewers are drawn to surprising or extreme statements, and highly engaged content is promoted by the app’s algorithm, which is why debunkers often find themselves responding to provocative assertions. For the same reasons, myth-busting response videos like Dhahir’s on oral contraception often get more views than simple explainers. “People like drama,” Wallace said. In refuting claims, debunkers try to engage respectfully with other creators. Mughal said he refrained from insulting or attacking creators who disseminated misinformation and instead focused on addressing the health claims. Wallace takes a different approach. She said she would first reach out privately to the original poster to explain why the video is problematic and urge them to take it down or publicly address the misinformation. “And if they block me or delete my comments,” she said, “then I’m like, ‘OK, it’s on.’” ON THE BRINK OF BURNOUT? The business of debunking is time-consuming. Scripting, filming and editing, not to mention managing comments – which sometimes also breed misinformation when users share counterarguments – can take hours each day. To attract an audience, each video must accurately convey the science but must also be entertaining and approach the topic with nuance and sensitivity, all while grabbing the viewer’s attention within 15 seconds. When Wong was a full-time science educator, she found herself working an extra 30 hours a week creating content for social media and her blog. “It was just destroying my personal life,” she recalled, adding that her relationship with her partner had ended partly because she was spending so much time on content creation. It does not help that debunking often will not pay the bills, as many myth busters refrain from accepting sponsorships to prevent a conflict of interest. Wong accepts sponsorships, but like others who work with brands, she is selective, avoiding clients with deceptive marketing practices or cure-all claims. “It is possible to work with brands and still remain fact-based and science-based,” she said, but she acknowledged that “part of it is necessity – because debunking was taking up so many of my hours.” Wong quit her job in 2019 to devote herself full-time to Lab Muffin Beauty Science, but she still sometimes works up to 70 hours per week. “Science just takes so much longer than misinformation, because you have to do the research properly,” she said. Once a debunker has an audience, the work of maintaining and building an account can also lead to burnout. Like most influencers, they put pressure on themselves to excel. As Dr Austin Chiang, a gastroenterologist with more than 500,000 TikTok followers, explained, they often blame themselves if their content underperforms. “We think, is it because my messaging isn’t good?” he said. “Is it because the quality of the video isn’t good?” Wallace said the most exhausting element, though, was the harassment. Commenters repeatedly insult her, and when she posts in favor of vaccination, they accuse her of being a “shill for Big Pharma.” “I block accounts every day,” Wallace said. She also received threatening and sexually violent messages through her university email account – a situation that she said had required the university police to become involved early this year. For health care professionals, harassment can also lead to professional consequences or the fear of them. “Many people’s institutions don’t want them to be attracting tons of negative attention,” said Renée DiResta, a misinformation expert and the technical research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory, which studies internet propaganda. Doctors are encouraged to treat patients. Scientists are encouraged to conduct research and submit their findings for peer review. To create content on TikTok? Less so. Dhahir considered quitting TikTok after users found the address of his pharmacy and spread rumors about his professional and personal lives. He also had to meet with the dean of medicine at the University of Sydney and explain why the university had received complaints. Dhahir said he felt supported by his university but worried that that could change quickly. “One wrong move, and then my work can fire me or the university can kick me out,” he said. “I have to make sure I don’t screw up.” Mughal said he had heard from fellow doctors who balked at making educational content on social media lest complainers “get them into trouble.” “There’s not a lot of protection for health care professionals that make content for the public,” he said. Creators said they feared losing their licenses or memberships in professional associations. Doctors who work in private practice worry that critics will flood Yelp with negative reviews. DiResta stressed the importance of health experts engaging with the public on social media, but until there is stronger support from institutions, she hesitates to recommend that they do so. “They have to know what’s going to happen to them when they do it. That’s the problem,” she said. MANY SOLUTIONS, THOUGH NOT ALWAYS AGREEMENT  With debunker burnout on the horizon and a never-ending flow of pseudoscience, researchers said they needed more data to determine which strategies worked best for countering misinformation. Some say that TikTok should promote evidence-based health content on the “For You” page, the platform’s personalised feed of recommended content, so it does not get lost among similar-sounding videos pushing misinformation. Not everyone is eager to see a platform artificially elevating health experts, though. Dr Karan Raj, a surgeon for Britain’s National Health Service who has garnered 4.8 million followers on TikTok by discrediting claims like the warning that holding in gas causes appendicitis or that desiccant tablets found in pregnancy tests are a form of Plan B, argued that top-down promotion could erode audience trust. “People should want to watch content because they enjoy the content,” Raj said, insisting that videos needed to gain popularity of their own accord. “If I get on the ‘For You’ page, it’s because people like my content.” Richards pointed out that ensuring that a video from, say, the World Health Organisation gets millions of views does not ensure that the information will affect users, noting that impact is gauged through a mixed methodology that analyses several factors, including engagement, watch time and shares. Some researchers recommend that TikTok work with health organisations to identify experts who can explain complex health issues in layperson’s terms, as the platform did with COVID-19 efforts. Ciaran O’Connor, an analyst who studies disinformation at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, suggested that TikTok offer experts verified badges as a stamp of authority. But misinformation experts and creators alike argued that social media platforms are not solely responsible for amplifying accurate information. They want institutions and health departments to further invest in influencers. They also want stronger initiatives to support creators, like financial compensation, mental health resources or help handling harassment. “For all of the experts who are on there trying to put out high-quality information, if we want that to be sustainable for them, we need to be building infrastructure that doesn’t rely on the platforms,” Richards said. Right now, she said, “it’s viewed as a hobby, almost like charity work.” Despite the hurdles, debunkers do see their efforts paying off. Followers have told Wallace that they got vaccinated after watching her videos. Chiang heard from viewers who got screened for medical conditions they might have otherwise ignored. And Dhahir’s fans sometimes reach out to say thank you. “They’ll say, ‘I appreciate everything,’ or, ‘You’ve inspired me,’” Dhahir said. “Then I’ll be like, ‘You know what? This is actually worth it.’” By Rina Raphael © 2022 The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/bold-fitness-gym-filza-dorah-female-entrepreneur-bodybuilding-training-2739061,Meet the former bodybuilding champ and Bold Fitness gym owner who wants to make women stronger,"It’s not often that you meet a female gym owner, let alone one who looks as well put together as Filza Dorah Sim. While a toned physique is a given, I wasn’t expecting the makeup, complete with lip gloss and false lashes. “The way I see it, this is my place of work. It’s like when you go into the office and you put in effort to look professional.”  Sim first stepped into a gym when she was only 19 years old, fresh out of junior college. “I remember signing up at California Fitness because it was the hippest gym in town back then, and everyone wanted to go to that gym,” the 42-year-old recalled.  Unlike many people who sign up at a gym because they want to lose weight, Sim did it purely because she felt naturally inclined to do so – she did track and field in primary school, netball and basketball in secondary school, and touch rugby in junior college. Sim started with once-a-week sessions, but by the time she had graduated from university, had progressed to almost daily visits. She would commute every day from Woodlands where she worked as a teacher, to Orchard Road to get her workouts in. “It was my lifestyle. I was that gym rat.”  So what got Sim so hooked? “At that time, I really wanted to achieve that athletic and toned body. I wanted to be strong. I really don’t know where this desire came from. For sure, none of my family members or friends were interested in that. I wanted to be different.”  She started out with the elliptical machine, then graduated to weights because she wanted to become stronger.  She admits that she learnt most of her workouts either by referring to magazines, such as Men’s Health, or observing what the gym trainers were doing. “At that time, there was not much you could find on the Internet, so I learnt what I could from flipping through magazines, and by trial and error.” And each time, she would spend one to two hours in the gym. “I really enjoyed it so it didn’t feel like I was wasting time.” TURNING HER INTEREST INTO A JOB  Sim said her desire to become a personal trainer stemmed from the years she spent at the gym.  “I remember doing my workouts and noticing an influx of new trainers coming in. As I was observing how they were training people, I found myself thinking that I could do it and probably do it better. And that’s when it hit me that, ‘Hey, I should do this!’” Sim turned her thoughts into reality when she joined Fitness First in 2009 as a junior trainer. “I wanted to join a mega gym because I wanted to learn the whole system. It really helped me build my foundation as a trainer.” To become a certified trainer, she took a basic course that covered everything from nutrition for weight loss to the human anatomy and how the muscles work.  And to build up her profile further, she went on to take courses on specific workout machines like the TRX, as well as exercises to help with sports injuries and even pre- and post-natal training.   DOING IT ON HER OWN After spending four and a half years at Fitness First, Sim decided to go freelance. But that proved challenging – while there were perks to working for yourself, she recounted that she had to constantly look for gyms where she could train her clients.  “At that time, there were maybe two or three gyms in Singapore which freelance personal trainers could use. So facilities and rental-wise, it wasn’t very concrete.” Sim had to either go to her clients’ houses or use their condo gyms if they had one, or conduct training sessions outdoors. “It was hard not only for me as a trainer, but for my clients too,” she recounted There seemed to be one problem or another. “Sometimes the facilities aren’t good, like it’s a really old gym or a super small space, or sometimes management isn’t efficient.” But more importantly, Sim said that the biggest worry was that being a freelance trainer would not be sustainable in the long run.  The final straw came when one of the gyms Sim was training her clients at closed without notice. “When that happened, I told my husband that we should open our own gym. I knew that it would be difficult because neither of us had done business before, but I was really confident of my plan.” Sim, along with her personal trainer husband, roped in another partner and opened Bold Fitness in 2019.  Bold Fitness is a gym not only dedicated to personal training, with its staff of in-house trainers, but is also a space for freelance trainers to train with their clients. About 40 freelancers currently use the space.  “Think of Bold Fitness as a co-working space. We provide the space and facilities, and the freelance trainers pay rent for using the space and facilities.  “Between my husband, our business partner and I, we have over 50 years of personal training experience. We’ve worked at different gyms and we’ve a lot of experience with different clients and management, so we use that knowledge to serve our trainers now.” DARING TO BE DIFFERENT  Having always wanted to be different, the petite fitness enthusiast started competing in bodybuilding competitions at the age of 35, taking first place in the Women’s Athletic Physique Open category at the WBPF National Bodybuilding Championships in 2015.  “It stems from me wanting to be different. Since young, I’ve always challenged myself. And I was wondering how I could level up as a trainer, so why not compete because I could be one of the very few trainers who could add this to my portfolio,” Sim said.  It was a difficult journey, which saw Sim having to train three hours a day, six days a week, and going through an extremely strict diet for five to six months in the lead-up to a competition.  “I did a lot of very intense weight training and cardio as well. I did a lot of dieting as well, but it was not starving yourself … I had to eat chicken breast, lots of fish, vegetables and brown rice. The only seasonings I could have were salt and pepper. I couldn’t even have chilli sauce. It was hard, I even cried while dieting at times.” But due to her late start, Sim only did two rounds of competition before stopping. “About seven years ago, there weren’t many female bodybuilding competitors, but these days there are more, which is really good for the sport.” WOMEN POWER: THE IMPORTANCE OF STRENGTH TRAINING   Currently, 95 per cent of Sim’s clientele is made up of women. “I do enjoy training women. It’s always more fun to chit chat about shopping, makeup, motherhood, boyfriends and husbands.”  If there’s one thing that she would like to educate women about when it comes to exercise, it would be to encourage them to strength train.  “It’s not about lifting heavy weights to bulk up. The misconception is that if you do strength training, you’ll be really muscular. But that’s not true. It actually takes a really long time to build big muscles.” Strength training, she said, is about being able to function well. It’s also been scientifically proven to increase bone density, which is important as women age.  “If you’re in your 30s or 40s and you have weak knees or ankles, it’s not a good sign. You should be able to climb four flights of stairs without feeling like you’re going to collapse or having any pain in your knees. You should be able to carry your kids or groceries, or even your luggage off the baggage carousel without feeling a strain in your back,” she added. Plus, strength training also helps with fat burning as it increases your metabolism, she said. One of the common strength-training exercises Sim gets her female clients to do is deadlifts – where you lift a barbell or bar off the ground to the level of your hips.  “The movement of lifting the bar off the ground and placing it back down is an important exercise for women because it is very functional. It works on your strength and helps shape your legs and butt.  “And at least 90 per cent of the women I work with always tell me that they want to pay more attention to their behind,” she said.  WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH Sim says it’s important for her to have a body positive mindset – and even more so when she’s in the business of helping women achieve their body and fitness goals. She added that she has been body-shamed for her physique. “It hurts to hear people going ‘Eee… she’s so muscular’, especially when I’ve put in hard work to achieve the body I have today. And it’s not just men, sometimes I hear it from women too,” she said.  She’s also seen men start flexing when they see her. “It left me amused, but also uncomfortable because I felt like I was being somewhat shamed for the way I looked.” Sim added that it’s sad that she, or any woman, should be made to feel this way.  “While you can’t stop people from passing judgement, it is equally important to remember to celebrate your achievements, especially knowing how hard you’ve worked to get there,” she emphasised.  And this is something that she imparts to her children as well. “I want to show them that it’s normal for women to want to be strong, to go out for a run and to be sweaty,” said the mother of two step-daughters and a son.  Ultimately, Sim said that body positivity to her simply means having a strong and healthy body. “Accept your body the way you want it, and be confident in knowing that what you’ve achieved is from all the hard work you’ve put in. It’s something no one can take away from you.” CNA Women is a section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/heat-immune-system-drink-water-fall-sick-2770461,Can Singapore’s hot weather make you prone to falling sick more easily?,"Despite news of more rainy days to come in the next few months, let’s face it: It is always hot in Singapore. That’s what you get for being located just 137km north of the equator (hello, full-on blast from the sun).  It also doesn’t help that we’ve been hitting record highs in temperature this year. In May, there were 22 days with a daily maximum temperature exceeding 34 degrees Celsius. A month before that, we were sweating to a daily maximum temperature of at least 35 degrees Celsius for seven days.   Dehydration and heat stroke are very real scenarios in this part of the world, especially if you work or exercise outdoors. Most of us already know the tricks to stay cool and hydrated: Drink more water, stay in the shade, switch on the fan or air-conditioner, and dress in light, breathable clothes.  But what about the notion that the heat can make you fall sick more readily? It may be widely accepted as a concept rooted in traditional Chinese medicine philosophies but on the conventional medical front, does it hold water?  HOW YOUR BODY REGULATES TEMPERATURE Your body likes to keep its core temperature at around 37 degrees Celsius (give or take a degree or two). It’s the optimal temperature for your organs to function: Too cold and you may develop hypothermia; too hot and you’ll be hit with hyperthermia. Both are potentially life-threatening conditions and can happen when your body fails to heat-regulate.  To keep you alive and well, your body will do whatever it takes to maintain that desired temperature, according to Medical News Today. And it does that by constantly monitoring the temperature changes that affect your body, from the iced latte you just drank to the sweltering heat that greets you when you step outside. This process is known as thermoregulation and its control centre is the hypothalamus in your brain. Once temperature deviations are detected, the hypothalamus sends out instructions for your body to act accordingly. It pumps out sweat and dilates the blood vessels to cool down the body and dissipate the heat. When it gets cold, it induces shivering to generate more body heat and constricts the blood vessels to keep the heat in.  CAN TEMPERATURE CHANGES MAKE YOU FALL SICK EASILY? Based on those rules set by your body’s internal thermostat, would experiencing fluctuating temperatures cause it to go haywire and you to fall ill easily?  After all, many people have resumed working in the office and scenarios such as exiting an extremely cold building to get lunch in the infernal heat of the midday sun, then heading back into subartic temperatures again are being played out every day – except now, the heat outside is more searing than before as we've established earlier on. Coconut water has gained the reputation of a natural isotonic drink as it contains electrolytes and sugar. In reality though, the electrolyte content of coconut water is low compared to dedicated isotonic drinks. “In theory, it should not affect our immune system as our core temperature is quite well regulated,” said Dr Derek Li, a family physician with Raffles Medical. “The core temperature is kept within a narrow range, despite potentially large fluctuations in ambient temperature.”  Having said that, Dr Li added that our immune system is certainly sensitive to temperature changes “to some extent”.  For one, people who are prone to allergies do not tolerate large temperature fluctuations well as the heat can “trigger flares of conditions like asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis”. These allergies are also thought to “stem from an inherently over-active immune system”.  Another example that our immune system is sensitive to heat is that it actually functions optimally at slightly higher temperatures and “this is also why we have evolved to develop a fever to fight infections”, said Dr Li.  What about extended periods of running hot, say, hours spent cycling on the PCN? Will our immune system burst into flames like an overheated Ferrari? “Whether prolonged periods of high temperatures have a negative impact, akin to how a car engine overheats, have not been well studied,” said Dr Li.  He said that there have been extensive studies on how heat stress affects the immune system of livestock but such studies are limited in human populations. “Human studies tend to focus on how cold conditions negatively impact immune function,” he said. “It is tempting to extrapolate the data we have from livestock studies (and apply it) to humans but the simple truth is, we don't have enough formal studies on humans in this area.” DOES DRINKING ENOUGH WATER HELP TO BOOST OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM? First, we have to understand how the lymphatic system works. Think of our blood vessels as roads and the different types of cells such as red blood and white blood cells as vehicles, said Dr Li. “The lymphatic system is the main sewage and drainage system that runs parallel to all the roads. It picks up excess water overflowing from the roads and funnels it back into the main system in specific parts of the body.”  That’s not all the lymphatic system does. “It also serves as a sort of transport network for the body's white blood cells, which make up the backbone of our immune system,” said Dr Li. “If the lymphatic system doesn't work, white blood cells can't get to where they need to be to fight an infection and that can prevent us from fighting off infections properly.” So, in theory, not drinking enough water can affect the function of the immune system “because all the systems are dependent on water to flow smoothly”, said Dr Li. “However, one would expect core systems like the blood pressure and heart function to be badly impacted first, long before any substantial impact on the immune system is felt. The immune function is among the last things to be impacted.” Still, that’s not your excuse to skip filling up your bottle. “Hydration is key to general health insofar as one is adequately hydrated,” said Dr Li.  BEST WAY TO HYDRATE? We know, water is tasteless and unexciting to drink – until you are thirsty. That’s when every drop becomes as delicious as mother’s milk to an infant. In such situations, how would factors such as fluid temperature and electrolyte make-up help to cool and hydrate you better?  They “only come into play when conditions need correcting” such as heat stress and dehydration, said Dr Li. In such medical situations, it may be more beneficial to consume cold fluids with electrolytes than just plain water. These “conditions” are certainly different from the usual complaints of “why is the air-con not strong enough?” or “I’m not really thirsty; just craving bubble tea”. “In 99 per cent of the time, people are fine drinking regular plain water,” said Dr Li."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/taiwan-monkeypox-first-imported-case-man-germany-study-2768771,Taiwan confirms first imported case of monkeypox,"TAIPEI: Taiwan's government on Friday (Jun 24) confirmed its first imported case of monkeypox, a man in his 20s who had studied in Germany from January until June this year when he returned to the island. Taiwan's Centres for Disease Control said the man flew back to Taiwan on Jun 16 and returned home for mandatory COVID-19 quarantine for all arrivals. On Jun 20, he developed symptoms including a fever, sore throat and a rash and sought medical attention, where he was tested and confirmed to have monkeypox, it added in a statement. He is now being treated in an isolation ward and his close contacts are showing no symptoms, it said. In the Asia Pacific, Singapore, South Korea and Australia have also all reported cases. More than 40 countries where monkeypox is not endemic have reported outbreaks of the viral disease as confirmed cases exceed 3,000. Monkeypox, which spreads through close contact and was first found in monkeys, mostly occurs in west and central Africa and only very occasionally spreads elsewhere."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/justin-bieber-ramsay-hunt-syndrome-facial-paralysis-chickenpox-virus-2760711,What’s the link between chickenpox and Justin Bieber’s facial paralysis? Are you at risk?,"You don’t have to be a Belieber (that’s Justin Bieber’s fandom) to believe that the Canadian pop singer has a serious health trouble. In the widely-reported Instagram video he posted on Jun 10, the Grammy-winning artiste detailed the partial facial paralysis that has affected his ability to blink, smile and move his nostril and cheek on the right side of his face.  The Honest singer mentioned that his facial weakness or palsy was the result of Ramsay Hunt syndrome, which is caused by the varicella zoster virus – the same bug that leads to chickenpox. And according to Dr Ng Chew Lip, a consultant ENT (ear, nose and throat) surgeon at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (NTFGH), who is trained in facial plastic surgery, Bieber’s condition “is pretty severe”. “Based on the House-Brackmann score, which we use to grade facial paralysis from one to six (one is normal and six is complete paralysis), the upper part of his face is a five and the lower part is about a four,” he said.  WHAT ARE YOUR ODDS OF GETTING FACIAL PARALYSIS?  Since the virus that caused Bieber's condition is the same one that leads to something as common as chickenpox, you might be wondering: How likely are you to develop facial palsy if you've had the latter? For the majority of recovered people, the varicella zoster virus is likely to be still lingering in the body in a very dormant state, said Dr Ng. “The virus likes to reside in the nerves and is very hard to eradicate. But for most people, it doesn’t cause any problem.” In fact, Ramsay Hunt syndrome’s incidence is considered rare – five per 100,000 in the US population. Locally, Dr Ng sees about 10 to 20 cases a year.  Trouble arises when you are immuno-compromised and the virus seizes the opportunity to reactivate. You could be feeling very overwhelmed at work, or in Bieber’s case, perhaps stressed over the preparations for his world tour. “Or sometimes, it just happens without any reason,” said Dr Ng. Depending on which nerve the virus reactivates in, it can result in shingles – a single stripe of painful blisters that wraps around either the left or the right side of the torso. “The reason why shingles present in this way is because there is a nerve that coils around the trunk like a snake. The virus travels along this nerve, causing injury and damage to it.” Or in the singer’s case, the varicella zoster virus chose to strike the nerves on the right side of his face. There are five branches of nerves on each side of the face and each branch is responsible for animating a different part: The forehead, around the eye, mid face, mouth and neck.  “Facial palsy can affect all five or any of the nerve branches, depending on how severe the nerve injury is,” said Dr Ng. “When that happens, the signals from the brain do not get transmitted to the facial muscles and movements are disrupted.” OTHER CAUSES THAT CAN PARALYSE YOUR FACE The virus that causes Ramsey Hunt syndrome isn't the only one that can lead to facial paralysis. There are others such as the herpes simplex virus (it causes cold sores and genital herpes) and even the influenza virus. “We do see patients who have facial palsy after having a flu and they would have one or more affected branches of the facial nerves,” said Dr Ng. Not every case of facial palsy can be traced to a known virus though. In such instances, doctors diagnose the unexplained facial muscle weakness as Bell’s palsy. “We don’t have any local data. In general, one in 65 people would have Bell’s palsy in their lifetime at least once. We see a number of such cases every week,” said Dr Ng. About 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the motor cortex (the part of your brain that controls movement) is devoted to facial movements. The reason your face gets allocated such a high CPU power is that there are 23 muscles and five branches of nerves on each side of your face. Together, they produce more than 2,000 facial expressions. He added: “Ramsay Hunt syndrome is more severe than Bell’s palsy in my experience, with more severe facial paralysis and poorer recovery. The worst case I have seen was a patient who was admitted for seizures from Ramsay Hunt syndrome, developed varicella zoster meningitis (inflammation of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord) and had to be treated in the ICU”. In patients with recurrent facial palsy over a short period of time, other causes need to be sought, such as nerve tumours, fibrous dysplasia, sarcoidosis and a very rare disease called Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, he said. As for the chart-topping singer, there are good and bad prognoses, according to Dr Ng. ""The good thing is, he is 28 years old, so he is young and can recover well. The bad factor is, Ramsay Hunt syndrome patients don't recover as well as those with Bell's palsy. But with his age and early treatment, he should recover very well. It may take weeks or months before he recovers fully."" WHAT ARE THE PROCEDURES AVAILABLE? Medication, especially for viral attacks on the nerve, forms the first line of treatment. “Studies have strongly supported that you need to get treated within three days for optimal prognosis and recovery,” said Dr Ng. Two kinds of medicine are commonly prescribed: High-dose oral steroids (1mg per 1kg of body weight) and anti-viral medication.  Physiotherapy is also used. ""Treatment includes facial massage, stretching and strengthening exercises,"" said Kelly Chan, NTFGH's principal physiotherapist. ""For mild impairment, recovery can be expected within a month. For moderate to severe impairment, recovery can range from three to six months. The prognosis and chance of recovery for most of the cases are significant."" It is only when the muscle weakness doesn’t turn around in six to 12 months that doctors consider the use of plastic surgery. “About 20 per cent of patients do not recover fully,” said Dr Ng. “These are usually elderly patients with poor regenerative potential and those with comorbidities like diabetes, for example.” Here’s a look at the various procedures available to restore the facial muscles’ functions, according to Dr Ng: UPPER FACE Targets: Droopy brow that obscures vision.  How: In the minimally invasive endoscopic brow lift, three small incisions are made behind the hairline. This allows the surgeon to insert the endoscope underneath the skin, reach the brow and separate skin from bone. Dissolvable bio-hooks are then implanted on the bone to let the surgeon anchor the skin at a higher position, creating a lifted effect. The direct brow lift works on the same principle of lifting and securing the brow at a higher position, except that an incision is made directly above the brow. Excess tissue is removed and the area is stitched up. The direct brow lift provides a better lift that lasts longer than the endoscopic method but it can also scar more.  Targets: Upper eyelid that doesn’t close completely, leading to dry eye and visual impairment. How: Bits of platinum are implanted into the skin of the upper eyelid to weigh it down. The implants weigh between 0.6g and 2g each, and can be in chain or solid form. Gold implants are sometimes used but platinum is preferred as it is denser.  Targets: Lax lower eyelid that can also lead to dry eye and visual impairment.  How: This tightening procedure basically snips off a bit of the tarsal plate, which is a dense connective tissue that forms the supporting structure of the lower eyelid (FYI, the tarsal plate is also found in the upper eyelid), tightens up the loose lid and secures the tighter tarsal plate to the bone. MID FACE: NOSE AND CHEEKS Targets: Collapsed nasal muscles that impede breathing.  How: When you breathe, the nasal muscles and valves on both sides of your nose are activated to prop up the nasal passages like the rafters in the roof. But if the muscles are paralysed, the nasal valves and passages remain narrow and you can't breathe well.  To prop up the collapsed nasal passage, donor cartilage or cartilage harvested from your nose, ear or rib is used. The “support” can be inserted at the lateral side of the nose or down the middle of the nose.  Targets: Lopsided or droopy cheek that pulls down the corner of the mouth. How: There are opposing forces provided by the various muscles in your face known as elevators and depressors. Take the brow, for example. The elevators lift your brows when you look surprised, and the depressors pull the brows down when you close your eyes.  When these opposing forces are in balance, your features look symmetrical whether your face is at rest or smiling. But when the elevators are weakened by paralysis, for example, the depressors pull down unopposed. If this happens to your cheek, it ends up drooping and pulls the corner of the mouth along with it.  Botulinum toxin or botox can be injected into the cheek to restore symmetry. It does this by weakening the muscles on the functional or unparalysed side. By weakening these muscles, the smile looks more balanced.  Botox can be used for all parts of the face for the same purpose but only if the paralysis is mild. Also, you’ll need maintenance injections every couple of months.  LOWER FACE: MOUTH  Targets: Lopsided smile and other mouth movements. How: First, the skin and soft tissues is surgically lifted off the face. Then, a sling is attached to pull up the the mouth up and back to restore the symmetry of the face.  This sling can be created using a band of fibrous tissue taken from the thigh known as the fascia lata; the temporalis, a muscle from the side of the face; or it can be a synthetic material. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/advertorial/optimise-your-joint-health-2745436,Optimise your joint health,"When people think about health, they often concentrate on visible factors like muscles and fat. However, paying attention to other factors like your skeletal and joint health is just as important as hitting the gym or maintaining a balanced diet. A popular misconception is that joint pain only occurs in the elderly. In reality, even people in their thirties may have joint pain due to surprisingly common factors like excessive running, which can cause cartilage to wear down over time. How do you know if your joint health is at risk, and how can you approach loving your joints in order to live life to the fullest? UNDERSTANDING THE UNSEEN An underlying reason for joint pain is indeed related to age. As one ages, joints become stiffer as the lubricating fluids within decrease and cartilage becomes thinner. Ligaments also tend to shorten with age, which reduces flexibility. Cartilage damage can also happen in young people, especially those who exercise too much. This is particularly true of high-impact, weight-bearing activities such as running, jogging and jumping. That said, a lack of exercise can lead to joint pain as well. This is because excess weight can put stress on joints and cause knee pain, while being inactive can cause muscles, ligaments and joints to weaken. Low-impact exercise such as swimming, walking, cycling, yoga and pilates can help to keep your joints lubricated. Common conditions like arthritis and gout can have a major impact on joint health. Arthritis is the swelling and tenderness of one or more joints, while gout is a form of arthritis resulting from hyperuricemia – a condition where excessive uric acid builds up in areas such as the knees and toes. LOVE YOUR BONES AND JOINTS Your joints are just as important to your well-being as every other part of your body – so care for them and seek medical attention as appropriate. If left unchecked, long-term joint pain can affect your ability to do everyday tasks. Fatigue is also a common outcome. Little tweaks can go a long way towards the prevention and management of joint pain. You can start by using discretion during physical activity, such as stretching before exercise and avoiding overloading joints with heavy weights. Other small adjustments range from building muscle progressively and evenly to maintaining good posture, whether it’s while walking or sitting at your desk. MASTER NUTRITION TO MASTER YOUR LIFESTYLE When it comes to bone and joint health, the adage that you are what you eat is doubly true. For example, fatty fish like salmon can be a good source of Omega-3 fatty acids, which help keep joints healthy. Consuming dairy products can raise your calcium intake while leafy greens help to promote Vitamin D levels – both of which are vital nutrients that keep your bones strong. To boost your intake of essential vitamins and minerals, consider dietary supplements. Containing glucosamine, MSM (methylsulfonylmethane), chondroitin and fish collagen peptides from Japan, 21st Century Healthcare’s Collasamine supplement is formulated to support and maintain healthy joints, give relief to joint discomfort and help in cartilage renewal. Available in convenient sachets, Collasamine can be easily incorporated into daily diets as a drink before or after a meal. 21st Century Healthcare’s products are made in the United States and are approved by the country’s Food & Drug Administration board after annual inspections and audits to assure consumers of high manufacturing standards and quality in its products. Take a holistic approach to self-care with health and dietary supplements from 21st Century Healthcare.  Consult a healthcare professional before starting a new vitamin or supplement routine."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/young-women-breast-pain-lumps-sagging-nipple-discharge-2738901,"From lumps to breast pain, what should women in their 20s do to keep their breasts healthy?","Younger women, such as those in their 20s, are usually less concerned about getting breast cancer, and doctors agree that there is little to be alarmed about. Only 10 per cent of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients are below the age of 40, even though the disease is the most common form of cancer among Singapore women. What can younger women do then, when it comes to their breast health? Start by doing regular breast self-examination (BSE), which helps you understand your breasts better and figure out when to worry if you observe something new or different. For example, what does it mean when you feel a lump in your breast? Lumps aside, women also frequently wonder: Why do my breasts suddenly hurt outside of my period? Should I be concerned if the texture of the skin suddenly looks different? CNA Women spoke to Dr Lee Wai Peng and Dr Lim Siew Kuan, both senior consultants and breast surgeons from Solis Breast Care and Surgery Centre, about the different things a woman may observe in her breasts, how to tell when something is amiss, and what to do about it. BREAST PAIN Breast pain – a feeling of fullness and soreness over the upper and outer parts of the breasts – is usually associated with hormonal fluctuations during your period. It usually occurs before and during the start of the period.  But what if your breasts hurt outside of your period? Try fixing your posture, said Dr Lim, adding that among her patients, the most common cause of non-cyclical breast pain is musculoskeletal pain, which may be caused by slouching over one’s devices. A muscle called the pectoralis major sits just behind the breasts. Dr Lim explained that when you slouch, this muscle can be strained and the pain can feel as if it is coming from the breast.  Both Dr Lee and Dr Lim also observed that stress can also cause hormone imbalances, akin to how it affects menstruation, leading to breast pain.  When should you seek help? It is uncommon for breast pain to be a symptom of early breast cancer, said Dr Lim.  However, she added that if the pain persists past menstruation or continues even after you’ve made a shift to a less stressful lifestyle, its likely cause could be a lump – breast lumps that are bigger in size may cause tenderness in the area.  Sometimes, removing the lump through surgery may be the optimal solution to ending the pain, said Dr Lim. In any case, you should visit a general practitioner to get persistent breast pain assessed.  BREAST LUMPS The most important thing to know here: “Eighty per cent of breast lumps tend to be benign or non-cancerous, but breast lumps still warrant a check with the doctor to ascertain whether it is benign or malignant,” said Dr Lee. “Malignant lumps tend to be more firm and less mobile, but it is difficult for a lay person to ascertain this,” Dr Lim added. She also said that both benign and malignant lumps can happen anywhere that you have breast tissue, even at the armpits. When it comes to malignant lumps, there is no one position or size, so it can be hard to tell its severity just by feeling. They are also random in size, so even a small lump could be cancerous.  Dr Lee added that most breast cancer lumps have no pain. Pro-tip from Dr Lim: You should also observe whether the lumpiness exists on both sides of the breast. If it does, it may just be the structure of your breasts. But if it is asymmetrical – it does not feel the same on the other side – it could be a sign that the lumpiness is not normal and you should seek medical advice.  “Hormonal levels change throughout the menstrual cycle, and this is the reason why women feel different degrees of lumpiness throughout the month”, said Dr Lim, who recommended that the best time to do breast self-checks is seven to 10 days after your menstruation, as any hormonal-related lumpiness would have subsided by then.   If the lump is persistently present past menstruation, she added, you should see a doctor about it.  A simple visit to a general practitioner can help assess the situation and get you a referral to a breast specialist, who can do a follow-up scan, such as a breast ultrasound, to assess the area. Ultrasounds can show detailed images of the breast tissue, revealing lumps or cysts.  UNEVEN BREAST SHAPE Breast development happens in stages, between the ages of 10 to 15. If the breasts remain uneven in shape past puberty, giving them a lopsided appearance, it is unlikely that they will even out naturally, said Dr Lee.  Will eating papaya or soy, or using over-the-counter bust creams help? These have no scientific basis for changing breast structure, Dr Lee said. According to her, sometimes, poor habits such as slouching can cause one breast to look smaller than the other too.  UNEVEN BREAST SIZE Hormonal changes when you’re on your period can account for unevenness in breast size across the month. Said Dr Lee: “Pre-menses, they may feel like a bit of engorgement, a bit of distended breasts. But actually the volume is the same – it’s just the feeling of it being bigger.”  When should you worry about uneven breast size? Dr Lee suggested that if you’re past puberty and observe a sudden asymmetry in your breast, you may have a breast lump; in some cases, breast cancer can also cause the breasts to be asymmetrical.  In both instances, it’s best to visit a breast specialist who can evaluate and conduct imaging scans to confirm the condition.  SAGGING BREASTS  Sagging breasts are associated with several factors, including age, pregnancy, breastfeeding and massive weight loss, and are unlikely to indicate any signs of an underlying medical problem, said Dr Lim.  Menopause, between the ages of 45 and 50, is also a factor. Dr Lim explained that this stage of a woman’s life leads to a decrease in hormone levels – the breasts become less fibrous and sagging occurs. Changes to the breast during breastfeeding also contribute to sagging. “To produce milk, the breast tissue is thicker and fuller, so the skin stretches to accommodate the larger breast volume. Once breastfeeding is over, the tissue decreases its volume and size, which could cause it to sag,” Dr Lim explained.  And what about bras? Dr Lee said that contrary to popular belief, bras – whether wired or non-wired, or even, not worn at all – play no role in changing the structure of your breasts, or preventing or hastening sagging.  “All bras out there are to provide comfort. It doesn’t actually prevent sagging because it's a natural progression,” Dr Lee said.  However, if you have sagging breasts, she advised that wearing a bra can make your breasts feel more supported, reducing the feeling of being “dragged” or weighed down, particularly during rigorous activities such as running. Here’s what to look out for when it comes to buying a well-fitted bra, the doctors advised:  BUMPS ON THE NIPPLE Spotted little skin-coloured bumps around the areola? These are natural oil glands known as Montgomery glands and everyone has them, although they may be more prominent in some women than others, said Dr Lim.  “Sometimes they may get infected and look like a pimple. They are usually benign but if it’s very painful or if there’s pus from the infection, then you have to see the doctor,” she added. NIPPLE SIZE AND COLOUR Different women have different nipple size and colour, and these can change during periods of hormonal fluctuations, for example during puberty, pregnancy or if you’re breastfeeding.  Dr Lim said the changes are “usually bilateral and fairly symmetrical”, meaning that both nipples should exhibit the symptoms. NIPPLE DISCHARGE There should be no nipple discharge for women who are not breastfeeding, Dr Lim said.  Dr Lee suggested that women look out for bloody nipple discharge, persistent ulcers around the nipple and discoloured patches. Although rare, these could be a manifestation of breast cancer that is situated near the nipple, she said.  Bloody nipple discharge can also be due to a small benign growth known as intraductal papilloma, she said. And apart from cancer, ulcers and discoloured patches could sometimes be due to poorly treated eczema.  As many similar symptoms run across both benign and malignant conditions, it’s difficult for a woman to make a self-diagnosis – the doctors recommend that women get a medical check-up once any abnormality is seen in the nipple.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/monkeypox-spread-countries-epidemic-outbreaks-transmissible-who-2762476,Commentary: Four ways the monkeypox outbreak can play out,"GLASGOW, Scotland: The first case of monkeypox in a human was reported in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Since then, there have been many monkeypox outbreaks, but they have been self-limiting, with chains of human transmission ending without establishing epidemics.  The current outbreak, however, is different. There is more human-to-human transmission, and it is over a much broader geographical area. In mere weeks, monkeypox has spread to 37 non-endemic countries, with over 2,600 cases. So, what is likely to happen to monkeypox in the following weeks and months? There are huge gaps in what we know about monkeypox, but combining what we do know with a history of other infectious diseases makes it possible to analyse likely future scenarios. The four scenarios below are based on the following knowledge: The average number of people an infected person is likely to infect (assuming they have not been vaccinated against the virus or had the disease before) is 2.13. This is called the basic reproduction number, or R.  Herd immunity – the point at which enough people have immunity such that disease transmission can’t be sustained – is 53 per cent. And the incubation period, the time from catching the virus to the appearance of symptoms, is between five and 21 days. The 2022 epidemic appears to have started as a super-spreader event involving a network of predominantly men who had sex with men. But until the current outbreak, it was assumed that the relatively low human-to-human transmissibility of the virus makes it unlikely for the virus to spread outside the initial community. In this scenario, the outbreak ends quickly once the population at risk becomes immune and herd immunity is reached locally. In the past, many people had some immunity (called cross-immunity) from the smallpox mass vaccination programmes of the late 20th century.  So the effective reproduction number, R, can be close to or even lower than one, and the transmission will soon stop. Behavioural changes can reduce the number R even more. For example, the ring vaccination can form a “firebreak”, further reducing the susceptible population.  Similar previous epidemics include the SARS outbreak from 2002 to 2004, when a quick intervention stopped the disease from spreading. The continuing spread of monkeypox in May and June suggests that the virus is moving beyond the original network. The size of the outbreak is already well beyond the most prominent 2017 to 2019 outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (760 cases). It is possible that large gatherings, including raves and festivals, have created new transmission clusters. This scenario assumes that everybody below the age of 50 is susceptible to the infection, reflecting the end of compulsory smallpox vaccination from the 1970s to 1980s. The virus will continue spreading, effectively searching for pockets of high-risk and non-immune communities. Unless a combination of contact tracing and ring vaccination stops the spread, the monkeypox will continue spreading. But, given the low transmissibility of monkeypox, the epidemic may fizzle out before reaching the herd immunity threshold of 50 per cent of the population. Complete eradication is impossible because monkeypox exists in a wide range of animal hosts. The low transmissibility also means it can survive at low levels in the population. In addition, the long incubation period and variable symptoms allow it to avoid detection. Therefore, monkeypox may have already been spreading for a long time. In this scenario, following the large outbreak, the disease will settle on a long-term, relatively constant level, similar to pre-vaccination smallpox or chickenpox. The influx of susceptible people through birth or migration will keep the virus in the population. Mass vaccination programmes might be needed to eradicate the disease. But relatively low monkeypox transmissibility means such programmes are likely to be highly effective. The current epidemic might be the first instance of a series of outbreaks. In the long term, we should expect a return of monkeypox caused by future “zoonotic events” where the disease jumps from animal hosts to humans. As the cross-immunity from smallpox vaccines wanes, the epidemics can become even more substantial. Little is known about the potential of monkeypox to mutate. Still, there is potential for it to evolve into a more rapidly spreading variant. Effective vaccines for monkeypox exist and are about 85 per cent effective. Although there are currently not enough doses to vaccinate everyone, there is no need for a mass-vaccination programme given monkeypox’s low transmissibility.  Instead, vaccines should be offered to those most at risk, including communities in Africa most in contact with the wild animals that carry the virus.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/british-airways-monkeypox-singapore-authorities-air-crew-quarantine-2763016,British Airways working closely with Singapore authorities over monkeypox case,"SINGAPORE: British Airways said on Wednesday (Jun 22) that it is working closely with Singapore health authorities after the country confirmed one imported case of monkeypox. It was responding to CNA’s queries on British media reports that an entire aircrew from the airline was quarantined after a cabin member tested positive for the disease. The Daily Mail reported that two pilots and nine cabin crew members have all been put in quarantine for 21 days. The crew had been on the flight from London to Sydney, which goes via Singapore.  “We’re working closely with the Singapore Health Authorities and have offered assistance with any information they require,” said British Airways in a statement.  “We’re in contact with our crew and providing the necessary support.” The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Tuesday confirmed one imported case of monkeypox infection in Singapore, a 42-year-old British national who works as a flight attendant.  The man was in Singapore between Jun 15 and Jun 17, and again on Jun 19 as he flew in and out of Singapore, said MOH. He tested positive for monkeypox on Jun 20.  He had an onset of headache on Jun 14 and a fever on Jun 16. These symptoms later resolved, and he then developed skin rashes on Jun 19. The man sought medical attention via teleconsultation on the night of Jun 19, and was then taken to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Jun 20 for further assessment. The man is currently warded at NCID and his condition is stable, said MOH. Contact tracing is ongoing.  “Contact tracing is ongoing for the affected flights and for the duration of his stay in Singapore. During this period, he had largely remained in his hotel room, except to visit a massage establishment, and eat at three food establishments on Jun 16,” the Health Ministry added.  All four locations visited by the man were also undergoing cleaning and disinfection.  As of Jun 21, a total of 13 close contacts have been identified. All close contacts will be placed in quarantine for 21 days since their last contact with the case, said MOH.  In addition, two low-risk contacts were placed on phone surveillance.  In response to CNA's queries, a British High Commission spokesperson said on Friday that it has offered consular support to a British national in Singapore and is in touch with the local authorities. Earlier in June, a traveller who transited through Singapore to Australia tested positive for monkeypox. The man departed from Barcelona on Jun 1 and arrived at Changi Airport the following day. He remained in the transit holding area at Changi Airport until his departure for Sydney on the same day. He did not visit other areas in Changi Airport, said MOH.  Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said in May that it should not be a surprise if Singapore detects a monkeypox case in the coming weeks, as people in the country travel widely and also due to its position as a commercial and international hub.  However, he assured that Singapore has in place the necessary protocols and public health measures, triggered by an imported case in 2019."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/south-korea-reports-first-suspected-monkeypox-cases-2762061,South Korea reports first suspected monkeypox cases,"SEOUL: South Korea on Wednesday (Jun 22) said the first two suspected cases of monkeypox virus have been reported in the country, adding that diagnostic tests were being conducted and health authorities will hold a briefing once the tests were completed. One of the people with suspected monkeypox, a foreign national who reportedly showed potential symptoms since Sunday, entered the country on Monday and is currently under treatment in an isolation bed at a hospital in the city of Busan, about 300km southeast of the capital Seoul. The other, a Korean citizen who showed symptoms while entering the country from Germany on Tuesday afternoon, has been admitted to Incheon Medical Center for treatment. ""Diagnostic tests and epidemiological investigations on the monkeypox are being conducted and the health authority will swiftly hold a briefing to announce measures and response plans once the results are out,"" the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said in a statement. KDCA, however, did not give further details of the individuals. Earlier this month, South Korea designated monkeypox as a second-degree infectious disease, according to its four-tier system, with 22 contagious diseases including COVID-19, cholera and chickenpox being included in the same category."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/mattress-cleaning-tips-dust-mites-steam-cleaning-sunning-vaccuming-2752906,Millions of dust mites living in your mattress (and their poop) could be causing your allergies,"Remember when we would leave the tilam or mattress out in the sun to get rid of “germs”? We’d give it a few hard smacks afterwards for good measure, and consider the mattress cleaning part of the day done and dusted.  Fast forward to 2022 when the COVID-19 pandemic still looms over our heads and everyone's more concerned about hygiene. Are those methods now considered archaic and ineffective? Are you better off using the vacuum cleaner on your mattress? Superficial stains aside, there are deeper reasons why there’s a need to clean your mattress: Allergies caused by dust mites. According to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, dust mites may be the most common trigger of year-round allergies and asthma. WHO ARE YOU SLEEPING WITH? Considering the amount of time you spend on the mattress (you do spend about a third of your life sleeping or attempting to), we don’t clean it enough, at least according to a Dyson survey involving more than 32,000 respondents from 33 countries. This annual global study found that close to seven in 10 Singaporeans do not vacuum their mattresses (we’ll cover whether vacuuming helps later) despite the fact that these places are hotbeds for dust mites. That’s right. Every night, you’re cosying up with millions of these companions in a single mattress. And do they love you.  Dust mites are eight-legged, microscopic (each about one-third of a millimetre) bugs that feed on human dander (we are known to shed about 5.7g of dead skin a day) as well as on the mould that thrive on this all-you-can-eat buffet that is your dead skin, body oil, sweat and dust, said Associate Professor Chew Fook Tim from National University of Singapore’s Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science.  They may seem like your personal clean-up crew but the effect is far from that. Dust mites and their faeces – along with the mould that grow on the accumulated mix of dust, dead skin, body oil and sweat – don’t spell good news for those who react to this allergy trifecta, said Assoc Prof Chew.  OH, CRAP… Yes, dust mite faeces – not just the mites themselves – are a source of allergen or trigger for runny nose, watery eyes, sneezing and in severe cases, asthma or eczema flare-ups. It is a fact that not many Singaporeans know, going by the Dyson survey: Only 30 per cent are aware that dust mite faeces can be an allergy trigger. “There are more than 30 to 40 different allergens that have since been identified to be capable of triggering allergic symptoms to varying extent in different individuals,” said Assoc Prof Chew. And some of these allergens are courtesy of the dust mites. For instance, meet Der p 1. This major allergen is mostly found in mite faeces, said Assoc Prof Chew. “There are many more allergens – Der p 2, Der p 3 and so on – that can be found on the bodies of the mites themselves. Some are the enzymes that are part of the mites’ gut system, while others make up different parts of the mites’ overall system.” If you have allergies, you probably have this major allergen found in mite faeces to thank (or maybe not). “Der p 1” is derived from:  Now that you know what you are dealing with, what are your options that can effectively control the dust mite situation in your mattress? “Some research indicates that any one single method of environmental control and mite-reduction method may not be effective,” said Assoc Prof Chew. Instead, you’ll do better with a combination of various methods.  But having said that, “dust mites are ubiquitous” and there is no way you can achieve Mite Population: 0, reminded Assoc Prof Chew. A more sensible approach is to minimise the mite levels, so that you have better control over your allergies. Here’s a look at the methods available and how they stack up: HYPOALLERGENIC AND ANTI-MITE PRODUCTS These mattresses and bedlinen may be treated or embedded with acaricidal (anti-mite), anti-fungal and/or anti-bacterial chemicals. However, such properties would wane over a few years – some faster than others, said Assoc Prof Chew.  Sometimes, they are made of breathable materials such as cotton or bamboo, which do not encourage the accumulation of humidity. “Dust mites thrive in high humidity, between 75 per cent to 80 per cent,” said Assoc Prof Chew, along with mould, which is a source of food for the mites.  Another method is the use of tightly woven fabrics that act as a barrier and supposedly do not allow the mites to pass through. “But such materials may not stay tightly woven over time, and in any case, the allergens that trigger the allergic symptoms are much smaller than the individual mite themselves,” said Assoc Prof Chew. Ultimately, do these products work? “The word ‘hypoallergenic’ doesn’t mean that the product won’t produce an allergic reaction; nor is it effective in reducing and keeping dust mite levels low for good,” said Assoc Prof Chew. “There are no standards or definitions that govern the use of the term.” Even if there are some benefits, different people have varying degrees of sensitivity to dust mites, he said. “How effective or long such hypoallergic properties would last depend on multiple factors, including the environment, hygiene practice, and individual sensitivity of the person.”   STEAM CLEANING While this method may kill dust mites on or near the surface of the mattress, it can’t reach the critters and allergens deep in a thick mattress (a typical mattress is at least 20cm high), said Assoc Prof Chew. “It may reduce the mite population and even reduce the allergen levels if the mattress is not thick and huge.”  Moreover, steam cleaning has to be done very thoroughly. Otherwise, it may worsen the situation by leaving the mattress damp and increasing the humidity. And as you’ve already read earlier on, mites and mould grow in these conditions – including bacteria, said Assoc Prof Chew. VACUUM CLEANING  Vacuuming your mattress may bring the allergens that are embedded deep within the mattress up to the surface and increase your exposure to these allergens, said Assoc Prof Chew.  Furthermore, “scientific research has consistently shown vacuum-cleaning to be largely ineffective at removing dust mite allergens”, he said, adding that it removes dust mite allergens “in an inconsistent and incomplete manner”. “One cannot vacuum away the millions of mites, nor the large quantities of allergens accumulated over the years,” he said. If you’re looking at removing dust from the top of your mattress, diligently vacuuming it may be “slightly better” than smacking it, he added. CHANGING THE BED SHEETS WEEKLY Regular changing would reduce the accumulation of dust, dead skin, body oil and sweat, said Assoc Prof Chew, and limit the proliferation of the mites and mould.  However, these bugs are found not only on the surface of the mattress but within as well, he said. “As such, changing the bed sheets alone would not be sufficient to reduce your exposure to dust mites and their allergens.” But if you’re up for it, he recommends changing your sheets once a week. “If your pet climbs onto the bed occasionally, a higher frequency of change would definitely be recommended, whether or not one is allergic to the pet.” SUNNING THE MATTRESS  Don’t write it off as “so auntie” just yet. Direct sunlight may kill bacteria, mould and dust mites – but not remove the allergens, said Assoc Prof Chew.  It only works if you leave the mattress in direct sunlight for up to six hours, he said. If you can sun the mattress weekly and keep it dry (whether from urine or drink spillage), it may be a useful method to try, provided it is a relatively new mattress that hasn’t accumulated a lot of allergens, he added.  But be prepared for your mattress’s lifespan to be shortened though. “Latex-based mattresses may be oxidised by direct sunlight exposure, resulting in their physical distortion and causing significant damage,” he said. REPLACING THE MATTRESS Assoc Prof Chew has this anecdote on mattress replacement: “A physician friend once told me that his advice for his very allergic patients is to buy cheap mattresses and change them every few months, rather than spend a lot of money on expensive mattresses and keep them for years or decades.” If going through cheap mattresses isn’t ideal for you, you could maintain an environment that is less mite-friendly. For instance, keep the temperature and humidity low in the bedroom at less than 50 per cent relative humidity, he said.  “Don’t clutter the bedroom or the bed. Avoid carpets, especially if you are very sensitive to dust mites, as the mattress and carpet are the most important accumulators of dust mites and their allergens.” But you may have to chuck out your mattress if you have:"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/egg-freezing-singapore-cost-what-know-2747546,Egg freezing for women: Where are the frozen eggs stored? What are the costs and risks involved?,"Singapore has made the unprecedented move of legalising egg freezing for women aged 21 to 35, which is expected to start in early 2023. Currently, the procedure is only allowed for women with medical conditions, such as cancer, who want to preserve their fertility.  Women are curious about the egg freezing process, including its success rate, costs and the technology involved. They also want to know: Where are the harvested eggs stored? Are there any risks involved, both in the procedure and in the freezing process? And can there be a situation where not a single egg harvested from a woman’s ovaries is usable – what happens then?  CNA Women delves into the egg freezing process to bring you the answers to these questions and more. Also, watch the video on what happens in the lab where harvested eggs are frozen and stored. 1. WHAT IS THE FULL COST OF EGG FREEZING IN SINGAPORE? The costs are based on the number of egg retrieval cycles, and that two cycles are normally needed to retrieve sufficient healthy eggs. The cost per egg retrieval cycle is on average S$7,000 to S$9,000 at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH), said Associate Professor Sadhana Nadarajah, Head and Senior Consultant at Department of Reproductive Medicine at KKH. Subsequently, there is an annual charge for storage of about S$500.  On the other hand, the cost per cycle in private fertility clinics such as Virtus Fertility Centre ranges from S$10,000 to S$15,000 – which includes clinical consultation and assessment, ovarian stimulation, egg retrieval, egg freezing and storage for one year. Subsequent charges for storage start from S$900 yearly (excluding package pricing).  This means the cost can be up to S$25,000 for a comprehensive (comprising two egg retrieval cycles) egg freezing procedure, said Dr Liow Swee Lian, scientific director at Virtus Fertility Centre.  So if you’re 27 when you freeze your eggs and hope to get pregnant at 35, you would be paying storage fees that start from S$4,000. 2. IS EGG FREEZING A ONE-TIME PROCEDURE THAT COVERS ALL MY FUTURE PREGNANCIES?  If a woman wants to have a second child, the frozen eggs from one egg retrieval cycle are “typically insufficient”, Assoc Prof Nadarajah pointed out. So a woman could go for two or three egg retrieval cycles to “bank” more healthy eggs for future use, said Dr Liow, ideally freezing a “minimum of 20 healthy eggs”. “For a woman who is 30 years old and below at the time of egg freezing, she may have two successful pregnancies from 20 frozen eggs,” he explained.  Meanwhile, women aged between 31 and 35 years old may only have one successful pregnancy from 20 frozen eggs.  3. HOW DOES MY AGE AFFECT THE EGG FREEZING PROCESS?  As egg quality decreases with age, it’s important to note that the older you are, the more egg retrieval cycles you’ll need to undergo to harvest and store healthy eggs. According to a recent study that was published in the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in April this year, women aged 35 and below would require 10 to 15 mature eggs to have an 80 per cent chance of having a baby, Assoc Prof Nadarajah said.  Meanwhile, women aged 38 to 40 would require 25 to 30 mature eggs to achieve a live birth rate of 65 to 80 per cent. In this case, based on her egg quality and ovarian reserve, she would require three to six attempts of egg retrieval cycles to obtain the required number of mature eggs, she explained.  4. IS THERE A POSSIBILITY THAT THE HARVESTED EGGS ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR FREEZING? WHAT SHOULD I DO THEN? While an average of 10 to 15 eggs is usually harvested during the egg retrieval process, these also “include a number of deformed eggs and immature eggs which are not suitable for freezing”, said Dr Liow.  While it differs from patient to patient, he said you can expect to retrieve seven to nine healthy eggs in a cycle. Studies have shown that a woman needs to freeze about 15 to 20 healthy eggs to achieve a live birth depending on her age and egg quality, explained Dr Sheila Loh, a specialist in Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Consultant at Raffles Fertility Centre.  This means women should be aware that two egg retrieval cycles are usually required to retrieve a suitable number of viable eggs, said Dr Liow.  And if your eggs are not usable in the first egg retrieval cycle, you can repeat another round of hormonal injections and egg retrieval procedure in the next cycle or in two months, he added.  At the end of the day, not all eggs will lead to a pregnancy or a baby, said Assoc Prof Nadarajah. “The success of egg freezing is heavily dependent on the quality and quantity of frozen eggs.” 5. DOES ELECTIVE EGG FREEZING CARRY ANY RISKS?   Women should be aware that egg freezing (which involves the egg retrieval procedure), is an invasive procedure and there are surgical risks, such as risks of bleeding or infection, said Assoc Prof Nadarajah. The risks of complications, however, are “very low”, she added.  It’s also important to note: “While a woman’s frozen eggs do not age, she is still ageing,” Assoc Prof Nadarajah said.  She would still be at risk of developing medical conditions such as fibroids, endometriosis, high blood pressure and diabetes as she grows older. “These conditions may complicate the pregnancy,” she said. There is also a “small risk” of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, said Dr Loh, which occurs when too many ovarian follicles have developed from the hormonal injections. If you manage to produce more than 20 eggs, she said, watch out for symptoms such as severe bloating, shortness of breath and abdominal pain. The chance of it occuring in egg freezing cases is, however, “rare”, she added.  Dr Liow Swee Lian, scientific director at Virtus Fertility Centre, lists the steps a woman who wants to freeze her eggs would go through. 6. WHICH PART OF THE EGG FREEZING PROCESS IS THE MOST INVASIVE OR UNCOMFORTABLE?  Egg retrieval is the most invasive part of the process, where a “long thin needle” is inserted into the ovaries via the vagina to retrieve the eggs, explained Dr Liow. This is done under general anaesthesia, and takes no longer than 30 minutes – usually 10 to 15 minutes, he added.  Immediately after the procedure, you’ll remain in the hospital or fertility clinic for about two to three hours to allow the anaesthesia to wear off before going home. “It is advisable to have a close friend or family member to send you home as you may experience some nausea or dizziness,” explained Dr Loh.  “The most common side effects following egg retrieval are vaginal soreness, abdominal cramping, spotting and bloating, which can cause discomfort,” Dr Liow said.  These side effects are normal, he said, and patients typically are able to resume normal activities within a few hours, and fully recover within a couple of days. At the same time, some women may also find that the hormone stimulation drugs (which are self-injected throughout the cycle prior to egg retrieval) cause them “discomfort and pain”. 7. HOW SHOULD I PREPARE FOR THE HORMONAL INJECTIONS AND/ OR THE EGG RETRIEVAL PROCEDURE?   In ovarian stimulation, you’ll need to self-administer hormonal injections at home to stimulate egg production. You’ll do these daily injections for about two weeks.  When it’s time for the egg retrieval procedure, Dr Liow recommended that women take a day’s leave for it.  Dr Loh advised taking it easy with work commitments and reducing “heavy physical exercises” when you are undergoing ovarian stimulation and egg retrieval procedure. “The enlarged ovaries (from ovarian stimulation) may be painful and can twist, causing complications,” she explained.  She added you should also avoid consuming alcohol and/or smoking for at least two months before the ovarian stimulation process.  8. HOW MUCH DOWNTIME IS NEEDED AFTER THE EGG RETRIEVAL PROCEDURE?  It is similar to that of couples undergoing IVF, said Dr Loh. After your eggs are retrieved, consider resting for another three to seven days as the ovaries may feel “sore and heavy”. Complete bed rest isn’t necessary, however. 9. WHERE ARE THE FROZEN EGGS STORED?  The fertility experts that CNA Women spoke to said the eggs are stored in receptacles (or “straws”), which are submerged in storage tanks filled with liquid nitrogen at a temperature of -196 degrees Celsius.  According to Dr Liow, two eggs are typically stored in one straw. 10. DO FROZEN EGGS AGE? The short answer is no – they remain the same age as when they were retrieved from your ovaries.  “When eggs are frozen, they are frozen in time, and are stored in a state of hibernation,” said Dr Liow. They do not get older “regardless of how many years later they are used”. So if you decide to freeze your eggs when you’re 32 years old, your frozen eggs will remain 32 years old forever.   “In theory, they can be kept for many years with minimal risk of deterioration in quality. However, we recommend that they be kept for not more than 15 years,” said Dr Liow. And while there is currently no age limit for when a woman has to use her frozen eggs, Dr Liow pointed out that maternal age has an impact on pregnancy outcome. “Women who are at an advanced age have higher risks of complications in their pregnancies,” he said. 11. HOW DO HOSPITALS OR FERTILITY CLINICS ENSURE THE SAFETY AND LONGEVITY OF FROZEN EGGS? It’s crucial to monitor the liquid nitrogen in the storage tank to safeguard the quality and viability of the frozen eggs in the long term, said Yong Yin Yin, a principal embryologist at Raffles Fertility Centre. “Storage tanks are fitted with sensors and a continuous monitoring and alarming system that sends us alarms in the event of any failure or conditions that might damage the frozen eggs in storage,” she explained.  The liquid nitrogen is consistently topped-up in the storage tanks, too, she added. This helps ensure the storage tanks will not “dry out”. Should there be a need to, there are back-up storage tanks that are “pre-filled (with liquid nitrogen) at all times” to transfer the frozen eggs into a “more secure” tank, she explained.  12. WHAT’S THE SUCCESS RATES OF FERTILISATION WHEN USING THE FROZEN EGGS? The fertilisation rate for frozen eggs is as good as “fresh” eggs – an average of 80 per cent, Dr Liow said. “This is because an ultra-rapid freezing process, called vitrification, ensures the egg is not damaged, with a survival rate of almost 100 per cent,” he explained.  This technique, which became a “routine practice” about a decade ago, gives a better outcome as compared to the older method of slow freezing, added Assoc Prof Nadarajah.  According to a 2017 study in the US discussing the past and current trends of the vitrification method, the benefits of vitrified embryos and eggs were gaining worldwide acceptance by 2010.  13. WHAT HAPPENS TO THE FROZEN EGGS IF, FOR WHATEVER REASON, I DECIDE NOT TO USE THEM?  According to Dr Liow, you can choose to either donate them to other couples anonymously or donate them for research and development purposes. You can also opt to dispose of them outright, he added, which “many couples” often opt to do. 14. IS IT POSSIBLE TO TRANSFER MY FROZEN EGGS TO ANOTHER LAB OR FACILITY IN SINGAPORE OR OVERSEAS? Yes, the frozen eggs can be transferred to another facility with the woman’s consent, said Dr Liow. The woman would be the owner of the frozen eggs, even if she marries in the future; there is no joint ownership of frozen eggs. “Specifically designed transport canisters are used to ensure the eggs are protected and maintained at the appropriate liquid nitrogen temperature,” he said. Hence, it is “very safe” for sperm, eggs and embryos to be transported between clinics, around the world, on a regular basis, he added. 15. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ARE READY TO USE THE FROZEN EGGS? Let the clinic know that you and your husband are ready to proceed with fertility treatment so you can meet with the fertility specialist to discuss the process, said Dr Liow.  Then you will consult with their fertility specialist again to begin the IVF cycle at the start of your menstrual cycle. On the day of ovulation, your husband provides a sperm sample, whereupon the eggs will be “warmed” and inseminated with the sperm. More than 30 years ago, IVF would involve the sperm and egg being placed in a petri dish while an embryologist waits for the sperm to fertilise the egg on its own, said Dr Liow. Since 1992 however, fertility clinics now use a process called Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI), where “a single sperm is injected into each egg to assist fertilisation using very fine micro-manipulation equipment”, he added. As an additional part of the IVF cycle, the technique ensures that the “best sperm” is directly injected into the egg – offering a “significant increase in fertilisation and pregnancy rates, and a reduction in miscarriage rates”, said Dr Liow.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/monkeypox-singapore-imported-case-flight-attendant-fever-rashes-moh-2760996,Singapore confirms imported case of monkeypox after flight attendant develops fever and rashes,"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed one imported case of monkeypox infection in Singapore. The patient is a 42-year-old British national who works as a flight attendant. MOH said the man was in Singapore between Jun 15 and Jun 17, and again on Jun 19 as he flew in and out of Singapore. He tested positive for monkeypox on Jun 20.  He is currently warded in at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and his condition is stable. Contact tracing is ongoing, said MOH.  The man had onset of headache on Jun 14 and fever on Jun 16. These symptoms subsequently resolved, and he then developed skin rashes on Jun 19.  MOH said the man sought medical attention via teleconsultation on the night of Jun 19, and was conveyed to NCID on Jun 20 for further assessment. “Contact tracing is ongoing for the affected flights and for the duration of his stay in Singapore. During this period, he had largely remained in his hotel room, except to visit a massage establishment, and eat at three food establishments on Jun 16.  “In general, the risk of transmission to visitors at these locations is low, as data has shown that monkeypox transmits through close physical or prolonged contact. All four locations visited by the case are undergoing cleaning and disinfection,” said MOH.  As of Jun 21, 13 close contacts have been identified. MOH said all close contacts will be placed on quarantine for 21 days since their last contact with the case. “In addition, two low-risk contacts have been placed on phone surveillance. Persons under phone surveillance will receive daily phone calls during the 21-day period to monitor for any onset of symptoms. If suspected of being infected, they will be immediately conveyed to the NCID for further evaluation and isolation to prevent further transmission,” added the ministry. Monkeypox is a viral disease that is caused by infection with the monkeypox virus. Infected individuals would typically experience fever, headache, muscle ache, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills, lethargy and skin rash. ""The disease is usually self-limiting, with most patients recovering within two to three weeks. In some cases, however, the virus can cause serious complications. Individuals who are at higher risk of severe illness include young children, pregnant women or immunocompromised individuals,"" said MOH. MOH added that human-to-human transmission is generally uncommon, but can occur via exposure to respiratory droplets or direct physical contact with the blood, body fluid or lesion material from infected individuals or contaminated materials. The incubation period ranges from five to 21 days. Those with the infection are generally infectious from onset of fever until the skin lesions have scabbed over. Given the evolving global situation, MOH advised members of the public, especially travellers, to maintain vigilance and take the following precautions:"

The CDC's move came after a panel of advisers voted to recommend COVID-19 vaccines for those children. The US Food and Drug Administration on Friday authorised Moderna's shot for children aged six months to five years, and Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine for children aged six months to four years. Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine is already authorised for children over the age of five in the US. The Health Ministry began its vaccination exercise for children aged five to 11 on Dec 27 last year.  In an update in January, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) said no serious adverse effects were reported for those in that age group who received their jabs as of end-December.  All individuals regardless of age, who are eligible for COVID-19 vaccination, can walk in for their primary vaccination series and booster doses every day of the week, before 7pm.  No prior appointment is necessary, according to the MOH website.  Children aged five to 11 can walk in with their parents or guardians to any paediatric vaccination centre to receive their vaccination doses. Those aged 12 to 17 can visit any vaccination centre offering the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. As of Sunday, 92 per cent of the total population have completed their full COVID-19 vaccination regimen. About 77 per cent have received their booster shots.  "

""You need to take your boosters,"" said Mr Ong in a video on TikTok. ""Don't delay anymore. Go get your booster shot."" Singapore can expect to see a next wave of COVID-19 infections in the next one to two months, said Mr Ong. The authorities have on several occasions warned of the possibility of another outbreak, as COVID-19 antibodies in individuals start to wane. When COVID-19 vaccines were first developed, they were designed for the ""wild-type"" virus, said Mr Ong. Now that the coronavirus has evolved into the Delta and Omicron strains, three doses of vaccines are needed for effective protection - the primary series and a booster shot, he added. Presenting figures, Mr Ong said that seniors who are 60 years old and above and who have not taken their primary series of vaccinations have a four in 100 chance of ending up in the intensive care unit (ICU) or dying from COVID-19. This drops to one in 100 if seniors have had two COVID-19 shots but no booster, and three in 1,000 if they have taken all three shots. ""It makes a difference whether you have taken 0, 1, 2 or 3 shots,"" said Mr Ong. Health experts have said that the next wave of COVID-19 infections will likely be driven by the Omicron variants BA.4. and BA.5, which have already spread to several countries, including Singapore. BA.4 and BA.5 are two subvariants of Omicron that are thought to be more contagious, but so far do not appear to lead to more severe disease. The authorities have also advised those aged 80 and above, residents of aged care facilities, such as nursing homes and medically vulnerable persons who are at increased risk of severe disease to get a second booster dose. Those aged 50 to 79 years can also receive the second booster if they choose to do so. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/new-study-points-surprisingly-simple-way-ward-knee-pain-2740511,A new study points to a surprisingly simple way to ward off knee pain,"A promising new study suggests that walking could ward off knee pain for people with osteoarthritis. Researchers surveyed over 1,000 people ages 50 or older with knee osteoarthritis, the most common type of arthritis in the United States. Some had persistent pain at the outset, while others did not. After four years, those who started off without frequent knee pain and walked for exercise at least 10 times were less likely to experience new, regular bouts of stiffness or aches around their knees and had less structural damage in their knees. The study suggested that people with knee osteoarthritis who are bowlegged might particularly benefit from walking. The research offers the potential of an easy – and free – way to combat one of the most common culprit of knee pain among older adults. The findings represent “a paradigm shift,” said Dr Grace Hsiao-Wei Lo, an assistant professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and the lead author on the study. “Everyone’s always looking for some kind of drug. This highlights the importance and likelihood that interventions for osteoarthritis might be something different, including good old exercise.” The research suggests that exercise could help manage osteoarthritis in other joints, she added, like those in the hips, hands and feet. Osteoarthritis, sometimes referred to as “wear and tear” arthritis, affects over 32.5 million adults in the US and occurs when the joint cartilage breaks down and the underlying bone begins to change, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The risk of developing the condition increases as you age, and around a third of people over 60 have knee osteoarthritis, Dr Lo said. Many patients take medications like ibuprofen or naproxen to treat the pain, she added, which in large doses can lead to kidney issues and ulcers. Instead, they may be able to turn to exercise. For decades, health experts saw walking primarily as a way to boost cardiovascular health, said Dr Elaine Husni, a rheumatologist at Cleveland Clinic who was not involved in the study. In recent years, though, doctors have looked to low-impact workouts to treat conditions like depression, cognitive impairment and mild osteoarthritis. But the new study shows that walking can also act as a preventive measure, Dr Lo said, and suggests that people who are at higher risk of developing the condition may want to incorporate a regular walk into their routine. For instance, Dr Lo herself said that, based on her findings, she should walk more, as her mother has osteoarthritis. The study began in 2004 and documented participants’ baseline knee pain, using radiographs to assess their osteoarthritis. Researchers then asked participants to document their exercise habits and reviewed their symptoms at regular follow-up visits, asking how frequently their knees hurt. After four years, 37 per cent of the study participants who did not walk for exercise (not including the occasional trip to the train or grocery store) developed new, frequent knee pain, compared with 26 per cent who did walk. Of course, researchers cannot definitively say that walking staved off knee pain, and it did not appear to lessen existing pain. Self assessments can be less accurate than fitness trackers or step counters. And the researchers did not track the distance or frequency that people walked, nor did they recommend strategies for how and when people with osteoarthritis should incorporate walking into their exercise routines. Still, the results bolster what clinicians already understand about how to manage osteoarthritis. Consistent movement can help create muscle mass, strengthening ligaments around the joints that have osteoarthritis, Dr Husni said. Walking is a low-intensity, low-impact workout, allowing people to maintain the strength and flexibility that are critical for healthy joints, she added. “It’s an intervention that anyone can do,” she said. “You have no excuse. You can do it anywhere you are.” Those who are already in pain should be careful to not overdo exercise, though, said Dr Justen Elbayar, a sports medicine specialist in the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at NYU Langone Health who was also not involved in the study. Walking long distances might exacerbate aches in some patients with severe arthritis, he said – but for those with smaller amounts of arthritis, “it’s one of the best exercises you can do.” He recommends that people start with a small, short walk, gradually building up distance over time. The goal of the exercise is to provide muscular support to an arthritic knee, he said, and to let the joints, tendons and tissues become acclimated to the walking. He also suggested using supportive shoes, drinking plenty of water during a walk and taking frequent rests if tired or new to it. After a long walk, icing the knee may also help relieve discomfort, he added. While a stroll down the street can’t repair cartilage or remedy existing pain, the exercise offers a compelling and accessible option for staving off the more intrusive aspects of osteoarthritis, Dr Lo said. After all, she added, “walking doesn’t cost a cent.” By Dani Blum © 2022 The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/how-long-does-covid-19-immunity-last-will-second-illness-be-worse-and-how-can-you-prepare-2746991,How long does COVID-19 immunity last? Will a second illness be worse? And how can you prepare?,"If you’re one of the millions who have already had COVID-19, you may be wondering how long you will have immunity from the coronavirus. Earlier in the pandemic, most people assumed that getting infected had at least one upside: That you would be protected against future encounters with the virus. But as the latest wave heads toward the Western region of the country and the virus shows no signs of easing up, reinfections seem to have become common. Already, many people are reporting second or even third infections with newer variants. Experts have warned that exposure to the coronavirus – through vaccination or infection – does not mean that you are completely protected from future infections. Rather, the coronavirus is evolving to behave more like its closely related cousins, which cause common colds and infect people repeatedly throughout their lives. “I’ve thought, almost since the beginning of this pandemic, that COVID-19 is eventually going to become an inevitable infection that everybody gets multiple times, because that’s just how a new respiratory virus gets established in the human population,” said Dr Amesh Adalja, an infectious-disease specialist at Johns Hopkins University. However, the coronavirus doesn’t yet fit into clear seasonal patterns like the other common cold viruses. It can also cause debilitating symptoms that persist for months or years in some people, and has claimed the lives of millions of others. So what can you do to protect yourself, not only from infection but also reinfection? We asked experts for answers to common questions. HOW LONG WILL MY IMMUNITY LAST AFTER GETTING COVID? Before Omicron, reinfections were rare. A team of scientists, led by Laith Abu-Raddad at Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, estimated that a bout with Delta or an earlier coronavirus strain was roughly 90 per cent effective in preventing a reinfection in both vaccinated and unvaccinated people. “But Omicron really changed that calculus,” said Dr Abu-Raddad, an infectious disease epidemiologist. After Omicron emerged, prior infections only provided about 50 per cent protection against reinfection, Dr Abu-Raddad’s study showed. The coronavirus had acquired so many mutations in its spike protein that newer versions became more transmissible and better able to evade immunity. That means you can catch a version of Omicron after recovering from an older, non-Omicron variant. You can even get sick with one of the newer Omicron subvariants after getting over a different version of it. Other factors also increase your vulnerability to reinfection, starting with how long it has been since you had COVID-19. Immune defenses tend to wane after an infection. A study published in October 2021 estimated that reinfection could occur as soon as 3 months after contracting COVID-19. While these findings were based on the genome of the coronavirus and accounted for expected declines in antibodies that could fight off the virus, the study did not account for new variants like Omicron that were radically different from older variants. Because of how different Omicron is, your protection may wane even sooner. In a study published in February that has not yet been peer-reviewed, scientists from Denmark found that some people got reinfected with the BA.2 sublineage of Omicron as soon as 20 days after they got infected with the original Omicron BA.1. Because the virus is infecting more people now, your chances of being exposed and getting reinfected are also higher, Dr Abu-Raddad said. And while it’s unclear if some people are simply more susceptible to COVID-19 reinfection, researchers are beginning to find some clues. People who are older or immunocompromised may make very few or very poor quality antibodies, leaving them more vulnerable to reinfection, Dr Abu-Raddad said. And early research shows that a small group of people have a genetic flaw that cripples a crucial immune molecule called interferon type I, putting them at higher risk of severe COVID symptoms. Further studies could find that such differences play a role in reinfection as well. For now, you should treat any new symptoms, including a fever, sore throat, runny nose or change in taste or smell, as a potential case of COVID, and get tested to confirm if you are positive again. WILL SUBSEQUENT INFECTIONS BE MORE OR LESS SEVERE? The good news is that your body can call on immune cells, like T cells and B cells, to quash a reinfection if the virus sneaks past your initial antibody defenses. T cells and B cells can take a few days to get activated and start working, but they tend to remember how to battle the virus based on previous encounters. “Your immune system has all kinds of weapons to try and stop the virus even if it gets past the front door,” said Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California. Many of these immune cells build up their protections iteratively, Dr Crotty said. That means that people who are vaccinated and boosted are especially well equipped to duke it out with the coronavirus. Similarly, people who have been infected before are able to keep the virus from replicating at high levels if they get reinfected. And most people who have logged encounters with both the vaccine and the coronavirus build up a hybrid immunity that may offer the best protection. The result is that second or third infections are likely to be shorter and less severe. Dr Abu-Raddad, who has been tracking reinfections among large groups of people in Qatar, has already started seeing this promising pattern in patient records: Of more than 1,300 reinfections that his team identified from the beginning of the pandemic to May 2021, none led to hospitalisation in an ICU, and none were fatal. But just because reinfections are less severe, it doesn’t mean that they are not terrible. You may still run a fever and experience body aches, brain fog and other symptoms. And there’s no way of knowing if your symptoms will linger and become long COVID, Dr Adalja said. It is possible that each COVID-19 infection forces you into a game of Russian roulette, though some researchers hypothesise that the risk is highest right after your first infection. One of the risk factors for long COVID is having high levels of virus in your system early in an infection, and you are likely to have such a high viral load the first time you are infected, Dr Abu-Raddad said. In subsequent infections, your body is better prepared to fight off the coronavirus so you may be able to keep the virus at low levels until it is completely cleared, he said. WHAT CAN YOU DO TO REDUCE YOUR RISK OF REINFECTION? Many of the tools and behaviors that help protect against infection can still help you avoid reinfection, Dr Abu-Raddad said. “There is no magical solution against COVID-19 reinfection.” Getting vaccinated and boosted, for example, is a good idea even after you’ve had COVID-19. You only need to wait a few weeks after an infection to get a shot. The vaccines will bolster your antibody levels, and research shows that they are effective in preventing severe outcomes if you get sick again. “Scientific confidence in vaccine-induced immunity was and is much higher than infection-induced immunity,” Dr Crotty said. Additional measures, like masking indoors and in crowded spaces, social distancing and improving ventilation where possible, can provide another layer of protection. But because most people and communities have largely dropped these protections, it is up to individuals to decide when to adopt extra precautions based on their risk of getting COVID-19 and how much they’d like to avoid it. “If you had an infection just last week, you probably don’t have to mask up,” Dr Adalja said. “But as a month or so passes from your infection and new variants start circulating in the US, it may make sense for high risk individuals to do that. People who are trying to avoid getting COVID-19 because they’re going on a cruise soon or because they need a negative PCR test for some other reason may consider taking precautions. Covid protections don’t have to be one-size-fits-all.” By Knvul Sheikh © 2022 The New York TimesThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/healthier-sg-healthcare-reform-enrol-gp-public-engagement-session-2750056,"Costs, flexibility in choosing doctors among concerns raised about Singapore’s healthcare reform initiative","SINGAPORE: The cost that comes with more regular screenings as well as the flexibility to choose their primary doctors were among the concerns raised on Wednesday evening (Jun 15) at a public engagement session on Singapore’s new healthcare strategy. The strategy, called Healthier SG, was announced in March at the Ministry of Health’s (MOH) Committee of Supply Debate. It aims to focus on preventive care, address the challenges of an ageing population and improve health outcomes. Residents will be invited to enrol with a single family doctor of their choice and adopt a care plan such as regular screenings. Singapore’s three healthcare clusters will support the general practitioners who are operating within their region and integrate them into the overall health system, such as by enabling data sharing. The new strategy will also involve a major shift in funding, where healthcare clusters will get a pre-determined fee for every resident in the region under their charge. MOH previously said that this will provide “a natural incentive” for hospitals to try to keep residents healthy through preventive care. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the Healthier SG public engagement session, Second Minister for Health Masagos Zulkifli said that MOH has engaged about 500 participants through five public sessions so far. “Our engagement so far has brought up a few concerns … For example, what if they already have a company doctor or (if) they have a few doctors, how do they make their choices?” he said, adding that these questions will be taken into consideration. “(We can) see how we can package it so that for both doctors as well as the resident - they know how best to choose their doctor, and for the doctors, how to manage patients who may even have more than one doctor,” said Mr Masagos, who is also the Minister of Social and Family Development. “We may have to have a good IT system so that information can be porous, (with) enough protection for their security but at the same time, enable different doctors hopefully to manage different kinds of sickness,” he said. In developing its new strategy, MOH consulted stakeholders - including GPs, healthcare workers and community partners - over the past few months, to get their views on how to improve healthcare across the population. Feedback gathered from these sessions will be studied and incorporated into a White Paper, which will be tabled for debate in Parliament later this year, said the ministry."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/rubbing-eye-effects-blepharitis-cornea-scratch-2729716,Here's why it’s not a good idea to keep rubbing your eyes (even though it feels so good),"It’s never a good move to over-do things. Take rubbing your eyes, for instance. Everyone does it when they feel dry, tired, itchy or irritated by allergies. And sometimes, it just feels, well, good to do it.  That’s because rubbing your eyes presses down on the eyeballs and that action can stimulate the vagus nerve, which slows down your heart rate and relieves stress.  The most common reason for rubbing your eyes is itchiness. And here’s the thing: If your eyes are persistently itchy, it could be more than just dust and pollen; you may have what the doctors call blepharitis.  “Itchiness around the eyes is often due to the over-production of oily secretions and the clogging of the oil glands on the eyelids,” explained Dr Johnson Tan, a specialist in ophthalmology and a consultant at Raffles Eye Centre.  “The oil is essential to prevent the over-evaporation of tears on the cornea surface. However, excessive oil and the clogging of the oil glands’ openings can cause inflammation and dry eyes, together with itchiness of the eyelids,” he said.  WHY IS IT BAD TO RUB MY EYES? When you vigorously and/or frequently rub your eyes, there’s an increased risk of you scratching your cornea with a fingernail or dislodged lash hair. Think of a scratched cornea like a scraped knee after taking a fall, said Dr Tan.  “Excessive rubbing causes the skin layer of the cornea (the epithelium) to come off.” Occasionally, a fingernail may also catch the cornea surface and cause the epithelium to tear off, he said. Ouch. More bad news. After the epithelium heals, it can “occasionally come off spontaneously”, said Dr Tan, describing a condition called recurrent corneal erosion. Your eyes naturally dry up during sleep, causing the eyelids to stick and tug on the epithelium when you open your eyes in the morning. So when the healed epithelium is no longer “strongly adherent to the underlying cornea”, you risk tearing it again.   “For mild cases, patients need to lubricate the affected eye often, especially before sleep and upon waking up,” said Dr Tan. “Severe cases may require a simple procedure to be done.” And scratched corneas occur more often than you think. At the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC), two to four such cases are seen every week. “This number may actually be higher in our A&E service or primary eye care clinics,” said Associate Professor Marcus Ang, a senior consultant with SNEC’s Cornea and External Eye Disease Department. There’s also the chance of you worsening pre-existing eye conditions such as glaucoma, according to Australia’s Vision Eye Institute. The pressure you exert can disrupt blood flow to the back of the eye and cause nerve damage and ultimately, permanent vision loss.  Rarely, persistent eye rubbing could lead to keratoconus, a condition that has a genetic predisposition, said Assoc Prof Ang. Instead of a sphere-like dome, your cornea starts to take on a cone shape from all the rubbing. The new shape affects how light is bent towards your eyes and in turn, compromises your vision. “This is very uncommon, but still, an important reason not to rub our eyes often,” he said. HOW DO I KNOW IF I’VE DONE IT? You have over-done the rubbing if your eyes are teary and red, and your vision is blurry. And no matter how much lubricating eye drops you apply, the symptoms don’t seem to be resolved, said Assoc Prof Ang.  Added Dr Tan: “There is often a sudden, sharp, poking pain associated with excessive tearing. This is worsened with blinking”.  Corneal abrasion typically takes three to five days to heal on its own, said Dr Tan. But see a doctor, he advised, if you have any of these symptoms:  The broken skin on the cornea can predispose your eye to infection, said Dr Tan. And if the infection is not treated promptly, it can result in a permanent decrease in vision. The takeaway message is, of course, don’t rub your eyes. To keep your itchy fingers away, use a topical lubricant eye drop, which can be purchased over the counter at any pharmacy. ""It should relieve the itch and dryness or discomfort,” said Assoc Prof Ang. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/long-covid-cant-sleep-insomnia-fatigue-symptoms-immunity-2748096,Commentary: COVID-19 infection could be why you're sleeping poorly,"NEWCASTLE, Australia: During the early phases of the pandemic, and especially during lockdowns and stay-at-home orders, many people reported disruptions to sleep and their sleeping patterns. As COVID-19 infections have increased, we’re again seeing reports of people experiencing poor sleep during and following COVID-19 infection. Some people report insomnia symptoms, where they struggle to fall or stay asleep, with this commonly being referred to as “coronasomnia” or “COVID-19 insomnia”. Others report feeling constantly fatigued, and seemingly can’t get enough sleep, with this sometimes being referred to as “long COVID”. So why is our sleep impacted by COVID-19 infections, and why do the impacts differ so much between individuals? When our body is infected with a virus, this causes an immune, or inflammatory, response. As part of this response, our cells produce proteins, such as cytokines, in order to help fight the infection. Some of these cytokines are also involved in promoting sleep and are known as “sleep regulatory substances”. In this way, when there are more of these cytokines in our bodies, this tends to make us sleepier. It gets a little more complicated though because, like many things, sleep and immunity are bidirectional. This means sleep, in particular poor sleep, can impact immune function, and immune function can impact sleep.  During sleep, especially during the non-rapid eye movement stage of slow-wave sleep (a deep stage of sleep), there is an increase in the production of some cytokines. As such, sleep increases the immune response which may increase our chance of survival from the infection. While we are still learning about the specific effects of COVID-19 on sleep, we do know about what happens to sleep with other viral infections. One study that looked at rhinovirus infections, or the common cold, in healthy adults, found that individuals who were symptomatic had a reduced sleep duration, less consolidated sleep and poorer cognitive performance than asymptomatic individuals. Another study that looked at people with respiratory infections showed that while symptomatic, people spent more time in bed and had increased sleep time, yet had more awakenings during sleep. People also reported increased difficulties falling asleep, poorer sleep quality, more restless sleep and more “lighter” sleep. A more recent study found that patients with COVID-19 reported more trouble sleeping compared to patients without COVID-19. While the changes in sleep with viral infections such as COVID-19 are likely to be due to our bodies’ immune response, it’s possible the sleep disturbances, such as the fragmented sleep and waking frequently, may lead to poor sleep habits, such as using phones or electronic devices at night. Poorer nighttime sleep may also lead to some people having more frequent daytime naps, which could further impact nighttime sleep. And taking longer to fall asleep, or waking up at night and struggling to fall back asleep, can lead to frustrations around not being able to sleep. All of these factors, either independently or in combination with each other, may lead to the insomnia symptoms people with COVID-19 are experiencing. In the short term, these insomnia symptoms are not really a big issue. However, if poor sleep habits persist this can lead to chronic insomnia. On the other side, there are people who experience long COVID, where they are constantly fatigued even though they may be getting sufficient sleep well after their COVID-19 infection has passed.  Unfortunately, more research is needed to determine why some people experience lingering fatigue after viral infections, but it may be due to an excessive immune response. Factors such as genetics, other health concerns and mood disorders such as anxiety are the likely culprits as to why some people experience COVID-19 insomnia, whereas others are more likely to develop long COVID. Much more research is needed to fully understand the causes of poorer sleep with COVID-19. During the acute phase of infections, it’s important to accept we may experience some sleep disturbances. Try not to get too frustrated about sleeping poorly or taking longer to fall asleep. When you start to feel better, aim to go back to your regular, pre-COVID, sleep-wake pattern, and avoid daytime napping, or at least too much daytime napping. Try to avoid looking at the clock when in bed, and go to bed when you feel sleepy.  Reduce light exposure at night, and aim to get some bright light in the morning, ideally outdoors. This will help you get back to a normal routine faster. If you’re still struggling with insomnia or excessive sleepiness following a COVID-19 infection, especially if it’s been a few months, it’s always good to see your GP, who can offer you more specific advice and work out if more testing is required.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/bunions-treatment-splint-toe-spacers-podiatrist-tips-2726841,Bummed out over bunions: Do toe spacers and splints actually help relieve pain and swelling?,"For those who love wearing high heels or shoes with narrow and pointy shoeboxes, bunions can be a pain. They are the bony bumps on the side of the feet where your big toes begin. These foot deformities take years to develop and can be rather bothersome for their owners. A bunion – or a hallux valgus in medical terms – occurs when the big toe joint known as the metatarsophalangeal or MTP joint (there are five MTP joints on each foot) gets forced out of alignment due to factors such as wearing those shoes we just mentioned. If you’re overweight, the pressure forcing your toe out of alignment is even greater. You could also develop these bony bumps if you have a family history of bunions, certain foot types (being flat footed, for example) or have inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis.  “We grade bunions into four stages: One (none), two (mild), three (moderate) and four (severe) based on how much deviation the big toe has towards the smaller toes,” said Alexandra Foo, a podiatrist from Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. “Generally, out of 10 patients with foot pain, we see about three to four people with painful bunions,” she said. WHAT ARE THE SIGNS? Bunions typically present as a bulge at the base of your big toe in the beginning and may be easy to miss. As it progresses, the bulge swells and reddens. Hardened skin such as corns and calluses may also form around it.   Meanwhile, your big toe begins to deviate from its original position and bends towards the second toe. In severe cases, it may even overlap with the second toe. There could be pain or a burning sensation when you try to bend your big toe, or it just feels numb.  HOW DO BUNION SPLINTS AND TOE SPACERS WORK? You might have seen advertisements for bunion splints and toe spacers. They don’t cost much (as little as S$20) and they seem to promise relief from the redness, swelling and pain caused by bunions. But do they actually work? Bunion splints vary in design and some of them have a sleeve that wraps around your big toe as well as a spacer to keep it separate from the second toe. Other bunion splints may look like a miniaturised knee brace; they keep your big toe straight by supporting it from the side.  According to Foo, bunion splints are “theorised” to stretch out the “thin, tight tendons and muscles that control the position and movement of the big toe” in the hope of realigning it. They provide an active resistance by pulling the big toe away from the second toe. “This results in a passive stretch to the soft tissues that may be contributing to the deviation and provide some pain relief,” she said. Toe spacers (generally made of silicone or gel material), as the name implies, space out your big and second toes so that they do not overlap. While they don’t pull the toes apart like the splints do, they temporarily force or support the big toe’s intended position, said Foo. Simply put, “toe spacers act like a wedge between the first and second toes” and prevent the big toe from pushing closer toward the second toe, she said.  WHY ARE THESE ITEMS OFTEN RECOMMENDED FOR USE AT NIGHT? That’s because you’re likely to be off your feet sitting on the sofa watching TV or lying in bed, which takes the weight and pressure off your MTP joints, said Foo. “This allows soft tissues (muscles, tendons and ligaments, for instance) supporting the joints to relax and be stretched out via bunion splints or toe spacers,” she said.  DO THESE PRODUCTS WORK? There are no local studies done on the success rates of such products, according to Foo. However, there are a few overseas ones that demonstrate some pain relief from the use of the splints and spacers over time.  Still, “there is no hard evidence so far to prove that these bunion splints and toe spacers will correct the big toe deformity over time”, said Foo. “They will not reposition the toe back to its initial position, especially for bunions that have already progressed into its later end-stages.” She added: “At best, bunion splints and toe spacers may only help in reducing marginal degrees of deviation but not enough to show a complete correction of these bunions.” ARE THEY WORTH TRYING? “If your bunions are in the early stages one through to early three, it would be fine trying them out,” said Foo. That’s because the soft tissues surrounding the joint are likely to be more pliable and accommodative compared to bunions in their later stages, she explained. But you can’t rely solely on these products without considering the other factors that may be contributing to your bunions. These could include an “elevated body weight, poor footwear choices, excessive flat feet, and weak muscles in your feet and ankle”, said Foo. If you’re still jamming your feet into heels or pointy shoes, you may not notice any changes. Even if there are slight results, your toe may revert to its deviation once you stop using them, she said.  If you’re already trying a splint or spacer, consider this: “It should feel comfortable when wearing, while exerting an appropriate amount of push or pull against the big toe”, said Foo.  WHAT OTHER NON-SURGICAL CORRECTION METHODS ARE THERE? Other than bunion splints and toe spacers, orthoses are commonly used to “manage the excessive forces that are exerting onto the big toe joint” and provide pain relief when walking, said Foo. Manual therapy and taping may also be used in some instances.  Unfortunately, all of these non-surgical methods can only slow down your bunions’ progression but that is all, she qualified.  To help your bunions further, switch to better fitting shoes that are ideally flat and wide enough to accommodate the bunions. “We usually tend to find more females than males with bunions because of the type of heels and pointy shoes that are worn. This is especially so when the heels are more than 2cm in height, and there is much more pressure being put onto the big toe joint,” said Foo.  If the patient is obese, healthy and sustainable weight loss will definitely help in reducing the amount of pressure and pain, she added. You can also try foot “core” exercises and toe exercises to help you improve joint mobility and reduce joint stiffness. “Some examples of these exercises are toe spreading, toe grasping and controlled big and small toe movements,” suggested Foo.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/can-eating-more-fish-really-affect-your-skin-cancer-risk-new-study-suggests-2738331,Can eating more fish really affect your skin cancer risk like this new study suggests?,"A large study published on June 8 found a surprising link between fish consumption and developing melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer. But while the finding raises questions about possible links between diet and melanoma, the study’s lead author and other experts cautioned that it’s not a reason to avoid eating fish. It also doesn’t change the most important advice for reducing melanoma risk: Limit your exposure to UV rays from the sun. The new study, published in the journal Cancer Causes & Control, evaluated data from more than 490,000 adults in the United States between the ages of 50 and 71 who were enrolled in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. At the start of the study, participants completed detailed questionnaires, including information about their fish intake, and then were followed for about 15 years to track cancer diagnoses among the group. Compared with those who ate hardly any fish, the group that ate the most – on average 283g, or about three servings, per week – had 22 per cent more cases of malignant melanoma, the researchers found. It’s not clear why eating fish might affect a person’s risk of developing melanoma, said Eunyoung Cho, an associate professor of dermatology at Brown University and the lead author of the study. “We believe it’s not fish per se, but probably some contaminant in fish,” she said. Other studies have found that people who eat more fish have higher levels of heavy metals such as mercury and arsenic in the body. These same contaminants are also associated with a higher risk of skin cancer, she noted. However, her study didn’t measure contaminant levels in participants, and more research is needed to explore this link, she said. “I wouldn’t discourage people from having fish just because of our finding,” Dr Cho said. Eating fish is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and maybe even some other cancers, she pointed out. The American Cancer Society recommends choosing fish, poultry and beans more often than red meat, and the American Heart Association (AHA) advises eating two servings of fish per week for heart health. (One serving is 85g of cooked fish, according to the AHA, or about three-quarters of a cup of flaked fish.) Other experts were similarly cautious in their interpretation of the study’s findings. “This does not change dietary recommendations for fish intake as part of a heart-healthy, anti-inflammatory or broad cancer prevention diet,” Carrie Daniel-MacDougall, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, wrote in an email. Dr Daniel-MacDougall led an earlier analysis, with a shorter follow-up time and fewer variables, of the same NIH-AARP cohort included in the most recent study. Her paper, published in 2011, also found a correlation between fish intake and melanoma risk. However, the NIH-AARP study was originally designed to track many types of cancers, and it didn’t measure important and well-known melanoma risk factors, like a history of sunburns or greater lifetime UV exposure, Dr Daniel-MacDougall wrote. People with these risk factors may have spent more time in the sun – perhaps at the beach or fishing – and may have also been more likely to enjoy seafood, she pointed out. Without more information, it’s impossible to determine if it’s the fish, time in the sun or some other factor driving the greater melanoma risk. Dr Sancy Leachman, director of the Melanoma Research Program at Oregon Health & Science University, said the new study was well-designed and called the findings “intriguing”. But, she said, when “you crunch large data sets like this”, what you find are correlations between factors, not evidence that one causes another. This type of study is good for developing new hypotheses – that contaminants found in fish might increase the risk of melanoma, for example – but they need much more research to see if they hold up. “Science evolves, and you can’t do everything overnight. That’s just part of the process,” Dr Leachman said. Many studies have identified correlations between certain foods and types of cancer, but in general, when more studies are conducted and the results are looked at as a whole, the effects often become smaller or disappear altogether. For melanoma specifically, limited studies have turned up some strange and surprising correlations with certain foods. Eating more citrus fruit has been associated with a greater melanoma risk in some, but not all, studies, for example. And red and processed meat has been associated with lower risk of melanoma but a higher risk of other cancers. When it comes to correlations between cancer risk and specific foods, “don’t get overwhelmed by this incomplete data that is yet to be proven”, Dr Leachman said. “Hold on to the tried and true things: Eat well, sleep well, exercise well, all in the moderation,” she said. “That gives you the most resilience you can possibly have against any kind of disease, including cancer.” And for melanoma specifically, “the most effective practices we have to prevent melanoma are limiting sun exposure – across the life span, starting in childhood – and skin cancer screening,” Dr Daniel-MacDougall wrote. Compared with the limited data on fish and other dietary factors, there’s far more evidence to support this advice, Dr Leachman agreed. Having had five or more sunburns doubles your lifetime risk of melanoma, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation. Check your skin regularly for any spots that seem to be new, changing or unusual, and see a doctor if you find something concerning, Dr Leachman said. “If you see something that looks funny, don’t just blow it off,” she said. “The earlier you can get it checked, the better off you’re going to be.” By Alice Callahan © 2022 The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/weight-loss-tied-dramatic-drop-cancer-risk-new-study-shows-2730771,"Weight loss tied to a dramatic drop in cancer risk, new study shows","A large new study found that people who lost significant amounts of weight through bariatric surgery gained a striking benefit:Their likelihood of developing cancer fell sharply. The study, published on June 3 in JAMA, followed more than 30,000 adults with obesity for about a decade. It found that those who underwent weight loss surgery had a 32 per cent lower risk of developing cancer and a 48 per cent lower risk of dying from the disease, compared with a similar group of people who did not have the surgery. On average, the people who had weight loss surgery lost about 25kg more than those who did not over the course of the study. The researchers found that the more weight people lost, the more their cancer risk fell. Obesity is a strong driver of cancer risk. Health authorities have linked excess weight to higher rates of many cancers. The new study is among the largest and most rigorous to suggest that the increased risk can be reversed in people who lose substantial amounts of weight. While the new research focused on weight loss through bariatric surgery, the authors of the study speculated that the benefit would apply to weight loss through other methods as well, such as diet and exercise or the use of weight loss medications. Dr Steven Nissen, a co-author of the study, said the findings “provide one more reason why people who are obese should lose weight”. “It’s an important public health message,” said Dr Nissen, the chief academic officer of the Heart, Vascular and Thoracic Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. “I think a lot of the public doesn’t understand or realise that obesity is such a strong risk factor for cancer, and they certainly don’t understand that it’s reversible.” One expert who was not involved in the study, Dr Ania Jastreboff, said that it demonstrates that treating obesity and achieving “clinically meaningful” weight reductions can improve health outcomes for patients. “That’s a really important finding,” said Dr Jastreboff, an associate professor at the Yale School of Medicine and the director of weight management and obesity prevention at the Yale Stress Center. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), obesity is a leading cause of preventable cancers, along with smoking, heavy drinking and exposure to ultraviolet radiation. People who are overweight or obese have a higher risk of developing 13 different types of cancer, including endometrial, breast, kidney, liver, oesophageal and colorectal. The CDC estimates that the 13 types of cancer linked to obesity make up 40 per cent of all cancers diagnosed in the United States each year. It is not entirely clear why obesity seems to promote cancer, but one potential factor is inflammation. Studies show that fat cells spew into the bloodstream a variety of inflammatory proteins known as cytokines, which have been found to stimulate cancer cells. Many scientists believe this chronic state of inflammation caused by fat cells is also one of the reasons people with obesity have higher rates of complications from COVID-19. Fat cells are often thought of as being inert – “that they’re just sitting there and not doing anything”, Dr Nissen said. “But, in fact, they’re metabolically active. We think that the chronic inflammation produced by obesity, by these very metabolically active fat cells, is one of the mechanisms by which cancer is induced.” According to the CDC, people with obesity tend to have higher levels of hormones such as insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1, or IGF-1, which can stimulate the development of colon, kidney, prostate and endometrial cancers. Bariatric surgery can lead to substantial weight loss. Though some patients end up regaining some of the weight that they lost, studies show that most people who undergo bariatric surgery are able to sustain a more than 20 per cent reduction in their body weight a decade after their procedure. That is much greater than what people with obesity can typically lose and maintain through diet and exercise alone. For the new study, Dr Nissen and his colleagues wanted to see how that amount of weight loss would affect cancer rates. They recruited 5,053 people with obesity who had undergone bariatric surgery at the Cleveland Clinic and followed them. Each patient was “matched” to five other patients who were similar in many respects. They were about the same age, sex and race, and they had similar medical histories and body mass indexes, but they did not undergo weight loss surgery. All told, there were more than 30,000 participants in the study, which included 25,265 people in the control group. Both groups had a median age of 46 and a median body mass index of 45, which the CDC categorises as “severe” obesity. That is the equivalent of someone who is about 172cm tall weighing about 136kg. According to the CDC, someone with a BMI between 25 and 30 is considered overweight and someone with a BMI above 30 is classified as obese. Not every person with obesity can have weight loss surgery. In general, to qualify for it, patients must have a BMI of at least 40, or a BMI of 35 or above, along with at least one obesity-related condition, such as Type 2 diabetes, hypertension or heart disease. In the new study, people who underwent surgery had either gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy procedures. After a decade, the patients who had the surgery had lost an average of about 28kg, while those in the control group (who were advised by their doctors to try to lose weight on their own) had lost an average of 3kg. Slightly less than 3 per cent of patients who had surgery developed cancer, compared with roughly 4.9 per cent of those in the non-surgical group – equivalent to a 32 per cent reduction in risk for those who had surgery. In general, the data suggested that patients needed to lose a large amount of weight, at least 20 per cent to 25 per cent of their body weight, to see a beneficial change in their cancer risk, said Dr Ali Aminian, the lead author of the study and the director of the Bariatric and Metabolic Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. The reduction in risk was particularly significant for endometrial cancer, which has the strongest association with obesity. Dr Aminian and several of the study’s authors reported receiving research grants or consulting fees from Medtronic, a company that makes devices used in weight loss surgery. Dr Nissen disclosed receiving research funding from companies that develop weight loss drugs, including Novartis and Eli Lilly. Dr Nissen said that while the new study focused on bariatric surgery, the message was that people should seek to lose weight in whatever way they could, whether through diet and exercise or with help from medical therapies. Obesity is often framed as a failure of willpower. But Dr Jastreboff at Yale noted that since 2013, the American Medical Association has recognised obesity as a chronic disease. She stressed that, as with any other chronic disease, people with obesity should not feel that they must struggle with it on their own. Instead, they should seek help from a doctor or a health care provider who can offer them safe and effective treatments. “When a patient comes to see me for their obesity, one of the first things I say is that this is not their fault, this is not their choice,” she said. “We should not blame patients for having the disease of obesity, in the same way that we do not blame our patients for having diabetes or high blood pressure.” By Anahad O’Connor © 2022 The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/bad-dreams-parkinsons-disease-symptom-risk-brain-health-2739291,Commentary: Frequent nightmares could be an early warning sign of Parkinson's disease,"BIRMINGHAM, England: Every night when we go to sleep, we spend a couple of hours in a virtual world created by our brains in which we are the main protagonist of an unfolding story we did not consciously create. In other words, we dream. For most people, dreams are mainly pleasant, sometimes negative, often bizarre, but rarely terrifying. That is, if they are remembered at all. Yet for about 5 per cent of people, highly memorable and terrifying nightmares (bad dreams that make you wake up) happen on a weekly or even nightly basis. Recent studies have shown that people with Parkinson’s disease have bad dreams and nightmares more often than people without the disease. Studies suggest that between 17 per cent and 78 per cent of people with Parkinson’s have nightmares weekly. A study I conducted in 2021 found that people newly diagnosed with Parkinson’s who experience recurring dreams with “aggressive or action-packed” content, have more rapid disease progression in the years following their diagnosis, compared with those without aggressive dreams.  As such, my study, alongside similar studies, strongly suggests that the dreams of people with Parkinson’s can predict future health outcomes. This made me wonder, might the dreams of people who don’t have Parkinson’s predict future health outcomes, too? My latest study, published in The Lancet’s eClinicalMedicine journal, shows that they can.  Specifically, it showed that developing frequent bad dreams or nightmares in older age could be an early warning sign of imminent Parkinson’s disease in otherwise healthy people. I analysed data from a large US study that contained data over 12 years from 3,818 older men living independently. At the beginning of the study, the men completed a range of questionnaires, one of which included a question about bad dreams. The participants who reported bad dreams at least once a week were then followed at the end of the study for an average of seven years to see whether they were more likely to be diagnosed with Parkinson’s. During this period, 91 people were diagnosed with Parkinson’s. Those who reported having frequent bad dreams at the beginning of the study were twice as likely to develop Parkinson’s compared with those who had them less than weekly. Intriguingly, a significant proportion of the diagnoses happened during the first five years of the study. During this period, the participants with frequent bad dreams were more than three times as likely to develop Parkinson’s disease. These results suggest that older adults, who will one day be diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, may start to experience bad dreams and nightmares a few years before developing the characteristic symptoms of Parkinson’s, including tremors, stiffness and slowness of movement. The study also shows that our dreams can reveal important information about our brain structure and function and may prove to be an important target for neuroscience research.  However, it is important to highlight that only 16 of the 368 men with frequent bad dreams in this study developed Parkinson’s. Since Parkinson’s is a relatively rare condition, most people who have frequent bad dreams are unlikely to ever get the disease. Still, for those who have other known Parkinson’s risk factors, such as excessive daytime sleepiness or constipation, the finding could be important.  Being aware that frequent bad dreams and nightmares (particularly when they start suddenly in later life) may be an early indicator of Parkinson’s, could lead to earlier diagnoses and earlier treatment. One day, doctors may even be able to intervene to stop Parkinson’s disease from developing at all. My team now plans to use electroencephalography (a technique to measure brainwaves) to look at the biological reasons for dream changes in people with Parkinson’s.  This may help us identify treatments that could simultaneously treat bad dreams and also slow down or prevent the onset of Parkinson’s in people at risk of developing the condition.

In a video posted on Instagram on Friday (Jun 10), Bieber said he had contracted Ramsay Hunt syndrome, which affected nerves in his ear and face. He noted that his right eye was not blinking. In an Instagram Story posted later that day, the singer added that it has been ""progressively harder"" for him to eat, which is ""extremely frustrating"". Charles Nduka, a consultant plastic reconstructive surgeon in Britain and the co-founder of health charity Facial Palsy UK, said about 75 per cent of patients with the syndrome who receive early treatment, including steroids and antivirals, make a full recovery. ""I did notice in the video shared by Mr Bieber that he does appear to have some evidence of recovery, which is encouraging,"" Dr Nduka told Reuters. ""With facial paralysis one of the most obvious things is patients are unable to close their eye fully to blink and they are unable to smile,"" Dr Nduka added. ""Before the smile recovers, the first thing that will develop is there is increasingly symmetry in the face at rest. So, the base of the nose often elevates slightly, and the mouth becomes more even. On the video that was shared I could see some signs that there is some early recovery."" Bieber, 28, said he was physically unable to perform his upcoming shows. Dr Nduka said he works with patients in the entertainment industry and it is important they first address any issues weakening the immune system before returning to work. ""They will be under financial pressures and all sorts of pressures to get back out there as soon as possible, but doing so will only lead to longer term problems,"" he said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/justin-bieber-ramsay-hunter-syndrome-2740931,Ramsay Hunt syndrome caused Justin Bieber's facial paralysis; world tour dates affected,"The Biebers aren’t out of the woods yet when it comes to health scares. After wife Hailey’s run-in with stroke-like symptoms in March (the episode was apparently caused by a blood clot in her brain), it’s now Justin’s turn.  In an Instagram video on Jun 10 (Friday), Justin shared his reason for pausing his Justice World Tour: He has been diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome. “I wanted to update you guys on what’s been going on,” he said. “Obviously, as you can probably see from my face, I have this syndrome called Ramsay Hunt syndrome. And it is from this virus that attacks the nerve in my ear and my facial nerves and has caused my face to have paralysis.” Ramsay Hunter syndrome is indeed caused by a virus and it’s the same one that causes chicken pox. It is a rare neurological disorder that is characterised by what the Grammy winner experiences – paralysis of the facial nerve – and in other cases, a painful, blistering rash affecting the ear as well as tinnitus or hearing loss, according to rarediseases.org.  “As you can see, this eye is not blinking, I can’t smile on this side of my face,” the Honest singer said, pointing to the right side of his face. “This nostril will not move. So full paralysis in this side of my face.” “So for those who are frustrated by the cancellations of my next shows, I’m just physically obviously not capable of doing them.”  He continued: “This is pretty serious as you can see. I wish this wasn’t the case, but obviously my body’s telling me I gotta slow down”. “I’m gonna get better,” he assured his followers. “I’m doing all these facial exercises to get my face back to normal and it will go back to normal. It’s just time, and we don’t know how much time it’s gonna be. But it’s gonna be OK, I hope. I trust God. I trust that this is all gonna … it’s all for a reason, I’m not sure what that is right now. But in the meantime, I’m gonna rest, and I love you guys,” he concluded. “Peace.” Before this announcement, Justin had posted an Instagram Story on Jun 7 that he was postponing some tour dates due to a health issue.  The Justice World Tour was originally scheduled to kick off in 2020 but was delayed twice – it was postponed to 2021, then to 2022 – by the COVID-19 pandemic.  No updates on the Singapore concert have been released at the time of writing. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/little-warriors-yong-qiao-qing-eczema-clothing-protection-babies-children-2705941,"Heartbroken to see her kids’ bloody scratches from eczema, this mum started a business to help them","When she first introduced formula made with cow’s milk to her first child, Yong Qiao Qing noticed rashes forming on her daughter’s neck and limbs. Shan En was only two months old then.  It got worse after her daughter, who was born in 2016, started preschool at two. The rashes erupted all over her body, her eyelids began to swell and she scratched until she bled from her wounds.  At the time, Yong did not have much knowledge about food allergies and eczema, and began a journey of learning more. Shan En’s eczema is triggered mostly by dairy, nuts, seafood and eggs. As she grew older, her condition caused Yong to reconsider her career as the head of a customer service team in a local hospitality company. Yong quit when Shan En was three, to help her manage her skin condition.  To help keep the outbreaks at bay, Yong prepared food and packed lunches for her daughter to consume in school. “Her skin condition is kept under control and she will only experience flare-ups if she eats something she shouldn’t have or comes into contact with harsh cleaning chemicals and even alcohol sanitisers.”  Shan En, now six, carries her own alcohol-free sanitiser wherever she goes. Her family also brings along a sensitive-skin cleanser to use instead of normal hand washes in public spaces, as commercial hand washes aggravate the girl’s eczema.  THE WRITING ON THE WALL WITH NUMBER TWO  In 2020, Yong had her second child, Shan Min. She realised she had another eczema baby when she discovered rashes on her second daughter on the day she was born. “The nurses gave her her first bath and when she was returned to me, I peeled back the swaddle to see her and found bright red rashes. I knew immediately I had my second eczema baby,” Yong recounted.    By then, Yong believed she was a seasoned parent on allergies and suspected food allergens to be the cause of her second child’s skin condition. “While breastfeeding her, I went on an elimination diet – removing foods which had dairy, eggs, nuts, seafood and gluten. I struggled with removing so many foods from my diet.”  Yong was also stricken with “mum guilt” every time she ate something which caused Shan Min to itch.  Her second child’s condition was a lot worse. By the time Shan Min was six months old, the infant suffered from red and weepy rashes on her cheeks, calves and arms.  Yong recalled: “She cried a lot from the discomfort the itch caused and would often rub and scratch herself till her clothes were soaked in blood. Conventional mittens did not work because she would pull them off.”  It got so uncomfortable that clothing with Velcro, zippers, buttons or any embellishments would become a tool for Shan Min to scratch herself. “These created deep open wounds on her skin and wherever we went, she would be the object of stares, rude questions and even hurtful comments.”  ELIMINATION, CREAMS AND DAILY RECORDS  On top of dropping allergens from her diet while breastfeeding, Yong also bought every remedy possible. “I used to joke that my collection of skincare products at home could rival that of a retail pharmacy. Every brand you can name, we would have probably tried it at some point. But nothing seemed to help.”  Together with her husband, Gerald Tan, 43, a regional sales manager in the oil and gas industry, Yong dressed their younger daughter’s wounds daily in bandages. They spend hundreds of dollars on wound dressings and even more time to clean and wrap her wounds.  She tried seeing many doctors, including dermatologists, and when the solutions didn’t work, Yong turned to alternative practices such as naturopathy, and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Shan Min got prescribed TCM herbs which were boiled and mixed into her meals.  When Shan Min started solids, all her meals were cooked from scratch and Yong made records of all the ingredients and everything her child ate.  At 11 months old, when Shan Min weaned off breast milk, Yong found milk alternatives and made healthy wholesome meals daily.  “At night, I would sit down with an A4 folder and pore over the daily records – what she ate and her skin condition each day. This way I could identify trends and spot potential allergens. Our goal was to formulate a list of ‘safe’ foods that we knew for certain wouldn’t cause her to itch, while meeting her nutritional needs.”  LITTLE WARRIORS – AN IDEA BORN OF DESPERATION The only thing which stopped her daughter from scratching herself bloody was protective garments with mittens that did not have any embellishments, Velcro, zippers or buttons.  At wits’ end, Yong asked her husband to source for garments that could protect Shan Min’s skin while keeping her comfortable in Singapore’s heat. The garments also needed to include padded mittens to stave off scratches from the baby’s nails.  Yong’s mental health was hanging by a thread. “At that time, I was struggling mentally and crying every night for the pain my children were going through.”  Her husband mounted a search and found local and overseas tailors, garment makers and even fabric suppliers. He came up with the idea for using the couple’s combined experience in sales, marketing and customer service to create clothing which would help other families like themselves who were facing similar difficulties.  He succeeded in convincing his wife and she said, “I decided to give the idea a go because I needed a higher purpose in life to pull me out of the trenches.”  Together, they launched Little Warriors on Shan Min’s first birthday in 2021, with a single product – the Eczema Protective Sleeves. Using super soft bamboo fibre blend, and attached with padded mittens, it can be worn over or under any outfit. The breathable fabric also helps affected children withstand the hot and humid Singapore weather.  The couple take their sourcing and product R&D seriously. They work with a local garment supplier with factories in Vietnam. They chose a local supplier over an overseas partner in order to manage quality control.  “Our local supplier has decades of experience in the industry – this way, we can touch and feel the fabric samples without second-guessing on quality. We can also work closely with them on samples,” Yong said.  This year, Little Warriors launched the Eczema Protective Pants to help children who scratch their legs with their feet.  Sales has been unexpectedly brisk. “We have helped hundreds of families with such little warriors. Many parents have reached out to thank us and some have even said our Protective Sleeves are ‘life-changing’.” “Our return customer rate is over 50 per cent and they come back to order anywhere between four to nine additional pieces. The children don’t just wear the Protective Sleeves to bed – they wear them at home and at school.  “Parents who have experienced our sleeves then share their good feedback with other parents. We’ve heard that some of their kids don’t even notice the extra layer of clothing.” THE ECZEMA JOURNEY SO FAR Shan Min recently turned two and is faring much better than her infant days. By the time she was 18 months, her parents had identified 22 safe foods which did not cause further reactions. All her meals are made with those 22 ingredients.  The family also saw an allergist at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital who administered a skin prick test on Shan Min. They found the same list of allergens her sister reacted to but also discovered new additions – fish, sesame and soy.  “I was consuming these while I was breastfeeding her,” Yong disclosed. However, with this discovery and subsequent elimination from her diet, there was improvement in Shan Min’s skin.   The little one became an entirely different person. “Once we removed her allergens, instead of crying for hours each day, she started to smile and laugh.” There are three creams which provide itch relief for Shan Min, Yong said. “After trying dozens of brands, the answer was in our diaper bag all along. The thing which worked best to heal her open and weepy wounds was diaper cream with zinc oxide.”  Shan Min’s skin is almost healed fully and she attends preschool daily. She still has to bring her food to school but doesn’t scratch from itch and wears both the Little Warriors’ Protective Sleeves and Pants at all times.  Older sister Shan En is also improving – she avoids certain allergens but otherwise enjoys her time at her preschool with her friends.  While there have been requests for adult-sized eczema-wear, Yong is putting her priority on customer service and quality, gathering feedback and improving her current inventory. “For now, our priority is still on children with sensitive skin and we may expand our product line to help these children.”  CNA Women is a section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/malaysia-health-minister-khairy-hfmd-cases-expected-decline-next-few-weeks-2736946,"Number of HFMD cases expected to decline within next few weeks, says Malaysia health minister","KUALA LUMPUR: A decline in hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) cases can be expected within the next two to three weeks, said Malaysia’s Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin.  At a press conference on Thursday (Jun 9), Mr Khairy said HFMD cases are seasonal and transmitted locally. “Usually, the cases will start and become a wave but after a month, the number of cases will reduce. When many children are exposed to the virus, their immunity will go up and the number of cases will decrease,” he said. Malaysia has experienced a sharp increase in the number of HFMD cases this year, following the reopening of economic sectors and schools. Varying levels of movement restrictions were put in place from March 2020 until March 2022 to curb the spread of COVID-19.  On Tuesday, Health Ministry director-general Noor Hisham Abdullah said a total of 82,846 HFMD cases have been reported as of the 22nd epidemiological week that ended on Jun 4.  It was a 2.7-fold increase compared to the 30,489 cases recorded during the same period in 2019, and a 33-fold increase compared to the same period last year, he added.   Weekly HFMD cases have fallen by 9.3 per cent, from 18,688 cases in the 21st week to 16,954 HFMD cases in the 22nd week, according to Dr Noor Hisham. Selangor recorded the highest number of infections so far with 23,305 cases, followed by Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, Perak, Kelantan and Johor.   Almost 90 per cent of the cases recorded this year involved children below six years old, said the director-general. Three children have been admitted to the intensive critical unit (ICU), with two of them suffering encephalitis, a brain inflammation.  A total of 305 premises in the country have shut voluntarily while 1,041 premises have been ordered to close so far this year because of the disease, said Dr Noor Hisham.  Mr Khairy said on Thursday that they have a theory on why the HFMD cases spiked this year. “One, of course the pre-schools and nurseries have reopened. But if we compare it to 2019 before the pandemic, the cases are very high. For two years, children didn’t go out and were not exposed to the virus and their immunity levels also decreased,” he said during the press conference. According to the ministry, symptoms of the disease include fever, mouth ulcers and skin rashes commonly found on hands, mouth or feet. Some infected children, however, do not experience any symptoms.   The disease is spread by direct contact with nose and throat discharges, saliva, feces and fluid from blisters of an infected person.   Coughing and sneezing, sharing of eating utensils or personal belongings, as well as touching contaminated surfaces, can cause the infection to spread."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/pet-owner-questions-cats-dogs-overfeeding-vet-clinic-2721166,Fur parents’ questions answered: Are you overfeeding your pet? When should you take it to a vet?,"If watching animal videos already gives your brain little fist bumps to keep you going in the day, living with an actual floof would most certainly lend a shot of pawsitivity to real life.  After all, studies have shown the direct link between pet ownership and better mental health and greater physical activity levels during the pandemic.  Not that Singaporeans need researchers to tell them the benefits of having a pet, COVID-19 or not. In fact, 17 per cent of local cat and dog owners welcomed a new furry member to the family at the start of the pandemic, according to the Pets & Us Survey on more than 1,000 cat and dog owners by Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) Animal Health Singapore. And of which, 12 per cent brought home their pets during the 2020 circuit breaker.   As it turns out, Singaporeans are big dog lovers; almost half of the pet owners surveyed have a canine family member. About a third of owners prefer cats, while 22 per cent have both cats and dogs. Among the respondents, the largest group consisted of millennials (51 per cent), followed by Gen-Xers, who make up 25 per cent. But while there is an increase in pet ownership, pet owners’ knowledge in their animals’ health care is rather lacking. For instance, the concern that almost every owner had, according to the survey, is having their pets develop chronic health issues.  Yet, despite the worry, more than two thirds of pet owners had little or no knowledge of key health issues such as parasite infestation, chronic kidney disease and heart disease that might affect their cats and dogs. When they did try to find information on pet health, 35 per cent turned to the Internet, while 26 per cent looked at YouTube and TikTok videos. And here’s where inappropriate or incorrect information can be just as harmful.  Information from “unreliable sources, coupled with self-diagnosis or uncertified interpretation of results and behavioural changes in the animal, are usually obstacles to proper care”, said Dr Eddie Tan, BI’s technical manager (companion animals) for Singapore and Malaysia. He has even come across owners who impose the beliefs and preferences that they follow in their own lives on their pets. They think that by doing so, “the pets will benefit from what they perceive as appropriate”, he said.  What other areas are pet owners in Singapore lacking in? Here’s a look at the common questions that the local experts have come across: MY CAT IS ALWAYS CLEANING ITSELF. DO I STILL NEED TO BRING IT TO THE VET TO CHECK FOR PARASITES? “Some pet owners think cats can take care of themselves without the need to visit a vet for regular consultation or health check-up. But that’s not true,” said Dr Tan Do Yew, BI’s regional technical manager (companion animals) for ASEAN, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. “Cats, like other pets, need veterinary care to prevent health issues and ensure their overall wellbeing.” He cited a recent study done in East and Southeast Asia, which found that 5 per cent of cats had gastrointestinal parasites. And get this: The same study revealed that nearly half of the cats in Singapore were exposed to at least one vector-borne pathogen (which can be transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes, ticks or sandflies etc) or infested by fleas or ticks.  When you find one flea on your cat, there are already more of the bloodsuckers in your environment, said Dr Tan DY. “A flea can lay an average of 25 eggs per day. Eggs can drop off the animal and cause an infestation in the home,” he said. “Therefore, preventative measures are very important. Don’t wait to treat the issue only when you see them. It could be too late as they may have already spread inside the home.”  The adage, prevention is better than cure, applies to dogs, too. Milo can be troubled by parasites if you don’t keep an eye out for them. In the same study, 4 per cent of dogs in Singapore tested positive for heartworm.  ARE CATS AND DOGS MORE RESILIENT THAN HUMANS TO DISEASE?  The Pets & Us Survey found that while 82 per cent of owners took preventive measures to safeguard their pets’ health, 11 per cent admitted to not taking their pets to a vet at all. Not a good move considering that about 10 per cent of dogs seen at the vet’s have heart disease. Cats aren’t spared either; chronic kidney disease affects 30 per cent to 40 per cent of cats above the age of 10.  The pet cancer situation looks malignant, too. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), about one in four dogs will, at some stage in their life, develop neoplasia, which is the uncontrolled and abnormal growth of cells. And half of dogs over the age of 10 will develop cancer.  “Dogs get cancer at roughly the same rate as humans, while there is less information about the rate of cancer in cats. Some cancers, such as lymphoma, are more common in cats than in dogs,” according to the AVMA.  Genetics are to blame for the abovementioned diseases but unfortunately, some of the ways pet owners use to show affection to their furry friends could be killing them. For instance, 85 per cent of owners in the Pets & Us survey admit to spoiling their pets with treats – and think this has a positive impact on their animals’ health and wellbeing. Ironically, the effect is quite the opposite. Take chronic kidney disease, for instance. Yes, it can be the result of a hereditary condition, said Dr Kenneth Tong from AAVC - Animal & Avian Veterinary Clinic. But more often, it is the owners’ overindulgence in supplements and feeding as well as not bringing the animal for routine examination to detect early signs of organ dysfunction, he said. “Early detection enables early treatment,” said Dr Tong. “Many owners tend to ‘fear the results’ and shun even attempting to get a test or examination done. It’s a phenomenon of ‘don’t see, don’t know, all is well’, until it’s too late.” MY PET DOESN’T SEEM WELL. WHEN DO I GO TO THE VET IMMEDIATELY?  Let’s put yourself in your pet’s situation, said Dr Tong. If you’re experiencing the following signs, would you wait another 24 hours or would you get yourself to the A&E department immediately?  “If any condition looks terrible to you, seems like an emergency, or sounds urgent in nature, it probably is,” said Dr Tong. “By waiting, you risk having the condition worsen, and the delayed care can result in your options being limited.”   On the other hand, if your pet is still active and seems to be its usual self (for example, wagging its tail, licking your face or grooming itself), you can wait 48 hours or so before taking your pet to the vet, said Dr Tong.  IS HOME-MADE PET FOOD BETTER THAN THOSE CANNED OR DRIED PET FOOD? Prepping your pet’s meals can seem like a good idea, doesn’t it? You can control what you put into the bowl (more fresh ingredients) and what you leave out (salt, sugar, oil, preservatives and other additives).  “Recently, perhaps driven by pet owners staying at home during the COVID-19 situation, there has been an upward trend in home-prepared pet food,” said Dr Teo Boon Han, a vet and managing partner of VetTrust. “Some of these home-prepared pet diets are also sold to the public.” But here’s the rub: Is the home-prepped pet food nutritionally complete? In a 2017 Brazil study on 106 pet diet recipes, which were taken from online and printed sources, the recipes were found to have at least one nutrient below pet dietary recommendations. The most common nutrients to fall short were iron, calcium, and vitamins E and B12. “When consumed long term, these diets expose pets to nutritional diseases,"" said Dr Teo. Conversely, it is also a misconception that all commercially available pet food is complete and balanced, he noted. “When in doubt, pet owners should seek advice from their veterinarians and/or pet nutritionists.”  Another way is to look for the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) or European Pet Food Industry Federation (FEDIAF) endorsement on the label, said Dr Tong. “This indicates that the manufacturer has met or exceeded the nutritional guidelines.” He added: “Feeding trials by the AAFCO or FEDIAF, when conducted, are prominently labelled as well, giving the assurance that the food was used for months, and the animal closely monitored and assessed showed no deficiency or side effects.” WHEN IT COMES TO PET SUPPLEMENTS, IT’S BETTER TO GIVE MORE THAN LESS, RIGHT? “Over-supplementation can lead to skeletal-muscle disproportionate growth, especially in young growing animals,” said Dr Tong. Not only that, it can also lead to excessive calcium deposits as well as overwork the animal's organs. This can all lead to medical conditions such as obesity, urinary stones, joint diseases and to some extent, liver and kidney diseases.  So does your pet need supplements? It goes back to how nutritionally complete your pet’s food is in the first place, reminded Dr Tong. “A balanced diet from a reputable pet manufacturing company would already have all the essential nutrients in it.” AM I OVERFEEDING MY PET? One way to minimise overfeeding is to use a measuring cup when portioning out your pet’s meal, said Dr Teo. “In an international survey of pet owners conducted in 2018, an astounding 80 per cent of pet owners do not always measure how much food they feed their pets. My advice is to follow the feeding recommendations on the label of your pet food packaging.” And for good reason, too. Overfeeding may lead to obesity and that may affect the musculoskeletal (Fido can develop osteoarthritis) and endocrine systems (Socks may get diabetes) of the pets, said Dr Tan DY.  Moreover, “pet owners may not readily recognise their pet as overweight”. One way to get around this blind spot is to use the Body Condition Score (BCS) system – similar to the human Body Mass Index (BMI) – to monitor their pet, he said, which you can speak to the vet about. And don’t give in to your pet when it begs for food.  BUT I THINK MY PET IS HAPPY WHEN I FEED IT – AND I WANT IT TO BE HAPPY It is common in the Asian culture to equate food with love, said Dr Tong. “Have you eaten?” and “eat more” are ways we show affection to one another. In this regard, feeding an animal and watching it eat enthusiastically makes the feeder happy as it is perceived as approval of the feeder’s actions, he said.  “Happiness can vary between individuals and the same goes for animals, too,” said Dr Tong. “Though seeing our pets eat can bring us joy, we need to remember a crucial take-home message: Do everything in moderation. Overdoing anything can impact our pet’s health, reduce their lifespan and ultimately, take away the pleasure we experience from having them in our lives.”  Dr E Tan agreed that there are ways other than food that allow pet owners to show affection such as playing with their pets, talking to them or simply being there. “Pets have feelings and emotions, and they will know or sense it,” he said.  Grooming, showering and brushing them are other examples, said Dr Tong. “Not all activities need to be physically straining but a game of fetch, finding a hidden toy or walking around the block is sufficient to make a better difference than a calorie-ladened treat.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/varicose-veins-women-treatment-pregnancy-2722411,Varicose veins aren’t just unsightly but could also be a health risk – why do women still ignore them?,"While many women look at varicose veins as an aesthetic or a cosmetic issue, the condition, while common, could potentially be more dangerous than we think. A 2021 YouGov survey found that more than one in three individuals in Singapore suffer from varicose veins. Out of this number, three-quarters of sufferers said they had not sought, and did not intend to seek, medical help for it, said Associate Professor Chong Tze Tec, Head & Senior Consultant of Vascular Surgery at Singapore General Hospital (SGH). Varicose veins are a progressive and debilitating condition that may affect your mobility, self confidence and ability to carry out a daily routine, he explained. These green-blue veins that look like ropes running down the skin frequently occur in the leg, resulting in leg cramps, aches and swelling.  Dr Sriram Narayanan, a senior consultant vascular surgeon at The Harley Street Heart & Vascular Centre, described varicose veins as “abnormal, tortuous veins” that are larger than 3mm in size.   Assoc Prof Chong explained that the condition occurs when the valves (tissue that prevents blood from flowing backwards) in the veins stop working properly, affecting blood circulation.  “Without proper valve function, the blood tends to flow down, giving rise to ‘blood pooling’ in the leg, thus causing the vein to bulge,” said Dr John Tan, a consultant vascular surgeon at The Vein Clinic. Overall, venous disease has a higher occurrence in places that have a longer life expectancy, such as Singapore, Dr Sriram noted.  “Quite simply, the longer you live, and the longer you stand, the higher the prevalence of venous disease,” he said, adding that about 15 per cent of Singaporeans will develop severe chronic venous disease, which can lead to leg ulcers, swelling or in rare cases, bleeding.  WOMEN ARE AT HIGHER RISK OF GETTING VARICOSE VEINS Generally, 35 per cent of women above the age of 20 have varicose veins and spider veins, said Dr Tan. The condition occurs less frequently in men, about 20 per cent. It’s mainly due to the effects of hormonal changes and pregnancy, Assoc Prof Chong explained. “The oestrogen hormone in women can weaken the walls of the veins and cause valves to function poorly.”  During pregnancy, added Dr Sriram, the baby in the womb puts pressure on the veins that take blood from the legs back to the heart, causing the vein valves to give way, resulting in varicose veins. IGNORING VARICOSE VEINS AND ITS SYMPTOMS Since varicose veins progress very slowly – over years and decades – most people often ignore it until it is very advanced, noted Dr Tan. Women, in particular, tend to downplay the importance of getting treated, said Assoc Prof Chong, adding that these visibly enlarged veins point to something more serious.  The stoic nature of many women, who bear with the symptoms, may also be a factor in them not seeking treatment, said Dr Sriram. Also, “women who normally cover their legs either as a personal choice or for cultural reasons tend not to seek treatment if they don’t have pain or ache”, he added. 1. WHAT CAUSES VARICOSE VEINS? In addition to pregnancy and hormonal changes in women, family history and obesity (as excess weight puts pressure on the veins) can increase one’s chances of getting varicose veins, Assoc Prof Chong said, adding that lifestyle choices such as smoking and lack of exercise are common risk factors.  Since it’s related to your lifestyle, your job could increase your risk, too, said Dr Sriram. This is especially so if it requires long hours of standing, such as being a nurse or a teacher.  2. WHAT ARE THE TELLING SYMPTOMS? Most patients report seeing varicose veins first appear on their legs, especially at their calves.  “The early signs of varicose veins include common muscle aches, discomfort, and heaviness of the legs. In more severe cases, symptoms can also include swelling, burning, itching, and even skin discolouration,” said Assoc Prof Chong.  Dr Sriram said that having a “sensation of aching” and “cramping in the legs”, which worsens at the end of the day, is also common. Some women also experience pain or throbbing in the varicose veins itself, especially around the time of their menstrual period, he added. 3. ARE VARICOSE VEINS THE SAME AS SPIDER VEINS? WHICH IS MORE SERIOUS?  Spider veins, also known as thread veins, are fine red lines often seen in fairer skin, Dr Sriram explained. They’re also smaller than varicose veins – less than 1mm in size.  “They appear as clusters of pink and purple thread-like veins that lie near the surface of the skin, typically on the legs,” explained Dr Tan.  While some may see spider veins as unsightly, Assoc Prof Chong told CNA Women that they are “much more common” and are less likely to cause harm to one’s health. In fact, up to 80 per cent of people in Singapore have spider veins, he added, and sufferers may not need treatment.  4. CAN WE LEAVE VARICOSE VEINS UNTREATED? Unlike spider veins, which can often be left alone, varicose veins should be treated, said Dr Tan. They will not go away on their own. Varicose veins can initially be asymptomatic, but as the condition progresses, you can expect significant discomfort in the form of aches, cramps and swollen ankles, said Dr Tan.  However, as varicose veins “progress slowly”, he added that you can slow its progression by wearing compression stockings and elevating your leg to relieve symptoms.  When should you seek medical attention and treatment? When the symptoms start to disrupt your ability to go about your daily routine, advised Assoc Prof Chong, or when you get to the stage of visibly enlarged veins. “Going about your daily routine might only exacerbate the condition and may lead to venous bleeding (which occurs when build-up pressure can eventually lead to the rupturing of the affected veins),” he said.  Persistent leg cramps and muscle aches are also not a good sign, Assoc Prof Chong added, and you should get your legs checked as soon as possible, before the symptoms worsen.  6. HOW SERIOUS (OR DANGEROUS) CAN VARICOSE VEINS GET? According to Assoc Prof Chong, a study suggested that 30 per cent of untreated patients will have more serious problems within six years, which include vein rupturing and heavy bleeding.   Signs of severe varicose veins include: 7. WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF TREATMENTS AVAILABLE FOR VARICOSE VEINS? The aim of treatment is to remove the veins with bad valves and push the blood into the good veins with well-functioning valves, said Dr Sriram.  Treatment used to involve surgery with full anaesthesia and “ugly incisions” to remove or tie up the damaged veins, said Dr Tan. But nowadays, these have been replaced with minimally invasive therapies to seal the affected vein. For example, in the venaseal closure procedure, a “medical glue” is used to seal the vein, said Dr Tan. During this procedure, a small catheter is introduced into the vein under ultrasound guidance, through which small drops of the glue are inserted every few centimetres, he explained. Pressure is then applied at each vein spot for the glue to act. Other minimally invasive treatments include using radiofrequency ablation (which uses heat to seal up the vein); and endovenous laser ablation (which uses significantly higher temperatures at the tip of a laser fibre to close the vein), said Dr Sriram.  Recovery time for these minimally invasive therapies is “significantly reduced”, said Assoc Prof Chong, with most treatments being done as outpatient procedures.  For instance, in endovenous laser ablation, varicose veins can be closed and eliminated in about one hour, said Dr Tan, leaving just a “few, small needle marks”, without scars.  In 15 to 30 per cent of cases, varicose veins can recur, usually within five years, said Dr Sriram.  To reduce the likelihood of recurrence, he advised developing the habit of walking (not running) to keep your weight down. “This activates the calf muscles to pump blood back to the heart from the veins.” “If the varicose veins come back in the same spot, it’s usually (though not always) due to incomplete treatment the first time.” CNA Women is a section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/swimming-workout-exercise-plans-tips-2712831,"With this crazy hot weather, it’s time to make swimming your regular workout","The weather is hotter than ever, and you’ve decided this is the year to trade your running shoes for a pair of swim goggles. Maybe you’ve tweaked a knee and need a lower impact form of cardio, maybe you just can’t face your outdoor boot camp class when it’s 32 degrees celsius. Whatever your reason for taking to the water, swimming is one of the best exercises you can do for your health. It’s a total body workout, taxing your arms and legs, as well as your cardiovascular system, yet it puts less stress on your joints than most other exercises. And on a hot summer day, the cool water is a good place to get sweaty. According to Hirofumi Tanaka, a professor of kinesiology at the University of Texas at Austin, swimming provides similar cardiovascular benefits as running or other endurance sports. Research at his lab also suggests a regular swim program can lower blood pressure and soften stiff arteries in older adults. “Swimming is really an underappreciated, sneaky good form of exercise,” Dr. Tanaka said. “Exercise needs to involve large muscle groups, be rhythmical in nature and it should tax cardiovascular functions. Swimming fits perfectly.” But where to begin? Facing down a lap lane can be intimidating as a novice. Below are some tips from professional coaches on how to turn 30 minutes at the pool into an effective workout. START SLOW “You wouldn’t go right out and say, ‘I’m going to run 10 miles (16km),’” said Cokie Lepinski, a U.S. Masters Swimming coach in Surprise, Arizona. “Same thing with swimming.” Buy a good pair of goggles (a swim cap and kickboard can be helpful but aren’t necessary) and start by swimming one lap — down and back the length of the pool — without stopping. Typically, people swim freestyle when they exercise because it’s the most efficient stroke, but you can switch it up if you have a strong preference or want some variety. Most American recreational pools are 25 yards (22.86m) long, so one lap is 50 yards (45.72m) two laps is 100 yards (91.44m) and so on. (Olympic pools are twice as long, while home pools vary, so make sure you know the length.) If one lap feels easy, do two with a short break (10 to 20 seconds) in between. Gradually build up, increasing the number of laps and decreasing the frequency of breaks, but don’t overdo it on your first day — no more than 10 laps total. “When it comes to swimming, it’s about consistency, so start from where you are,” said Cullen Jones, a four-time Olympic medallist who coaches youth swimming. “Make sure that what you’re doing is manageable. Have the mind-set that you can do it again the next day or two days from now.” FOCUS ON FORM If your last swim lesson was in grade school, here are a couple of tips to keep in mind. First, you want your body to be on top of the water as much as possible. The easiest way to do that is to keep your head down and look at the bottom of the pool. “If you lift your head up and you look at the wall,” said Fares Ksebati, a founder and chief executive of the swimming app MySwimPro, “your legs are going to sink, and that’s going to create a lot of resistance.” Your kick also helps you stay balanced on top of the water. In fact, unless you’re sprinting, kicking is more important for body position than for propulsion. Kick just enough to keep your hips and legs on top of the water so they don’t drag you down. “The biggest mistake beginner swimmers make is they kick too much,” Mr. Ksebati said. “The legs use the most blood, so if you kick a lot, you’re going to fatigue a lot more quickly.” If you’re racing, then you can kick your legs into high gear, as Mr. Jones did in the 50-metre freestyle sprint at the 2012 Olympics. But when swimming for endurance or general fitness, imitate someone like distance swimmer Katie Ledecky, whose legs barely make waves, to conserve energy and focus more on balance and alignment. Another mistake beginners make is staying too flat in the water. Instead, you want to rock subtly from side to side. As your fingertips touch the surface, extend your arm as far as you can while rotating your hips and shoulders slightly. Try this on dry land: stand on your tiptoes with one arm stretched overhead. If you shift your hip and shoulder upward and forward, you can probably reach a few inches higher. Now do that in the water. “If you can start to rotate with your shoulders and your hips on every single stroke and reach a few more inches, you’re going to basically lengthen out your stroke, and that’ll make you more efficient,” Mr. Ksebati explained. Another way to increase your efficiency is to create more force with each stroke. As you pull your arm down through the water, try to get your forearm perpendicular to the bottom of the pool. Your fingertips should be separated slightly — less than a centimetre — to get the most power. Don’t worry about breathing on alternating sides if one feels more comfortable than the other. The goal is to keep a rhythm. “Every time your face is in the water, you’re exhaling,” Ms. Lepinski said. “Every time you come up, you’re having a nice, measured inhale.” Once you can do eight laps easily, try some interval training. For serious swimmers, workouts are structured like weight training, broken into sets rather than going for 30 minutes straight. To do this, you need to understand an interval formula used in almost all swim workouts. Intervals are usually described firstly, the number of repetitions and, secondly the distance in yards of each rep as a multiple of 25 (the length of the pool). Short rests are built in after every rep. For example, a two X 50 means swimming 50 yards (45.72m down and back), taking a 10-second break, and then swimming another lap. For a four X 25, swim the same distance, but rest every time you touch a side. A one X 100 means swimming two laps continuously and resting after. All three intervals are 100 yards total, but they’re swum at different rates. Tailor your intervals to your goals. If you want a higher intensity workout, swim shorter intervals at a faster pace. If you want to work on endurance, swim longer distances at a slower pace with fewer breaks. For example, a four X 25 would typically be swum at a sprint, while a one X 100 is usually a slower, endurance-focused interval. “If you swim the same pace every day,” Ms. Lepinski said, “you won’t get as much benefit.” For one, she added, interval training is more fun. “And two, it just challenges your heart a little bit better.” Mr. Ksebati and Ms. Lepinski said a good beginner or intermediate workout is 1,000 to 1,500 yards, or 20 to 30 laps, which should take about half an hour. Begin with a short warm-up — maybe a four X 50 at an easy pace — to get your heart rate up. You can mix in different strokes, doing breast or backstroke instead of freestyle for a little variety. Next do a four X 25 using a kickboard to get your legs activated. Then comes the main set, or the bulk of your workout. If you’re working on speed, do eight X 50 (eight laps with a break after each) at a fast pace. If you want to increase endurance, try a moderately paced ladder, ascending and then descending the length of your intervals: one X 50, one X 100, one X 200, one X 100, one X 50. Last comes the cool-down, another four X 50 of swimming at a relaxed pace. You can take a longer break — one or two minutes — in between the warm-up, main set and cool down. It’s a little confusing at first, but once you get the lingo you can follow almost any swim workout. Want even more structure or a goal to work toward? Apps like MySwimPro provide customized workout plans, or you can find your local U.S. Masters Swimming team. (In the swimming world, “masters” just means adult.) Most of all, enjoy the process. For many swimmers, the water isn’t only a place to work out, it’s also a sanctuary. “It’s hard to be thinking about the stresses of the world when you’re thinking about, ‘When’s my next breath? Where’s the end of the pool? What set am I on?’” Ms. Lepinski said. “When we slip under the water, the world goes away.” By Dana G Smith © The New York Times Company This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/parkinsons-disease-boxing-therapy-2719211,Boxing said to be good therapy for patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease,"For Cheryl Karian, a 72-year-old retired physician assistant, boxing is medicine. Ms. Karian, whose Parkinson’s disease was diagnosed in 2020, doesn’t compete or spar, but every Tuesday and Thursday, she trains for an hour at Main Street Boxing and Muay Thai in downtown Houston. Before her diagnosis, Ms. Karian ran, played tennis and worked a demanding job caring for patients at MD Anderson Cancer Centre. This all changed in the years leading up to her diagnosis in 2020, as she started experiencing cognitive difficulties and frequent falls. “I can’t do what I used to do,” Ms. Karian said one day after a boxing class. Along with two other class participants, Ms. Karian was shadowboxing, or punching into thin air, under the direction of the professional boxer Austin Trout, known as No Doubt Trout. It was part of a program called Rock Steady Boxing, which specializes in no-contact boxing training for Parkinson’s patients. As Mr. Trout called out instructions — “One, two! One, two, slip!” — Ms. Karian threw different punches, dodging and rolling her head, all while maintaining a boxer’s wide-legged stance. No-contact boxing training has grown more popular over the last decade or so, with 4,000 new gyms popping up before the pandemic hit and more than five million Americans strapping on gloves in 2020. Boxing’s varied and high-intensity workouts offer a blend of strength and cardiovascular conditioning that improves agility, coordination and balance, and which may be especially beneficial for people with neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease. Parkinson’s is caused by a chronic deficiency in dopamine, which triggers increasing muscle stiffness, tremors, difficulties with speaking, fatigue, dizziness and a loss of coordination and balance. Patients’ movements often get very slow and small. Falling is a big problem, especially as symptoms progress. And while there is no cure, or even a way to halt the symptoms, no-contact boxing training seems to offer a way to slow the effects and improve confidence. “If you train for boxing, you’ll see that your coordination is better, your agility is better, your balance is better,” said Mr. Trout, a former light middleweight world champion who has been teaching Rock Steady classes for four years. “This is a way to physically fight back against Parkinson’s.” A COUNTERINTUITIVE IDEA Rock Steady Boxing was founded in 2006 by Scott Newman, a prosecutor in Marion County, Ind., who discovered that boxing workouts helped him manage his symptoms of early-onset Parkinson’s disease. In the beginning, it was just he and five other patients training with a former professional boxer, Kristy Follmar. The strangeness of boxing therapy was not lost on them — the sport has among the highest rates of concussion and brain injury. While it’s not clear that a lifetime of concussions can cause Parkinson’s, it can increase the risk. Muhammad Ali, one of the sport’s most iconic figures, developed the condition after a professional career in which he famously wore out the hardest-hitting heavyweights of his time by taking punch after punch. In Rock Steady’s classes, participants don’t take punches; they only throw them. Ryan Cotton, the chief scientific officer at Rock Steady Boxing, said that in the early days Mr. Newman and Ms. Follmar were working on a hunch. At the time, Parkinson’s experts recommended focusing on mobility and balance while avoiding overexertion. The wide-legged stance of a boxer and the shifting centre of gravity when throwing a punch seemed perfect for training balance and posture. “There was theory this should work, but there was no scientific evidence,” Dr. Cotton said. “Really, science has caught up to us and now supports a lot of the things we were integrating.” In the years since, research has shown that many forms of high-intensity exercise, and particularly boxing, may slow the progression of Parkinson’s symptoms. Boxing also seems to help with other neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and stroke. Rock Steady has grown to over 850 affiliate programs in 17 countries, with training and certification programs for coaches like Mr. Trout, who want to offer training specifically for people with Parkinson’s disease with varying severity of symptoms. When Ms. Karian’s learned of her illness, she knew what her future could look like if she wasn’t proactive. She watched her mother, who also had Parkinson’s disease, for years as her quality of life declined. But she has found that boxing helps her balance, coordination and mental functioning. “I’m going to do as much as I can, for as long as I can,” Ms. Karian said FINDING BALANCE Around half of all Parkinson’s patients will fall in a given year, most more than once. Mr. Trout, like many boxing coaches, drills his students on maintaining a stable stance while keeping their hands by their faces and their arms tucked to protect the body and face. “This is exceptional training for fall prevention,” said Ben Fung, a physical therapist based in San Diego who specializes in helping patients, including those with Parkinson’s, avoid falling and has a background in mixed martial arts. Many falls happen when a person is either reaching for something or changing direction or velocity. Learning a boxer’s stance can help with maintaining balance, while keeping the hands up can protect the body and face from injuries in the event of a fall. Participants practice falling as part of the Rock Steady curriculum. “Ending up on the floor is more common than not with people with Parkinson’s,” said Dr. Cotton, whose father received a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease a few years after he started working with Rock Steady. “Our boxers still fall; they’re just not paralyzed by fear.” Less fear may mean fewer falls. “One of the biggest factors in whether or not someone is at risk for falling is if they’re fearful of falling,” said Rebecca Martin, a professor of physical therapy at Hanover College in Indiana. Dr. Martin is not affiliated with Rock Steady Boxing, but seeing its effectiveness has led her to incorporate boxing techniques into her work, which includes leading weekly exercise classes for people with Parkinson’s disease. A recent study of boxing therapy found that Parkinson’s patients who underwent twice-weekly training reported fewer falls, with the number of falls going up during Covid-19 lockdowns and going back down once the restrictions were lifted and they were able to resume training. This is something Mr. Trout saw first-hand, as many of his participants — or “fighters,” as he calls them — came back from lockdowns stiffer and shakier than before. OUTSIDE THE RING Parkinson’s disease also has psychological effects. As patients lose coordination and balance, many start to second-guess their abilities and pull into a shell, withdrawing from friends and family and limiting trips outside the home, because of fears about falling. “Parkinson’s takes away your confidence,” Ms. Karian said. “You have to work at it to keep it up.” In a recent survey of more than 1,700 people with Parkinson’s disease, nearly three-quarters of Rock Steady Boxing participants reported that the program improved their social lives, and more than half said it helped with fatigue, fear of falling, depression and anxiety. “Parkinson’s disease is not just a condition that affects motor symptoms, such as how you move, walk and talk. Parkinson’s can also affect people’s moods, making them feel lonely or isolated,” said Danielle Larson, a neurologist at Northwestern University in Illinois and one of the researchers to conduct the survey. She is also not affiliated with Rock Steady but said she now often recommends boxing to her patients. For some of Mr. Trout’s fighters, boxing class is often the only time they get out of the house each week. Kathy Smith, a retired schoolteacher, said she often felt self-conscious about her abilities in exercise classes. In Rock Steady Boxing, “they understand, and they help us adjust to our different abilities,” she said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/wellness-vagus-nerve-mental-health-depression-ptsd-diabetes-2723886,This nerve influences nearly every internal organ in our body. Can it improve our mental health too?,"In recent years, the vagus nerve has become an object of fascination, especially on social media. The vagal nerve fibres, which run from the brain to the abdomen, have been anointed by some influencers as the key to reducing anxiety, regulating the nervous system and helping the body to relax. TikTok videos with the hashtag “#vagusnerve” have been viewed more than 64 million times and there are nearly 70,000 posts with the hashtag on Instagram. Some of the most popular ones feature simple hacks to “tone” or “reset” the vagus nerve, in which people plunge their faces into ice water baths or lie on their backs with ice packs on their chests. There are also neck and ear massages, eye exercises and deep-breathing techniques. Now, wellness companies have capitalized on the trend, offering products like “vagus massage oil,” vibrating bracelets and pillow mists, that claim to stimulate the nerve, but that have not been endorsed by the scientific community. Researchers who study the vagus nerve say that stimulating it with electrodes can potentially help improve mood and alleviate symptoms in those who suffer from treatment-resistant depression, among other ailments. But are there other ways to activate the vagus nerve? Who would benefit most from doing so? And what exactly is the vagus nerve, anyway? Here’s a look at what we know so far. WHAT IS THE VAGUS NERVE? The term “vagus nerve” is actually shorthand for thousands of fibres. They are organized into two bundles that run from the brain stem down through each side of the neck and into the torso, branching outward to touch our internal organs, said Dr. Kevin J. Tracey, a neurosurgeon and president of the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Northwell Health’s research centre in New York. Imagine something akin to a tree, whose limbs interact with nearly every organ system in the body. (The word “vagus” means “wandering” in Latin.) The vagus nerve picks up information about how the organs are functioning and also sends information from the brain stem back to the body, helping to control digestion, heart rate, voice, mood and the immune system. For those reasons, the vagus nerve – the longest of the 12 cranial nerves – is sometimes referred to as an “information superhighway.” Dr. Tracey compared it to a trans-Atlantic cable. “It’s not a mishmash of signals,” he said. “Every signal has a specific job.” The vagus is the main nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system. Unlike the sympathetic nervous system, which is associated with the body’s “fight or flight” response, the parasympathetic branch helps us rest, digest and calm down. Scientists first began examining the vagus nerve in the late 1800s to investigate whether stimulating it could be a potential treatment for epilepsy. They later discovered that a side effect of activating the nerve was an improvement in mood. Today, researchers are examining how the nerve can affect psychiatric disorders, among other conditions. WHAT DOES THE RESEARCH SAY? Evidence indicates that stimulating the vagus nerve can help people with epilepsy, diabetes, treatment-resistant depression and post-traumatic stress disorder – as well as inflammatory autoimmune conditions like Crohn’s disease or rheumatoid arthritis. There is even some preliminary research suggesting that long Covid symptoms could originate, in part, from the virus’s effect on the vagus nerve. “It can sound sort of magical with all the things it does,” said Eric Porges, an assistant professor in the department of clinical and health psychology at the University of Florida who studies the vagus nerve. Our understanding of the vagus nerve “continues to grow in richness and depth,” he said, but there is still much to learn about how it works. In the early 2000s, researchers started to show that vagus nerve stimulation could help some patients who were severely depressed and had not responded to other treatments. A wave of studies followed. By 2005, the Food and Drug Administration had approved implantable pulse-generating devices that sent electrical signals to the vagus nerve, for use in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Similar devices have also been approved for obesity – to help control feelings of hunger and fullness – and for the treatment of epilepsy. The downside of these devices, however, is that the surgery is expensive and it can take months – and sometimes as long as a year – to have an effect. Researchers are now recruiting patients for the largest clinical trial to date examining to what degree vagus nerve stimulation may help patients with depression who have been unable to find relief with other treatments. The device may be especially helpful for those with bipolar depression because so few treatments exist for them, said Dr. Scott Aaronson, one of the senior psychiatrists involved in the clinical trial and the chief science officer of the Institute for Advanced Diagnostics and Therapeutics, a centre within the Sheppard Pratt psychiatric hospital that aims to help people who have not improved with conventional treatments and medications. In general, one of the problems with treating depression “is that we’ve got a lot of medications that pretty much do the same thing,” Dr. Aaronson said. And when patients do not respond to those medications, “we don’t have a lot of novel stuff.”   Implanted vagus nerve stimulation isn’t currently accessible for most people, however, because insurers have so far declined to pay for the procedure, with the exception of Medicare recipients participating in the latest clinical trial. Dr. Tracey’s research, which uses internal vagus nerve stimulation to treat inflammation, may also have applications for psychiatric disorders like PTSD, said Dr. Andrew H. Miller, the director of the Behavioural Immunology Program at Emory University, who studies how the brain and the immune system interact, and how those interactions can contribute to stress and depression. PTSD is characterized by increased measures of inflammation in the blood, he said, which “can influence circuits in the brain that are related to anxiety.” In one pilot study at Emory, for example, researchers electronically stimulated the neck skin near the vagus in 16 people, eight of whom received vagus nerve stimulation treatment and eight of whom received a sham treatment. The researchers found that the stimulation treatment reduced inflammatory responses to stress and was associated with a decrease in PTSD symptoms, indicating that such stimulation may be useful for some patients, including those with elevated inflammatory biomarkers. Meanwhile, Dr. Porges and his colleagues at the University of Florida have patented a method to adjust vagus nerve electrical stimulation based on a patient’s physiology. He is now working with the company Evren Technologies, where he is a shareholder, to develop an external medical device that uses this approach for patients with PTSD. HOW DO YOU MEASURE VAGUS NERVE ACTIVITY? The activity of the vagus nerve is difficult to measure directly, especially given how complex it is. But because some vagus nerve fibres connect with the heart, experts can indirectly measure cardiac vagal tone – or the way in which your nervous system regulates your heart – by looking at your heart rate variability, which are the fluctuations in the amount of time between your heartbeats, on an EKG. An abnormal vagal tone – one in which there is very little heart rate variability – has been associated with conditions like diabetes, heart failure and hypertension. A high variability between heart beats may signify an ideal vagal tone. HOW CAN YOU IMPROVE YOUR VAGAL ‘TONE’ AT HOME? Holding your breath and submerging your face in cold water can trigger the “diving reflex,” a response that slows the heartbeat and constricts blood vessels. Some people who have tried it report that it has a calming effect and can even reduce insomnia. Others wrap an ice pack in cloth and place it on their chest to relieve anxiety. These specific exercises haven’t been sufficiently studied as methods for controlling anxiety or depression, so it is difficult to know if they work, or if they do, how well. Even so, some experts say they’re worth a shot. “It’s certainly one of the more benign things you can do,” Dr. Aaronson said.  But Dr. Tracey urged caution, adding that it’s difficult to properly assess the risks and benefits without clinical data. “I would not advise anyone to do any intervention without checking with their physician,” he said. “For wellness, try to maintain high vagus nerve activity through mindfulness, exercise and paced breathing,” Dr. Tracey said. “These are all very good for you.” By Christina Caron © The New York Times Company This article originally appeared in The New York Times"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-insider/mould-growing-home-facts-harm-health-food-safe-2711036,Got a mould problem? Here’s what you should know to get rid of it,"SINGAPORE: Those tell-tale spots — black, white, green or grey — can be found inside cupboards, under kitchen sinks and in the unlikeliest of places. Mould can be found everywhere, including the air we breathe. This microscopic type of fungus thrives in Singapore’s humid climate. Its unpleasant appearance aside, exposure to mould is known to cause health issues like asthma and allergic reactions. But just how dangerous is the mould in homes? Is mould growth likelier in some homes than in others? Can you get rid of mould for good? What about the mould that grows on food? The programme Talking Point gets answers to these questions and more. Accompanied by mould exterminator Andrew Mantle from hazmat experts Mouldgone, host Steven Chia visited four Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats across Singapore, from a ground-floor unit in Choa Chu Kang to a new flat in Punggol. They discovered mould in varying degrees on walls and ceilings, under kitchen sinks and even on an occupant’s bed frame. While moulds are sometimes visible to the naked eye, bright white or ultraviolet lights may be needed to see the spores. And according to Mantle, some homes are indeed more prone to mould than others. They are: Homes on lower levels, which are more exposed to moisture evaporating from drains, soil and the ground when it rains; homes near water bodies, because of higher levels of moisture in the air; and older homes, which are more prone to water leaking from old pipes and walls, plus other wear and tear. Mould growth may also be likelier in some parts of one’s home, depending on the orientation of the building. “Within a condo or an HDB building … where one side gets more sunlight, one side gets more airflow, that can be a contributing factor,” said Mantle. But mould is also unavoidable, as Chia discovered after leaving petri dishes in the four homes for 30 minutes and taking the dishes — filled with agar, a medium for growing organisms — to a laboratory. After five days of incubation, the dishes were covered with different colonies of mould. “There’s a lot of diversity of mould species in the air,” said Amy Choong, a National University of Singapore senior lecturer in biological sciences. Some mould species produce volatile organic compounds, which cause a musty smell, she added. “If you can smell it, it means there’s a lot of it.” So how bad is breathing in mould spores for health? Some people may be more at risk, such as those with known allergies or asthma and those whose immune system is compromised, cited Sanjay Chotirmall, an associate professor from Nanyang Technological University’s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine. This could include those with cancer, undergoing chemotherapy or have liver disease. But healthy people may also be susceptible to bouts when their immune function may change. “For instance, some people develop allergies later in life,” he said. “We’ll all have chest infections at some point. We may have some surgery, whether minor or not. “This all disrupts our immune system. So … if we see mould in the home, I think it’s best to get rid of it.” When mould grows on food, the effects can be more serious, he noted. It can produce fungal toxins that can “have effects on virtually every organ”, particularly the liver. “If ingested in high enough proportions, it can make you quite sick quite quickly and even cause death in some rare cases,” he added. When there is mould on food, it might be common practice for some people to toss out the mouldy parts and keep the rest. To figure out how safe this is, Chia sent some tomatoes and bay leaves saved from a mouldy batch to a lab for testing. While the food looked fine, the tests showed a mould count of 7,500 spores in one gram of the tomato sample. Mould was also found on the “entire surface” of the bay leaves and was “too numerous to count”, said Richard Khaw, deputy director of Nanyang Polytechnic’s School of Applied Science. He noted that as mould is usually found on the surface of the food, washing the tomatoes “thoroughly” would remove the mould. Cooking the food would also achieve the same result. But he also cautioned that should the food be damaged in any way — for example, if the tomatoes are dented — mould may go in the food, which would then pose a danger to one’s health. “Usually, what we advise consumers is to look at the whole box (before purchase),” he said. “If you see any of the tomatoes … have already got white spots or mould-like growth, try not to buy those. Because … it’ll spread very fast, (even) if you only have one (mouldy tomato) inside the box.” When food is contaminated by mould, it is likely that other bacteria are also present, which may explain why some people get food poisoning after eating mouldy food. “Usually, the food poisoning effect may come from the bacteria rather than from the mould,” said Khaw. “Mould may produce toxins, but the effect of those toxins is long-term, not an immediate effect.” For the removal of mould from surfaces other than food, Nanyang Polytechnic senior specialist in food chemistry and safety Gan Heng Hui offered a few solutions. Bleach and common mould removal products, for example, can kill mould as they contain sodium hypochlorite as an active ingredient, she cited. Vinegar is a “natural” home remedy as its acidity also kills mould, while ultraviolet-C light kills mould by destroying its cells. But she cautioned against combining bleach with vinegar and described the effect of this home remedy as “disastrous”. “Because of the chemical reactions that take place between acid and hypochlorite, you might create an explosion, especially if the place isn’t ventilated,” she said. WATCH: Is mould in our homes killing us? (22:51) Air purifiers, meanwhile — those with High Efficiency Particulate Air filters in particular — do the job of trapping mould. A lot of these “surface kills” are quick fixes, however, and Gan advised homeowners to deal with the “root cause” of mould growth — moisture — for a longer-lasting solution. “Make sure that the place is well ventilated, and the air is dry,” she said. “And then try to clean (it) off whenever you see potential mould growth.” Watch this episode of Talking Point here.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/test-makers-target-monkeypox-market-cases-surge-2725011,Test makers target monkeypox market as cases surge,"LONDON: Diagnostic companies are racing to develop tests for monkeypox, hoping to tap into a new market as governments ramp up efforts to trace the world's first major outbreak of the viral infection outside of Africa. The scramble started last month, much like early 2020 when companies rushed to make kits to help diagnose COVID-19, creating a multibillion-dollar boon for test makers. But demand for monkeypox tests will be a fraction of what it was for COVID-19, given monkeypox is not as transmissible nor as dangerous - it typically spreads through close contact and can cause flu-like symptoms and pus-filled skin lesions that usually resolve on their own within weeks. And unlike the sudden emergence of COVID-19, there are vaccines, treatments and tests that can already help curb the spread of monkeypox. A niche new market could soften - but won't make up for - the anticipated slowing of COVID-19 diagnostic sales as the need to test for the SARS-CoV-2 virus ebbs and concern about monkeypox grows, analysts say. Roche, for instance, made 1.9 billion Swiss francs (US$2 billion) in COVID-19 test sales in the first quarter, and Barclays analyst Emily Field estimates the tests will generate 3 billion Swiss francs in total for the company in 2022. ""It would be very difficult for monkeypox revenues to offset this in any meaningful way,"" she said. More than 550 confirmed cases of monkeypox have been reported by about 30 countries since early May. The majority were in Europe and not linked to travel to Africa, where the virus is endemic. Public health authorities suspect some degree of community transmission. No deaths have been reported. Still, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said it expects infections to rise as surveillance expands and its Europe head warned the spread could accelerate as people gather for parties and festivals over the summer. This outbreak is significant on the monkeypox scale, but there is not yet a need for hundreds of thousands of tests, which was the case when COVID-19 emerged, said Daniel Bausch, senior director, emerging threats and global health security at FIND, the global alliance for diagnostics. ""This isn't going to be the next COVID ... so I don't think the needs are massive. I don't anticipate [test] supply to be an issue."" Some countries, including Switzerland and the Netherlands which have reported only a handful of cases, say that for now they have sufficient testing capacity for monkeypox. Britain, where nearly 200 cases have been confirmed, is working on expanding capacity. Although researchers previously had fragmented access to the chemicals and other materials needed to conduct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for monkeypox, kits being developed by companies such as Roche theoretically allow them to have everything they need in one place to process a sample in a lab. Kits like Roche's have not been cleared by regulators for use as a medical diagnostic – however, they are available for research purposes only. Meanwhile, more than a dozen listed Chinese firms, including Jiangsu Bioperfectus Technologies, say they have added the European Union's CE mark of quality to their kits. The regime allows test-makers to self-certify that they are complying with EU regulations, and can accordingly be sold in the region. Broadly there are two types of test: PCR and antigen tests are designed to detect whether a person is currently or very recently infected, while antibody tests show whether a person has previously been infected. The monkeypox virus is part of the orthopoxvirus family that also includes smallpox and cowpox PCR tests are the gold standard test for the detection of monkeypox, according to the WHO, while the way antigen and antibody tests are designed makes it less likely that a positive result is definitively indicative of monkeypox. It is unclear whether infected but symptomatic individuals can spread the virus, says the WHO, so it's not known if precautionary testing of suspected cases is needed. However, since suspected cases are expected to isolate for up to 21 days, rapid antigen tests could be useful, given there are currently no pox virus diseases that have broadly spread across populations, said Carlos Maluquer de Motes, who runs a research group studying poxvirus biology at Surrey University. Most diagnostic makers are focused on PCR tests for monkeypox. A few others, including Tetracore Inc, are working on rapid antigen tests. However, caution is warranted. ""Virtually none of the kits, whether listed for research or otherwise, have gone through extensive validation,"" said Bausch. ""It would be interesting to order all the tests that have suddenly come on the market and see what you get.""    "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/advertorial/6-tips-keep-your-hair-and-scalp-healthy-and-happy-2703521,6 tips to keep your hair and scalp healthy and happy,"Everyone knows that sunscreen is necessary to protect your skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. But did you know that UV rays can damage your hair as well?  Overexposure to the sun can result in hair thinning and brittleness, while sunburn can irritate your scalp. Just ask actress Jesseca Liu, whose scalp tends to be red and sensitive, especially after long outdoor shoots. “When I return to my hometown in Langkawi, my scalp can be susceptible to sunburn,” she added. The sun is not the only culprit that can harm your scalp and hair. Many factors, some of which are by-products of our modern lifestyles, can be detrimental to your crowning glory. External factors include Singapore’s tropical climate (which may lead to an oily scalp), over-washing of one’s hair, using excessive hairspray or wax, and undergoing chemical treatments like bleaching, dyeing or rebonding one too many times.  Internal factors include medication, stress, diet and weight loss, which can sometimes be accompanied by a dry scalp and hair loss. There are also biological factors such as hormonal changes – during menopause or post-partum, for example – and genetics, which might result in male pattern hair loss or prematurely grey hair. Left untreated, these conditions may deteriorate and become irreversible.  To keep your mane full and shiny, seeking professional help early is important. Boasting an established clientele including celebrities like Liu and fellow artiste Dennis Chew, as well as content creator Mongchin Yeoh (Mongabong), local brand Yun Nam Hair Care has over 38 years of experience in treating hair and scalp issues. Yun Nam Hair Care specialist John Lee offers tips on what your hair and scalp need to be healthy and happy. TIP #1: EAT FOR YOUR SCALP, NOT JUST YOUR STOMACH “As the saying goes, you are what you eat,” said Mr Lee. “A healthy balanced diet – such as one that adheres to Health Promotion Board guidelines – is crucial for scalp and hair health.” During a busy workday, it’s far too easy to grab a burger and fries, or scoff down a greasy dish from the nearest coffeeshop. However, a diet that is high in sugar or fat can lead to an oily scalp. Try replacing soft drinks with plain water, and high-fat treats like chips and doughnuts with vegetable sticks, hummus and raw nuts. TIP #2: KEEP STRESS AT BAY For popular deejay, host and actor Chew, a packed work schedule resulted in stress and lack of sleep, and that affected his hair health.  “I eventually developed an oily scalp that caused hair loss,” he said. “Initially, I didn’t pay much attention to it, but as I continued filming the drama 118, more people noticed that my hair condition was worsening. My hair was becoming thinner and my hairline was receding.” According to Mr Lee, stress can lead to a reduced nutritional supply to one’s hair and increased free radical production. This results in a shortened hair cycle and increased hair loss.  Making time for a little pampering can make a big difference to your stress levels – and your hair, as Liu discovered. Regular appointments at Yun Nam Hair Care are an essential part of her self-care routine. “Every visit is an opportunity for me to unwind and take a breather from my hectic life. The treatment process is very relaxing and my scalp always feels clean and refreshed after treatment. My hair also feels softer and stronger,” she said. TIP #3: PROTECT YOUR SCALP THE WAY YOU PROTECT YOUR SKIN Just like how you protect your skin with sunscreen, you need to do the same for your hair and scalp.  There are many sun protection products for scalp and hair that come in mists, oils and serums, so if you’re a beach body, remember to factor them into your routine. If you’re planning to be out in the sun the whole day, use a hat with UV protection where possible. TIP #4: PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR SCALP How you wash your hair matters, advised Mr Lee, who pointed out that lathering your hair with shampoo without also cleansing your scalp will cause dead skin, sebum and dust to build up. When that happens, you may experience an itchy scalp that can be accompanied by dandruff, acne and increased hair loss.  “The scalp and hair share a close-knit relationship as hair follicles are found in the epidermis and dermis layer of the skin,” he explained. “Simply put, healthy scalp equals healthy hair.”  He added that an unhealthy scalp is linked to inflammatory skin conditions such as eczema, seborrheic dermatitis and folliculitis. “The inflammation, together with accelerated shedding of the skin and scratching, may lead to damage of the hair follicles, shortened hair growth and increased hair loss.”  TIP #5: GET HELP FROM HERBS If you want a natural, safe and chemical-free solution to healthy hair, Mr Lee recommends that you turn to a qualified hair consultant for advice.  He said: “A hair consultant needs to determine the condition and cause before formulating a customised treatment plan. At Yun Nam, we use a variety of herbs, with the three signature ones being ginseng, angelica and polygonum. For example, ginseng is recommended for a person with a dry scalp and hair loss that is attributed to a weak constitution or poor nourishment, but not for someone with an oily scalp and hair loss due to a diet high in fat or sugar.”  For those who aren’t fans of the bitter taste of traditional Chinese herbs, there’s no need to hold your nose and swallow any concoctions. Yun Nam Hair Care’s topical application ensures that customers not only avoid the unpleasant taste, but also minimises the risk of systemic drug interactions when customers are on medication for other conditions.  TIP #6: DON’T WAIT UNTIL IT’S TOO LATE TO SEEK HELP If you notice hair loss, thinning or other issues, it’s best to seek treatment before the problem worsens.  “We have a limited number of hair cycles per lifetime. Seek help early when the follicles are still viable, and when the regeneration capabilities of the skin and hair tissues are still at their peak,” advised Mr Lee. If you want help for your hair, but are wary of committing to a treatment package, look for an established provider that offers trial treatments and has good reviews. “Research the company – find out how many years it has been around, the awards it has won, and what customers are saying,” said Mr Lee. “Yun Nam’s trial treatment also offers potential customers a great opportunity to experience the outlet’s environment and the treatment itself.”  Yun Nam Hair Care is currently offering a S$28 trial for its FASTGro Hair Care treatment, which uses Chinese herbs to stimulate and nourish hair follicles in order to restore scalp health and boost hair growth. The trial price is inclusive of a computerised hair follicle scan and analysis that help to pinpoint the root cause of hair and scalp issues.  Contact Yun Nam Hair Care for a trial session of FASTGro at S$28 (usual price S$300) and get a free hair care kit (worth S$88), exclusive to CNA readers. This promotion is for new customers aged 18 and above only. Terms and conditions apply. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/group-exercise-fitness-covid-pandemic-restrictions-2722716,Commentary: Group exercise has benefits but we also need a strong exercise self-identity,"WINNIPEG, Canada: Anyone who has been part of an exercise group likely knows the power and benefit of group exercise. Exercise group members often identify with their group and develop a sense of “we” or belonging. Having this sense of “we” is associated with numerous benefits, including life satisfaction, group cohesion, support and exercise confidence. Furthermore, group attendance, effort and a higher exercise volume are more likely when people identify strongly with an exercise group. Belonging to an exercise group seems like a great way to support an exercise routine. But what happens when people can’t rely on the support of their exercise group? In our kinesiology lab at the University of Manitoba, we have started to answer this question. People may lose access to their exercise group when they relocate, become a parent or take on a new job with a challenging schedule. In March 2020, many group exercisers lost access to their groups due to the limits on public gatherings that accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic. To understand if tying oneself to an exercise group makes it harder to exercise when the group is not available, we asked exercise group members how they would react if their exercise group was no longer available to them. People who strongly identified with their group were less confident about their ability to exercise alone and thought this task would be difficult. We found similar results in two studies yet to be peer-reviewed, in which we examined how exercisers reacted when they lost access to their exercise groups because of COVID-19 restrictions on group gatherings. Again, exercisers with a strong sense of “we” felt less confident about exercising alone.  This lack of confidence may have stemmed from the challenge of members having to go “cold-turkey” on group participation, and suddenly losing the support and accountability that the group provided. Further, the strength of exercisers’ group identity was unrelated to how much they exercised alone after losing their groups. Exercisers’ sense of connection to the group may not translate into skills that help them exercise alone. Some exercisers we interviewed reportedly stopped exercising altogether during pandemic restrictions. These findings are consistent with other research that suggests that when exercisers become reliant on others (in this case, exercise leaders), they have difficulty exercising alone. What might equip group exercisers with the skills and motivation to exercise independently? We believe that exercise role identity may be a key. When people exercise with a group, they often form an identity not only as a group member but also with the role of someone who exercises. Identifying as an exerciser (exercise role identity) involves seeing exercise as core to one’s sense of self and behaving consistently with the exerciser role. This may mean engaging in regular exercise or making exercise a priority. Research shows a reliable link between exercise role identity and exercise behaviour. Group exercisers who have a strong exercise role identity may be in the best position to keep exercising even when they lose access to their group because exercise is core to their sense of self. To test this idea, we looked at how exerciser role identity related to group exercisers’ feelings about exercising alone. We found that in both hypothetical and real-world situations where exercisers lost access to their group, people who strongly identified with the exerciser role were more confident in their ability to exercise alone, found this task less challenging and exercised more. In fact, some exercisers reported seeing the loss of their group during the pandemic as just another challenge to overcome and focused on opportunities to exercise without having to worry about other group members’ schedules or workout preferences.  These findings suggest that having a strong sense of “me” may offer exercise group members the tools needed to exercise independently from the group. There are undeniable benefits to group exercise. Exclusively solo exercisers do not get the benefits of group cohesion and group support. As exercise adherence experts, we highly recommend group exercise. However, we also argue that exercisers who rely too heavily on their groups may be less resilient in their independent exercise – especially if they suddenly lose access to their group. We feel it is wise for group exercisers to foster an exerciser role identity in addition to their exercise group identity. What might this look like?  Exercisers may clearly define what it means to them personally to be an exerciser independent of the group or pursue some goals with the group (for example, training for a fun run with group members) and other goals alone (for example, running a race at one’s fastest pace). Overall, if you are looking to support your exercise routine and stay flexible in the face of challenges, having a sense of “we” is great, but don’t lose sight of your sense of “me”.

These days, the conversations among my 30-something and over 40-year-old girlfriends revolve around our body aches, bouts of insomnia and of course, the increasing number of health checks we need to do.  Just the other day, one of my girlfriends was regaling us with tales of her first mammogram. “There’s just so much squeezing involved. And just when you think the metal plates can’t squeeze your boob anymore, they squeeze it some more!”  Which made me wonder, why are these health checks necessary and how often do we really need to get them done? Is it fine if we skip a year or two? Plus, why do some of these tests have to be so uncomfortable?  We get the medical professionals to share insights on the important health checks that women should do and get the lowdown on the discomfort level, if any, and everything else you need to bear in mind for that test.   If you’re tempted to put it off – just one more year, we can hear you – remember the breast cancer slogan: Early detection saves lives. And it’s not just for your breasts.   HOW TO CARE FOR YOUR BREASTS  Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in Singapore, affecting one in every 13 women here.  According to the 2020 Singapore Cancer Registry Annual Report, every year, about 2,165 women are newly diagnosed with breast cancer, with about 436 dying from the disease.  Just having breasts puts one at risk. “You do not need to have a family history of breast cancer or cancer of any form to be at risk of developing breast cancer,” said Dr Lee Wai Peng, senior consultant and breast surgeon at Solis Breast Care and Surgery Centre.  Currently, the most effective way to detect breast cancer at an early and treatable phase is with a mammogram screening. However, a mammogram is only suitable for women aged 40 and above. “Younger women have denser breasts, which may make the mammograms less sensitive to picking up small cancers,” Dr Lim Siew Kuan, senior consultant and breast surgeon at Solis Breast Care and Surgery Centre, explained.  However, Dr Lim does add that for women with high risk factors, such as hereditary genetic mutations, personal history or a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer, bi-annual or annual breast screenings might be recommended much earlier. In such instances, it would be best to consult your doctor for a screening schedule. But that’s not to say that women under 40 need not do any breast care. Make sure to do your monthly breast self-examination (BSE). Dr Lim said most women frequently forget to do so, and regular BSE can help them pick up any changes that might occur. It’s also interesting to note that BSEs need to be done continually throughout your life.   “Women above the age of 18 should do their BSE once a month, between day seven and day 10 of their menstrual cycle. This is the period when the breasts feel the least lumpy, and any recent breast change can be picked up,” Dr Lim explained.  But if your menses is irregular, or if you’re post-menopausal, Dr Lim advised choosing a fixed day of the month to do your BSE.    Your doctor might also get you to do a breast ultrasound. Even so, while a breast ultrasound can detect abnormalities in the breast tissue, Dr Lim said it should not replace your annual mammogram.  This is because a breast ultrasound is usually done in tandem with a mammogram, to add information where needed, or to help guide the placement of needles for procedures such as a biopsy.  “The mammogram and breast ultrasound are useful in picking up different abnormalities. A mammogram can detect abnormal calcifications or architecture distortion, which are the earliest signs of breast cancers … therefore making mammography the gold standard for breast screening in women who are asymptomatic. “However, if the mammogram reveals dense breasts or any abnormalities, a breast ultrasound can be used as an adjunct to delineate further details in the breast tissue,” said Dr Lim.  MAMMOGRAM What to expect: You’ll be brought into a room and asked to stand in front of a special X-ray machine. Here, you’ll be asked to place one breast onto a plastic plate in front of you. Another plate, known as the paddle, is then lowered from above. The plates compress the breast, holding it still for the X-ray to be taken. This lasts for a few seconds. The process is repeated for a sideward view of the breast, and then for your other breast.  According to Dr Lee, the compression or spreading out of the breast in this way allows for a “better view of the breast and to detect normalities”.   How often should you get checked: Normal-risk women aged 40-49 years may choose to do a yearly mammogram but should speak to their doctor about the pros and cons of screening, taking their risk profile into account. Women above 50 should do a mammogram every two years  Best time to get checked: Book your appointment for at least one week after the start of your menses, as your breasts will be less tender and sensitive.  Comfort level: Many women do find the compression to be uncomfortable, sometimes even painful. “If you encounter severe pain during the compression, do inform the radiographer as slight adjustment of the breast may help to relieve this discomfort,” said Dr Lee.  Pre-appointment prep: Avoid using perfume, deodorant, powder or ointment around the breasts and armpits as they can affect the test results.   BREAST ULTRASOUND What to expect: A much more comfortable test compared to the mammogram as it’s done with you lying down. Your doctor or a sonographer will place a gel-coated transducer probe on your breast and look for any lumps or abnormalities within.  In order to examine the tissues and structures of your breast, photographs of your breasts will be taken at different sites and from various angles. During this process, you may be asked to hold your breath briefly to facilitate image taking.   How often should you get checked: Depending on your breast density, you may be encouraged to get a breast ultrasound annually together with your mammogram. But do check with your doctor about whether this is necessary for you, given your own risk factors and health profile.   Best time to get checked: Similar to a mammogram, book your appointment a week after the start of your menses.  Comfort level: Completely comfortable, though you might feel a teeny discomfort if the transducer probe scans over a sensitive or tender area of the breast. Pre-appointment prep: Similar to-dos as a mammogram.  HOW TO CARE FOR YOUR REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM  In Singapore, three gynaecological cancers – cervical, ovarian and uterine – are among the top 10 cancers affecting women, with cervical cancer being the most common. While there is currently no routine screening for women who have no known risk factors for ovarian and uterine cancers, there are two tests that you can take as part of the National Cervical Cancer Screening programme: Pap smear and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) test.  The HPV test looks for the presence of HPV infection, which is the primary cause of cervical cancer, while a Pap smear detects pre-cancerous changes in the cervix. While Pap smears used to be the standard test for cervical cancer, doctors are now recommending HPV testing as a much more effective method.   Professor Yong Eu Leong, emeritus consultant at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, National University Hospital Singapore, said the HPV test can be likened to a “PCR test to detect genetic materials from strains of the HPV that may be growing within the cells in the neck of the womb”.   “The HPV test detects the virus that is causing the cancer and the Pap smear detects the cells that has turned cancerous due to the effect of the virus,” he added.  PAP SMEAR OR PAP TEST What to expect: You will need to remove your underwear and lie on an examination table, with your knees bent. The doctor then gently inserts an instrument known as a speculum – a duck bill-shaped device, that allows him or her to open the walls of your vagina. Then using a soft brush and spatula, the doctor will collect a tissue sample from the cervical wall. How often should you get checked: Once every three years for women between 25 and 29 years, if you have ever had sex. After 30, women should move on to doing the HPV test.  Best time to get checked: Two weeks after the start of your period, as this allows the doctor to get the clearest and cleanest sample of cervical cells. Comfort level: Some women do experience a slight discomfort when the cervical cells are being collected.  Pre-appointment prep: Avoid sexual activity and the use of vaginal lubricant, douching products or tampons 48 hours before the test.   HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUS (HPV) TEST OR HPV SCREENING What to expect: The process is similar to getting your Pap smear. In fact, since both the HPV test and Pap smear collect tissue samples from the cervix, both tests are usually performed at the same time, using the same tissue sample.  How often should you get checked: Once every five years for women aged 30 years and above, and yes, this includes even if you’ve been vaccinated against HPV.   Best time to get checked: Similar to a Pap smear. Two weeks after the start of your period. Comfort level: Similar experience as getting a Pap smear. Pre-appointment prep: Similar to-dos as a Pap smear. PELVIC ULTRASOUND SCAN  What to expect: There are two ways to do the scan – via an ultrasound probe inserted into the vagina (transvaginal) or a combination of transvaginal (TV) and transabdominal (TA).  For a TA scan, you’ll lie comfortably on an examination table. Gel is applied over your lower abdomen and the doctor or sonographer presses an ultrasound probe against the skin, moving around to obtain ultrasonic images of the uterus and ovaries. For a TV scan, you’ll lie on the examination table with your knees bent, and feet and legs supported, like you would during a Pap smear. A lubricated specially-designed probe, usually long and slim (also known as a transvaginal transducer) is then gently inserted into the vagina. The doctor will then turn and angle the probe to examine different areas within.  How often should you get checked: Dr Tan said that women 30 and above may want to consider getting a pelvic ultrasound annually, especially those who are at risk of ovarian cancer. You should speak to your doctor about including a pelvic ultrasound in your routine screening schedule if you have BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations, Lynch syndrome or a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer in more than one relative.  Dr Tan Toh Lick, obstetrician and gynaecologist from Thomson Surgical Centre, added that a pelvic ultrasound can also help “check for uterine growth, including fibroid, polyp and cancer, as well as ovarian cyst and cancer”.   Best time to get checked: Between days seven and 10 of your menstrual cycle “when the endometrium (uterine lining) is thin and clear, and the ovaries are less likely to have any large follicles, which may be considered to be an ovarian cyst”, said Dr Tan.  Comfort level: Generally, a TA scan is completely comfortable, though you may feel a little uncomfortable with the ultrasound probe pressing firmly against your full bladder (imperative for the doctor to get good images of the area).  For a comfortable TV scan, the key is to remain relaxed, Dr Tan said. Some discomfort is common as the transducer is moved, but the pain should still be bearable. Pre-appointment prep: A full bladder is required for a TA scan, so you will need to drink at least three cups of water from 30 minutes to an hour before the scan. If you’re getting a TV scan after, you should relieve yourself as an empty bladder is required for this screening.   ONE MORE TEST FOR WOMEN ABOVE 65 YEARS And while these are the key checks to do, Prof Yong added that another test you might want to include, especially for women above the age of 65, is an “assessment for the risk of menopausal osteoporosis”. This is because not only does boss loss happen naturally with age, women also tend to have smaller, thinner and less dense bones than men.  It involves an osteoporosis screening with your doctor, which includes a physical examination.  You may also be asked to go for a Bone Mineral Density test to measure the mineral content, like calcium, in your bones. Also called Dual Energy X-Ray Absorbitary (DEXA) or bone densitometry, it is an enhanced form of X-ray to measure bone loss, says the Radiology Info website. According to the Singapore Health Hub website, DEXA detects the amount of energy that has been emitted after the X-ray is done. As bone mass will naturally obstruct the energy passing through, the more energy emitted, the weaker the bone is. WHERE WOMEN CAN GET TESTED There is really no excuse for not scheduling your health checks as these are widely available across Singapore, and can be “arranged by doctors in polyclinics, in general practice and in hospitals”, said Prof Yong. And to make it even easier, you can also check out the national Screen for Life programmes. The Screen for Life – Breast Cancer Screening Programme offers subsidised mammograms from S$50 at participating polyclinics, while the Screen for Life – National Cervical Cancer Screening Programme offers subsidised rates for Pap smears and HPV tests, from S$15 at all polyclinics.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/enlarged-prostate-gland-trouble-peeing-treatments-2706621,Why do some men find it hard to pee? An enlarged prostate could be the problem,"When it comes to relieving yourself in the washroom, there's nothing to it, right? You simply undo the necessary garment, relax your muscles and in a few seconds, sweet relief is yours. But for some men, the ability to empty their bladder may not come at all no matter how many trips they make to the urinal.  Despite feeling as though their bladders may burst, they may find it difficult to start urinating. When they do manage to, it’s more of a trickle than a satisfying release; the urine stream may even stop and start several times. And there’s always the feeling that there’s something left in the tank no matter how hard they force it.  If you’re one of these men, you might feel that those symptoms seem to point to an obstruction in your plumbing. And you might be right on that count if you have been diagnosed with something that has to do with your prostate, called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  WHAT IS THE PROSTATE GLAND IN THE FIRST PLACE? The term “benign prostatic hyperplasia” refers to the enlarged and non-cancerous state of the prostate gland (we’ll touch on why it gets enlarged in a bit). And nope, this gland doesn’t reside in either of the testicles. The chestnut-sized organ sits within the body, directly below the bladder and surrounds the urethra, the tube that urine passes out from.  The prostate is also located just in front of the rectum, which is why the doctor will perform a digital rectal examination (in case you’re wondering, “digital” here refers to the use of a gloved finger, or digit) to feel for it during your medical check-up.  All is well and good when you’re young. The prostate does its job of producing the thin, milky part of semen – crucial for “the proper functioning of the sperm cells, and therefore also for fertility in men”, according to the National Library of Medicine. And because there are also many muscle cells inside the gland, it plays a part in expelling semen during ejaculation as well.  Things may start to take a downturn as you get older. Interestingly, the prostate continues to grow throughout a man’s life and can get as big as an orange, according to the US Urology Care Foundation. The reason why you don’t feel a protrusion is this: There is a layer of tissue around the prostate that keeps it from growing outward, according to Cedars Sinai.   But all that growth has to go somewhere and that is when the enlarged gland starts to “press on the urethra like a clamp”, explained the same website. The results are the symptoms described earlier on: Straining to urinate, slow urine flow, frequently waking up at night to urinate and the inability to empty the bladder.  Patients with high degrees of obstruction may even develop urinary tract infections and bladder stones, said Dr Thiruchelvam Jegathesan, a consultant with Tan Tock Seng Hospital’s Department of Urology.  “The exact reason for BPH is not known but is postulated to be related to age and male hormones causing a proliferation of the prostate cells,” he said. “Typically, BPH can happen after 50 years old and it becomes more prevalent with age.” A study done in Singapore supports the age link that Dr Jegathesan mentioned. As the population ages, the incidence of local patients with moderate to severe BPH symptoms has been increasing – from 10 per cent in 1997 to 14 per cent in 2005, and 16.5 per cent in 2012.  Greater awareness of BPH could have also led to a higher incidence rate recorded over the years, said Dr Fiona Wu, a consultant urologist with Aare Urocare. “Generally, more people are aware of the condition and seeking professional advice earlier. In fact, some of the male patients have seen how their elderly fathers suffered from BPH and are more likely to seek help early,” she said.  WHAT ARE THE TREATMENT OPTIONS? Since an enlarged prostate is the root of the trouble, the treatment generally focuses on removing or shrinking the organ, or widening the constriction for urine to flow through better. Most options involve minimally invasive procedures that can be performed “through an endoscope inserted through the urethra”, said Dr Wu. “A urinary tube (catheter) to drain urine is usually required post-surgery.” The not-so-good news is, prostate enlargement and its accompanying urinary issues can recur after treatment. ""Sometimes, the urologist may use different methods to treat BPH recurrence such as medical treatment or another surgical option depending on the situation and the patient’s age and fitness level,"" said Dr Wu. Here’s a look at the treatment options available and how they work. An instrument called a resectoscope is inserted into the urethra to reach the prostate. The resectoscope is like a multi-function Swiss Army knife that has a light, camera and tool that uses electric current to cut, remove, or destroy tissue and control bleeding. TURP may be performed under general or regional anaesthesia, said Asst Prof Chua Wei Jin, a senior consultant with the Department of Urology at National University Hospital.  This is the ""gold standard surgery that revolutionised BPH surgery"", said Dr Colin Teo, a senior consultant urologist with Gleneagles Hospital. And unlike the other methods, TURP allows tissue samples to be taken to test for cancer, he said.  However, TURP has “up to 70 per cent risk of ejaculatory dysfunction, which may concern younger sexually active men”, said Dr Jegathesan. Who it’s for: Patients with acute or chronic urinary retention, recurrent urinary tract infections, bladder stone, renal insufficiency, large bladder diverticulum/diverticula and/or failed medical therapy. One or two small cuts are made at the bladder neck, the area where the prostate and the bladder are connected. Doing so widens the urinary channel and allows urine to pass easier. “It has less risk of bleeding and ejaculatory issues when compared to TURP,” said Dr Wu. It can be done as an outpatient procedure.  “TUIP is usually performed as an additional procedure for patients undergoing TURP with small prostates,” said Asst Prof Chua. On its own, TUIP may be less effective than TURP and you may need to be treated again with another BPH therapy. Who it’s for: Prostates that are less than 30g (a normal one weighs about 20g to 25g) as well as a high or tight bladder neck. Also for patients concerned about fertility as the procedure does not directly involve the prostate gland. There are two main types of laser surgery. The PVP, for one, uses a form of laser known as GreenLight to vaporise the excess tissue and widen the urinary channel, said Asst Prof Chua.  The second method, he cited, is the HoLEP, which uses holmium laser to free up the enlarged prostate tissue from its outer layer, and deposits it in the bladder where it is suctioned out using an instrument. “It is very unlikely that the prostate will regrow and re-obstruct following this procedure,” said Asst Prof Chua of the second method. Added Dr Wu: “This method generally removes more prostatic tissue than TURP and with less catheter time (under 24 hours) and less reoperation rates”. However, there is a higher risk of bladder perforation compared to TURP, she said.  Who it’s for: There is less bleeding with laser therapy, so it's better suited for patients who are already on antiplatelet or anticoagulant medicine to reduce their stroke or heart attack risks, said Dr Lie Kwok Ying, a senior consultant urologist from Gleneagles Hospital.  This new treatment method for BPH doesn’t cut or zap off any tissue at all. Instead, it uses tiny, permanently placed, stainless-steel clips to lift or hold the enlarged prostate tissue out of the way, so that urine can flow through the urethra. Different patients will need different numbers of clips, depending on the size and length of their prostate, said Dr Jegathesan. It can be done under local anaesthesia and “most patients will be able to go home without a urinary catheter”, he said.  Dr Wu noted that PUL has much lower risks of bleeding and ejaculatory issues than TURP. “It is useful for males trying to avoid ejaculatory or erectile issues, and for elderly patients who are not fit for general anaesthesia.” However, Dr Lie highlighted that urinary flow trouble may recur with PUL. In more than one in 10 cases, retreatment is needed at the five-year mark.   Who it’s for: Prostates that are 30g to 80g. Also suitable for men who wish to preserve their erectile and ejaculatory functions. It delivers “targeted, controlled doses” of steam directly to the prostate, said Asst Prof Chua, and “gently kills the excess prostate cells”. “Over time, the body's natural healing response removes the dead cells, shrinking the prostate and opening the urethra, thus relieving the BPH symptoms.” The whole process can take as little as 10 minutes, even with the use of general anaesthesia, said Dr Teo.  However, WVTT may not be suitable for very large prostates and the time required for patients to be on catheter is usually longer than the other procedures, said Dr Wu.  Who it’s for: Moderate BPH symptoms, prostate volume of 30ml to 80ml, failed medical therapy or no desire to be on long-term medication. Also suitable for men who wish to preserve their erectile and ejaculatory functions. It involves inserting a small antenna through the urethra to reach the prostate gland as well as a rectal temperature monitor through the anus. Once in place, the antenna releases microwave energy at temperatures of 41 degrees Celsius to 46 degrees Celsius to destroy the excess prostate tissue. The procedure is done under local anaesthesia.  “TUMT has a lower complication rate than TURP in general but there is a higher reoperation rate. The improvement in symptoms may not be as good as TURP,” said Dr Wu. Who it’s for: Small to moderate-sized prostates.  The first line of treatment for BPH using medicine is with alpha-blockers, said Dr Wu, which help to relax the muscles in the bladder neck and prostate. However, they do come with side effects such as hypotension on standing (a form of low blood pressure that happens when you stand up from sitting or lying down) and ejaculatory problems, she said. For those who are at risk of developing BPH complications, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) can be added. These agents inhibit the body’s conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (aka DHT, a hormone that stimulates the development of male characteristics, including prostate growth) and in turn, cause DHT levels to drop. However, the results aren’t as immediate as the procedures mentioned above. For instance, 5-ARIs typically take three to six months to work, said Dr Wu. And even so, they may only reduce prostate size by 18 per cent to 28 per cent. Another downer is that there may be diminished sexual functions such as erectile dysfunction and reduced libido. The medication approach is also a lifetime commitment.  Who it’s for: Prostates above 40ml, moderate to severe BPH symptoms."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/dengue-outbreak-singapore-infection-immunity-mosquitoes-control-vaccine-2715926,Commentary: Why is there another dengue outbreak in Singapore despite all our efforts?,"SINGAPORE: It never rains, but it pours. Just when COVID-19 cases in Singapore have fallen back to lower levels, we are experiencing yet another outbreak, this time of a more familiar foe – dengue.  The number of cases reported so far this year has already exceeded the whole of 2021 and is already climbing towards the levels in 2020 when Singapore saw its worst dengue outbreak.  Why is this happening despite efforts by the National Environment Agency (NEA) and the public in mosquito control? To borrow terms we’ve become familiar with over the last two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the effective reproductive number – the number of people infected by the mosquitoes infected by one dengue carrier – needs to be kept below 1 to curb transmission. And that isn’t currently happening. We know some circumstantial factors that may be responsible for the current outbreak. The recent warm weather is conducive to mosquito population growth. DENV3, the current dominant serotype behind the large majority of cases now, has not circulated at such levels before 2021.  But here are two broader factors we think are responsible for why outbreaks like the current one still persist: Ever lower population immunity and ever better diagnostics. Ironically, both are good problems to have. A seeming paradox of dengue epidemiology in Singapore is that despite thousands of cases in recent years, immunity in the population is dropping. It seems to defy logic until you flip it around: Immunity is falling, so dengue can spread more easily. Low levels of transmission over the last 50 years, thanks to community and government successes in vector control, mean that fewer people have been exposed to dengue. With more people susceptible, a single infected mosquito has more chances to pass on the virus, meaning that controlling the mosquito population has to be increasingly effective to get the same results.  Every few years, NEA and the Health Sciences Authority screen residual blood donations for past dengue infection, and each time over the last decade they have done so, the prevalence has fallen. In 2004, about one in three 30-year-olds had had dengue before and this fell to about one in four by 2017. The fall was generally starker among those aged 45, with prevalence falling from about 74 per cent to 48 per cent. So how do we reconcile the paradox of the falling prevalence of dengue with the large numbers of cases diagnosed in recent years? The short answer is that we are better now at detecting dengue infections than in the past. The public is also on higher alert for potential infections, thanks to COVID-19.  Dengue and COVID-19 share some early clinical symptoms, like fever, body ache and fatigue, so more may have sought medical attention in the past two years or so. The availability of rapid diagnostics in GP clinics is another factor. In a nutshell, though overall the prevalence of dengue has fallen over the years, we are more susceptible to getting infected if exposed to the virus and more adept at diagnosing infections. So does this mean we just have to accept dengue, as it is for evermore? We don’t think so.  Of course, there are small steps most of us are already familiar with, such as removing stagnant water, using the myENV app to get alerts about clusters, as well as the increased use of sprays, long-sleeved and legged clothing, and residual indoor spraying around the home.  But scientists have always sought out more upstream interventions in control that could create a step change in outcomes.  Fortunately, there are long term technological solutions around the corner, the two most likely over the years ahead being the use of Wolbachia mosquitoes and dengue vaccination. Singapore has been leading the way internationally in using Wolbachia mosquitoes since 2016 in a suppression strategy – where male mosquitoes infected with the Wolbachia bacteria are released to mate but the resultant eggs cannot produce offspring, thus making the wild population crash.  The data from the pilot field sites in Tampines and Yishun over the last few years suggest the approach is very successful in cutting mosquito populations there. But at a pilot stage, the effects are mainly entomological – we see a tenfold reduction in the number of female mosquitoes around release sites.  As this strategy moves towards larger-scale implementation, the effects should start to manifest epidemiologically, and we should see falling dengue case counts around release sites, as has started to transpire around the earlier release sites in Yishun and Tampines, where NEA reported a fall in 2019 of up to 88 per cent in dengue incidence.  An NEA factory running in Ang Mo Kio produces up to two million Wolbachia mosquitoes a week for release and aims to breed about five million a week. The aim is to hopefully cover larger tracts of the population with this technology than ever before, making genuine island-wide control start to look more science fact than science fiction. The other potential major shield against dengue will be vaccination. The development process of vaccines for dengue has been long and winding.  There is one vaccine licensed for use in Singapore, but it’s targeted only at those who have been infected before and below 45 years of age. Because most in Singapore under 45 likely have not been infected before, fewer are able to be vaccinated than their peers in other countries of Southeast Asia.  However, other vaccines are under development including promising candidates by Takeda and the US’s National Institute of Health. The Takeda vaccine is being considered for approval by the European Medicines Authority – and it will be vital for us to assess its suitability here given Singapore’s unique epidemiology.  The efficient roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines in Singapore offers hope that a dengue vaccination programme can be effected once a broadly-suitable vaccine becomes available. Just like how antivirals like Paxlovid have been deployed as the next line of defence after COVID-19 vaccines in Singapore and around the world, the development of effective antivirals will also be important.  Depending on how they work, antiviral may help lead to a shorter illness, less severe disease or help reduce transmission, depending on how they work. A number of candidates are in trials, but none are licenced yet.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, the world has shown it is capable of rapid investment and international collaboration to understand the biology, develop vaccines and learn how to control this new disease.  The hope for those of us working in infectious diseases is that these successes could galvanise solutions to endemic diseases like dengue – a disease that has been around much longer but against which we have fewer tools.  So while the recent rise in dengue cases may seem alarming, this is a reflection of past successes in vector control and better testing capabilities. Advances lie on the horizon and can take Singapore to the next stage of dengue control. But for now, let’s remain diligent in doing our mozzie wipeout while we work our way there.  Hannah E Clapham is an Assistant Professor at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/are-you-getting-most-out-push-ups-heres-what-you-need-know-2700856,Are you getting the most out of push-ups? Here’s what you need to know,"Simple, strenuous and possible to do almost anywhere, push-ups are an almost universally known exercise and a mainstay of military, sport and fitness training regimens. Push-ups are a “basic, foundational movement,” said James Whitener III, a strength and conditioning coach at Bethune-Cookman University in Florida. Because it requires a cognizance of the body’s position from head to toe, the exercise helps to develop something called kinesthetic awareness – an understanding of how one’s body moves through space. This awareness, in turn, can help exercisers develop a sense of their body’s ability and prepare them for “bigger, more complex movements,” like dead lifts or squats, he said. But getting the most out of push-ups requires good technique. Here’s what you need to know. WHAT MAKES PUSH-UPS GREAT Push-ups hone your chest, shoulders and arms – particularly the deltoid, triceps and pectoral muscles – but they’re really a full body movement. “We think of it as an upper body exercise, but it’s also working the core muscles and building coordination as well,” Whitener said. Holding your body in a rigid plank position while executing a push-up activates your core muscles and can even require some work from your legs too. “They’re very versatile, because they just target so many things at once,” said Tessia De Mattos, a physical therapist and strength, conditioning and performance rehabilitation coach at The Strength Athlete. To start, get into a classic plank position with your palms on the ground, arms slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and your palms about even with your shoulders. Mastering regular planks is important, Dr De Mattos said, because “if you can’t do a full plank with proper form, you’re going to have difficulty performing a full push-up.” To ensure that you’re using good form, try filming yourself with a smartphone, advised Hampton Liu, a personal trainer, fitness influencer and founder of Hybrid Calisthenics. “You don’t have to show anyone your video! You can even delete it immediately afterward. It’s just for you.” Two common mistakes, Dr De Mattos said, are letting your belly sag or arching your lower back rather than keeping it aligned with the rest of your body. HOW MANY? How many repetitions you should do depends on your current ability and your objectives. For the average person who is trying to get healthier, fitter and stronger, the best approach is to aim for momentary failure – the point of fatigue where you can’t complete another rep with good form – rather than a specific number of repetitions, said Patroklos Androulakis-Korakakis, a researcher at Solent University in England and strength coach at StrongerByScience.com. “By reaching momentary failure, or at least getting very close to it, people can ensure that they’re getting a sufficient enough stimulus for strength and hypertrophy adaptations,” he said. If you can’t do more than a handful of repetitions before reaching this point, you can try some of the easier variations below. As you progress, you can switch back to standard push-ups and then move on to more difficult variations to increase the difficulty as you get stronger, Dr Androulakis-Korakakis said. “There’s no reason to be ashamed if you can’t do a push-up. Fitness is a journey and we all start somewhere,” Liu said in a video about push-ups. If you can’t yet do a push-up, “you can build up,” he added. WALL PUSH-UP: If you’re just starting out, Liu suggested trying wall push-ups. Stand facing a wall at arm’s length, and place your hands about shoulder-width apart against it. Lean in until your face almost touches the wall, then push back to your starting position. Do as many reps as you can, and when this gets easy, you can progress to a kneeling push-up. KNEELING PUSH-UP: If you can’t quite do a standard push-up yet, you can give yourself a bit of a boost by initiating the movement from a kneeling position, which reduces the amount of load you’re putting on your arms, shoulders and chest, Dr De Mattos said. As you become more proficient at doing push-ups, you’ll need to do more of them to reach the point of momentary failure. Performing exercises to this point can maximise motor unit and muscle fiber recruitment, Dr Androulakis-Korakakis said, which in turn will stimulate adaptations and make you stronger. “Reaching momentary failure is a great way to ensure people are getting the most out of each set.” Here are some ways to get you there. RAISED LEG PUSH-UP: Once you become adept at standard push-ups, you can increase the difficulty by starting the push-up movement with your feet elevated above you, Liu said. Starting with a few books on the ground underneath your feet should provide some noticeable difference, he said. From there, you can try a short stool (maybe a foot off the ground) and then work up to a chair or even a railing. NARROW (OR DIAMOND) PUSH-UP: These are a more difficult push-up variation that you do by holding your hands together with your thumbs and forefingers touching in a way that creates a diamond-shaped hole where your hands come together. You can work your way up to these by simply moving your hands a little closer together until that becomes easy, then moving them closer and closer until eventually they finally touch, Liu said. WEIGHTED PUSH-UP: When you can do sets of 10 push-ups easily, you can turn up the difficulty by placing a small weight plate on your back to increase the weight you’re pushing. If you’re doing these at home and don’t have weights, you can throw a few heavy books in a backpack and use that as a weight, Dr De Mattos said. The extra weight shouldn’t be so much that you can’t do more than a couple, but should be enough to get you to the point of momentary failure in about ten reps or less. ONE ARMED PUSH-UP: These require excellent core strength to keep your body in position as you push up with a single arm, Liu said. “It’s a great core exercise.” The trick here is to use your legs and core to keep your body stable as you push up with a single arm. Spreading your feet further apart can help you stabilize yourself as you go. There are lots of ways to do push-ups, Liu said. “Find one you can do, and work it.” As you get stronger you can progress to a harder version.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/smallpox-monkeypox-vaccines-transmissible-dna-virus-west-central-africa-2708881,"Commentary: Vigilance, not universal smallpox vaccination, needed against monkeypox","LONDON: The Angel of Death was an oddly serene term for a disease that killed millions and left survivors disfigured by “small pocks”, or blisters on the skin. Smallpox, named in the 15th century to distinguish it from the “great pox” of syphilis, was officially eradicated in 1980 after a global vaccination campaign. Now, a smallpox vaccine is being wheeled out again to combat an unusual outbreak of monkeypox, a milder disease caused by a related virus. As of Sunday (May 22), the World Health Organization (WHO) has recorded more than 250 confirmed or suspected cases of monkeypox in the biggest outbreak seen outside West and Central Africa, where it is endemic.  The United Kingdom is one of the worst-affected countries, with 71 confirmed cases as of May 25. For comparison, the country saw a total of seven cases from 2018 to 2021. The smallpox vaccine, marketed as Jynneos or Imvanex, is also licensed for monkeypox and provides a good degree of cross-protection. The UK Health Security Agency, which has 5,000 doses and more on order from maker Bavarian Nordic, stated on Monday that it was immunising close contacts of confirmed cases and advising 21-day quarantines, reflecting the possible incubation period.  This containment strategy recognises that some patients have no history of travel or contact with infected animals, implying community transmission. Scientists are now trying to work out whether the outbreak is due to human behaviour or a genetic change in the monkeypox virus. The virus, first recorded in monkeys in 1958 and in humans in 1970, belongs to a family of DNA viruses called orthopoxviruses. Other members that can affect humans include smallpox (the variola virus), cowpox and vaccinia, a relatively mild virus used in the smallpox vaccine. Confusingly, chickenpox is not related.  There are two main virus clades, or branches: The current outbreak is of the West African clade, fatal in one per cent of cases, rather than the Central African (or Congo Basin) clade, which can kill up to 10 per cent. Children and those with compromised immunity, including pregnant women, are most at risk. Early symptoms of infection include fever, aches, chills and exhaustion; later, rashes on the face, genitals and extremities. These swell into pus-filled lesions, which dry out and fall off. Generally, the illness clears up on its own after two to four weeks. The virus is not usually highly transmissible; it spreads mostly through skin-to-skin contact or via contaminated bedding, clothing or utensils. Household members and sexual partners are at the highest risk. The transmission role played by semen or other genital secretions is unclear, according to the WHO.  Large respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes can also transmit the virus but, in terms of airborne transmission, monkeypox is harder to catch than COVID-19. Jimmy Whitworth, a professor of international public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, noted that many current cases are among men who have sex with men, making behavioural factors a simpler explanation than a mutated virus, as DNA viruses evolve much more slowly than RNA viruses like influenza and COVID-19. “Such close-knit groups are well-documented for allowing rapid extension of infectious disease outbreaks,” said Whitworth. “Superspreading events are more likely than a change in the characteristics of the virus itself.” The odds of catching it from an infected colleague or on public transport, he added, were “exceedingly low” because of tiny case numbers, making universal smallpox vaccination, which was dropped after eradication, unwarranted. Vigilance rather than panic, then, seems to be the watchword. The monkeypox virus is endemic in countries where it circulates constantly in animals, mostly African rodents, such as prairie dogs and rats; it spills over into people through bites, scratches or bushmeat handling.  The European Centre for Prevention and Disease Control has warned that the current human outbreak could find its way into animals in non-endemic countries, with human-to animal “spillback” creating new viral reservoirs. That further dials up the risk. As the doctor Gareth Williams recounts in his acclaimed 2010 book Angel of Death, smallpox may have arisen from mutations in another orthopoxvirus, the taterapox virus in gerbils.  Cautioning against complacency, he writes that, in theory, a smallpox-like pathogen could resurface through the mutation of a related virus: “Monkeypox is already most of the way there.” Fallen angels, he observes, do not necessarily disappear forever."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/prime-pejuang-kopi-sexual-enhancement-potent-ingredient-tadalafil-2708381,'Potent' medicinal ingredient found in sexual enhancement coffee product: HSA,"SINGAPORE: Members of the public have been warned against purchasing or consuming a coffee product purported to contain herbal ingredients that enhance male sexual health. The advisory from the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) on Thursday (May 26) came after it received feedback on two cases of adverse effects after the individuals consumed Prime Kopi Pejuang 3 in 1.  The sachet drink had been marketed online as a natural product containing ""herbal ingredients of high quality"". ""HSA proceeded to test the coffee product and found that contrary to the advertisement claims, it is not natural or herbal and contains high concentration of an undeclared synthetic potent medicinal ingredient, tadalafil,"" it added.  Tadalafil is a prescription medicine used to treat erectile dysfunction that should only be given under medical supervision, added the authority.  A consumer was admitted to the hospital emergency department after he experienced adverse effects such as body aches, chills, migraine and tightness around the jawline, said HSA. Another consumer experienced priapism, or prolonged erection, of about four hours after taking the product.  ""Priapism is a serious condition and can lead to penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency if not treated immediately,"" said the agency.  HSA said consumers taking the product according to the labelled instructions for use, which was one sachet daily, could be overdosing on more than 10 times the usual prescribed dose of tadalafil.  ""Inappropriate use of tadalafil is dangerous and can increase the risk of serious adverse effects, including heart attacks, stroke, palpitations, irregular heart rate and priapism,"" it added.  Taladafil can also pose serious health risks to certain individuals, including those with heart-related problems. It can cause potentially life-threatening low blood pressure in those who are on heart medications, especially those containing nitrates.  Prime Kopi Pejuang 3 in 1 was sold on local e-commerce sites such as Shopee, Lazada, Qoo10 and Carousell, as well as on Facebook.  HSA has worked with the platform administrators to remove the affected listings and has issued warnings to the sellers. ""All sellers and suppliers must stop selling or supplying Prime Kopi Pejuang 3 in 1 immediately. ""HSA will not hesitate to take stern enforcement actions against anyone who sells and/or supplies products found to be adulterated with potent medicinal ingredients,"" the authority added.  Sellers and suppliers of the product are liable to be prosecuted. If convicted, they may be jailed for up to two years, or fined up to S$10,000, or both.  Members of the public who have any information on the sale and supply of this illegal product may contact HSA's Enforcement Branch at 6866 3485 during office hours or reach them via email. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/women-history-periods-menstruation-sanitary-pad-tampon-828771,How women dealt with periods long before sanitary pads and tampons,"Did you know that the first disposable sanitary pads were made for men, not women? In the 1700s, the idea of creating a highly absorbent pad that could be discarded after use was thought up by US president Benjamin Franklin, who wanted to help wounded soldiers control bleeding of a different kind. Of course, women were menstruating before the 1700s and were known to use some form of menstrual protection. One of the earliest records was of a 4th-century Greek mathematician, who resorted to throwing her menstrual rag at a persistent admirer after everything else she did failed to fob him off. Other than rags, women also lined their underwear with whatever was cheap and in abundance. In China, women were thought to have made period pads by putting sand in a cloth pouch and wrapping it tightly. When the pad was wet, the sand would be discarded and the pouch washed for the next cycle. Elsewhere, women were said to have used moss or grass, though we wonder if they also had to grapple with frequent infections down there.  It isn't clear why menstrual rags weren't used by some women from the 1700s to the 1900s in Europe or America. It could be the extreme poverty that the majority of the population lived through.  For whatever reason, women did not use anything to catch their menstrual flow. Those who could afford to would use knitted ""pads"", sheep's wool, or rabbit fur.  MARKETING ""UNMENTIONABLES"" The first disposable pads that women finally got to buy and use came out in the 1890s. They were inspired by French nurses who had used pads stuffed with absorbent wood pulp to stop excessive bleeding on the battlefield.  One such item was Johnson and Johnson's Lister's Towels, which came out in 1896. But because advertising such ""unmentionables"" was frowned upon, not many women knew about them. Curads faced the same fate when it tried to sell its pads in 1920.  How did women know about sanitary pads when you couldn’t even talk about them? In 1921, Kimberly-Clark got around it by getting women to ask for the pads by the brand Kotex, which is short for cotton-like texture. The name is still synonymous with sanitary pads today.  Women who were embarrassed to approach the male clerk for Kotex had another option: Boxes of the disposable sanitary pads were placed on the cashier's countertop, so women could simply pick up a box and drop money into a special payment box – making Kotex one of the first self-service items in America. But these early sanitary pads were nothing like the version we are familiar with today. The great-grand-daddy of sanitary pads looked like cotton wool held in netting with loops on each end. Women wore these pads with a belt to hold them in place, though not very successfully as they tended to shift forward or backwards. It was only in the 1980s when the stick-on pad we’re familiar with today appeared. Before we knew it, they'd sprouted ""wings"", adopted scents to mask odour, and came in various thickness and lengths to suit different flow rates.  TAMPONS AS CONTRACEPTION? As for tampons, the earliest version can be found in ancient Egyptian records, which described tampons fashioned from the papyrus plant. In the fifth century, Greek women were said to have made their version by wrapping lint around a small piece of wood, according to Hippocrates.  Women in ancient Japan fashioned tampons out of paper, held them in place with a bandage, and changed them 10 to 12 times a day. The tampons of old weren't always used for period protection. The ancient Egyptians and Romans fashioned tampons out of elephant or crocodile dung, or lint soaked in acacia juice to use as contraception. Tampons were also used as pessaries for delivering medicine into the vagina and cervix – though the effectiveness was highly questionable, considering these were reportedly soaked in substances that ranged from goose fat to opium. The modern tampon with its applicator was created in 1929 by Dr Earle Haas, who invented and patented the design. He later sold the rights to businesswoman Gertrude Tendrich, who went on to start the company behind Tampax.  The tampon without applicator, however, was created in the late 1940s by German gynaecologist Judith Esser-Mittag. The name ""ob"" is short for ""one binde"", which means ""no napkins"" in German."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/office-hygiene-germs-mould-virus-wfh-2689461,How germy and mouldy is your office after coming back from WFH?,"If you’re reading this on your desktop at work, do you wonder how clean the very surfaces – including the keyboard, mouse and even the desk – you’re touching are? After all, the average office desk is said to contain 400 times more germs than a toilet seat, according to research by the University of Arizona.  It might have been weeks, months or even a year or so since you last set foot in the office. And for those who don’t have cleaners regularly sanitising the office while everyone was working from home, what sort of micro-organism growth has taken place while you were away? Makes you want to douse your entire desk with sanitiser, doesn’t it? For starters, the same research found that, compared to women, men have three to four times the number of bacteria in, on and around their desks, phones, computers, keyboards, drawers and personal items. It might be that men have lower standards of personal grooming than women. Men also tend to have bigger desks, which gives them a bigger surface area to deposit bacteria, according to the research. HOW GERMY IS YOUR OFFICE? Whether it’s mould, bacteria or viruses, there are always going to be microbes around you. Humans, for one, are a source of these microorganisms, said Associate Professor Richard Sugrue from Nanyang Technological University’s Department of Biological Sciences. Also, “different microbes can attach to small dust particles in the air and settle on surfaces”, he said.  “There are many kinds of bacteria, viruses and fungi found on environmental surfaces commonly left behind from our skin as well as other bacteria and mould that exist naturally in the environment,” said Dr Louisa Sun, an infectious disease consultant with Alexandra Hospital. Furthermore, at locations and surfaces that experience high footfall and touch, it is common to find “skin bacteria and others like enterococci (faecal bacteria that can cause infections of the urinary tract, blood and wounds etc), several common cold viruses and other viruses that cause diarrhoea and stomach flu”, said Dr Sun.  Of course, not all of your microscopic deskmates can potentially make you sick; some are just “part of our skin flora and are not harmful”, she added. Does that mean you’ve brought back a workstation-full of microbes after a hiatus of months or even a year? Not so much for bacteria and viruses, said Assoc Prof Sugrue. “In general, viruses (in particular, enveloped viruses such as COVID-19) are not very stable for extended periods on most surfaces.” You should perhaps be looking out for mould. When enclosed rooms have been left vacant for more than three months, the high humidity level there can encourage mould growth, cautioned Richard Khaw, the deputy director of the School of Applied Science at Nanyang Polytechnic.  “Mould spreads very quickly through the formation of spores and they produce allergens,” said Khaw. “If one inhales or touches mould spores, it may cause an allergic reaction such as irritation to the respiratory system or even inflammation in those with a weak immune system.” FINALLY RETURNED TO THE OFFICE? If your office has been left empty for a long time, here’s what you can do: Wipe everything with a disinfectant: Use a household bleach that contains 10 per cent sodium hypochlorite, said Khaw. Or opt for a disinfectant with 70 per cent alcohol. Also, wiping something longer does not mean that it is going to be cleaner, he said. “Most importantly, we must ensure that entire surfaces are wiped thoroughly.” Use a reusable cloth instead of disposable disinfectant wipes: It is more environmentally friendly to use the good ol’ Good Morning towel or any reusable cloth that you can rinse after each wipe down, suggested Khaw. Remember to rinse the cloth after wiping each surface, even if you use a disinfectant.   In fact, Khaw recommended using separate cloths for different areas such as high-touch zones (for example, the doorknobs), personal workstations and shared equipment (such as the photocopier) to reduce the risk of cross contamination. Get the mould professionals: If the mould doesn’t budge after cleaning, you may need to engage the services of a professional cleaning company, said Dr Sun. Don’t just rinse utensils: Scrubbing with dishwashing detergent and a clean sponge is important as the utensils may have been left damp without being dried properly, said Khaw. “Bacteria can attach to these damp surfaces to form a layer of biofilm, which could then multiply. Once a biofilm layer is formed, it cannot be dislodged easily simply by rinsing with running water.” Replace air-condition’s filter: “Contaminated air may be continuously circulated if the filter system is not maintained and checked frequently,” said Khaw. “If an enclosed space has been vacant for a long period of time, it is advisable to clean the air-conditioning system and change the air filter before occupants return to the office.” WHAT DO YOU DO TO MAINTAIN OFFICE HYGIENE? Even with your best effort, “we cannot completely remove every organism present on surfaces”, said Dr Sun. “The most important thing to do is to wash our hands properly with soap and water regularly throughout the day, especially before and after meals. And, of course, after using the washroom.”  She said: “Regular and proper hand washing should be observed as the main activity to help to reduce the transmission of various infectious pathogens that can be transferred to our hands from these environmental surfaces. Bear in mind we are also touching multiple other surfaces in shared or public spaces every day”.  To help you keep your workstation as germ-free as possible, here’s a look: Soap and water are fine: Just wipe your workspace with normal soap and water, said Dr Sun. You don’t have to break out the big guns such as bleach and alcohol every day – provided you’ve been routinely keeping your desk clean. Moreover, the daily use of disinfectants and alcohol wipes is “harmful to our skin and cause irritation”, she said. “It is good practice to rinse or use different cloths when cleaning different equipment and surfaces,” she added. Monitor for mould: To minimise the build-up of mould and fungi, ensure good ventilation and reduce the moisture in the room, said Assoc Prof Sugrue.  Change the filter: Clean or replace the filter in the air-conditioner at least once every three months to maintain good indoor air quality, said Khaw."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/covid-19-reinfections-omicron-delta-2692716,Getting infected with COVID-19 again: How often can you fall sick with it?,"A virus that shows no signs of disappearing, variants that are adept at dodging the body’s defenses and waves of infections two, maybe three times a year – this may be the future of COVID-19, some scientists now fear. The central problem is that the coronavirus has become more adept at reinfecting people. Already, those infected with the first Omicron variant are reporting second infections with the newer versions of the variant – BA.2 or BA2.12.1 in the United States, or BA.4 and BA.5 in South Africa. Those people may go on to have third or fourth infections, even within this year, researchers said in interviews. And some small fraction may have symptoms that persist for months or years, a condition known as long COVID. “It seems likely to me that that’s going to sort of be a long-term pattern,” said Juliet Pulliam, an epidemiologist at Stellenbosch University in South Africa. “The virus is going to keep evolving,” she added. “And there are probably going to be a lot of people getting many, many reinfections throughout their lives.” It’s difficult to quantify how frequently people are reinfected, in part because many infections are now going unreported. Pulliam and her colleagues have collected enough data in South Africa to say that the rate is higher with Omicron than seen with previous variants. This is not how it was supposed to be. Earlier in the pandemic, experts thought that immunity from vaccination or previous infection would forestall reinfections. The Omicron variant dashed those hopes. Unlike previous variants, Omicron and its many descendants seem to have evolved to partially dodge immunity. That leaves everyone – even those who have been vaccinated multiple times – vulnerable to multiple infections. “If we manage it the way that we manage it now, then most people will get infected with it at least a couple of times a year,” said Kristian Andersen, a virologist at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego. “I would be very surprised if that’s not how it’s going to play out.” The new variants have not altered the fundamental usefulness of the COVID vaccines. Most people who have received three or even just two doses will not become sick enough to need medical care if they test positive for the coronavirus. And a booster dose, like a previous bout with the virus, does seem to decrease the chance of reinfection – but not by much. At the pandemic’s outset, many experts based their expectations of the coronavirus on influenza, the viral foe most familiar to them. They predicted that, as with the flu, there might be one big outbreak each year, most likely in the fall. The way to minimise its spread would be to vaccinate people before its arrival. Instead, the coronavirus is behaving more like four of its closely related cousins, which circulate and cause colds year round. While studying common-cold coronaviruses, “we saw people with multiple infections within the space of a year,” said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University in New York. If reinfection turns out to be the norm, the coronavirus is “not going to simply be this wintertime once-a-year thing,” he said, “and it’s not going to be a mild nuisance in terms of the amount of morbidity and mortality it causes.” Reinfections with earlier variants, including Delta, did occur but were relatively infrequent. But in September, the pace of reinfections in South Africa seemed to pick up and was markedly high by November, when the Omicron variant was identified, Pulliam said. Reinfections in South Africa, as in the United States, may seem even more noticeable because so many have been immunised or infected at least once by now. “The perception magnifies what’s actually going on biologically,” Pulliam said. “It’s just that there are more people who are eligible for reinfection.” The Omicron variant was different enough from Delta, and Delta from earlier versions of the virus, that some reinfections were to be expected. But now, Omicron seems to be evolving new forms that penetrate immune defenses with relatively few changes to its genetic code. “This is actually for me a bit of a surprise,” said Alex Sigal, a virologist at the Africa Health Research Institute. “I thought we’ll need a kind of brand-new variant to escape from this one. But in fact, it seems like you don’t.” An infection with Omicron produces a weaker immune response, which seems to wane quickly, compared with infections with previous variants. Although the newer versions of the variant are closely related, they vary enough from an immune perspective that infection with one doesn’t leave much protection against the others – and certainly not after three or four months. Still, the good news is that most people who are reinfected with new versions of Omicron will not become seriously ill. At least at the moment, the virus has not hit upon a way to fully sidestep the immune system. “That’s probably as good as it gets for now,” Sigal said. “The big danger might come when the variant will be completely different.” Still, each infection may bring with it the possibility of long COVID, the constellation of symptoms that can persist for months or years. It’s too early to know how often an Omicron infection leads to long COVID, especially in vaccinated people. To keep up with the evolving virus, other experts said, the COVID vaccines should be updated more quickly, even more quickly than flu vaccines are each year. Even an imperfect match to a new form of the coronavirus will still broaden immunity and offer some protection, they said. “Every single time we think we’re through this, every single time we think we have the upper hand, the virus pulls a trick on us,” Andersen said. “The way to get it under control is not, ‘Let’s all get infected a few times a year and then hope for the best.’” By Apoorva Mandavilli © 2022 The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/residents-jalan-bukit-merah-block-be-offered-free-tb-screening-after-cluster-7-cases-found-2697696,Residents of Jalan Bukit Merah block to be offered free TB screening after cluster of 7 cases found,"SINGAPORE: Current and former residents of Block 2, Jalan Bukit Merah will be offered voluntary screening for tuberculosis after a cluster of seven cases was detected, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Saturday (May 21). This is a precautionary measure after seven people who lived in seven different units at the block were diagnosed, said MOH. The screening will be conducted free of charge between May 27 and May 31. ""Residents, stallholders, shop owners and employees of Block 2 Jalan Bukit Merah are strongly encouraged to participate in the TB screening,"" said MOH. Mobile teams will be sent to flats in the block to carry out the screening for residents. A screening station at the Queenstown Hock San Zone Residents’ Committee (RC) Centre at Block 3, Jalan Bukit Merah will also be set up for those working at the shops and stalls, as well as to cater to residents whose homes are not suitable for screening. MOH was notified on Mar 2 of seven tuberculosis cases involving residents living at Block 2, Jalan Bukit Merah. The residents were diagnosed between February 2021 and March 2022. All of them lived in different units. MOH said the affected residents stated treatment immediately following diagnoses. Two of them have since completed treatment, while three are still undergoing treatment. Separately, two of those who were affected have since died ""from causes not due to TB"", said MOH. ""As individuals diagnosed with TB will rapidly become non-infectious once treatment starts, the cases are not an ongoing public health risk,"" the ministry said. MOH said contact investigations for each of the seven cases were initiated shortly after notification. Close contacts of the cases were identified and contacted for screening. Investigations for each of the seven cases at the time of their diagnosis did not identify each other as close contacts, said MOH. Genetic analysis and links - established in April this year - revealed that all seven cases had similar genetic make-up, suggesting that they were linked by spread from one or more common sources, said MOH. However, investigations showed the cases had no links other than that they lived in the same block. They also did not know or interact with one another, or congregate at the same common areas, said the ministry. ""Therefore, as a precaution, we are offering screening for those in the block to diagnose any TB cases that may be present for early treatment,"" said MOH. MOH said that staff from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), with support from the People’s Association, will visit flats at the affected block from May 21 to 23 to engage residents, as well as shop and stall owners and employees, and encourage them to participate in the screening. It said that while the screening is not compulsory, it strongly encourages residents to do so to determine if they have tuberculosis disease or infection (which is non-infectious). Those with tuberculosis disease will be treated immediately, while those with tuberculosis infection will be given follow-up appointments and offered treatment to minimise their risk of developing tuberculosis disease in the future. Former residents and subtenants who resided in the block from October 2020 will be contacted via phone call in June 2022 and offered screening at the Tuberculosis Control Unit (TBCU). They can also call the TBCU appointment hotline at 6258 4430. ""The risk of transmission to persons who are not close contacts of a TB case is very low. Screening is thus not necessary for individuals who had occasionally visited the block or vicinity,"" said MOH. MOH noted that tuberculosis is endemic in Singapore. Tuberculosis infection is not uncommon in our population, as tuberculosis had been prevalent in Singapore until the 1970s and older Singaporeans could have been exposed to tuberculosis and acquired tuberculosis infection when they were younger. Persons with tuberculosis infection do not experience symptoms of tuberculosis and are not infectious. ""TB is curable and the spread of TB is preventable. Early detection and prompt treatment of cases remain important in helping those infected and rendering them non-infectious,"" said MOH. The symptoms of tuberculosis disease include a persistent cough that lasts three weeks or longer, low-grade fever, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss and chest pain."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/running-exercise-tips-cardio-2688901,Feeling out of shape? Getting back into running is easier than you think,"Dusting off your running shoes after a break can be intimidating. If an injury, pregnancy or busy work schedule got in the way of your passion for running, you may wonder if you’re now too out of shape. Will your body even remember how to run a certain pace? Or will your legs feel weak and wobbly? And how many times do you have to pound pavement or hop on a treadmill before it feels fun again? The good news is that your muscles retain a memory of their former strength, which can make it easier to bounce back than if you were starting from scratch. If you were sidelined for only two or three weeks, you may not even notice a significant change in your running performance, especially if you remained physically active during your time off. If it has been longer, you may not want to rush back to several-mile runs. Mix running with walking, take time building up strength in unused muscles, and use a few tricks to motivate and reward yourself. It can take about two months for a new behaviour to become automatic. Once it does, it also becomes less taxing. But until then, you want to minimise the potential for injury and frustration. Use these expert-backed tips to get past the annoying retraining period so you can hit the open road with passion. EASE INTO A ROUTINE You are more likely to stick with a running habit if you start with small goals. That may mean holding yourself back a bit, both in terms of pace and distance. “Slow and steady wins the race,” said Karena Wu, a physical therapist and owner of ActiveCare Physical Therapy in New York City. Slow down until you can pass the talk test, which means carrying on a conversation while running. Try to do two to three short, easy runs per week. You could also follow a couch to 5K training plan designed for beginner runners and those who are returning after a long break. Alternatively, you may use a strategy that incorporates walking breaks into your runs. Whichever plan you pick, be sure it has elements of strength training, stretching and resting. The point is to stay consistent and remember that you are using this time to recondition the muscles, tendons, ligaments and connective tissues in your legs, Dr Wu said. BUILD IN IMMEDIATE REWARDS You may think you can muscle through the first few weeks or months of running, but research suggests that motivation alone is not always enough. Pairing small, immediate rewards to a task – like watching Netflix while on the treadmill or treating yourself to an Epsom salt bath after a long trail run – can make it easier and more enjoyable to continue doing these activities. “People repeat behaviours that they enjoy,” said Wendy Wood, a research psychologist at the University of Southern California and the author of Good Habits, Bad Habits. “If you hate running to begin with, there’s probably not much you can do to motivate yourself to repeat it.” Short-term rewards can carry you through the days when your motivation is lagging. And they may even accelerate the formation of your new running habit. Research shows that you can also get psychological rewards from running with a group of friends, affirmations from a coach or listening to your favourite music. Some studies have shown that people who listen to music are able to run faster, perform better and feel less exhausted. START STRENGTH TRAINING Strength training helps prepare your body for running again and can keep you injury free for the long haul. Many physical therapists and running experts even recommend strength training a few weeks before returning to running to build up muscle strength, increase flexibility and improve overall biomechanics. “I think a lot of people use running to get in shape, but I would really recommend getting in shape to get back to running,” said Irene Davis, an expert on the biomechanics of running at the University of South Florida. Runners tend to be weak in their feet and ankles, as well as their hips and glutes, Dr Davis said. To strengthen these areas, try weight lifting, yoga, calisthenics or plyometrics at least two days per week. Dr Davis and Dr Wu recommended exercises that train multiple muscles at the same time, like single and double leg calf raises, lateral band walks (or monster walks), planks, lunges, squats and step-ups. STRETCH A well-designed warm-up can also get your blood flowing and prepare your muscles for running. Dr Wu and Dr Davis recommended dynamic stretches, in which you move your joints and muscles through full ranges of motion, mimicking the movement you’re about to perform without holding them in place. For runners, they are often the same exercises used in strength training, like lunges and squats, as well as butt kicks and high knees. Research has offered mixed and often contradicting results regarding the benefits of cooling down after a workout. But many athletes and physical therapists, including Dr Wu, recommend static stretches, in which you hold a position for a period of time, after a run. She also recommended bringing your knee to your chest, pulling your ankle toward your glutes, leaning against a wall to stretch your calves or going into a deep lunge and moving your hips in a circle. Experiment with stretching and see if it makes you feel more flexible or helps you regain energy for the next run. GET ENOUGH REST Just because your body remembers how to do a five-minute mile doesn’t mean your muscles and joints are ready for the toll running can take. While you are rebuilding stamina and strength during runs, you’re also breaking your body down in many ways, like opening microscopic tears in your muscles. Taking at least one day off a week will help avoid injury and let you come back stronger, allowing your body time to recover. During each run, your body also depletes its stores of glycogen, a type of carbohydrate saved in the muscles and liver. Resting and refueling helps replenish these reserves so that you can use them as energy when you run again. Remind yourself that you are making progress throughout the whole process. Running is an invigorating way to exercise with the breeze in your hair and the ground at your feet. So dust off those shoes and head out the door.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/drinking-wine-beer-alcohol-heart-disease-obesity-2654291,Commentary: Drinking beer may lead to higher levels of body fat than wine,"AMES, Iowa: Drinking beer and spirits are linked to elevated levels of visceral fat – the harmful type of fat that is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and other health complications – whereas drinking wine shows no such association with levels of this harmful fat and may even be protective against it, depending on the type of wine consumed.  In fact, we found that drinking red wine is linked to having lower levels of visceral fat. These are some of the key takeaways of a new study that my colleagues and I recently published in the Obesity Science & Practice journal. Although white wine consumption did not influence levels of visceral fat, our study did show that drinking white wine in moderation might offer its own unique health benefit for older adults: Denser bones.  We found higher bone mineral density among older adults who drank white wine in moderation in our study. And we did not find this same link between beer or red wine consumption and bone mineral density. Our study relied on a large-scale longitudinal database called the UK Biobank. We assessed 1,869 white adults ranging in age from 40 to 79 years who reported demographic, alcohol, dietary and lifestyle factors via a touchscreen questionnaire.  Next, we collected height, weight and blood samples from each participant and obtained body composition information using a direct measure of body composition called dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Then, we used a statistical program to examine the relationships between the types of alcoholic beverages and body composition. Ageing is often accompanied by an increase in problematic fat that can lead to heightened cardiovascular disease risk as well as a reduction in bone mineral density. This has important health implications given that nearly 75 per cent of adults in the United States are considered overweight or obese.  Having higher levels of body fat has been consistently linked to an increased risk of acquiring many different diseases, including cardiovascular disease, certain types of cancer and a higher risk of death. And it’s worth noting that national medical care costs associated with treating obesity-related diseases total more than US$260.6 billion annually. Considering these trends, it is vital for researchers like us to examine all the potential contributors to weight gain so that we can determine how to combat the problem. Alcohol has long been considered one possible driving factor for the obesity epidemic.  Yet the public often hears conflicting information about the potential risks and benefits of alcohol. Therefore, we hope to help untangle some of these factors through our research. There are many biological and environmental factors that contribute to being overweight or obese. Alcohol consumption may be one factor, although there are other studies that have not found clear links between weight gain and alcohol consumption. One reason for the inconsistencies in the literature could stem from the fact that much of the previous research has traditionally treated alcohol as a single entity rather than separately measuring the effects of beer, cider, red wine, white wine, Champagne and spirits.  Yet, even when broken down in this way, the research yields mixed messages. For example, one study has suggested that drinking more beer contributes to a higher waist-to-hip ratio, while another study concluded that, after one month of drinking moderate levels of beer, healthy adults did not experience any significant weight gain. As a result, we aim to further tease out the unique risks and benefits that are associated with each alcohol type. Our next steps will be to examine how diet – including alcohol consumption – could influence diseases of the brain and cognition in older adults with mild cognitive impairment.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/monkeypox-australia-melbourne-traveller-britain-2694991,Australia reports first monkeypox case in traveller from Britain,"SYDNEY: Australia on Friday (May 20) reported its first monkeypox case in a traveller who recently returned from Britain, while a probable case of infection was identified with testing being carried out to confirm it. A man in his thirties who arrived in Melbourne on Monday has the virus, Victoria state's health department said, while the probable case was identified in Sydney in a man in his forties who had recently travelled to Europe. Both men developed mild illness after arriving back in Australia with symptoms clinically compatible with monkeypox, health officials said. ""Just to reassure the community, it is not the same spread mechanism as COVID or flu, where it is more fleeting,"" New South Wales state Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant told reporters. Cases of monkeypox have been identified in several non-endemic countries in recent weeks, including Britain, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Canada and the United States. Monkeypox, which mostly occurs in west and central Africa, is a rare virus similar to human smallpox, though milder. It was first recorded in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the 1970s. Cases in West Africa have increased in the past decade. Symptoms include fever, headaches and skin rashes starting on the face and spreading to the rest of the body. People can contract monkeypox through very close contact with those who are infected with the virus. Australian health officials have taken steps to identify and manage any monkeypox cases including clinical alerts to doctors and hospitals, Chant said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/polyphasic-monophasic-sleep-pattern-schedule-2677456,"Polyphasic sleep: Can snoozing 4 hours a day really improve your alertness, productivity and mood?","Unless you work the graveyard shift, most of us sleep through the night in one solid block, or what sleep researchers term a monophasic sleep pattern. It is, after all, what experts have told us to strive for: Getting seven to nine hours of slumber every night keeps our internal circadian rhythm ticking, and in turn, regulates a myriad processes such as hormone production, eating habits and digestion, and body temperature. Interestingly though, humans are some of the few mammals that stick to this sleep schedule. According to the National Sleep Foundation in the US, 85 per cent of mammals sleep in polyphasic patterns, meaning they break up their sleep into short periods throughout the day. Babies, for instance, naturally follow a polyphasic sleep pattern until they are about three months old, according to the foundation. So how did we evolve to sleep through the night and stay up during the day? It became the norm during the industrial revolution, when people needed to be awake longer in the day to improve productivity, according to Medical News Today.  “Some argue that since the advent of electricity and increased exposure to bright light, melatonin levels are decreasing, as they would if a person were exposed to sunlight. This can interrupt a person’s sleep-wake cycle and have a negative impact on their sleep durations,” noted the website.  DO GENIUSES SLEEP LESS? So what exactly is a polyphasic sleep pattern? There are many variations to it but generally, it is marked by multiple intervals of sleep and wakefulness throughout each 24-hour day.  A polyphasic sleep pattern actually reduces the total amount of sleep you get across the day, so that you get more time to spend on waking activities, explained Professor Joshua Gooley, the principal investigator at Duke-NUS Medical School’s Chronobiology and Sleep Laboratory. It is, perhaps, the kind of sleep routine a high-performing “genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist” like Ironman’s Tony Stark uses to get more out of each day.  Reality may not be too far off either. Great minds such as Leonardo da Vinci and Nikola Telsa have been rumoured to be polyphasic sleepers; the painter of Mona Lisa himself supposedly took a 20-minute nap every four hours, while the Tesla coil inventor was said to never have slept for more than two hours a night.  In more modern times, Gucci's former creative director Tom Ford purportedly only steals three hours to sleep a day. Meanwhile, Apple's CEO Tim Cook is said to be already up and checking his emails by 4.30am. Conversely, there are also successful people who insist on getting their executive suite of rest. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg is known to keep a normal routine that gives him seven to eight hours of sleep. Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos apparently needs eight hours of sleep each night to help him make the difficult decisions he has to make on a daily basis. WHAT HAPPENS DURING SLEEP? It is important to understand what your brain goes through during slumber. There are four stages of sleep, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Stages One to Three are when you go through non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and it’s hard to wake up from. This is when your body regenerates and repairs itself.  Stage Four is when REM sleep and dreams occur; this happens about 60 to 90 minutes after falling asleep. “A full sleep cycle takes about 90 to 110 minutes. Your first REM period is short. As the night goes on, you’ll have longer REM sleep and less deep sleep,” noted the website.  Studies such as this have pointed out the association between poor-quality REM sleep and Alzheimer’s disease and depression. Others claim that REM sleep stimulates the areas of the brain that help with learning and memory.  WHAT IS POLYPHASIC SLEEP? Let's say you need more waking hours each day to get things done. Besides, you are already sleeping rather little at night due to maybe insomnia, digital distractions (are you reading this before bed?), external factors (noisy neighbours) or other changes in your life (starting a new job or having a new baby).  Is it worth exploring polyphasic sleep schedules to hack your life and get more done? After all, proponents allege that polyphasic sleep could improve memory, mood and restfulness, all while increasing productivity.  If you can work from home and incorporate naps into your day, how does polyphasic sleep fit into your 24 hours? Here's a look: Of all the polyphasic sleep patterns, the Everyman schedule detracts the least from the regular monophasic pattern and maintains a semblance of the circadian rhythm. Still, it only gives you a core sleep period of three hours, typically from 1am to 4am, along with three 20-minute naps sprinkled throughout the day.  Total sleep per day: Four hours  This regimented schedule gives you six 30-minute naps every four hours. Proponents say that this sleep pattern sustains the concentration of adenosine (a chemical that regulates sleep recovery) in the blood, which would otherwise drop during prolonged sleep. In turn, it supposedly lets you enter REM sleep (more on that later) quicker than a monophasic pattern of sleep. However, not many people can stick to this sleep schedule for long to scientifically prove this. Total sleep per day: Three hours Yes, it will give you plenty of time to accomplish what you need to do each day as you only take four 30-minute naps every six hours, or just two hours of sleep a day. Its creator Richard Buckminster Fuller was said to be able to keep this schedule for two years as he purportedly had a rare mutation of the DEC2 gene, which is known as the ""short sleep gene"". But for the regular person, it is very likely to lead to chronic sleep deprivation. Total sleep per day: Two hours SHOULD YOU TRY IT? If you’re curious enough to try any of the polyphasic sleep patterns, “the Everyman schedule would be the ‘easiest’ because it allows for more total daily sleep, and there is a longer bout of sleep at night”, said Prof Gooley, although he cautioned against it. ""There is a remarkable amount of misinformation on the Internet about polyphasic sleep,"" he said. ""There is no scientific evidence to suggest that adopting a polyphasic sleep schedule provides benefits for health or performance.  ""Advocates of polyphasic sleep have the misguided view that performance can be sustained (or even enhanced) by splitting up sleep into smaller naps across the day,"" he continued. ""In fact, studies have shown that polyphasic sleep schedules are associated with worse sleep, impaired cognitive performance, and deterioration of mood.""  What about the pursuit of REM sleep by advocates of the Uberman sleep schedule mentioned earlier on? Matthew Walker, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, believed that REM sleep is not the only stage of sleep that matters in a Time article.  “REM sleep may have its own function, but most of the research still focuses on the restorative and very important benefits of the other phases,” he said. In fact, non-REM sleep “still seems to carry the majority of health benefits”, including regulating blood flow and blood glucose levels, and clearing Alzheimer’s-related plaque from the brain.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/monkeypox-rare-outbreaks-north-american-europe-spread-2691811,"Rare monkeypox outbreaks detected in North America, Europe","MONTREAL: Health authorities in North America and Europe have detected dozens of suspected or confirmed cases of monkeypox since early May, sparking concern the disease endemic in parts of Africa is spreading. Canada was the latest country to report it was investigating more than a dozen suspected cases of monkeypox, after Spain and Portugal detected more than 40 possible and verified cases. Britain has confirmed nine cases since May 6, and the United States verified its first on Wednesday (May 18), saying a man in the eastern state of Massachusetts had tested positive for the virus after visiting Canada. Monkeypox, which mostly occurs in west and central Africa, is a viral infection similar to human smallpox, though milder. It was first recorded in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the 1970s.  The illness, from which most people recover within several weeks and has only been fatal in rare cases, has infected thousands of people in parts of Central and Western Africa in recent years but is rare in Europe and North Africa. The illness often starts with flu-like symptoms such as fever, muscle ache and swollen lymph nodes before causing a chickenpox-like rash on the face and body. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday it was coordinating with UK and European health officials over the new outbreaks. ""We really need to better understand the extent of monkeypox in endemic countries ... to really understand how much is circulating and the risk that it poses for people who are living there, as well as the risk of exportation,"" infectious disease epidemiologist Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove said at a WHO press conference on Tuesday on global health issues. The first case in Britain was someone who had traveled from Nigeria, though later cases were possibly through community transmission, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said in a statement. ""These latest cases, together with reports of cases in countries across Europe, confirms our initial concerns that there could be spread of monkeypox within our communities,"" said UKHSA Chief Medical Adviser Dr Susan Hopkins. The WHO said it was also investigating that many cases reported were people identifying as gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men. ""We are seeing transmission among men having sex with men,"" said WHO Assistant Director-General Dr. Soce Fall at the press conference. ""This is new information we need to investigate properly to understand better the dynamic of local transmission in the UK and some other countries."" The UKHSA noted that monkeypox has not previously been characterized as a sexually transmitted disease, underscoring that ""it can be passed on by direct contact during sex."" ""Anyone, regardless of sexual orientation, can spread monkeypox through contact with body fluids, monkeypox sores, or shared items (such as clothing and bedding) that have been contaminated with fluids or sores of a person with monkeypox,"" a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) statement said Wednesday, adding that household disinfectants can kill the virus on surfaces. The Massachusetts Department of Health, said that the case there - the first confirmed this year in the United States - occurred in a patient who had recently traveled to Canada and ""poses no risk to the public, and the individual is hospitalized and in good condition."" Health authorities in Canada's Quebec province announced they were investigating at least 13 suspected cases of monkeypox, the public broadcaster CBC reported Wednesday. The cases were flagged to Montreal authorities after diagnoses were made in several clinics specializing in sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) told CBC it had called on ""public health authorities and laboratory partners across Canada to be alert for and investigate any potential cases"". According to the CDC, there were no reported cases of monkeypox for 40 years before it re-emerged in Nigeria in 2017."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/new-omicron-subvariants-ba4-and-ba5-not-surprise-ong-ye-kung-2690696,New Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 ‘not a surprise’: Ong Ye Kung,"SINGAPORE: The discovery of new Omicron subvariants is “not a surprise at all”, as it is known that the virus that causes COVID-19 will continue to mutate, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung on Wednesday (May 18). Speaking on the sidelines of a media event, Mr Ong noted how cases of the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants have been found in many countries - including in Singapore, with the country reporting its first three such cases on Tuesday. He said: “What we learnt from the data and findings of scientists is that BA.4 and BA.5 have a transmission advantage over BA.1 and BA.2."" That is why the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants have been classified as variants of concern by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, he added. “But more importantly, so far, there has been no evidence that the BA.4 and BA.5 will cause more severe illness.” Separately, Mr Ong gave an update on plans for a new national healthcare strategy - Healthier SG - which was first unveiled at Budget 2022. The strategy and its reforms aim to address the challenges of an ageing population and improve population health outcomes. Public consultations will be held from May 18 to Aug 15 this year, as part of efforts to involve Singaporeans in shaping the strategy. These engagements will be held in-person and through online surveys. Mr Ong said: “In a nutshell, we want to find out: Why do residents not go to one doctor?” Getting residents to register and stick with one doctor is a key pillar of the Healthier SG strategy. This way, doctors can better understand patients, their medical history, said Mr Ong. He added that the Ministry of Health (MOH) wants to find out what residents hope to see in care plans given to them by doctors. The feedback gathered will be studied and incorporated into a White Paper, which will be tabled for debate in Parliament later this year. MOH added that it has already begun engaging general practitioners (GPs) and senior management of healthcare clusters for feedback. The biggest concern that has emerged thus far is about drug prices, said Mr Ong.  “If you go to a GP (general practitioner) versus you go to a polyclinic, up to a certain point, polyclinic drug prices are cheaper.” Drug prices and subsidies will thus have to be adjusted, and this is an issue authorities “have to really think about”, said Mr Ong. Other examples of concerns include ones about technology systems, which are needed for data sharing. But he added that his sense is that there is “a lot of buy-in” for the strategy. When asked about whether these concerns about subsidies and technology would lead to higher healthcare costs - which the reforms are meant to tackle, Mr Ong said such costs are necessary for the long-run. “Sometimes, a lot of things in life are like that. You invest in something that's preventative for the long-term. It will save you a lot of pain and costs in future.” Editor's note: This story has been updated to clarify that the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants are classified as variants of concern."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/migraine-stroke-symptoms-2659131,Can migraine symptoms mimic a stroke? How do you tell if you need a painkiller or an ambulance?,"You might have a few questions after reading about local DJ Divian Nair’s health scare back in April. He was rushed to the hospital following a bad migraine attack that apparently caused “some paralysis on one side”. In his Instagram post, Nair wrote that ""it was most likely a major migraine caused by severe stress and fatigue that resulted in symptoms mimicking a stroke"".   How do you tell if your headache is just that or something more sinister? With the amount of stress that we are under these days – be it from trying to stay COVID-19-free or the pressure of returning to the office – we’d wager that taking painkillers for headaches and migraine is becoming as common as breaking out the ART test kit these days.  So, if you’re asking yourself this each time you have a stress-induced pounding in the head – is my bad migraine a sign of stroke or can it lead to one? – here’s an FAQ with the experts:  WHEN IS A HEADACHE CONSIDERED A MIGRAINE? HOW ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF A MIGRAINE AND STROKE DIFFERENT? A migraine is like a pumped-up headache on steroids that won’t let go. It pounds on one side of the head (usually) and is often accompanied by nausea, vomiting and extreme sensitivity to light and sound, said Associate Professor Raymond Seet, a senior consultant with the Division of Neurology at National University Hospital.  “Migraine attacks can last for hours to days, and the pain can be so severe that it interferes with your daily activities,” he said.  That’s not the end of the trouble. Some migraine attacks can be accompanied by an aura occurring before the attack itself.  Said Assoc Prof Seet: “These auras are usually visual symptoms causing bright spots or flashes of light, and can include vision loss, weakness or numbness in the face or side of the body, and difficulty speaking. Aura symptoms usually begin gradually, build up over several minutes and could last for hours.” By contrast, there is no headache when a stroke occurs. But sometimes, stroke patients can experience a sudden and intense headache that results from “bleeding within the brain tissues and subarachnoid spaces”, explained Assoc Prof Seet. However, the most common signs of a stroke include sudden facial weakness, weakness in the arm and leg, and speech slurring, he said. WHAT HAPPENS IN YOUR BRAIN WHEN YOU HAVE A MIGRAINE VS A STROKE? Simply put, a migraine attack is your brain over-reacting to innocuous stimuli such as light or smell. For instance, drawing the curtains to bright sunlight or smelling the intense aroma of spices frying.  “In a person with migraine, certain parts of the brain are easily activated,” said Dr Yasmin Idu Jion, a senior consultant with National Neuroscience Institute’s Department of Neurology. “They fire excessively and cause changes in the chemicals and blood vessels in the brain.”  A stroke, on the other hand, is caused by a ruptured blood vessel in the brain (haemorrhagic stroke). More commonly, it is brought on by the interruption of blood supply to the brain (ischaemic stroke), said Dr Yasmin. Both stroke types can lead to a “neurological loss of function” in the area of the brain that is affected, and can “manifest as visual loss, numbness, weakness, slurred speech”.  Shingles is a painful rash that wraps around the left or right side of your torso. It is caused by the varicella-zoster virus – the same virus that causes chicken pox.  But that is not the only location on the body that shingles can show up on – nor is it the only symptom. Other than a painful, burning, numb or tingling rash, shingles can also cause headache and sensitivity to light, according to Mayo Clinic. Very similar to a migraine attack, actually. Broadway composer Lin-Manuel Miranda had that experience when he tweeted he had “the worst migraine of my life” in 2018. He later followed up with: “Hey, cool story. This isn't a migraine, it's shingles! Caught it early, quarantined away from the baby, in a Phantom mask til further notice”.  According to Mayo Clinic, “Pain is usually the first symptom of shingles. For some, it can be intense. Depending on the location of the pain, it can sometimes be mistaken for a symptom of problems.” CAN A MIGRAINE ATTACK FEEL LIKE A STROKE? “Migraine and stroke are two different conditions with separate mechanisms,” emphasised Assoc Prof Seet. Having said that, a migraine can sometimes – but rarely – be accompanied with stroke-like symptoms. The electrical activities that trigger a migraine can affect different parts of the brain, including the “critical sensory, motor and speech areas”, said Assoc Prof Seet.  If the motor area is affected, it can create a migraine headache along with weakness on one side of the body known as hemiplegic migraine, he said. “Hemiplegic migraine is rare, occurring about one in 10,000 individuals in the community.” CAN A MIGRAINE LEAD TO A STROKE? What can happen is an ischaemic stroke occurring alongside a migraine with aura known as a migrainous stroke, said Dr Yasmin. Again, it is a very rare diagnosis, accounting for only 0.8 per cent of all strokes.  There are risk factors that may predispose someone with migraine to have a stroke, she said. These factors include age, pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors and in smokers, the use of oral contraceptive pills.  “Some studies have observed a marginally increased risk of stroke in migraine patients,” said Assoc Prof Seet. “This is not surprising as migraine patients harbour vascular risk factors and are better aware of stroke symptoms through regular visits with their family physicians and neurologists.” HOW DO YOU TELL IF THE SYMPTOMS ARE THE RESULT OF A MIGRAINE OR STROKE? According to Dr Yasmin, migraine symptoms tend to “build up over time (minutes to hours) and are usually similar to the symptoms of previous attacks.  “Stroke symptoms, on the other hand, tend to occur abruptly and affect one side of the body. In general, most strokes (commonly the ischaemic stroke) are also painless,” she said. If the headache is caused by a haemorrhagic stroke, it tends to be “abrupt, sudden and explosive in nature”.  “Having said that, sometimes, it can be difficult to distinguish the two, especially when the patient is having a migraine for the first time,” she said. “It is best to seek medical help urgently.” Assoc Prof Seet concurred on getting help ASAP. “As migraine patients are also at risk for stroke, they are strongly advised to call for an ambulance should they develop abrupt stroke-like symptoms, especially for the first time. Paramedics are well trained to perform pre-hospital stroke assessment to evaluate and bring suspected stroke patients to the nearest stroke-ready hospital."" ""Time is brain"", added Dr Yasmin, referring to the phrase used in the medical community pertaining to stroke care, ""and the earlier treatment is given, the more brain cells can potentially be saved if it is a stroke"". "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/fitness-tracker-boom-less-exercise-physical-activity-decline-2677461,Commentary: We're buying more fitness trackers but exercising less,"BOISE, Idaho: Worldwide sales of fitness trackers increased from US$14 billion in 2017 to over US$36 billion in 2020. The skyrocketing success of these gadgets suggests that more people than ever see some value in keeping tabs on the number of steps they take, flights of stairs they climb, the time they spend sitting and the calories they burn. The manufacturers of these devices certainly want consumers to believe that tracking fitness or health-related behaviours will spur them to increase their activity levels and make them healthier. Our analysis of research published over the past 25 years suggests otherwise. To learn whether and how physical activity has changed in the years since fitness trackers became popular, we analysed more than two decades of research from several industrialised nations – all conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic. Our systematic review of data from eight developed nations around the world shows that despite the surge in sales of fitness trackers, physical activity declined from 1995 to 2017. What’s more, we discovered that this was not an isolated effect in one or two countries, but a widespread trend. To conduct the study, we first searched for published research that tracked physical activity such as walking, household activities or playing sports throughout the day. We wanted studies that obtained two “snapshots” of daily activity from a population, with the measurements separated by at least one year. We found 16 studies from eight different countries that met these criteria: Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, Japan, Norway, Sweden and the United States. The studies were conducted between 1995 and 2017. It is important to note that these snapshots did not track specific individuals. Rather, they tracked samples of people from the same age group. For example, one Japanese study of physical activity among adults ages 20 to 90 collected data every year for 22 years from people in each age group. Scientists tracked the participants’ physical activity using a variety of wearable devices, from simple pedometers – step counters – to more sophisticated activity monitors like accelerometers. The study groups ranged from large, nationally representative samples numbering tens of thousands of people to small samples of several hundred students from a few local schools. After identifying the research studies, we calculated an “effect size” for each study. The effect size is a method of adjusting the data to allow for an “apples-to-apples” comparison.  To calculate the effect size, we used the data reported in the studies. These include the average physical activity at the beginning and end of each study, the sample size and a measure of the variability in physical activity. Using a technique called meta-analysis, this allowed us to combine the results of all studies to come up with an overall trend. We discovered that overall, researchers documented fairly consistent declines in physical activity, with similar decreases in each geographical region and in both sexes. Overall the decrease in physical activity per person was over 1,100 steps per day between 1995 and 2017. Our most striking finding was how sharply physical activity declined among adolescents aged 11 to 19 years – by roughly 30 per cent – in the span of a single generation.  For instance, when we compared the studies reporting physical activity in steps per day, we found that the total steps per day per decade declined by an average of 608 steps per day in adults, 823 steps per day in children and 1,497 steps per day in adolescents. Our study doesn’t address why physical activity has declined over the past 25 years. However, the studies we reviewed mentioned some contributing factors. Among adolescents, declines in physical activity were associated with increases in ownership and use of smartphones, tablets, video games and social media. In the US, for example, screen time increased dramatically in adolescents, from five hours per day in 1999 to 8.8 hours per day in 2017. At school, most of the physical activity that adolescents perform has traditionally come from physical education classes. However, the changes in the frequency of physical education classes during the study period are inconsistent and vary from country to country. All of these factors may help to explain the decline in physical activity that we observed in our study. In addition, fewer adults and children are walking or bicycling to school or work than 25 years ago. For instance, in the late 1960s, most US children ages 5 to 14 rode a bicycle or walked to school. Since then, this “active transportation” has largely been replaced by automobile trips. Rates of travel by school bus or public transportation have seen little change. So if levels of physical activity have dropped at the same time that the popularity of fitness tracking has grown, what makes these gadgets useful? Fitness trackers can help to increase people’s awareness of their daily physical activity. However, these devices are only part of the solution to addressing the problem of sedentary lifestyles. They are facilitators, rather than drivers, of behaviour change. When a person’s physical activity goes down, it opens the door to overall reduced fitness levels and other health problems such as obesity or diabetes. On the other hand, physical activity has a dramatic positive impact on health and well-being.  The first step to increasing active movement is to measure it, which these devices can do. But successfully increasing one’s overall physical activity requires several additional factors such as goal-setting, self-monitoring, positive feedback and social support.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/myopia-children-treatment-prevent-spectacles-contact-lenses-lasik-2683371,Commentary: It’s not enough to count on glasses or Lasik to fix short-sightedness,"SINGAPORE: There’s a silent epidemic in Singapore that affects up to eight out of 10 children by the time they are in Primary 6. It could have lifelong consequences, but parents are generally unaware of how to reduce its impact. This epidemic is no stranger to any of us – it’s known as myopia.  Myopia is so prevalent in Singapore today that it’s hard to find a child who is not myopic. Our children now spend so much time on computers and mobile devices for leisure and schooling that myopia is an unavoidable reality for most of them. But should we accept it passively by letting our children’s myopia progress over the years? Is there nothing that can be done about myopia beyond correcting our children’s near-sightedness with spectacles?   You might be wondering why there’s a need to be concerned about your child’s myopia when there are tried and tested ways to correct their vision. As an optometrist, I have observed that when a child is diagnosed with myopia, the default response from parents is to fit the child with spectacles and hope that when they’re adults, they can undergo Lasik to permanently correct their vision.  While spectacles and Lasik are effective in helping a myopic sufferer see clearly, we need to differentiate between myopia management and myopia correction.   Blurred vision of faraway objects is the most immediate and visible consequence of myopia, but myopia is much more than simply not being able to see far. It is a chronic, progressive eye disease, characterised by excessive elongation of the eyeball, such that light rays focus on a point in front of the retina, rather than directly on its surface. This elongation of the eye is irreversible. If it develops into high myopia, defined as 500 degrees and above in each eye, it could lead to sight-threatening conditions such as myopic macular degeneration and retinal detachment. Young children who develop myopia before the age of 12 are more at risk of developing high myopia and, as a result, are vulnerable to developing complications later in life. Spectacles act as a tool to correct vision but have little bearing on the progression of one’s myopia. Similarly, the Lasik procedure affords clear vision by removing a part of the layer of the cornea to neutralise myopia and astigmatism, but this does not treat the health risks which occur in eyes that have developed high myopia. This means patients can have 6/6 perfect vision after Lasik, but still be susceptible to developing myopia-related issues. Therefore, it’s essential for parents not to merely correct the symptom, but to manage the disease itself.   A common misconception about myopia is that it cannot be prevented or managed after being diagnosed. Its onset and progression can indeed be slowed down before it becomes high myopia.  The most effective way of delaying the onset of myopia in children is to increase the time they spend outside. A study found that children who are outdoors 200 minutes or more every day are less likely to be or to become myopic, regardless of how much near work they do or whether they’re genetically inclined to myopia. This is partly because bright outdoor light, which cannot be replicated indoors, provides a protective effect even if you’re wearing sunglasses or are under an outdoor shelter. Therefore, you should actively involve your child in regular outdoor activities such as sports, games and walking. One small and achievable lifestyle habit is to take your family out on daily outings so your child spends more time away from screens and even books indoors. Another thing you can do is to start your child on optical intervention treatments available in Singapore. These include myopia control daily contact lenses worn in the daytime, spectacle lenses with a design that creates peripheral defocus, and orthokeratology, also known as ortho-K lenses. Ortho-K lenses are hard lenses worn at night while the child is sleeping to reshape their cornea and provide clear vision the next day so that they don’t need to wear spectacles or contact lenses. These treatments are safe for children and have been proven effective in slowing down myopia progression.  Children whose myopia can be controlled when at a low degree will enjoy more freedom from impaired vision. As reducing the rate of myopia progression could cut the prevalence of high myopia by up to 90 per cent, it is essential for every parent to actively manage your child’s eye health as early as possible. If you’re unsure of how to get started, a crucial first step would be to take your child to the optometrist for regular eye checks to assess the progression of their myopia and discuss best methods for managing it. The earlier we start, the higher the chance our children will enjoy good eye health for the rest of their lives.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-insider/probiotics-myth-miracle-friendly-bacteria-benefits-diet-2681021,Probiotics: Myth or miracle? What we should know about these friendly bacteria,"SINGAPORE: Winnie Ong remembers being “very sceptical” about the health benefits of kombucha, a fermented tea known to be rich in probiotics, when she was first introduced to it. But after brewing her own kombucha and drinking it over a period of two weeks, she saw a marked improvement in the eczema and rashes she was dealing with at the time. “That’s how I became a believer,” she said. Today, she runs kombucha-making workshops at local brewery Craft and Culture, which she co-founded. Probiotics, or live bacteria and yeasts, now seem to be all the rage. They can be found on the labels on foods ranging from cereal bars to chicken products. According to market research firm Meticulous Research, the global probiotics market is expected to reach US$75.9 billion (S$105.9 billion) by 2027, at a compound annual growth rate of 5.6 per cent from 2020 until then. But do probiotics really work? Is it necessary to take a daily supplement? The programme Talking Point finds out. It starts with the gut, which includes the mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine and large intestine. The gut has trillions of bacteria, viruses and fungi known as the gut microbiome, which plays an important role in one’s health by helping to regulate digestion, the immune system and metabolism. It can even influence one’s mood. Probiotics help by secreting compounds that grow good intestinal bacteria and restore the balance between good and bad bacteria in the gut, according to gastroenterologist Loh Poh Yen. An imbalance can have a disruptive effect, whereby allergens, bacteria and toxins “cross into the intestine and subsequently activate the immune system in the bowels”, said the doctor from Farrer Park Hospital. “That can lead to a lot of diseases.” These could range from allergic reactions, such as eczema and asthma, to conditions like irritable bowel syndrome. There are some things to note about probiotics, however, to reap the most benefits. One main consideration is whether the probiotics are still alive, and if so, how many microbes there are in the food item, according to William Chen, the director of Nanyang Technological University’s Food Science and Technology Programme. To be labelled “probiotic”, noted the professor, the food item must contain at least a billion CFUs, or colony forming units, which represent the number of bacteria in each serving. But a probiotic product can lose potency if it is not stored properly or sits on the shelf for too long. “Ideally, the lower the temperature, the better,” he said. “Bacteria grow more slowly at a lower temperature, but faster at a high temperature.” The CFU number on the label is typically the number at the date of packaging, he added. But the company will not be monitoring how long a product was on the shelf before it was bought. So “no one knows” how many microbes is taken in at the time of consumption, said Chen, who advised paying attention to the expiry date. “Don’t buy too much and then put (the food) in the fridge for too long.” As for the type of foods to eat, in general, fermented foods are good for gut health because they are easier to digest, according to Jeremy Lim, chief executive officer of precision gut microbiome company Amili. The fermentation process also allows probiotics to multiply. WATCH: Probiotics — are they really necessary? (23.49) Besides, these foods contain “other goodness”, noted principal dietitian Bibi Chia from Raffles Diabetes and Endocrine Centre. For example, kimchi has fibre and lactic acid, while yoghurt contains protein and calcium. This is why she recommends against favouring probiotic supplements over the foods. But if one were looking for a supplement, she suggested that one should consider the number of different strains it contains. “If you look at the bottle, it generally will tell you what the different types of strains are,” she said. “Different strains mean they are of different bacteria … almost like different species.” For general well-being, she added, the more strains the supplement contains, the better. “But for certain health conditions, you might want to target the specific strains studied (that benefit) that health condition.” Probiotics cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution, as Talking Point host Steven Chia discovered after he brought a stool sample to Amili’s laboratory in order to determine his gut health. According to the test analysis, while his gut was generally healthy, there were three areas for improvement. He was not producing much serotonin, a hormone that affects mood and sense of well-being; he had a high level of Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a chemical produced in the gut that is associated with poorer heart health; and his overall metabolism. Accordingly, four specific foods that would benefit him were recommended to him: Natto (Japanese fermented soya beans), miso soup, idli (a South Indian fermented rice cake) and Pu-erh tea. He was also prescribed supplements formulated for his health profile. “When we talk about these probiotics, there are literally hundreds of different strains,” noted Lim. “Some of them can be good for you, (while) you already have enough (of some others).” Chia incorporated the foods into his diet for two weeks, after which a second analysis showed that while his serotonin production had not improved, his TMAO levels were brought within the normal range, thereby lowering his risk of heart disease. The results also showed that the efficiency of nutrient absorption in his gut had improved. Lim noted, however, that the test Chia took — called Bio and Me — is a wellness test and is not meant for diagnostic evaluation or medical purposes. “This is for those who are interested in how their microbiomes look like and how to live their lives to the fullest from a gut health point of view,” said Lim, who is also an associate professor at the National University of Singapore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. But is it necessary to enhance one’s diet with probiotics? If one has a balanced diet and avoids smoking and excessive drinking, then probiotic supplements are unlikely to be needed, according to Melvin Look, a general surgeon practising at Mount Elizabeth Novena Specialist Centre. “If your gut is functioning healthily, it should be able to balance itself,” he said. Some early warning signs of an unhealthy gut include irregular bowel habits and susceptibility to diarrhoea or food poisoning. But foods rich in probiotics are a “good idea”, he added, as they are an “essential part” of a balanced diet. And probiotic supplements can help in times of illness when one’s immunity is low. While he noted that probiotics are safe — and consumers cannot “overdose” on them — there may be side effects from eating a lot of fermented foods, whose high levels of amines can irritate the brain and cause headaches in some people. Consuming a lot of probiotic foods and supplements may also cause fermentation in the gut, which could result in abdominal bloating and discomfort in some people.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/covid-19-scientists-question-mass-swab-test-checks-denmark-who-2674926,"Test, test, test? Scientists question costly mass COVID-19 checks","COPENHAGEN: For many people worldwide, having cotton swabs thrust up their nose or down their throat to test for COVID-19 has become a routine and familiar annoyance. But two years into the pandemic, health officials in some countries are questioning the merits of repeated, mass testing when it comes to containing infections, particularly considering the billions it costs. Chief among them is Denmark, which championed one of the world's most prolific COVID-19 testing regimes early on. Lawmakers are now demanding a close study of whether that policy was effective. ""We've tested so much more than other countries that we might have overdone it,"" said Jens Lundgren, professor of infectious diseases at Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, and member of the government's COVID-19 advisory group. Japan avoided large-scale testing and yet weathered the pandemic relatively well, based on infection and death rates. Other countries, including Britain and Spain, have scaled back testing. Yet repeated testing of entire cities remains a central part of the ""zero-COVID"" plan in China, where leaders have threatened action against critics. ""We need to learn, and no one did it perfectly,"" said Dale Fisher, chair of the World Health Organization's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. The WHO urged countries to ""test, test, test"" all suspected cases after the coronavirus was first identified. Global surveillance helped scientists understand the risk of severe illness or death, as well as the risk of transmission. Now, with the dominance of the relatively milder Omicron variant and the availability of vaccines and more effective treatments, governments should consider more strategic policies, such as population sampling, experts said. Pulling back too drastically, however, could leave the world blind to a still-changing virus, some officials said. WHO guidelines have never recommended mass screening of asymptomatic individuals - as is currently happening in China - because of the costs involved and the lack of data on its effectiveness. Denmark ultimately recorded similar case numbers and death rates as other countries with less widespread testing. This has prompted a majority of parties in parliament to call for an investigation into the strategy. In the last two years, Denmark's population of 5.8 million logged more than 127 million rapid and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, all provided free. In total, Denmark spent more than 16 billion crowns (US$2.36 billion) on testing, according to the Danish Critical Supply Agency. Neighbouring Norway, with a similar population size, only performed 11 million PCR tests, while Sweden, home to nearly twice as many people, completed around 18 million, according to Our World in Data. Christine Stabell Benn, professor of global health at University of Southern Denmark, said Denmark's strategy was expensive and results ""undocumented"". ""The mass testing approach took away the focus from testing where it really matters: Among the vulnerable."" Other experts – and the Danish government - said widespread testing reduced the transmission rate and helped people re-enter society, boosting the economy and their own mental health. The economy took a relatively milder hit than other European countries, according to a government report released in September. ""There is no doubt that the human and economic costs of, for example, an extensive lockdown, as we have seen in many other countries, would be greater,"" Justice Minister Nick Haekkerup told Reuters in an email. One Danish study published last year concluded that the testing programme and subsequent isolation of confirmed cases helped reduce transmission by up to 25 per cent. Other disease experts question such estimates. A review published in Medical Virology in late March on the use of rapid tests for people without symptoms in mass screening initiatives found ""uncertainty"" over their impact. ""The claim was that (mass testing) would stop the pandemic in its tracks, and that it would cut transmission by 90 per cent. And it hasn't,"" said Angela Raffle, a senior lecturer at Bristol University Medical School, who has worked with the UK's National Screening Committee. There are several possible explanations why testing did not yield a bigger benefit, including an over-ambitious target and the fact that the tests were imperfect. Plus many people either did not or could not isolate after testing positive: A review in the British Medical Journal, pre-Omicron, found that only 42.5 per cent of such cases stayed home for the entire isolation period. In England, free COVID-19 tests are now only available for government healthcare workers, those with certain health conditions and people entering hospital. Others, even with symptoms, have to pay for tests or are simply advised to stay at home until they feel better.  Some global health experts say such a pullback goes too far. ""In some settings, because politicians have decided to 'move on' and dismantle all public health, testing has been deliberately reduced or made harder to access,"" said Madhu Pai, a global health professor at McGill University in Canada. ""This will be disastrous, because we will be completely caught off guard if a more dangerous variant emerges."" "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/changsha-china-probe-byd-children-nosebleeds-factory-emissions-2673231,Chinese city probing BYD factory emissions over allegations of children's nosebleeds,"SHANGHAI: A Chinese city has opened an investigation into a factory owned by automaker BYD over allegations that emissions from the plant were causing nosebleeds among children living nearby. Changsha city authorities said in a statement on Sunday (May 8) it had sent an investigative team to BYD's factory to look into the allegations about its emissions. The allegations first surfaced in mid-April on a website belonging to state newspaper People's Daily. Messages left by people living near the factory said the plant's emissions had a strong odour, irritated throats and gave children nosebleeds. Local media reported over the weekend that residents gathered at the Changsha factory's gate on Friday to protest and urge the company to solve the problem. Changsha is the capital of Hunan province in southern China and has a population of 10 million. BYD said in a social media post on Saturday that all emissions from the factory were compliant with China's regulatory rules and standards on emissions. The company said in the post it had taken measures to improve the impact of its emission on some residential areas next to the plant. It added, however, that it had filed police reports over the complaints about nosebleeds, saying these were groundless and malicious. BYD did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Changsha city's investigation on Monday. Its shares fell 4 per cent on Monday. The manufacturer is China's biggest maker of electric vehicles (EV). Its EV sales increased nearly fivefold in the first four months of 2022 compared with the same period last year, even as the country's zero-COVID policies disrupted the operations and deliveries of many of its rivals. BYD's Changsha factory, which started up in 2012, churned out 62,500 vehicles in the first quarter, a 271 per cent increase from a year ago, according to local official media Rednet.cn. That accounted about one-fifth of BYD's total output, according to a Reuters calculation."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/headaches-migraines-causes-carbs-sugar-2661011,Do you get a headache after eating carbs and sugar? Experts explain why,"It’s common for people to notice a headache coming on after eating certain foods, and foods high in sugar or refined carbohydrates, like a slice of chocolate cake or a bowl of pasta, are among the usual suspects. Such food triggers are often reported by people who have migraines, said Dr. Peter Goadsby, a professor of neurology at King’s College London and the University of California, Los Angeles. “The person that’s asking this question, pounds to pennies, has migraine,” he said, particularly if certain foods seem to be repeat triggers and their headaches are bothersome enough to wonder about it. Unlike the more common, tension-type headaches most people get from time to time, migraine headaches – which affect an estimated 18 per cent of women and 6 per cent of men each year in the United States – are much more debilitating, said Dr. Rashmi Halker Singh, an associate professor of neurology and a headache medicine specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz. People with migraine have recurring episodes of moderate or severe headaches, often accompanied by symptoms like nausea or light sensitivity, which can interfere with normal activities, Dr. Halker Singh said. And many people don’t realize the headaches they have are actually migraines, she added. In one review of studies published in 2018, researchers concluded that nearly 30 percent of patients reported that certain foods or eating habits triggered their headaches. But recent research by Dr. Goadsby and others suggests that it’s most likely not the foods that cause migraines, but rather it’s the migraines that cause people to eat certain foods. And evidence for this counterintuitive explanation may lie in the brain. During the initial stage of a migraine attack – called the premonitory or prodrome phase, which can begin a few hours to days before the headache phase hits – people may experience symptoms like fatigue, brain fog, mood changes, light sensitivity, muscle stiffness, yawning and increased urination, Dr. Goadsby said. During this time, he added, brain imaging studies have shown that the hypothalamus, a region of the brain that regulates hunger, is activated, causing people to want – and eat – certain foods. “It is pretty clear that this area is changing in its activity before the pain starts,” he said. What a person reaches for in response is often carbohydrate-rich and highly palatable, though the exact food varies from person to person. Some people want savoury or salty snacks, while others crave sweets and chocolate, Dr. Goadsby said. Then, after they’ve indulged their craving and the headache phase of the migraine begins, it’s natural for people to wonder if something they ate contributed to the pain, Dr. Halker Singh said. “Sometimes people come in and tell me, ‘I had some chocolate, and soon after that, my migraine attack started,’” leading them to guess that the chocolate itself triggered the headache. But what also could have happened, she said, “is that maybe the craving for chocolate was actually the start of the migraine.” Chocolate is among the most reported food triggers for migraines, but in one review of studies published in the journal Nutrients in 2020, researchers concluded that there wasn’t enough evidence to say that chocolate can cause migraines. In the above scenario, Dr. Goadsby said, the person would have probably gotten a headache whether they ate the chocolate or not. So, if you’re craving a treat during the early stages of a headache, he said, it’s fine to enjoy it. If you often get food cravings before migraine headaches, it’s still a good idea to take note of them, along with other prodrome phase symptoms, so you can prepare for what’s coming. You might use that time to find your migraine medication and opt for an early bedtime, for example, rather than going out for drinks, Dr. Goadsby said. “If people understand their disorder better, they can adjust what they’re going to do so they don’t set themselves up for a crash,” he said. Margaret Slavin, an associate professor of nutrition and food studies at George Mason University, said that foods high in sugar or refined carbohydrates can also cause blood sugar to spike, leading to “an outsized insulin response.” Insulin helps normalize blood sugar, but too much insulin can overshoot the goal, leading to low blood sugar. This condition is called reactive hypoglycemia, and a headache is one of its symptoms, along with feeling weak, shaky, tired and lightheaded. For people who get migraines, it’s also possible that regularly following a diet high in refined sugar and processed carbohydrates might increase inflammation levels in their body and make them more susceptible to attacks, Dr. Slavin said. There is some limited research to support this idea, and it may be worth trying to cut back on added sugar in favour of anti-inflammatory foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans, whole grains and fish. (Since research on the link between diet and headache is limited, Dr. Slavin noted, there isn’t enough evidence to recommend specific diets that prevent migraines.) Skipping meals and fasting are also commonly reported migraine triggers, so Dr. Halker Singh advises her patients to eat regular, nutritious meals, in addition to getting enough sleep, exercising regularly and managing stress. There has been significant progress in understanding and treating migraines in recent years, Dr. Halker Singh said. “There’s an explosion of new treatments in this field, and we have a lot of hope to offer people,” she said. “If you feel like you’re having significant problems from a headache, sugar related or not, I think you should probably consider being evaluated.” By Alice Callahan © 2022 The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/vagina-care-probiotics-supplements-2654421,Can taking probiotics boost vaginal health? Here's what the experts say,"Before there were vaginal probiotics, there was the yogurt douche. In the 1970s, a common home remedy for yeast infections and other irritating ailments was to soak a tampon in plain, unsweetened yogurt and insert it into the vagina. The same live bacteria that make yogurt beneficial for the gut, the thinking went, might also be good for the vagina. Though yogurt douching never went commercially mainstream, the concept of infusing an ailing vagina with good bacteria has, in the form of vaginal probiotics. Sold in drugstores and online marketplaces and advertised on Instagram and in subway ads, many of these supplements (which can be taken orally or vaginally) claim to seed the vagina with friendly bacteria that can “restore feminine balance,” “prevent the intimate troubles” and “create an ideal environment for healthy microflora to flourish.” Many of these product’s claims are vague, but some are more bold in their advertising, promising to prevent or treat common vaginal problems like yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis. But do they actually work? Here’s what we know. HOW DOES THE VAGINAL ECOSYSTEM GET OUT OF WHACK? Think of the vaginal microbiome as a rainforest: a unique ecosystem teeming with microscopic life including bacteria, viruses and yeast. For many (though not all) premenopausal women, the dominant microbes are certain species of a bacterial group called Lactobacillus. Other members of this group live in the gut and ferment dairy products like yogurt and cheese. But the Lactobacillus in the vagina are special. They’ve likely adapted over thousands of years to digest sugars shed by vaginal cells and spew out lactic acid, creating a mildly acidic environment that is inhospitable to bacterial invaders. This helps form a crucial barrier between you and not-you, protecting your reproductive tract from infection and disease. Lots of things can disrupt vaginal Lactobacilli, including antibiotics, menstruation, douching, certain sexually transmitted infections and semen. When Lactobacilli numbers fall, other bacteria or yeast normally present in the vagina can overgrow, causing various types of imbalance. One of the most common states of imbalance is bacterial vaginosis — an ecosystem shift away from Lactobacillus and toward a diversity of other bugs that thrive in low-oxygen environments. Its tell-tale signs include itchiness around the vulva, a thin grey-white discharge and a “fishy” odour. B.V. can also make you more susceptible to S.T.I.s like chlamydia, gonorrhoea and H.I.V., and has been associated with preterm birth. Currently, antibiotics are the only recommended treatment for symptomatic B.V., but experts say they’re an imperfect solution. Like a forest fire, they tend to wipe out not only the infection, but most of the vagina’s microbial inhabitants, leading to an imbalance that can lead to future infections. Vaginal probiotics, their makers claim, could be a simple and effective alternative, adding “good” microbes and strengthening the ecosystem before or during an infection. SO ARE VAGINAL PROBIOTICS THE SOLUTION TO YEAST INFECTIONS AND B.V.? They might be in the future. But the pills and suppositories available today have not yet been proven to work. Based on what experts know, vaginal probiotics must satisfy two criteria to be effective: They should contain a vaginal strain, like Lactobacillus crispatus, that has been shown to protect against infection; and they should be inserted directly into the vagina. Most of the products on the market, however, don’t check both of those boxes. Many oral and suppository probiotics contain bacterial species cultivated from the gut or from fermented foods that aren’t natural inhabitants of the vagina. “Biologically, I don’t think it makes a whole lot of sense,” said Catriona Bradshaw, a sexual health expert at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, who researches bacterial vaginosis. And the majority of vaginal probiotics on the market are oral capsules, which studies suggest are unlikely to alter vaginal flora. That’s because the bacteria would have to make the treacherous journey down through the gut, out the anus and then crawl their way over to the vagina. “That is not happening,” said Jacques Ravel, a microbiologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine who studies the vaginal microbiome. (Dr. Ravel is also chief scientist at LUCA Biologics, a biotech company developing probiotics for B.V. and preterm birth.) A few products are meant to be taken vaginally — including FloraFemme vaginal probiotic suppositories (US$50 (S$69) for 6 capsules), VagiBiom suppositories ($66 for 30 suppositories) and Physioflor vaginal tablets ($27 for two tablets). Some, but not all, of the suppositories available contain the right strains. But a larger issue with both oral and suppository probiotics (and the wider supplement market in general), is that none of these products have undergone the rigorous safety and efficacy testing required for Food and Drug Administration approval. The studies that do exist generally have small sample sizes, lack control groups and are not blinded or randomized. “Most of these products don’t have the quality control that is required for actual pharmaceuticals,” Dr. Bradshaw said. “So you don’t really know what you’re putting in your mouth — or vagina, for that matter.” In a 2020 review of studies on 22 vaginal probiotics taken as suppositories, all were found to be safe. Some even showed promise in preventing and treating B.V. However, none of the strains stuck around the vagina for long, meaning they were unlikely to be beneficial in the long run. They also did not prevent yeast infections. “It just seems like such a great idea, right? It seems so logical,” Sharon Hillier, a microbiologist at Magee-Womens Research Institute who studies the vaginal microbiome and S.T.I.s., said of vaginal probiotics. “And yet study after study has failed to identify a real benefit for most of these products.” Dr. Carolyn Ross, an OB-GYN and medical adviser for Stix, a company that sells vaginal probiotics among other women’s health products, said in an email that while the evidence on vaginal probiotics is limited, published studies do suggest “a beneficial effect of probiotics on the prevention of bacterial vaginosis.” She cited two meta-analyses that did note beneficial effects, but also cautioned that large, high-quality studies “are urgently needed” before broad conclusions could be drawn. Bobban Subhadra, a microbiologist and chief executive of Biom Therapeutics, which makes vaginal probiotic suppositories, said that while his company has not yet published any studies on vaginal probiotic effectiveness, they have several in the works. Some researchers are hopeful that better studies will bear out the potential of vaginal probiotics. “I do think it’s an area of great promise,” said Dr. Janneke van de Wijgert, an infectious disease researcher at Utrecht University in the Netherlands and lead author of the 2020 review. “But we’re not there yet.” IS THERE ANYTHING I SHOULD TAKE OR DO TO ENSURE MY VAGINAL MICROBIOME IS HEALTHY? In the future, there may be research-backed ways to strengthen the vagina’s bacterial defenses, possibly by combining effective probiotics with antibiotics or even by performing vaginal microbiome transplants. But for now, experts simply don’t know enough about the vaginal microbiome to be able to reliably shift it in the direction of better health. So, while vaginal probiotics are unlikely to hurt you, they also aren’t likely to help you — whether you have an infection or not. And unless you’re actively ailing, the best way to maintain “optimal feminine balance” is also the simplest: Don’t do anything special. And certainly, don’t spend money on unproven treatments for your most intimate of landscapes. “Women have enough things in this world to worry about,” Dr. Hillier said. “The bottom line is that it’s the doorway to your reproductive tract. Treat it with respect and love it.” By Rachel E. Gross © 2022 The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/exercise-tips-sprain-ankle-injury-2662676,Prone to sprains? Here’s how you can avoid (and fix) a weak ankle,"When Chris Peterson sprained his ankle playing football in high school, he brushed it off as a minor injury. His ankle hurt for a couple days, but no one suggested he see a doctor, and soon enough, it felt better. “I got back to playing as soon as I could,” said Dr. Peterson, now a physical therapist at Washington University in St. Louis. However, although his ankle didn’t hurt, it just wasn’t the same afterward. “I’d step wrong, and my ankle just wasn’t there,” which often led to falls, he said. Sprained ankles are among the most common musculoskeletal injuries. Official estimates are that two million people in the U.S. sprain their ankle every year, but the real number is likely much higher, as many people never seek care for their injury. Although an ankle sprain may seem like a minor injury, suffering one leads to a much higher chance of doing it again. In a study of military cadets, those with a history of sprained ankles were 3.4 times more likely to sprain their ankle during the course of the study, compared with those with no history of sprained ankles. For an estimated 40 per cent of people, a sprained ankle can lead to chronic ankle instability, characterized by repeated rolling of the ankle, a general feeling of wobbliness and instability, and occasional pain, tenderness or swelling. If you’ve sprained your ankle in the past, that doesn’t mean that you are destined to go through life with an achy, wobbly joint, fearing the moment when it will give way. Experts recommend a number of exercises to strengthen the ankles, which in turn reduce the chances of sustaining a sprain, whether for the first time or the 10th. WHY MANY ANKLE INJURIES DON’T FULLY HEAL “The biggest reason people have recurrent ankle sprains is that they never do rehabilitation,” said Dr. Michael Fredericson, a sports physician at Stanford University. The ankle is a complicated patchwork of bones and ligaments stitched together, connecting the tibia and fibula of the leg to the delicate bones of the foot. It has to do a lot of work, bearing the full weight of the body while also bending and flexing in many directions. It’s this versatility, along with a constant workload, that makes fully recovering from an ankle injury so difficult and critical, since it’s very easy to reinjure an ankle. “There’s not a lot of room for error, particularly if you do sports,” Dr. Fredericson said. The key is exercise. In a recent meta-analysis of 14 randomized controlled trials, exercise-based interventions were more effective at reducing the risk of recurring sprains than usual care, which often consists of rest, ice, compression and elevation. “We do know that exercise therapy works,” said Jente Wagemans, a graduate student at the University of Antwerp and the lead author of the study. “We know that it is effective for the prevention of a secondary injury.” Even in the first few days after a sprain, it can help to move the ankle. Dr. Alysia Robichau, a sports physician at Houston Methodist Hospital, often recommends very light, non-weight-bearing activity, such as tracing the alphabet with the foot, in the days after a sprain. “That helps with gentle range of motion,” she said. SLOWLY STRENGTHENING THE ANKLE Once the ligament has started healing, which happens in the first few weeks after a sprain, the next step is weight-bearing exercise. Like bones and muscles, Mr. Wagemans explained, ligaments become stronger when you apply increasing amounts of force. Unlike bones, ankle ligaments need to be strengthened in multiple directions, because the joint is so mobile. One simple ankle-strengthening exercise is to loop a resistance band around the foot and attach it to something heavy, like a table leg. Then flex the foot forward, backward and sideways, aiming for three sets of 15 repetitions each. If you are trying to prevent ankle injuries, these exercises should be done three to four times a week. If you are recovering from a recent ankle sprain, any exercises should be under the guidance of a physical therapist, who will tailor them to the injury. THE RISK OF NERVE DAMAGE Every time you step on an uneven surface or have to place your foot quickly, tiny nerves in your ankle automatically help it remain steady rather than rolling or twisting. Think of them as the lane-assist feature in some cars, which make tiny steering corrections to avoid drift, Dr. Peterson said, except the nerves bring your ankle back to a neutral position. One major cause of wobbly ankles is when sprains also damage these corrective nerves. “Without that feedback system, you are more likely to roll your ankle again,” said Jeff Harvath, a physical therapist at Washington University in St. Louis. SINGLE-LEG BALANCING TO RETRAIN NERVES If your ankle feels wobbly or unstable or has a habit of rolling, you need to retrain the nerves in that area. “It’s about teaching the muscles and the ligaments to coordinate in the right ways,” Dr. Robichau said. One of the best ways to do this is a single-leg balance exercise. To start, balance on one leg, reaching out with your arms in different directions, aiming for one set of 20 repetitions. It’s important to use a lot of varied movements, such as reaching out for something with your hands, shifting your weight, closing your eyes or even standing on one leg while brushing your teeth. “The more real it seems, the more it transfers” to daily life, Dr. Peterson said. Once you are comfortable with this, incorporate an element of instability by balancing on a couch cushion, foam balance pad or Bosu ball. For an additional challenge, add a light weight or medicine ball. Another variation is the standing leg star tap. Balance on one foot and reach the other foot out in straight line, forward, to the sides and backward, in a clockwise pattern, aiming for two sets of 15 repetitions. STRONG MUSCLES TO SUPPORT YOUR ANKLES The muscles of your legs, ankles and feet also play an important role in ankle stability, which is why it’s important to strengthen them. Whenever your ankle joint gets pulled in the wrong direction, your ankle and calf muscles help pull it back. “We don’t want to rely on ligaments for everything,” Dr. Harvath said. This includes the muscles of our lower legs, which tilt our foot in, out, up and down. Strengthening these muscles can help compensate for weaknesses in the ligaments of the ankle. Dr. Harvath recommended lunges onto an unstable surface, such as a couch cushion, foam balance pad or Bosu ball. He recommended two sets of 15 repetitions for each leg. Another exercise for your calves and ankles is the standing heel raise, which can be done with a single leg or both legs. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Simply rise to your tiptoes, then lower your heels to the ground. Aim for three sets of 10 repetitions. If done regularly, these exercises can both prevent and help you recover from injury. As for Dr. Peterson, his ankle instability forced him to stop playing football and persisted for about 10 years. It was only when he went to school for physical therapy that he started his own ankle-strengthening exercise routine. Today, although the ligament in his ankle is still damaged, he has been able to compensate and create the stability he needs. He does all of his favourite activities, such as running marathons and rock climbing, without worrying about his ankle rolling. For many of the patients he sees, regaining strength and stability in their ankles is a matter of learning what exercises to do. “It’s often very simple,” he said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/feeling-sick-menstrual-cycle-symptoms-women-immune-system-2664711,Do you always feel sick before your period? Here’s why,"Does a woman’s immune system weaken at certain times of her menstrual cycle? I have always noticed that if I get sick, it’s almost always just before I get my period. Experts say that while there isn’t enough data to prove that you’re more likely to feel sick before or during your period, there are some hints that it is possible. Emerging research suggests that the immune system can fluctuate during this time, sometimes exacerbating underlying chronic disease symptoms or creating new ones that some women may mistake as signs of a new illness. Just before a period, for instance, some women report symptoms typically associated with the flu, like body aches, malaise and even fever. This so-called period flu isn’t caused by an actual pathogen, said Dr. Taraneh Shirazian, a gynaecologist at N.Y.U. Langone Health. But it can be the result of a person’s immune response to natural inflammation as the uterus cramps and sheds cells. “It’s how your body perceives the inflammation,” she said. Hormones may also be to blame for these symptoms, Dr. Shirazian said. Luteinizing hormone, or L.H., surges just before ovulation and then sharply drops when a period starts, she said. As L.H. levels shift, people can experience fatigue, bloating, headaches and nausea. “Some women go through this with really aggressive symptoms every cycle, every month,” Dr. Shirazian said. In a 2018 review in partnership with the period-tracking app Clue, researchers also noted that in women with certain underlying illnesses – like inflammatory bowel diseases, epilepsy and autoimmune disorders – symptoms associated with the illnesses sometimes worsened during ovulation, improved about a week later and worsened again during menstruation. This, said Sabra Klein, a microbiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, could be the result of seesawing hormones and immune system changes over the course of a period. Other research has found that between 19 and 40 per cent of women with asthma have reported more intense and frequent asthma flare-ups or attacks right before or during their periods. Perimenstrual asthma, as it’s called, has been linked to increases in asthma-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations, including intubations. Some small studies have also shown that women with multiple sclerosis reported worsening symptoms right before or during their periods. And patients with lupus have reported more pain and fatigue around their menstrual cycles. The evolutionary function of the menstrual cycle is to give women an opportunity to become pregnant, said Dr. Kimberly Keefe Smith, a ​reproductive endocrinologist and gynaecologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. When fertilization does occur, some parts of the immune system are suppressed so that the body does not reject the foetus. During the menstrual cycle, the ovaries secrete oestrogen and progesterone, which affect different branches of the immune system in different ways depending on the part of the body. Progesterone, in particular, can be an immunosuppressant when present at high levels in the body, like during pregnancy, Dr. Keefe Smith said. But oestrogen and progesterone alone can’t explain a weakened immune system, she added; patients who receive extra doses of the hormones during certain medical treatments or while on birth control, for example, are not more susceptible to feeling sick. Without definitive data, scientists can’t provide clear guidance on how women should think about their chances of feeling sick based on their cycles. “This has been grossly understudied,” Dr. Klein said. “I can’t really tell you if you’re more likely to get a cold or have infections, because the more detailed studies just haven’t been done.” While additional research is needed to better understand how the menstrual cycle influences disease susceptibility, she added that if you consistently find yourself feeling sick at a certain point in your cycle, don’t ignore it. You can take steps to protect your health leading up to your period: Make sure you’re eating a balanced diet, getting enough sleep and washing your hands for at least 20 seconds. “Every woman knows their body best,” Dr. Klein said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/covid-severe-icu-cognitive-mental-health-problems-long-2665401,Commentary: Severe COVID-19 may be as damaging to health as ageing 20 years,"LONDON: Severe COVID-19 results in cognitive impairment similar to that sustained between 50 and 70 years of age, and is the equivalent of losing 10 IQ points, our latest research shows. The effects are still detectable more than six months after the acute illness, and recovery is, at best, gradual. There is growing evidence that COVID-19 can cause lasting cognitive and mental health problems, with recovered patients reporting symptoms including fatigue, “brain fog”, problems recalling words, sleep disturbances, anxiety and even post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) months after infection. In the United Kingdom, a study found that around one in seven people surveyed reported having symptoms that included cognitive difficulties 12 weeks after a positive COVID-19 test. And a recent brain imaging study found that even mild COVID-19 can cause the brain to shrink. Only 15 of the 401 people in the study had been hospitalised. Incidental findings from a large citizen-science project (the Great British Intelligence Test) also showed that mild cases can lead to persistent cognitive symptoms. However, these problems appear to increase with the severity of the illness.  Indeed, it has been independently shown that between a third and three-quarters of hospitalised patients report suffering cognitive symptoms three to six months later. The magnitude of these problems, and the mechanisms that are responsible, remain unclear. Even before the pandemic, it was known that a third of people who have an episode of illness that requires ICU admission show objective cognitive deficits six months after admission. This is thought to be a consequence of the inflammatory response associated with critical illness, and the cognitive deficits seen in COVID-19 could well be a similar phenomenon. Yet there is evidence that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can infect brain cells. We cannot exclude direct viral infection of the brain. Other factors, such as hypoxia (low oxygen levels in the blood), may also have a role. It was also unclear whether the pervasive problems with psychological health reported after COVID-19 were part of the same problem as the objective cognitive deficits or represented a different phenomenon. To characterise the type and magnitude of these cognitive deficits, and better understand their relationship to disease severity in the acute phase and psychological health problems at later time points, we analysed data from 46 former COVID-19 patients.  They had all received in-hospital care, on the ward or ICU, for COVID-19 at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, England. The participants underwent detailed computerised cognitive tests an average of six months after their acute illness using the Cognitron platform. This assessment platform is designed to precisely measure different aspects of mental faculties such as memory, attention and reasoning and had been used in the above-mentioned citizen science study. We also measured levels of anxiety, depression and PTSD. The data from the study participants were compared with matched controls – people of the same sex, age and other demographic factors, but who weren’t hospitalised with COVID-19. COVID-19 survivors were less accurate and were slower to react than the matched controls. These deficits resolved slowly and were still detectable up to ten months after admission to the hospital.  The effects scaled with acute disease severity and markers of inflammation. They were strongest for those who required mechanical ventilation, but they were also substantial for those who did not. By comparing the patients to 66,008 members of the public, we were able to estimate that the magnitude of cognitive loss is similar on average to that sustained with 20 years of ageing, between 50 and 70 years of age. This is equivalent to losing 10 IQ points. The survivors scored particularly poorly on tasks such as “verbal analogical reasoning” (completing analogies, such as “laces are to shoes what buttons are to …”).  They also showed slower processing speeds, which aligns with previous observations post-COVID of decreased brain glucose consumption in key brain areas responsible for attention, complex problem-solving and working memory. While people who have recovered from severe COVID-19 can have a broad spectrum of symptoms of poor mental health – depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, low motivation, fatigue, low mood and disturbed sleep – these were not related to the objective cognitive deficits, suggesting different mechanisms. Direct viral infection is possible, but unlikely to be a major cause. Instead, it is more likely that a combination of factors contributes, including inadequate oxygen or blood supply to the brain, blockage of large or small blood vessels because of clotting, and microscopic bleeds. However, emerging evidence suggests that the most important mechanism may be damage caused by the body’s inflammatory response and immune system.  Anecdotal evidence from frontline doctors supports this inference that some neurological problems may have become less common since the widespread use of corticosteroids and other drugs that suppress the inflammatory response. Regardless of the mechanism, our findings have substantial public health implications. Around 40,000 people have been through intensive care with COVID-19 in England alone, and many more will have been admitted to hospital.  Many others may not have received hospital treatment despite severe illness due to the pressure on healthcare during peak pandemic waves. This means that there are many people out there who are still experiencing problems with cognition many months later. We urgently need to look at what can be done to help these people. Studies are now underway to address this issue. However, there is something of a silver lining. If, as we suspect, the picture we see in COVID-19 does indeed replicate the broader problem seen in other types of severe illness, this provides an opportunity to understand the mechanisms responsible and explore treatments.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/aphasia-stroke-dementia-early-signs-treatment-2650221,What is aphasia and how is it linked to dementia or stroke? What are the signs and who's prone to it?,"If it wasn’t for Bruce Willis’s diagnosis and his family’s subsequent announcement in March this year that the actor would be stepping away from acting, chances are, many people wouldn’t have been aware aware of the condition called aphasia. In Singapore, there was local playwright Lim Hai Yen, wife to Member of Parliament Baey Yam Keng, and the news she was also diagnosed with aphasia following a stroke. And she is not alone as seen in the recent CNA story about living with aphasia in Singapore. According to the Singapore Stroke Registry in 2019, about 3,000 new cases of aphasia are diagnosed every year. Non-profit organisation Aphasia SG, for instance, has about 160 patients and caregivers in its support group. But what exactly is aphasia and how is it different from other neurological issues such as dementia or stroke? Here’s an FAQ with the experts. WHAT IS APHASIA? Aphasia is a neurological condition that affects the parts of the brain that control language, explained Dr Chiew Hui Jin, a consultant with National Neuroscience Institute’s Department of Neurology. “This leads to difficulty with communication.” The damage is often on the left side of the brain, which is “important for understanding and producing language”, said Dr Emily Guo, a principal speech therapist at the Department of Rehabilitation at National University Hospital (NUH). “It can affect speaking, listening, reading and writing.” Aphasia’s causes can include stroke, brain tumour, traumatic brain injury, infections or inflammations of the brain, dementia or progressive neurological disorders, said Dr Guo, who is also an associate professor with the Singapore Institute of Technology's Health and Social Sciences cluster. ARE THERE DIFFERENT TYPES OF APHASIA? Generally, aphasia can be grouped into three main categories: Expressive, receptive and global aphasia, according to Dr Chiew.  “In expressive aphasia, the patient may have difficulty expressing himself and may speak in incomplete sentences, and experience difficulty in word-finding or writing,” he said.  Those with receptive aphasia may have difficulty with language comprehension. They may not be able to follow or understand conversations, or they may demonstrate a sudden inability to read. “A person with global aphasia typically has difficulty with all of the above functions,” he said.  However, this does not mean that the patient’s intellect is affected, according to Aphasia SG.  HOW IS APHASIA LINKED TO STROKE? A stroke occurs when something blocks the blood supply to a part of the brain or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts. In both instances, the brain cells can’t get their supply of oxygen and start to die within minutes, leading to what we know as a stroke.  It goes to stand that if the blockage or rupture occurs in the brain’s left hemisphere, where the language centre sits, it can cause aphasia. In fact, one third of all stroke survivors suffer from aphasia, according to Aphasia SG. HOW IS APHASIA DIFFERENT FROM DEMENTIA? CAN BOTH CONDITIONS OCCUR AT THE SAME TIME? Dementia is a neurological disease that affects a person's cognitive functions, of which language and memory are examples, explained Dr Chong Yao Feng, an associate consultant at NUH’s Division of Neurology.  However, “the most common cognitive function to be lost in dementia is memory rather than language”, he said. “This is why the layperson’s common picture of dementia is that of an elderly person who is forgetful.” But can there be a link between dementia and aphasia? According to Dr Guo, dementia involves brain degeneration in multiple parts of the brain. “If the language areas are impacted, aphasia will occur as well.”  As for how frequently that co-occurrence happens, Dr Chong noted that he sees about three out of 100 patients with dementia, based on his clinical experience. “I would qualitatively say that aphasia is not commonly seen in the early stages of dementia. But as the dementia progresses to later stages, aphasia becomes common.” The link between dementia and aphasia is also more pronounced in primary progressive aphasia (PPA), which is a specific type of dementia, said Dr Chong. “PPA is very different from the other types of dementia in that it presents with aphasia in the early stages.” He is not aware of statistics but commented that PPA is rare in Singapore.  WHO IS PRONE TO DEVELOPING APHASIA? WHAT ARE THE EARLY SIGNS AND RISK FACTORS? “There is no typical patient profile as it depends on the cause of aphasia. If the cause is due to stroke and degenerative diseases, the risk increases with age,” said Dr Guo. In instances where aphasia is caused by a stroke or traumatic brain injury, there is no early warning sign that we can look out for, she said. “Aphasia’s onset is sudden and acute in these cases.”  If aphasia is caused by degenerative conditions such as dementia, the early signs may include difficulty in following conversations and finding the right words to express themselves, said Dr Guo. Such aphasia can deteriorate over time.  Added Dr Chong, the common causes of aphasia in Singapore are probably stroke and dementia. “Technically speaking, we can say that the ‘typical profile’ of a patient with aphasia is the same as the typical profile of someone who has stroke or dementia,” he said.  WHAT ARE THE ISSUES THAT PATIENTS FACE FROM NOT BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE AS WELL AS BEFORE? Evelyn Khoo, the founder of Aphasia SG as well as a speech and language therapist, said that many aspects of the patient’s life are affected, including his career, which “can affect their sense of self-identity”.  Patients may also experience a loss of independence and sense of social isolation, she added. Activities that the patient used to be able to carry out on his own may now have to be done with the help of family members.  “I have witnessed first-hand the struggles my patients with aphasia experience doing everyday tasks like using WhatsApp or buying food at the hawker centre,” said Khoo. “Once, a hawker even raised her voice at my patient, who had difficulty ordering his food.” And when friends and loved ones do not understand the condition, the aphasia sufferer may feel socially isolated, she said. “Family members are often at a loss and struggle to communicate with their loved one who has the condition. In fact, 93 per cent of aphasia patients suffer from psychological distress and depression as a result of the loss of independence and social isolation within the first six months of their stroke.  “Coupled with the fact that most mental health support relies heavily on communication, the person will find it difficult to seek psycho-emotional treatment,” said Khoo. WHAT CAN PATIENTS DO TO RECOVER? Speech and language therapy are key, said Dr Chiew. The recovery process depends on the cause of the aphasia, he said. In instances where the cause is stroke, traumatic brain injury or a brain tumour, the aphasia may “stabilise or even improve with treatment and time”.  “In aphasia caused by stroke, there can be some improvement in language, speech and communication over time aided by speech therapy,” said Dr Chiew. “However, in PPA, a neurodegenerative illness with similarities to dementia, there is no known cure for this currently.” To help aphasia patients gain confidence to communicate with strangers or in groups, Aphasia SG has two programmes: Chit Chat Cafe and Aphasia SG Choir. “Our volunteers are trained to support and facilitate conversations for adults with aphasia, so that even those with severe impairment will feel included,” said Khoo, although she qualifies that these sessions do not constitute speech therapy and do not replace one-on-one therapy.  “Speech therapy is customised to the needs of the individual. (The Chit Chat Cafe) is additional support for those who want more practice and wish to get to know others facing similar struggles.” As for the benefits of singing, Khoo explained that “Music and rhythm activate the uninjured right hemisphere of their brains to facilitate verbal expression”.  Are certain music genres more helpful than others? “I am not sure if a certain musical genre is superior, but our songs are selected by music therapists and musical volunteers based on the preferences of our participants with aphasia,” she said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/artificial-sweeteners-increased-cancer-risk-stevia-aspartame-2591856,"Commentary: Not all sweeteners are equal, some may increase the risk of cancer","BIRMINGHAM, United Kingdom: Sweeteners have long been suggested to be bad for our health. Studies have linked consuming too many sweeteners with conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. But links with cancer have been less certain. An artificial sweetener, called cyclamate, that was sold in the United States in the 1970s was shown to increase bladder cancer in rats. However, human physiology is very different from rats, and observational studies failed to find a link between the sweetener and cancer risk in humans. Despite this, the media continued to report a link between sweeteners and cancer. But now, a study published in PLOS Medicine, which looked at over 100,000 people, has shown that those who consume high levels of some sweeteners have a small increase in their risk of developing certain types of cancer. To assess their intake of artificial sweeteners, the researchers asked the participants to keep a food diary. Around half of the participants were followed for more than eight years. The study reported that aspartame and acesulfame K, in particular, were associated with increased cancer risk - especially breast and obesity-related cancers, such as colorectal, stomach and prostate cancers. This suggests that removing some types of sweeteners from your diet may reduce the risk of cancer. Many common foods contain sweeteners. These food additives mimic the effect of sugar on our taste receptors, providing intense sweetness with no or very few calories. Some sweeteners occur naturally (such as stevia or yacon syrup). Others, such as aspartame, are artificial. Although they have few or no calories, sweeteners still have an effect on our health. For example, aspartame turns into formaldehyde (a known carcinogen) when the body digests it. This could potentially see it accumulate in cells and cause them to become cancerous. Our cells are hard-wired to self-destruct when they become cancerous. But aspartame has been shown to “switch off” the genes that tell cancer cells to do this. Other sweeteners, including sucralose and saccharin, have also been shown to damage DNA, which can lead to cancer. But this has only been shown in cells in a dish rather than in a living organism. Sweeteners can also have a profound effect on the bacteria that live in our gut. Changing the bacteria in the gut can impair the immune system, which could mean they no longer identify and remove cancerous cells. But it’s still unclear from these animal and cell-based experiments precisely how sweeteners initiate or support cancerous changes to cells. Many of these experiments would also be difficult to apply to humans because the amount of sweetener was given at much higher doses than a human would ever consume. The results from previous research studies are limited, largely because most studies on this subject have only observed the effect of consuming sweeteners without comparing against a group that hasn’t consumed any sweeteners. A recent systematic review of almost 600,000 participants even concluded there was limited evidence to suggest heavy consumption of artificial sweeteners may increase the risk of certain cancers. A review in the BMJ came to a similar conclusion. Based on current evidence, it’s generally agreed that using artificial sweeteners is associated with increased body weight - though researchers aren’t quite certain whether sweeteners directly cause this to happen. Although this recent study took people’s body mass index into account, it’s possible that changes in body fat may have contributed to the development of many of these types of cancers - not necessarily the sweeteners themselves. Although the findings of this recent study certainly warrant further research, it’s important to acknowledge the study’s limitations. First, food diaries can be unreliable because people aren’t always honest about what they eat or they may forget what they have consumed. Although this study collected food diaries every six months, there’s still a risk people weren’t always accurately recording what they were eating and drinking. Though the researchers partially mitigated this risk by having participants take photos of the food they ate, people still might not have included all the foods they ate. Finally, the risk of developing cancer in those who consumed the highest levels of artificial sweeteners compared with those who consumed the lowest amounts was modest - with only 13 per cent higher relative risk of developing cancer in the study period. So although people who consumed the highest amounts of sweetener had an increased risk of developing cancer, this was still only slightly higher than those with the lowest intake. While the link between sweetener use and diseases, including cancer, is still controversial, it’s important to note that not all sweeteners are equal. While sweeteners such as aspartame and saccharin may be associated with ill health, not all sweeteners are. Stevia, produced from the Stevia rebaudiana plant, has been reported to be useful in controlling diabetes and body weight, and may also lower blood pressure. The naturally occurring sugar alcohol, xylitol, may also support the immune system and digestion. Both stevia and xylitol have also been shown to protect from tooth decay, possibly because they kill bad oral bacteria. So the important choice may be not the amount of sweetener you eat but the type you use. James Brown is Associate Professor in Biology and Biomedical Science at the Aston University.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/can-certain-foods-really-stave-dementia-and-preserve-brain-health-2646806,Can certain foods really stave off dementia and preserve brain health?,"Walnuts can improve cognitive function. Blueberries can boost memory. Fish oil supplements can lower your risk of Alzheimer’s disease. You may have noticed these buzzy “brain food” claims scattered across online health articles and social media feeds. But can certain foods or diets really stave off or prevent dementia? Experts say that while nutrition studies are notoriously challenging to carry out, there is a compelling and ever-growing body of research that does suggest that some foods and diets may offer real benefits to an ageing brain. So we spoke with two dozen researchers and pored over the research to better understand the links between diet and dementia. FOUR PILLARS OF A ‘BRAIN-BOOSTING’ DIET Scientists don’t yet know for certain what causes Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia. And there is currently no medication that can reverse it, said Dr Uma Naidoo, the director of nutritional and metabolic psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital and the author of This Is Your Brain on Food. “But,” she said, “we can impact how we eat.” Research shows that people with certain conditions like heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes are more likely than those without such conditions to experience age-related cognitive decline. And the risks of developing those conditions can be increased by poor diet and a lack of exercise, suggesting there are things you can do to lower the chances of developing dementia, Dr Naidoo said.
  Two diets in particular, the Mediterranean diet and the MIND diet – both of which encourage fresh produce, legumes and nuts, fish, whole grains and olive oil – have been shown in scientific studies to offer strong protection against cognitive decline. One study, published in 2017, analysed the diets and cognitive performance of more than 5,900 older US adults. Researchers found that those who most closely adhered to either the Mediterranean diet or the MIND diet had a 30 to 35 per cent lower risk of cognitive impairment than those who adhered to these diets less closely. “Pretty much anything that will help keep arteries healthy will reduce risk of dementia,” said Dr Walter Willett, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health. And Dr Ronald Petersen, a neurologist and the director of the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, agreed:“What’s good for the heart is good for the brain.” LEAFY GREENS One big change you can make to your diet, Dr Naidoo said, is to “up your plant game.” Leafy greens are packed with nutrients and fibre, and some solid evidence has linked them with slower age-related cognitive decline. In one randomised controlled trial performed in Israel and published this year, for instance, researchers took brain scans of more than 200 people who had been split into three diet groups. They found that after 18 months, those who followed a “green” Mediterranean diet – one rich in Mankai (a nutrient-packed green plant), green tea and walnuts – had the slowest rate of age-related brain atrophy. Those who followed a traditional Mediterranean diet were close behind. Those who followed regular healthy diet guidelines –which was less plant-based and allowed for more processed and red meat than the other two diets – had greater declines in brain volume. These neuroprotective effects were especially pronounced in people 50 and older. COLOURFUL FRUITS AND VEGETABLES The more colorful the produce on your plate, the better the food usually is for your brain, several experts said. In one 2021 observational study, researchers followed more than 77,000 people for about 20 years. They found that those with diets high in flavonoids – natural substances found in colourful fruits and vegetables, chocolate and wine – were less likely than those who consumed fewer flavonoids to report signs of cognitive ageing. The MIND diet specifically points to berries, good sources of fibre and antioxidants, as having cognitive benefits. One study published in 2012 looked at more than 16,000 people aged 70 and older for more than a dozen years. It concluded that older women who ate more blueberries and strawberries had delayed rates of cognitive decline: Perhaps by up to 2.5 years. “I don’t think there are miracle foods, but, of course, it’s really good to eat the fruits and vegetables,” said Dr Allison Reiss, a member of the medical, scientific and memory screening advisory board at the Alzheimer’s Foundation of America. FISH Many types of seafood, in particular fatty fish, are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which have been long associated with better brain health and reduced risk of age-related dementia or cognitive decline. “Fish is brain food,” said Dr Mitchel Kling, the director of the memory assessment program at the New Jersey Institute for Successful Aging at the Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine. One specific omega-3 fatty acid – docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA – found in cold-water, fatty fish, like salmon, is “the most prevalent brain fat,” said Lisa Mosconi, the director of the Alzheimer’s Prevention Program at Weill Cornell Medicine. Our bodies cannot make enough DHA on their own, Dr Mosconi said. “We have to provide it from the diet, which is a strong argument toward eating fish.” According to Dr Willett, about two to three servings per week will provide “virtually all the benefit.” NUTS, WHOLE GRAINS, LEGUMES AND OLIVE OIL Nuts and seeds have been repeatedly linked to slower cognitive decline. In one 2021 review of 22 studies on nut consumption involving nearly 44,000 people, researchers found that those at high risk of cognitive decline tended to have better outcomes if they ate more nuts – specifically walnuts. However, the authors acknowledged some inconsistency among the studies and inconclusive evidence. Another study, published in 2014, looked at about 16,000 women ages 70 and up between 1995 and 2001. Researchers found that women who said they consumed at least five servings of nuts per week had better cognitive scores than those who did not eat nuts. Whole grains, as well as legumes, like lentils and soybeans, also appear to have benefits for heart health and cognitive function. In one 2017 study of more than 200 people in Italy aged 65 and older, researchers found an association between consuming three servings of legumes per week and higher cognitive performance. And olive oil, a main component of both the Mediterranean and MIND diets, has strong links with healthy cognitive aging. One 2022 study of more than 92,000 US adults found that higher intakes of olive oil were associated with a 29 per cent lower risk of dying from neurodegenerative disease – and 8 per cent to 34 per cent lower risk of mortality overall – when compared with those who never or rarely consumed olive oil. DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS MAY HAVE LITTLE EFFECT According to the experts we spoke with, there is little to no evidence that dietary supplements – including fatty acids, vitamin B or vitamin E – will reduce cognitive decline or dementia. “Supplements cannot replace a healthy diet,” Dr Mosconi said. One major study of about 3,500 older adults, for instance, concluded that taking omega-3 supplements, which are often marketed as supporting brain health, did not slow cognitive decline. When it comes to supplements like fish oil, Dr Willett said, you don’t need to “load up like a seal.” Instead, Dr Petersen, of the Mayo Clinic, said, remember this pithy adage:“If it comes from a plant, eat it. If it’s made in a plant, don’t eat it.” By Amelia Nierenberg © 2022 The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/pandemic-related-increase-foot-pain-2653996,'Pandemic foot': Staying home and inactivity have been hard on our feet,"In March of 2020, Krista Fahs began working from home. As she sidled up to her desk, the 53-year-old sales associate for a computer distributor put aside her usual sneakers. She found herself doing laundry, playing with her cat and even visiting neighbours without putting on shoes. “I was barefoot all the time,” she said. A few months into working from home, she began to feel a twinge of heel pain, but disregarded it until last month, when it got too intense to ignore. Even as she lay in bed, the throbbing wouldn’t stop. “‘This is ridiculous,’” she remembered thinking, “I didn’t even know how I was going to fall asleep.” The beginning of the pandemic coincided with a steep decline in foot trauma, said Dr Robert K Lee, chief of podiatric foot and ankle surgery at UCLA Santa Monica Medical Center, but his practice quickly repopulated with patients like Ms Fahs who complained about foot pain. “I was like, ‘Aha, so this is the effect of the pandemic on feet across the country,’” he said. There is no hard data on the increase in foot pain, but Dr James Christina, the executive director of the American Podiatric Medical Association, said it’s been a clear trend for many of his 12,000 members. Members like Dr Rock Positano, the co-director of the Non-surgical Foot and Ankle Service at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, who has seen foot pain increase so much – 20 to 30 per cent – that he called the phenomenon “pandemic foot.” Now that spring is here, mandates are relaxing and people are eager to get their prepandemic bodies and hobbies back, they are hitting the pavement, said Dr James Hanna, a podiatrist and president of the New York State Podiatric Medical Association. Many are exacerbating existing foot injuries or creating new ones. “People thought they could just return to where they left off or try something they hadn’t tried in a couple years,” he said, “but their feet aren’t prepared for what their bodies want to do.” By instituting a few simple measures, Dr Hanna assures owners of achy feet everywhere that foot pain can be alleviated as well as prevented.
  OVERUSE INJURIES Some of the most common foot ailments occur simply because the foot is under increased strain during the pandemic. Perhaps you opted to walk long distances instead of use public transportation or went barefoot at home. “People don’t realise how much mileage they put on walking and standing in their houses,” Dr Positano said. Ms Fahs was diagnosed with one such overuse injury, plantar fasciitis, where the ligament under the foot that supports the arch becomes inflamed, often felt as pain in the heel. “I knew what it was because my brother, sister and one of my best friends all got it recently, too,” she said. Metatarsalgia is another overuse injury, similarly caused by inflammation, but in the toe joints, which causes pain in the ball of the foot. For those starting ambitious running routines right out of the pandemic gates, Achilles’ tendinitis has been a common diagnosis. The tendon connects the calf muscle to the heel bone and with a sudden increase in use, it can become irritated and swell. These injuries can impact more than foot health. If they are not addressed, they can “go up the chain,” and cause knee, hip and back pain. “People think they are falling apart, but they are not,” Dr Positano said. “They are overusing their feet.” FRAGILE FEET Overuse injuries aren’t the only reasons people have been feeling foot pain lately. Dr Priya Parthasarathy, a Maryland-based podiatric surgeon, has also seen an uptick in toe and foot fractures. Some are caused, she said, by accidentally kicking furniture – a result of being home and barefoot more often – and tripping and falling awkwardly over pets. “You see one, then you see two, then three and then four,” she said of such pet-related fractures, “and you’re like, ‘Wait, there’s definitely a connection here.’” SPREADING TOES Meanwhile, Dr Judith F Baumhauer, an orthopedic surgeon at University of Rochester Medical Center, has been removing more bunions, which are bony protrusions at the base of the big toe. Without supportive shoes, the foot can splay – actually widen – and the anatomical structures can change. Among other issues, this can aggravate bunions. “They let their feet do whatever they wanted,” Dr Baumhauer said, “and now that they have to go back to work, their feet are rebelling.” MORE WEIGHT ON THE FOOT Dr Baumhauer said that pandemic weight gain may also be to blame for the rise in foot discomfort. She explained that even an extra couple of pounds makes an impact. “It’s literally just physics,” she said, explaining that the foot takes on four times the force of our body weight when walking. Losing or gaining five pounds would be a change of “20 pounds to their ankle and foot,” she said. TOO MUCH TOO FAST Jacqueline M Dylla, an associate professor of clinical physical therapy at the University of Southern California, said one of the biggest triggers is people doing too much too fast. Many of us have undergone atrophy and bone density loss from inactivity without noticing it, making it harder to stabilise ourselves on uneven surfaces. “Smaller injuries are causing more catastrophic problems,” she said. “I have patients who look like they were in a car accident,” she added, “but they just rolled their ankle during a hike.” Even young children, after a year or two doing virtual school, are experiencing issues as they jump headlong into sports. “You have a kid sitting at home every day for a year going straight into cross-country practice,” Dr Parthasarathy said. HOW TO HELP YOUR FEET Podiatrists say one of the fixes for foot pain can be quite simple: Wear supportive footwear. That means a semirigid sole, a spacious toe box and a small heel lift. Get properly fitted at a shoe store and, if you don’t want street shoes in your home, get a pair specifically for use indoors. If using older shoes, be sure that the tread is not too worn, as those may have degraded too much to offer substantial support. Insoles can also be added for additional arch support. Ms Dylla said it’s also essential to prepare our bodies for renewed activity by strengthening them first. This means exercising the feet with toe curls and foot doming. “There’s a crunch for the stomach,” Ms Dylla said, “doming is the crunch for the foot.” Dr Hanna said the best advice may be to start slow. “If you’re going to start walking, do moderate pace at short distance,” he said. “If you tolerate that well, maybe go at a faster pace for longer distance.” Podiatrists also say stretching is crucial to prevent and treat unhappy feet. “A proper warm-up,” Dr Hanna said, “I cannot emphasise this enough.” In the morning, even before going to the bathroom, Dr Hanna recommends flexing your feet by pulling your toes up toward your body. Then pretend your toes are a pencil and write out the alphabet. “If you do that,” he said, “you’ll activate all the joints and be much less likely to injure yourself.” Even though the calf seems distant from the bottom of the foot, stretching it plays an essential role in pain-free walking. “When your calf and Achilles are tight,” Dr Lee said, it “creates a lot more stress to all your foot joints.” He suggests getting into a lunge position with one foot in front of the other, your hands up against a wall and your feet flat on the ground. You should feel the stretch in the calf of the back leg. He suggests doing this several times throughout the day. Massaging the arch area can also prevent injury by keeping the bottom of our feet limber. Dr Lee advises grabbing a tennis ball or golf ball while sitting at a desk or while watching TV. “Roll your foot over the ball and massage into that area to loosen up those fibres,” he said. However, if you are having heel pain, get your foot checked by a doctor before stretching. In some cases, Dr Positano said, there can be undiagnosed tears in the plantar fascia that stretching can worsen. If you are experiencing any persistent foot pain, book an appointment with a podiatrist. There are many simple ways doctors can relieve pain and prevent chronic issues from developing. If you’re in discomfort, “seek care,” Dr Baumhauer said, “because there are a lot of tricks up our sleeves.” By Mara Altman © 2022 The New York TimesThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/five-friday-covid-19-rules-miss-safe-distancing-work-home-2652831,Five on Friday: 5 pandemic precautions that some of us may miss,"SINGAPORE: Like many people, I’ve long dreamt of the day that we could go back to ""normal"" after more than two years of pandemic limbo. No more SafeEntry check-ins or COVID-19 swabs before travel! Once my initial excitement died down, however, I realised that I may not have mentally prepared myself for this brave new world. Singapore on Apr 26 reached this ""major milestone"" and moved ahead with its most significant relaxation of COVID-19 measures yet.  And although I know the eased restrictions will go a long way towards getting life back on track and boosting ailing businesses, I will have to admit that it feels just slightly bittersweet.  After years of having COVID-19 anxiety engraved into me and informing most of my life decisions and daily habits, some things might take a little getting used to again.  We've all had to look over our shoulder to spot the safe distancing ambassador who had the unenviable task of reminding us to keep a 1m distance from another group. But having a claim over maintaining a bubble of personal space is something that most of us probably already miss.  Let me jolt your memory. Prior to pandemic precautions, you may have been packed in like sardines in exercise studios where strangers would be within reach of rogue elbows and flying sweat.  Peak shopping hours - hello Orchard Road on a weekend - and special events were also guaranteed mosh pit situations, sometimes leading to flared tempers and even jail time. While scrapping the safe-distancing rule is a much needed move for the many businesses that were hit hard by COVID-19, it'll take some time for us to adjust back to sharing our space.   Am I ready to sit shoulder to shoulder with other patrons when I dine out, close enough to hear every chew or hem of their throat? Or share armrest real estate in a cinema? Deep breath.  The pandemic has forever changed the way we think about where and how we work. While it took most of us some time in the early days of the outbreak to get used to a work from home setup - screaming kids and fiddling with Zoom backgrounds - we soon learnt to cope.  Up to a third of those recently polled by the Institute of Policy Studies felt that working from home on most days should be the new norm. But there are certainly clear benefits to logging in-person hours with your colleagues. This includes fostering closer bonds, communicating clear instructions and a quick gossip over some pantry snacks. However, you cannot deny the convenience of dodging the morning rush hour and working in your pyjamas.  Have you embraced the return to the office?  While queueing still remains Singapore’s unofficial sport, the pandemic has forced us to take a more virtual approach.  Stores and entertainment venues were quick to adapt, managing human traffic through booking systems in order to stagger arrivals.  Many eateries also pivoted away from exclusive ""walk-ins only"" policies in favour of reservations in order to avoid overcrowding and snaking lines.  Sure, it was a little more difficult to be spontaneous, but the trade-off meant guaranteeing your spot in advance without the need to anxiously wait around. Will the relaxed measures herald a return to normalising physical queues once again? Prior to COVID-19, I remember catching the office flu once every few months. It would start with a small sneeze from the corner of the office. Then gradually my colleagues, one after the other, including myself would succumb. But nearly everyone I know reported falling sick less often when mask-wearing was mandatory both indoors and outdoors. Hand washing and a keener eye for hygiene also contributed to this. Health Ministry data showed a steep decline in confirmed influenza cases at polyclinics and general practitioners shortly after the ""circuit breaker"" period, when safety measures were at their tightest. Civic-minded individuals were also quick to self-isolate when feeling unwell, quickly cutting off the chain of virus transmission. While mask-wearing is now optional in outdoor settings and in some situations in the workplace, thankfully we're also now more mindful to keep a mask on when unwell.  ""I'm sorry but I don't think we should meet because there's a spike in COVID-19 community cases.""  It will now be harder to hide behind the good excuse of COVID-19 the next time you want to duck out of a social engagement. The pandemic did help us to normalise being homebodies and saying no, hunkering down and cancelling meet-ups at the slightest sign of a sniffle. We are being responsible, right? But with the lifting of the 10-pax limits for gatherings, several of my friends have also sheepishly admitted that they will no longer be able to dodge attending one too many weddings. A few have also said they can no longer avoid their relatives during festive occasions like Chinese New Year.  Raise your hand if you too are guilty of this.  To all those who enjoy a good gathering, I am happy for you. But as a representative of couch potatoes everywhere, if there's something the last two years has taught me, it's that it's ok to say NO. I’ll stay at home for a little longer.  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-insider/why-healthcare-workers-singapore-hospitals-resignations-2647746,Why some healthcare workers in Singapore’s hospitals have quit — and others soldier on,"*Names have been changed.  SINGAPORE: It was early 2021. Lisa*, then a senior staff nurse at a public hospital in Singapore, received news that her father had contracted COVID-19 in Malaysia amid the Delta wave. She would have gone home straight away, but her nurse manager’s response to her leave request shocked her. “She told me that with the manpower shortage, I shouldn’t be so selfish and (should consider) my other colleagues,” said the Malaysian in her 30s who had worked here for 12 years at that point. The hospital relented only when she said she would quit. She considers herself “very lucky” that she was granted a month’s no-pay leave: Eventually, her father’s condition deteriorated, and he needed intensive care. “The saddest part about being in healthcare is when you spend so much time taking care of patients and their families, but you end up neglecting your own,” she said. CNA Insider could not get the hospital to verify her account without identifying her. But she said it was the last straw in a series of events that had “drained” her. She realised that the long shift hours and lack of rest was taking a physical and mental toll. She left the hospital last August but is still in public healthcare: At a polyclinic, where she works more regular hours. She is only the tip of the iceberg. In November, the Ministry of Health (MOH) released statistics showing that about 1,500 healthcare workers resigned in the first half of last year, compared with 2,000 annually before the pandemic. Last month, Senior Minister of State (Health) Koh Poh Koon elaborated on these numbers in Parliament: In 2019, the overall attrition in the healthcare workforce was 9.6 per cent. It dipped to 6.8 per cent in 2020, but then the two-year average attrition reached 9.8 per cent last year. Two of the public healthcare clusters approached by CNA Insider did not share their attrition rate. The third, the National Healthcare Group (NHG), said last year’s rate was “higher than pre-COVID periods (2018 and 2019)” but “manageable”. But even as the Omicron wave wanes, healthcare workers CNA Insider spoke to say manpower shortage remains a concern. More than 20 nurses, doctors and allied healthcare workers were interviewed and spoke on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorised to speak to the media. About half of them had left their jobs in public and private acute hospitals or have tendered their resignation. When James*, a mid-career nurse in a public hospital, tendered his resignation in January, he realised that at least five colleagues from his renal ward had done the same that month. Another nurse from the ward, whom CNA Insider spoke to, corroborated this. The departures this year were “more pronounced” than last year, he felt. “(With) the third year of the pandemic, I guess most of them had enough. There was uncertainty over when their next break would come.” A speech therapist in another public hospital said she has not seen this number of resignations in her 10 years there: This year alone, seven people in her department left, though not all owing to burnout or stress, she noted. “Usually, about three, maximum four, people leave in a year,” she said. Senior pharmacist Dean*, who has been in a public hospital setting for four years, said that in his section of about 150 staff, the resignations are most notable among pharmacy technicians. They number more than pharmacists and assist with pharmacy operations such as dispensing of medication and inventory-related matters. About 30 to 40 per cent of them, mostly foreigners, left between the end of last year and early this year during the height of the Omicron wave, when the impact of departures was most acute, he said. Pharmacists like himself had to fill the gaps. “Pre-COVID, if people left, (the hospital) would just hire people from overseas to replace them, so nobody really felt the pain. But with COVID and the borders closed, it wasn’t so easy to plug the holes,” he added. For David*, a nurse in the emergency department with 10 years’ experience, the fact that experienced workers are quitting is a deeper concern than the numbers alone. His colleague, Yvette*, agreed. “The need to retrain new nurses — which takes time — will increase the burden on the experienced ones, which gives these remaining experienced nurses even more of a push factor for leaving, like a vicious circle,” said the emergency doctor. The mental health of healthcare workers has recently been a topic of concern across different platforms, from social media posts to authored studies. In late February, an Instagram post from @thehonesthealthcareworker on how nurses were “not coping well” did the rounds. It said that the healthcare system was on a “slow road to collapse”, that working conditions have “worsened significantly” with no increase in practical support and that many workers were leaving. The nurse-patient ratio has also increased “from 1:6 to 1:12 or more”, wrote the author, who later told CNA Insider he saw this happening in his hospital — although this could not be verified officially. A study published in the same month by the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, Tan Tock Seng Hospital and the National Centre for Infectious Diseases highlighted the burnout brought on by overwork, emotional exhaustion and inability to take adequate leave as a “morale breaker” among healthcare workers. There may also be pull factors at work, particularly among foreign nurses who may be attracted to other countries. According to MOH figures in Dr Koh’s parliamentary speech, last year’s attrition rate among foreign nurses was 14.8 per cent, double the 7.4 per cent among local nurses. As the Omicron wave wanes and Singapore regains a semblance of normality, is there respite in sight to stem the flow, particularly for healthcare workers in acute hospitals? It may not be a given. “It was never only about the pandemic,” said Tina*, a former senior staff nurse in her 30s who left her post in a renal ward at a public hospital. “This pandemic only brought more attention to healthcare workers and the issues we face at work.” Sunlight. That was the first thing that came to mind for Lisa when asked what marks her polyclinic job out from her previous one in an acute stroke unit. “You’re always in the building throughout the day. You don’t get to see the little, simple things that tell you it’s going to be a good day,” she said, tears welling in her eyes at the memories. She also worked night shifts (9pm to 8am). For every three of these shifts, she used to get a “sleeping day” to readjust her body clock, on top of her regular days off. But this was removed even before COVID-19. “You didn’t get to rest and recharge before your next shift starts,” she said. She often worked overtime. As a senior staff nurse, she oversaw 12 to 14 patients and had to manage complaints. She was also a clinical instructor mentoring nursing students. Today, she often leaves work at 5.30pm. Her mood is “much better”, and she is “energised” for the day, she said. Besides polyclinics, other job options for nurses include dialysis centres, nursing agencies, community nursing in long-term care settings like hospices, and lecturing in polytechnics or the Institute of Technical Education. While facilities like HCA Hospice and the National Kidney Foundation Singapore said the number of nurses joining them has been “stable” over the past few years, three nursing agencies that recruit on a freelance basis cited an increase in applications. Carelink Home Nursing Services estimated the increase at 40 per cent, compared with before the pandemic. Common reasons include flexible working schedules and more balanced pace of work, as well as higher compensation and recognition, said agency director Vikki Tan. At caregiving start-up Homage, nurses can take up stints in various settings, whether in a home, community hospital or a facility. This is what James the mid-career nurse has done, citing the ability to have “more control” over his work. “I try to achieve a bit more work-life balance … If I need more money, I’ll take on more jobs,” said James, who now also works at a private clinic. This contrasts with his experience in a COVID-19 ward, where he was deployed in the early days of the pandemic and during the Delta and Omicron surges. At one point, he was taking care of eight to 10 patients — his previous “worst-case scenario” was six to seven patients. After months of “repetitive” work and “this vicious cycle of non-stop working”, he reached “breaking point”, he said. If this trend for nurses going to nursing agencies continues, there is cause for concern, said Associate Professor Jeremy Lim of the National University of Singapore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. “Staffing becomes more difficult and expensive, which cascades into higher costs for patients and, potentially, safety issues due to staff turnover and unfamiliarity,” he said. Higher pay outside public hospitals was a strong pull factor for some. Farez*, a staff nurse who left a general ward last August for a private dialysis clinic, said he is earning more while the workload is less. “(People who quit) don’t feel like they were paid for the amount that they worked,” he said. Occupational therapist Ryan*, who left public healthcare last month after six and a half years of service, was offered a 20 per cent pay increase in the private sector. He was also told he would be “chased home at 5.45pm”. “I now see about 10 patients a day. I get to spend quality time with them. I’m able to relate better, understand their needs more thoroughly and assist them throughout the recovery process so much more,” he added. Before he made the switch, his daily case numbers during the pandemic had risen to about “19 to 20”, as there were more elderly patients whose physical function “fell quite a bit” after they contracted COVID-19.   There are others who have quit just to rest. One of them is Tina, who has eight years’ experience. She said her patients’ growing demands, especially during the pandemic, had drained her. For example, when visits were not allowed, her ward provided video calls as an “extra service” — which, in turn, patients “demanded”. “If we were busy, you had to wait a while. But there’d be people … shouting at us just to get the video-call phone to call their family,” she said. She also felt recognition for nurses was lacking. Pandemic notwithstanding, Tina said she had patients asking her, “Do you even earn S$2,000 a month? You’re just a missy. You’re just wiping buttocks. Why do you need a degree for that?” Some healthcare workers are drawn to opportunities overseas, and even private hospitals are not immune. Filipino nurse Chris*, for example, left his private employer for the United States in April last year. “It’s raining green cards for nurses,” he said, referring to the card that allows holders to live and work permanently in the US. It would have taken years to obtain before the pandemic, but it landed in his lap in less than a year, he added. Two other Filipino nurses CNA Insider spoke to made similar points. Chris loved his job here and Singapore too. He lived with his sister and had “a lot of opportunities” at the hospital he worked at — he said he was promoted every two years and was offered a scholarship. But his application in 2013 for permanent residency was rejected — twice in his sister’s case. In the US, Chris is paid thrice his salary in Singapore, has an apartment to himself and owns a car. When applying for a car loan, he noticed how different things were as a nurse in the US vis-a-vis Singapore. “People here really appreciate nurses. They have high respect and high trust,” he said. According to him, even though he had no credit history, the moment he said he was a nurse, his loan was approved, no questions asked. According to a Singapore Nursing Board report in 2019, Filipino nurses number about 7,600, or 18 per cent of Singapore’s nursing workforce. Citing these figures in Parliament last July, Dr Koh said the MOH was working with healthcare employers to ensure the adequacy and sustainability of the nursing workforce. “Healthcare employers should also diversify their recruitment sources,” he added. With greater competition for nurses worldwide, however, Assoc Prof Lim said Singapore would “remain uncompetitive” if it does not “unlock” the permanent residency and citizenship lever for foreign staff. “If we don’t change, we then become the training stop for nurses,” he said. “(They) come here for a couple of years, get trained and then head to Australia or the United Kingdom.” Last month, Dr Koh said the MOH is working on retaining foreign nurses by “keeping their remuneration competitive”. It has also worked with other agencies on “factors that are important for their retention”. Despite the overall challenges, many healthcare workers have soldiered on — together. In her two and a half years in the oncology department of a public hospital, staff nurse Kelly* has had her share of bad days, but what has kept her going is her colleagues. “That motivates me to come to work every time, knowing that I’m well supported by others working on a shift with me, regardless of the situation and demands of the day,” she said. Sometimes they help to answer call bells from her patients on her behalf or start medications that doctors have ordered for her patients. When manpower is lacking, especially with nurses coming down with COVID-19, her supervisors step out of their offices and work with them on the ground — helping with dressings and even feeding or showering the patients, she added. This is a view echoed by Alex*, a medical officer in the emergency department of another public hospital. “Sometimes when I’m unable to (fill in) a certain form or talk to a patient’s family, my nurses will say, ‘Don’t worry, I’ll help you.’ Or sometimes when nurses are busy and can’t check (patients’) blood pressure, I’ll tell them, ‘Don’t worry … I’ll do it,’” he said. “Everybody is in one team helping to solve the problem … It’s a far nicer feeling than feeling isolated … facing all this shit yourself.” Indeed, in the recent study on burnout cited above, many healthcare workers had mentioned being “motivated and inspired by strong leadership and supportive colleagues”. Other morale boosters included having pride in being healthcare workers, and those on the front line expressed their appreciation for being thanked and supported at work. This included kind words and tokens of appreciation distributed to all healthcare workers, as well as more tangible support such as the provision of interim staff housing and the ability to take consecutive days of leave once again. The aim of the study was to explore the effects of Singapore’s pandemic response on healthcare workers’ morale and commitment, and to identify ways of enabling operational safety and functioning. To this end, the researchers identified workers’ “stoic acceptance to fight, adjust and hold the line”, characterised mostly by a sense of devotion to service — “we have to work under such conditions” — and the expression or inference that “fear is for the weak”. But the researchers concluded that this attitude, though necessary in the eye of the storm and indeed the biggest morale booster at the height of Singapore’s first COVID-19 wave, can last only so long before causing chronic and systemic problems, such as entrenched burnout. Both Alex and Kelly attest that the latest wave has taken a toll. Kelly, for example, is “more burnt out than ever”. “Imagine working tirelessly for five months and finally (taking) a week of leave, only to be called back four times during the week,” she said. In response to CNA Insider’s queries about the attrition rate, manpower shortage and nurse-patient ratio, the MOH pointed to Dr Koh’s parliamentary speech last month. The three public healthcare clusters, meanwhile, outlined efforts on the ground to retain staff and ensure their well-being. The NHG said it aims to help staff achieve higher job satisfaction by automating manual tasks and empowering them to make decisions when redesigning roles. It added that it has stepped up efforts to monitor the well-being of staff, including their psychological health. Staff at SingHealth have access to experienced medical social workers, counsellors and psychologists, coordinated by the SingHealth Staff Care Centre, “whenever they may feel distressed or simply want someone to talk to”, highlighted group chief human resource officer Esther Tan. The cluster also has about 500 peer supporters who are “trained to extend emotional support to their fellow colleagues in times of need”. The National University Health System (NUHS) has rolled out meetings in certain specialities whereby senior and junior staff can have “frank discussions about their emotions and feelings of vulnerability” in the clinical environment. On the issue of leave, the NHG said staffing needs are managed through “advance planning and staggered rostering of leave”. “This ensures that staff are able to go on leave by turns to rest and recharge or to return to their home country,” said Olivia Tay, its group chief human resource officer. SingHealth, meanwhile, said the prevailing guidelines on overseas leave applications are largely “no different” from usual leave applications. “As the Omicron situation in Singapore eases further, more staff will be able to resume some pattern of time away from work to rest and recharge, and for our foreign staff, the opportunity to return home to spend time with their families,” said Ms Tan. As for recruitment, the NUHS is stepping up efforts locally and internationally, to “combat exhaustion”, and has introduced flexitime opportunities and part-time nursing schemes “where appropriate”. Returning staff are also valued, said its group chief human resource officer, Priscilla Teo. For example, some locum nurses who worked at its Community Care Facilities have joined the cluster full-time. There is also an “alternative workforce” comprising basic care assistants and student nurses who support its nurses in patient care. At SingHealth, while recruitment efforts are in place, the cluster devotes “much more attention” to staff development, especially with the “insatiable global demand” for healthcare manpower. Now with the Omicron wave waning, some healthcare workers said their working conditions have improved. Janine*, a senior staff nurse in her 30s, told CNA Insider earlier this month that morale in her department, an intensive care unit, was “rather low”. But since then, things have started to look up — the lifting of restrictions has helped “in a big way”. Some of her colleagues have taken leave and even travelled, including foreign colleagues off to see their families. “We have sufficient manpower now, so that means … no one’s getting a call back on their days off,” she said. She had also been hoping that training opportunities would resume — in particular, courses to help her specialise in trauma. And she got her wish: Training sessions that were on hold for months have recently resumed. In senior pharmacist Dean’s case, while the COVID-19 workload is decreasing, there is little respite. Manpower has yet to be replaced, and patient cases and projects that were postponed over the past two years are coming back “fast and furious”. Since January, he has been able to take up to two consecutive days off. Anything longer than that, he said, is subject to balloting. And overseas travel requires approval from his head of department. Still, he remains hopeful and looks forward to a time when the manpower issues can be resolved. As for doctors, those CNA Insider spoke to welcomed the recent news about a national wellness committee for junior doctors, which will review and recommend changes to existing healthcare practices and guidelines to improve the well-being of junior doctors. Singapore Medical Council guidelines stipulate that junior doctors may work up to 80 hours a week. But surveys showed that 20 per cent of them exceeded this stipulation, possibly owing to “the nature of clinical work in certain departments or exigencies of service”, Dr Koh said last month. Now that the ministry is involved, Terry*, a medical officer in the general medicine department of a public hospital, is “hopeful that the committee will make a difference”. “But with regard to whether (the recommendations) will be adopted and whether they’ll be enforced properly … only time will tell,” he said. He listed two things that would help significantly: Mandated rest days that are strictly enforced and a “nationwide effort to move away from 30-hour calls”. This refers to doctors having to stay through the night at the hospital after their shift and continue the next working day. Those who have left acute hospitals, however, said it is unlikely that they will return. “It’s a fulfilling job, but the amount of recognition doesn’t reciprocate the amount of hard work,” said Tina. With plans in the pipeline to start a family, Lisa, too, is unwilling to endure irregular hours and shift work once again. “The hours aren’t friendly to working mothers,” she said, adding that as her husband is also a nurse, it would mean days when they barely see each other. Farez is another who is contented where he is, at the private dialysis clinic. “I might go back only if the hospital has a better staff to patient ratio and more protection for nurses,” he said, highlighting multiple occasions of “verbal abuse” from patients as one of the triggers for his departure. Some allied healthcare workers CNA Insider spoke to echoed this view. Indeed, the NUHS said that besides the workload and working hours, a “significant part of staff burnout” is due to abuse, in person and online, and that it has “increased measures to mitigate risks”, without elaborating on these protective measures. One way to take this forward, suggested Assoc Prof Lim, is to “very publicly punish” the people who abuse healthcare professionals. “Yes, you’re under emotional stress,” he said. “But so are the nurses, and so are the doctors. I think people can take a lot more when they feel that their bosses have their backs.” Another way to improve matters is to raise wages, he added. “We agree that nursing, physiotherapy and so on create a lot of societal value — then society should be prepared to pay.” Last year, the MOH announced a salary increase of up to 14 per cent for nurses in the public healthcare sector, phased over two years. For allied health professionals, pharmacists and administrative and ancillary staff, the increase was 3 to 7 per cent of their monthly base salaries last year. What is important, stressed Assoc Prof Lim, is that nurses’ salaries be benchmarked to their peers in other essential public services. “For new recruits to any profession, it’s not what you’re paid relative to three or five years ago if you’d been (in that profession),” he said. “It’s the opportunity cost: If I wasn’t in nursing, would I be a teacher? “Is a nurse with 10 years’ experience similar to a police officer with 10 years’ experience? A Singapore Armed Forces officer? That’s the sort of equilibration we should be looking at. “And if the pay goes up, respect goes up.” In the meantime, he sees one other way to retain staff or entice those who have left to return: To increase public awareness of the “nobility of the profession”. “It’s not that people don’t want to be nurses. People want to save lives (and) do good,” he said. “How do we, as a society, make it easy for people to do the right thing and sign up for the caring professions? Because, trust me, we and our families will need to use the health system.” For folks like Kelly, there is still job satisfaction. “Nursing is my passion, and I’ve never regretted joining the industry,” she said. “As cliched as it sounds, I chose this profession with the intention of helping others in need. And by doing so, it helps me keep … my humanity and humility.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/fear-dentist-dental-anxiety-pain-checkups-2633361,Why are some people terrified of going to the dentist? Here's how to overcome your anxiety and fear of pain,"For some, the shrill sound of the dental drill grinding against tooth is enough to make them jump out of their skin. For others, it could be the sight of sharp objects a dentist is waving in front of their faces. In Michael Tan’s case, the fear of needles has kept him away from the chair since primary school.  “I couldn’t avoid the check-ups during primary school because they were mandatory. To date, I think I’ve only been to the dentist as an adult not more than five times,” said the 40-year-old senior manager. Tan attributed his dental anxiety to his father, who also shares the same fear for needles. “The thought of needles makes me extremely uncomfortable, to the point of raising my heartbeat. So you can imagine how stressful it was for me when I was taking the COVID-19 shots.” Tan shared that he only goes to the dentist “when I am pushed to the limit”. “Like if I’m made to choose between jumping off a cliff and seeing the dentist,” he laughed. Or in the case of his last dental appointment the year before, an intolerable toothache caused by a wisdom tooth.  WHY ARE SOME PEOPLE SO TERRIFIED OF THE DENTIST? Tan’s situation isn’t unique. If your Mum or Dad is afraid of going to the dentist, chances are, you might have learned the same nervousness at an early age. “Parents’ anxious expressions and their constant reassurance to ‘not be afraid’ erroneously teaches their children that there will be danger or something to be afraid of at the dentist,” said Dr Lim Boon Leng, a psychiatrist with Gleneagles Hospital’s Dr BL Lim Centre For Psychological Wellness.  At times, the anxiety may be triggered by irrational fears such as claustrophobia and contracting HIV through dental procedures, he said. “Other anxiety disorders like panic disorder, where one fears that he may have a panic attack in the midst of his procedure, can result in dental anxiety or phobia.” A not-so-good dental experience in the past may also have rippling effects. These patients may be afraid of “associated visual or auditory cues, such as the sight of dental instruments or the sound they make”, said Dr Leroy Kiang, a dentist at Orchard Scotts Dental. Unfamiliarity is another deterrent. Dr Andrew Chia, a dentist with Vista Dental Surgery, noted that about 60 per cent of his new patients show signs of apprehension in his chair. “It is to be expected. It’s like going to a new hairdresser. You’re not sure of the outcome because you’re not familiar with him or her,” he said. “The regulars already know what to expect, so they aren’t nervous.” If you dread the polishing and scaling at your annual dental check-up because of your tooth sensitivity, you can do something about it.  Use the toothpaste for sensitive teeth religiously twice a day for four to six weeks before your appointment, said Dr Andrew Chia, a dentist with Vista Dental Surgery. “It will help but you have to use the toothpaste continuously.” You can also discuss with the dentist about using an anaesthetic spray on the gums or teeth to help you cope with the sensitivity, he said. DO YOU HAVE DENTAL ANXIETY OR DENTAL PHOBIA? “Anxiety towards dental treatment has been widely recognised as a significant deterrent to patients seeking dental treatment,” said Clinical Associate Professor Lui Jeen Nee, a senior consultant and the head of the Department of Restorative Dentistry at National Dental Centre Singapore. However, dental anxiety and dental phobia aren’t the same. “Dental anxiety refers to the emotional state that develops in response to the anticipation or experience of dentistry,” she said. “Compared to dental phobia, dental anxiety is slightly less severe” and can present with “symptoms such as breaking out in cold sweat, heart palpitations and feeling nervous”.  Dr Lim added that it is “quite normal” to experience dental anxiety’s symptoms “for a few days before the appointment”. But dental phobia is something else altogether, he said. It is “characterised by a persistent and excessive fear of going to a dentist for more than six months. Those affected go to great lengths to avoid going to a dentist. If it cannot be avoided, they will experience extreme distress and anxiety.” Dental phobia could also be experienced by patients who are victims of sexual, physical or childhood abuse, and “develop complex post-traumatic stress disorder or dissociative personalities” as a result, said Clin Assoc Prof Lui.  “There are many parallels and associations between dentistry and trauma histories, which may often account for these specific dental phobias. Unfortunately, these often go undetected due to the lack of awareness among dentists,” she said.  HOW IS PAIN MANAGED? Naturally, the most common obstacle stopping people from going to the dentist is pain. “While we do not have the exact numbers, it is common for patients to avoid coming to the dentist unless they are in pain,” said Dr Kiang.  Painkillers, of course, are one way to allay patients’ fear of pain. These can be topical, given as a gas or injected. But painkillers in itself can be a cause of anxiety, especially when needles are involved – and that is where dentists have a few tricks up their sleeves. Dr Kiang, for instance, applies a topical anaesthetic gel first before injecting the local anaesthetic.  Dr Chia, who performed the wisdom tooth extraction on Tan, also goes topical first. But the way he administers the local anaesthetic is slightly different. “I’ll inject about a quarter of the total amount in the first jab, wait for it to take effect, then inject the rest in the second round,” he said. And to make the injections more comfortable for patients, Dr Chia does them in the fleshy part of the cheek and not directly on the gum.  “Before doing anything, I like to chat with my patients first,"" he said. ""Especially those who are already in pain from a toothache, I’ll explain to them how I’ll make them comfortable before the extraction.”  WHY YOU SHOULDN’T PUT OFF YOUR DENTAL APPOINTMENT All the dentists that CNA Lifestyle spoke to have this same message: Don’t skip your yearly dental check-up – even when things feel fine in your mouth. “By the time a dental problem causes pain, there is a far greater likelihood that the required treatment will be more invasive and potentially, even involve losing the tooth,” said Dr Kiang.  Take, for instance, tooth decay and gum disease – the two top dental issues seen in Singapore, according to Clin Assoc Prof Lui. “It is important to understand that many of these dental diseases can be prevented if detected and managed early,” she said. If you’re a parent who is tempted to book an appointment with your child’s paediatric dentist (because he or she is so good at putting your child at ease), sorry you can’t.  “Paediatric dentists do not provide dental services for adults as that is beyond their scope of specialisation,” said Clinical Associate Professor Lui Jeen Nee, a senior consultant and the head of the Department of Restorative Dentistry at National Dental Centre Singapore.  In fact, paediatric dentists typically only see children up to the age of 18, said Dr Leroy Kiang, a dentist with Orchard Scotts Dental.  Another common and preventable issue is worn or cracked teeth, said Dr Kiang. Hairline cracks can develop, especially if your teeth have fillings or if you accidentally bite on something hard such as an unexpected piece of bone. Initially, there may be no symptoms or just a slight discomfort when chewing, he said. “But like a small crack in your car windscreen, it can end up propagating and shattering the whole windscreen.”  Certainly, oral cancers are more life threatening than cavities but they, too, can be symptom-less at the beginning. “Patients may not know that there is anything wrong” as it is not easy to self-check common sites such as the “border of the tongue, floor of the mouth, lining of the cheeks and soft palate”, said Dr Kiang.  “Oral cancer screening is an important part of patients’ regular dental examinations” and the prognosis is “much more favourable if the lesions are detected and treated early”, he said.  HOW TO MANAGE YOUR ANXIETY To help you stay calm and carry on before your next dental appointment, here are some practical tips from the experts: Whether it’s for a routine check-up or non-emergency situation (skip to “While waiting in the reception area” if yours is an emergency), it helps to speak to someone – a friend, family member or even a dentist – to get motivated and make the appointment, said Clin Assoc Prof Lui.  This could mean having a pre-consultation with a dentist just to talk about your anxiety and what to expect during the procedure. “It is completely acceptable to inform the dentist about any specific fears and anxieties about the treatment as it can be modified accordingly to create a calm environment for the patient,” she said. During the pre-consultation, you can ask the dentist to walk you through the procedure and be shown videos, said Dr Lim. From there, you can have mental rehearsals in your mind about the treatment you’ll be going through, he said. “Such exposure will help to desensitise you to your fear and help with a smoother dental experience.” You can also arrange for a friend or family member to accompany you to the appointment if the person's presence helps to keep you calm.  There’s no point lying in bed and worrying about tomorrow’s appointment. Neither would telling yourself “worrying does not help”, said Dr Lim.  Since you can’t stop your mind from racing, you could mentally run through the procedure you’re undergoing tomorrow. (That’s where the video and talk you had with your dentist come in handy.) If that mental exercise ends up creating some anxiety in you, do some deep-muscle relaxation exercises to help youself calm down, said Dr Lim. Or you could read or watch TV to distract yourself, and go to bed when you’re finally sleepy, he added. “If you cannot sleep, tell yourself it is okay. Pick up your book or watch TV again.” If you have severe anxiety, you can take an anxiolytic, which you can get from the dentist or general practitioner, said Dr Lim. You could bring along music or anything that “could help distract or provide comfort while waiting”, said Clin Assoc Prof Lui.  Dr Lim agreed: “You can distract yourself with a book or watch a video clip on your handphone. You can also close your eyes and perform relaxation exercises.” Whatever you do, this is the time to make yourself comfortable, and take slow and easy breaths, he said. But if your anxiety is making you restless, allow yourself to be, said Dr Lim. “Walk around if you need to,” he said.  Close your eyes and concentrate inwards, said Dr Lim. “Continue to focus and regulate your breathing.” At the same time, know that you are in control as that will keep you at ease. “You can always inform the dentist if you are uncomfortable in any way. You can even stop the procedure,” he said. Furthermore, dentists are big advocates of putting their patients at ease. “It can be as simple as giving the patient noise-cancelling headphones, a blanket, a stress ball, even aromatherapy,” said Dr Kiang. “Or offering the patient regular breaks for long procedures and making it a point to check in on them occasionally. Every patient is different.” "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/malaysia-hemp-ketum-amend-laws-cultivation-police-anti-narcotics-2647886,"Amend the laws before allowing hemp, ketum cultivation in Malaysia: Anti-narcotics chief","KUALA LUMPUR: Relevant Acts and procedures under the Malaysian law have to be amended if the government wants to allow the cultivation of ketum and hemp in the country, said Director of Narcotics Crime Investigation Department Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay. Among the amendments that needed to be made involved the Poisons Act 1952 and the National Land Code 1965, said Mr Ayob Khan at a press conference at the Bukit Aman police headquarters on Monday (Apr 25). Bernama reported Mr Ayob Khan as saying that the Poisons Act 1952 has to be amended because ketum contains psycho-active substances that could be sedative and euphoric.  According to medical experts, ketum is a plant that has stimulant and opioid properties, similar to illegal and addictive substances. “At present, the planting of ketum is not an offence but when it is picked, processed, sold and exported then it becomes an offence,” said Mr Ayob Khan. The National Land Code 1965 should also be amended because the power to manage land is under the State List in the Federal Constitution, he added. The state governments have legislative power over subjects under the State List.  “We will abide by any decision the government makes but many procedures and processes need to be followed,” Mr Ayob Khan was quoted as saying. He also said that tests on the effects of ketum use have only been done on animals at the preclinical stage only, adding that clinical trials have not been done on humans to identify its side effects. “Many types of research need to be done. For example, there are talks that the planting of ketum can generate RM180 million (US$41 million) a year,” he said. “However, other costs need to be looked at. For instance, presently we have about 130,000 addicts and 25 per cent of them (36,000) are placed at the Voluntary Narcotics Addiction Rehabilitation Centre (Puspen),” he added. Mr Ayob Khan said that the National Anti-Drug Agency did not have a special rehabilitation programme for ketum abuse. On Sunday, Deputy Communications and Multimedia Minister Zahidi Zainul Abidin was reported as saying that the Cabinet has given its go-ahead for discussions to be held with Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin on the planting and use of hemp and ketum for medicinal purposes.  Malaysian daily Sinar Harian quoted Mr Zahidi as saying that the green light from the Cabinet is with regard to the consumption of hemp and ketum for medicinal purposes only and not for their general use. He also said that the global demand for ketum and hemp is very high with three countries currently being their major producers. Indonesia is believed to be the biggest producer of ketum, providing about 90 per cent of global supply.  Mr Zahidi said if Malaysia could become the fourth largest producer in the world, it could gain a substantial revenue from hemp and ketum.  “An acre (0.41 hectar) of hemp could yield RM3,000 and for 10 acres, the revenue generated could reach RM30,000,” noted Mr Zahidi. Last Thursday, the bi-partisan parliamentary caucus said that Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob was in the process of reviewing the previous Pakatan Harapan (PH) government’s decision on allowing alternative treatments which include the use of ketum and medical marijuana. One of the caucus members, Shah Alam MP Khalid Abdul Samad, said they were told of the review during their official meeting with Mr Ismail Sabri on Apr 12, reported Malaysiakini. Mr Khalid said that the prime minister had responded positively in the meeting and gave his promise to discuss and fine-tune the relevant issues more thoroughly in the Cabinet. According to the PH MP, the caucus chaired by former youth and sports minister Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman also discussed with Mr Ismail Sabri about policy issues related to the hemp, ketum and medical marijuana industry for use in Malaysia. They also raised issues related to Malaysians charged and convicted by the courts for using marijuana for medical purposes."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/least-one-child-dead-after-increase-acute-hepatitis-cases-children-who-2643671,At least one child dead after increase of acute hepatitis cases in children: WHO,"The World Health Organization said on Saturday (Apr 23) that at least one child death had been reported following an increase of acute hepatitis of unknown origin in children, and that at least 169 cases had been reported in children in 12 countries. The WHO issued the figures as health authorities around the world investigate a mysterious increase in severe cases of hepatitis - inflammation of the liver – in young children. The WHO said that as of Apr 21, acute cases of hepatitis of unknown origin had been reported in the United Kingdom, the United States, Spain, Israel, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Italy, Norway, France, Romania and Belgium. It said 114 of the 169 cases were in the United Kingdom alone. The cases reported were in children aged from one month to 16 years, and 17 had required liver transplantation, it said. It gave no details of the death that it said had been reported, and did not say where it occurred. The WHO said a common cold virus known as an adenovirus had been detected in at least 74 cases. COVID-19 infection was identified in 20 of those tested and 19 cases were detected with a COVID-19 and adenovirus co-infection, it said. The WHO said it was closely monitoring the situation and working with British health authorities, other member states and partners. US health officials have sent out a nationwide alert warning doctors to be on the lookout for symptoms of pediatric hepatitis, possibly linked with a cold virus, as part of a wider probe into unexplained cases of severe liver inflammation in young children."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/not-just-spa-or-yoga-ambient-music-also-form-escapism-2635401,Not just for spa or yoga – ambient music is also a form of escapism,"When I heard the news that my mother had suffered a stroke, the feeling that surfaced wasn’t despair, but an impulse to problem solve. First, the doctor’s medical jargon flooded into my brain like ticker tape: A cerebrovascular accident due to embolism of the left middle cerebral artery. Five milligrams of Eliquis and 50 milligrams of Losartan and 50 more of Metoprolol, in addition to four other pills at morning, noon and midnight. My brother and I compiled passwords to medical insurance platforms, patient portals and bank accounts in a shared Notes app entry. We filled out paperwork for long-term disability payments. We consulted lawyers, wondering how to handle my mother’s employer, which had threatened to fire her if she did not return to work. A month after the stroke, the night before my 29th birthday, we were in an accident that totalled my mother’s car. In the hopes that she would eventually be able to drive again, I gave her a few thousand dollars of my savings toward buying a new one. The stroke wasn’t the only crisis. There was the ceaseless drag of the pandemic; the expectation to complete my master’s degree while I cared for my mother; and the reality that, as an immigrant family, our full support system was back home in the Dominican Republic. For the most part, my brother and I were on our own. So, I Googled. I made playlists. I called one of them, if you need to breathe, all in lowercase. I populated it with the soft-focus synth tones and obliterating loops of ambient music. I scrolled through Spotify and stumbled upon dozens of playlists engineered for mood regulation and self-care: Peaceful Indie Ambient, Lo-Fi Cool Down, Ambient Chill. On Headspace, a meditation app that costs US$69.99 a year, I found curated soundscapes by savant producer Madlib and songwriter John Legend intended to conjure soothing atmospheres and facilitate productive workdays. It was clear that I was not alone. In recent years, ambient music has become an escapist salve for a planet coping with mass death, political instability, climate anxiety, the incessant culture of overwork and the dissociation these conditions cause. The tech world has been quick to cash in: In 2017, critic Liz Pelly wrote about the proliferation of Spotify’s “chill” playlists, referring to it as “an ambition to turn all music into emotional wallpaper”. This is late capitalist Muzak, smooth-brain anaesthesia to pacify the mind. But in the months after my mother’s stroke, after I rematriated into her one-bedroom apartment in Chicago, ambient music was not just some commodified act of self-care. Listening to it demanded that I relinquish control. It asked me to dispense with progressive time. It forced me to slow down and confront collapse. At the top of “if you need to breathe” is Alessandro Cortini’s Iniziare. Cortini, an Italian musician, who started out as a guitarist, keyboardist and bassist for Nine Inch Nails, is also known for his ghostly, narrative-driven synth music. On Iniziare, Cortini arrests time. A single synth tone, at first bound to the earth, floats 40,000 feet in the air, spiralling into astral fragments. Ripples of electronic feedback crest into peaks and valleys of stretched echoes, decayed into hollowed abysses. Time becomes supple, pliant, disobedient. Listening to it, I am forced to close my eyes, to feel the way that sound travels over the body, shape-shifting into nonlinear drift. I am detached from any deterministic version of the future. In this place between lightness and darkness, pleasure and pain exist in equal measure. I experience all the fragmentation of life, the reminders of trauma and uncertainty I have woken up to for the past four months. Here, I refuse to let grief become self-definition: I live unfettered from the speed of emergency. Ambient music has always contained a kind of subterranean knowing. British musician and critic David Toop, who wrote Ocean Of Sound, the defining 1995 text on the music, recently argued that it has become severed from the philosophical qualities suggested during its genesis in the 1970s. Back then, ambient represented an alternate protocol for listening and music-making. In a 2019 essay, Toop refers to it as a musical form “committed (implicitly or explicitly) to an engagement with interpretations and articulations of place, environment, listening, silence and time”. In his view, it is music that inspires “a state of mind attuned to inclusivity”, rather than “withdrawal”. And yet, the dominant vision of ambient music today is a cartoonish inversion of these aspirations. In a multibillion-dollar wellness industry, streaming platforms and meditation apps frame ambient as background music, something for detached listening and consumption. It is spa and yoga music, or field recordings for undisturbed, restful sleep. Instead of embracing ambient’s potential – its capacity to soften barriers and loosen ideas of sound, politics, temporality and space – the music has become instrumentalised, diminished into sound-as-backdrop. Experimental music pioneer Pauline Oliveros foresaw how a sensorial approach to music and listening could cultivate politically dynamic thinking. She spent her life developing a theory of deep listening, a practice that promotes radical attentiveness. In this approach, there is a distinction between hearing versus listening: The former is a surface-level awareness of space and temporality; the second is an act of immersive focus. I practised deep listening with my playlist, if you need to breathe, especially with new age innovator Laraaji’s composition Being Here. It is hard to pinpoint exactly when Being Here clicks: Maybe it’s at the 10-minute mark, the 15-minute mark or even at its beatific, 25-minute close. Laraaji, who has been releasing music since the late 1970s, produces aural glossolalia – divine, luminescent melodic debris. Listening to his music, I am held in an unspoken embrace with his vision of the present, notes refracting like sunlight caressing the azure waters of the ocean. This is music that curls into the ears, mutating into an imagined Elysium, stopping time and space. It’s not just scenery, not a simple balm for immeasurable pain. For some, the lessons of Being Here might recall some sort of empty practice of mindfulness, a concept so often misappropriated as a wellness buzzword. That enterprise often tells us to “be present” so that we can self-optimise and better function as workers and individuals, rather than as humans who are part of a community. But Being Here is not a demand to recharge for productivity. It asked me to forget the looping of time, to disengage with any kind of predictive chronology – about my mother’s recovery, but also about surviving a continuous state of hardship. Being here, slowing down, was not about inactivity or lack of energy. It was about releasing myself from the imperative to withdraw in the face of precariousness. It was an insurgent break in time – a call to drench myself in the reality of a catastrophic present and to equip myself to do something about it. I won’t pretend ambient music is some kind of comprehensive solution for a world contending with death, war and devastation. But I do wonder how, on an infinitesimal scale, listening closely might free us from the logic of hasty, individualistic action. When I force myself to listen closely, I hear a refusal to analyse, judge and act with immediacy. In its call to suspend time, the music carries the potential to press pause on the punishing velocity that attends disaster, that robs our attention and predetermines a fixed future. I hear the promise to act deliberately, collectively and with care, to embrace intentional observation and action – the durational practice of a lifetime.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/why-gut-health-taking-over-tiktok-2637221,Why is gut health taking over TikTok?,"Every few months, like clockwork, hundreds of videos promising tips and tricks to “hack” your gut flood TikTok. In March, influencers pushed shots of aloe vera juice: “My digestive system, like my gut health? Never been better”, one gushed in a video with one million likes while tapping on a purple bottle of the drink. Another, with the username “oliveoilqueen” advocated drinking extra virgin olive oil every day in a video viewed more than 3.5 million times, claiming that doing so cleared her skin, made her periods less painful and fixed her frequent bloating. Videos tagged with #guttok have garnered nearly 400 million views. They’re crammed with suggestions for cucumber-ginger juices and boiled apples, bone broth in the morning and sludgy sweet potato soups at night. There’s not enough data to prove whether any of these supposed fixes improve digestive functions, gastrointestinal experts said. Some purported gut-health helpers, like coconut oil, have high fat content that can loosen stool and irritate your stomach, said Beth Czerwony, a registered dietitian with the Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Human Nutrition. Others, such as aloe vera juice, may cause diarrhoea in some people. And since the Food and Drug Administration largely does not regulate supplements, gastroenterologists are reluctant to recommend the pills, powders and products promoted by influencers. “If somebody is claiming to have something that will immediately turn gut health around, you should be skeptical of that,” said Justin Sonnenburg, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford. Instead, his research points to long-term lifestyle habits that can benefit the gut – ones that rarely go viral or make their way to social media acclaim. HOW GUT HEALTH WENT MAINSTREAM The online obsession with gut health is just one example of self-transformation content, said Stephanie Alice Baker, a senior lecturer in sociology at the City, University of London, who studies online wellness culture. What you see is this trend of self-optimisation,” Dr Baker said. The most popular #guttok videos tend to feature before and after pictures – the swell of bloating under a crop top becomes toned abs. In a culture that sometimes bristles at mentions of dieting or weight loss, framing these changes around a topic like gut health might be more palatable to an influencer’s audience, she said. There’s also an inherent intimacy that comes with talking about the gut, Dr Baker said. Authenticity attracts an audience – and it’s hard to get more personal than talking about bowel movements. “That’s what people are referring to when they say gut health,” said Dr Rabia De Latour, a gastroenterologist at NYU Langone Health. “They want to stamp a nice, pretty name on it, but it’s about pooping.” HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE POOR GUT HEALTH? There’s evidence to suggest that gut-related health conditions, particularly irritable bowel syndrome, have spiked over the past few decades, said Dr Sonnenburg, a surge he attributes to the rise of processed and packaged foods. A global survey published in 2021 of over 73,000 adults from 33 countries found that more than 40 per cent of respondents had gastrointestinal disorders, like irritable bowel syndrome or constipation. Chronic, unexplained abdominal pain, constipation and diarrhoea are all signs of poor gut health, experts said. People may also feel sluggish, or “blah”. If you’re concerned about your gut, pay attention to the consistency of your stool, Dr De Latour said; you want them to be soft, smooth and sausage shaped. The Bristol Stool Chart, a medical classification of seven groups of poop, can help determine whether or not your stool is healthy. Gut health can have long-term health consequences, doctors said. The gut is linked to the immune system and heart health, and emerging research is examining the link between gut flora and neurological disorders like Parkinson’s disease, said Dr Reezwana Chowdhury, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Medicine. Issues with your gut could point to a larger health problem, she added, and people experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms like abdominal pain or chronic diarrhoea should consult a doctor. WHAT CAN YOU DO TO IMPROVE YOUR GUT HEALTH? Eat more fibre: Two kinds of fibre can aid your gut: Soluble fibre – the gummy fibres we get from foods like oatmeal and apple skins – and insoluble fibre, which serves as a laxative that helps push food through the digestive system. Nuts, whole grains, beans and legumes can be good sources of insoluble fiber, Czerwony said. Be careful not to introduce a lot of fibre too quickly, though. You want to ease into any dietary changes, experts said, and steadily increase the amount of fibre-rich foods you add to your meals over a period of weeks. Limit processed foods: Emulsifiers that help keep packaged foods shelf-stabilised can erode the mucus barrier in your gut, Dr Sonnenburg said, and artificial sweeteners found in many processed foods can lead to unhealthy gut microbes. Bacteria in the gut may quickly convert simple sugars and starches into gas, he said, causing bloating. This means that fast foods and processed foods, which Dr Sonnenburg defines as foods with ingredients “your grandmother wouldn’t recognise as food” like additive chemicals, can contribute to poor gut health. The gut microbiome is fairly resilient, though, he said; the occasional ice-cream binge or petrol-station snack won’t wreak havoc on your gut health. Opt for fermented foods: Dr Sonnenburg published a study in August showing that fermented foods like yoghurt, kimchi, kefir, sauerkraut and kombucha can increase the diversity of bacteria in the gut. His research found that people who ate six servings of fermented foods each day saw these benefits – the equivalent of consuming one cup of yoghurt, one 16-ounce bottle of kombucha and one cup of kimchi in a day. Past research has linked high levels of diversity in your gut microbiome to lower rates of obesity, diabetes and other health conditions. Lower your stress levels: There’s a strong connection between the gut and the brain, Czerwony said. “If you’re stressed, if you’re not sleeping well, you might have gastrointestinal symptoms and think it’s from your diet. It could be from your lifestyle,” she said. Adequate levels of sleep, hydration and exercise are also linked to gut health, she said.

When our hospitals were still under a lot of pressure, VDS was critical in ensuring that we do not assert too much burden on our healthcare system,” the Health Minister said at a multi-ministry task force press conference.  “However now that the hospitals’ workload has eased considerably, there is less need now to retain VDS in its current form.”  In addition, Singapore’s vaccination coverage is “among the highest in the world” at 96 per cent of its eligible population, MOH noted. All this allows the country to step down its vaccination-differentiated safe-management measures by reducing the settings in which they are needed, said Mr Ong.  “In particular, settings such as places of worship, malls, retail shops, supermarkets et cetera, will no longer need to maintain VDS,” he added.  “It also means that the onus now falls on the individuals who are not fully vaccinated to take the necessary precautions to avoid crowded places, so that you minimise your chance of being infected and falling severely ill."" While people still need to be vaccinated to be able to dine in at F&B establishments, these businesses will no longer need to conduct vaccination checks on their customers, said MOH. Customers will be expected to abide by the rules, and random spot-checks will continue to be conducted to ensure that only fully vaccinated people are dining in, it added. This is already the case for hawker centres and coffee shops currently. Workplace vaccination measures implemented by the Ministry of Manpower will also be lifted, announced Mr Ong.  He added that the Manpower Ministry has been discussing the issue with tripartite partners, who agree that given the significant pandemic risks that still exist in the coming months, businesses should still be given the flexibility to impose vaccination-related instructions for employees, for business continuity, as well as health and safety reasons. MOM will provide further details later, said Mr Ong.  The Health Ministry will stop issuing health risk notices to close contacts of COVID-19 cases from Apr 26. Those who test positive for COVID-19 will no longer need to submit the details of their household contacts online, said the ministry, while cautioning that people should continue to exercise social responsibility. For example, infected people should still inform close contacts so that they can, in turn, take the necessary precautions by testing themselves before leaving the house.  Settings with vulnerable people like hospitals, nursing homes and elderly homes should request proof of a negative antigen rapid test result for people will recent exposure before they are allowed to enter, said MOH.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/group-size-limit-covid-19-safe-distancing-singapore-return-workplace-apr-26-2641146,"COVID-19 group size limit to be removed in Singapore, all employees can return to the workplace from Apr 26","SINGAPORE: There will no longer be limits on group sizes or a requirement for safe distancing from Apr 26 as Singapore moves to further ease COVID-19 measures. All employees may also return to the workplace from Apr 26, an increase from the current limit of 75 per cent of those who can work from home. That is also when the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level will be lowered from Orange to Yellow for the first time in more than two years.  The DORSCON framework, which gives an indication of the current disease situation, was raised to Orange on Feb 7, 2020. With COVID-19 cases falling and stabilising in Singapore, the “time is right” to lower it to Yellow, co-chair of the task force Gan Kim Yong at a press conference on Friday (Apr 22). “Under DORSCON Yellow, each of us must continue to comply with the safe management measures and exercise social responsibility. This means that if you are unwell, we should really stay home. We must also maintain good personal hygiene and adhere to health advisories,” said Mr Gan, who is the Trade and Industry Minister.  With the easing of restrictions, it will no longer be a requirement to keep to a group size of 10 from Apr 26. The cap on the number of unique visitors per household will similarly be lifted, said co-chair of the task force Lawrence Wong. The current limit is also 10 visitors per household at any one time.  The capacity limit of 75 per cent for mask-on events with more than 1,000 people will also be removed. However, this capacity limit will remain at nightlife establishments where there is dancing among patrons because it is considered a higher-risk activity, said Mr Wong.  Mask-wearing will continue to be required indoors, including on public transport, and optional outdoors. At the workplace, however, employees will be allowed to remove their masks when they are not interacting physically with others and when they are not in customer-facing areas, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a separate press release. This means that employees at their work stations in the office will be allowed to take off their masks, Mr Wong said. “Because it will be very hard to be back at work throughout the day and then wearing a mask and working. And therefore this flexibility is extended for such an occasion,” he added, urging employees to maintain a safe distance from their colleagues if they are not wearing a mask.  The Health Ministry said that even with these changes, employers are encouraged to retain flexible work arrangements such as telecommuting and staggered work hours. ""Beyond the workplace benefits of flexible work arrangements, this will also help workers avoid peak period crowds as more of us return to the workplace,"" it added. The Health Ministry said Singapore's transition to DORSCON Yellow is a milestone in its progress towards living with COVID-19. ""However, the situation can change quickly in the face of new variants. Hence, we urge everyone to remain socially responsible and vigilant even as we take strides towards normalcy,"" it added. This is a “very significant step forward” in Singapore’s journey to live with COVID-19, said Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister.  “It has been more than two years since we raise the alert to DORSCON Orange in February 2020. Since then we’ve gone through a lot together,” he added, recounting the panic buying, the “circuit breaker” and multiple rounds of restrictions.  “Two years isn’t that long but it somehow feels like a lifetime ago because so much has happened. And we have been through so much together. Working together, we have been able to keep everyone in Singapore safe, to protect lives and livelihoods, and to achieve one of the lowest COVID-19 fatality rates in the world.”  Stressing that the COVID-19 pandemic is “certainly not over” and that a new variant will emerge sooner or later, Mr Wong added that Singapore may have to tighten restrictions or reinstate TraceTogether and SafeEntry when the time comes.  “The approach that we are taking is step down, but not dismantle. We must keep our systems warm so that we can activate them later on if the need arises,” he said.  “And we hope everyone understands this, so that if and when we need to tighten, you will be mentally and psychologically prepared for such future scenarios.”  Watch the full news conference, including the Q&A session with journalists:  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/miscarriage-myths-pregnancy-loss-2590971,Why did I lose my baby? 10 miscarriage myths explained and debunked by medical experts,"Miscarriage is not an easy topic to talk about, even among your closest and dearest. And it’s also more common than most people realise.   About 15 to 20 per cent of pregnancies end in miscarriage, said Professor Tan Hak Koon, Chairman and Senior Consultant with the Division of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, at KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH). Prof Tan said that most miscarriages occur before the first trimester (or week 12) of pregnancy as the foetus is not developing normally due to genetic or chromosomal disorders. “Medical conditions such as uncontrolled severe diabetes, hyperthyroidism or autoimmune disease can raise a woman’s risk of miscarriage,” he explained.  As well, advanced maternal and paternal age, previous miscarriage, low blood progesterone levels during pregnancy, and chronic alcohol and/or substance abuse, may be contributing factors. Pregnancy loss can also happen after the first trimester. Dr Seng Shay Way, a specialist in Obstetrics and Gynaecology and consultant at Raffles Women’s Centre, said the probability of a miscarriage occurring during the second trimester is 1 to 5 per cent.  Pregnancy loss after week 24 is termed a stillbirth and its causes would “usually include maternal and pregnancy-related problems”, he added. CAN A MISCARRIAGE BE PREVENTED?  According to Dr Seng, most miscarriages occur because the foetus isn’t developing as expected. “About 50 per cent of miscarriages are associated with a genetic defect, which often results from errors that occur by chance as the embryo divides,” he explained. In most situations, such incidences are completely random.  However, there are some factors that can increase the risk of miscarriage, Dr Seng said. Age: The older you are, the higher your risk of miscarriage is. “At age 35, you have about a 20 per cent risk. At age 40, the risk is about 40 per cent. And at age 45, it is about 80 per cent,” he said. Weight: Being underweight or overweight has been linked with an increased risk of miscarriage. Uterine or cervical problems: Certain uterine conditions or weak cervical tissues (incompetent cervix) may increase the risk of miscarriage. Invasive pre-natal tests: Some invasive pre-natal genetic tests, such as chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis, can carry a slight risk of miscarriage, said Dr Seng. Both tests are used to detect conditions such as Down syndrome in the baby.  Smoking, alcohol and illicit drugs: These all carry a greater risk of miscarriage. But what about common miscarriage beliefs such as whether exercising, eating raw fish, and more recently, receiving a COVID-19 vaccination while pregnant can lead to pregnancy loss? CNA Women asked the experts to shed light on 10 miscarriage myths. MYTH #1: IF YOU’VE HAD A MISCARRIAGE, CHANCES ARE YOU’LL MISCARRY AGAIN False. “Most women who miscarry go on to have healthy pregnancies after,” said Prof Tan.  However, he said that losing “three or more pregnancies is defined as recurrent pregnancy loss”, and that a woman should seek treatment as there are many conditions and a diverse range of causes that can lead to it.    Some contributing factors could be medical problems, like autoimmune or blood clotting disorders, and genetic causes, added Dr Seng.  MYTH #2: GETTING AN MRNA VACCINE CAN CAUSE A MISCARRIAGE  False. Despite what you might have read, Prof Tan said that “real-world data demonstrates that the mRNA vaccines are safe in pregnancy”. Also, getting a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine will not give you or the baby the virus. Studies have shown that more than 230,000 pregnant women in the US have received an mRNA vaccine (either Pfizer BioNTech or Moderna), and there have not been any safety concerns raised, he explained.  Current scientific data also shows that pregnant women who received the COVID-19 vaccine had no increased risk of other pregnancy complications, such as pre-term birth, stillbirth, growth restriction or birth defects, as compared to those who did not, Prof Tan said.  Various studies have also shown that antibodies from the mRNA vaccine were found in umbilical cord blood, illustrating how the vaccine protects both mother and child.  MYTH #3: YOU DON’T NEED MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR A MISCARRIAGE False. As 15 to 20 per cent of threatened miscarriages, which presents as vaginal bleeding especially in early pregnancy, can lead to spontaneous miscarriage, Prof Tan said it is crucial for a woman to seek medical help as soon as possible.  “While most threatened miscarriages may not be preventable, some pregnancies can be stabilised with the use of progestogens, a steroid hormone,” he explained.  A KKH study showed that a blood test that measures the progesterone level in the body can be used to screen and triage women with threatened miscarriages, which in turn helps guide hospital clinicians in the management of the patient.  More importantly, the findings showed that this protocol was able to prevent a miscarriage in 30 per cent of high-risk pregnancies, said Prof Tan.  MYTH #4: MISCARRIAGES RUN IN THE FAMILY False. Miscarriage usually does not run in the family, unless there is a family history of a rare genetic medical condition.  “Most miscarriages occur because the foetus is not developing normally due to genetic or chromosomal disorders,” said Prof Tan. However, he added that some hereditary medical conditions, such as uncontrolled severe diabetes, hyperthyroidism or autoimmune disease can raise your risk of miscarriage.  MYTH #5: AFTER A MISCARRIAGE, YOU SHOULD WAIT A WHILE BEFORE TRYING FOR ANOTHER BABY   False. While it can be physically and emotionally draining on a woman after a miscarriage and she is encouraged to get adequate rest, both Prof Tan and Dr Seng say it is perfectly fine to start trying for another baby once your menstrual cycle resumes.  Prof Tan also recommended taking folic acid daily at the same time, as the B vitamin not only helps improve one’s chances of conceiving, it also helps in the production of red blood cells and can help reduce the baby’s chances of developing spina bifida, a spinal tube defect. MYTH #6: HAVING SEX WHILE PREGNANT CAN HURT THE BABY AND CAUSE A MISCARRIAGE False. Sexual activity during pregnancy is generally safe, said Prof Tan. This is because during intercourse, the uterus which houses the foetus, is never penetrated.  However, he advised that if you have “suffered from threatened miscarriage anytime during your pregnancy or antepartum haemorrhage (bleeding from the genital tract) in the second half of pregnancy, to avoid sexual activities until your condition is stable”.  MYTH #7: CONSUMING TOO MUCH CAFFEINE CAN LEAD TO A MISCARRIAGE   Interestingly, there is some truth behind this.  A meta-analysis of 60 unique publications published in the European Journal of Epidemiology in 2014, found that greater caffeine intake was associated with an increase in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, pre-term delivery, low birth weight and small-for-gestational-age infants.  Prof Tan advised women to avoid consuming excessive caffeine during pregnancy as “it is a stimulant”, which could lead to an elevation in the mother’s heart rate. This, in turn, can put stress on the baby, and potentially increase the risk of miscarriage, he said.  The World Health Organization advises expectant mothers who consume more than 300mg of caffeine per day to reduce their intake, added Dr Seng.  Limit it to 200mg of caffeine daily, or approximately two cups of regular coffee or tea, Prof Tan advised.   MYTH #8: EATING SUSHI/SASHIMI AND UNPASTEURISED FOODS LIKE CERTAIN TYPES OF MILK AND CHEESE CAN CAUSE PREGNANCY LOSS True. According to Dr Seng, these foods may contain a kind of bacteria called listeria, which can cause listeriosis, an infection that is particularly dangerous for pregnant women (and newborns), as it can “lead to miscarriage or stillbirth”. MYTH #9: EXERCISING TOO MUCH OR NOT RESTING ENOUGH CAN CAUSE A MISCARRIAGE False. Not exercising or doing very little while consuming added calories during pregnancy can do more harm than good to both mother and child.  This is because excessive weight gain can increase the risk of gestational diabetes, which in turn, can lead to adverse consequences, such as foetal macrosomia (where the foetus is significantly larger than average, often 3.8kg and above, which can cause complications), stillbirth or foetal congenital malformations.  In addition, both mother and baby are also at risk of developing Type 2 diabetes later in life.  A study led by KKH in August 2019 found that the prevalence of obesity in pregnancy among Singapore women is high – about 24 per cent of the women surveyed were overweight and 11 per cent were obese.  This is why exercise is highly recommended during pregnancy. To that end, in January 2020, Singapore launched a set of guidelines on physical activity and exercise during pregnancy. For healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies, the rule of thumb is to engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activities a week, like brisk walking, swimming, stationary cycling, low-impact aerobics, jogging as well as resistance training such as squats, push-ups and resistance band exercises.  To be safe, check with your gynaecologist before embarking on any exercise regimen.   MYTH #10: MOVING HOUSE AND ORGANISING THE BABY’S ROOM CAN CAUSE MISCARRIAGE   False. It is common for expectant women to go through a nesting phase, characterised as a burst of energy they get in the last few weeks of pregnancy that inspires them to clean and organise the house in preparation for the baby’s arrival, and there is no medical evidence to prove that this should be avoided.  But it’s also important to put your safety first, and avoid excessive physical exertion, such as carrying things that are too heavy or doing activities that can potentially cause falls, like climbing and standing on ladders, said Prof Tan.  Dr Seng also added that while minor falls are unlikely to cause a miscarriage, a major fall with head or abdominal trauma can lead to one. So carry out any cleaning and moving works with caution.  THERE IS HOPE AFTER MISCARRIAGE At the end of the day, pregnancy loss is never easy, and it’s common for women to wonder if they’ve done something to cause the miscarriage.   “Inevitably, women blame themselves especially when they perceive it as their responsibility in preventing the miscarriage from happening,” said Ang Lee Beng, master medical social worker at the Medical Social Work Department, and chairperson of the Bereavement Support Committee, at KKH. To help both the woman and her husband cope with their loss and heal, Ang shared these simple pointers: Most importantly, “grieving does not mean we cannot have snippets of happiness”, said Ang. So don’t feel guilty about focusing on self-care, enjoying recreational activities when necessary and reaching out for support to help with your recovery process.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/chronic-kidney-disease-dialysis-fistula-job-loei-2623346,Life with chronic kidney disease since 18: He was told he had 7 years to live – he’s now in his active 50s,"Imagine being so thirsty, you wish you could drink the moisture right off the humidity in Singapore. But you can’t – not because it is impossible to do so, but because you’ve already hit your fluid quota, which can be as little as 500ml a day. That quota includes not only plain water but any food or drink such as coffee, tea, juice, soup, gravy, porridge and even ice cream that contributes to your fluid intake at room temperature.  Such is the constant struggle for chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients who are on dialysis. And for good reason: They pass very little or no urine at all as a result of their reduced kidney function. This means that fluid build-up in the body can lead to issues such as heart problems or fluids in the lungs if they don’t control their fluid intake.  And while you may have heard of dialysis, you may not be aware that some of these patients have to have an arteriovenous or AV fistula surgically created beforehand. It involves stitching an artery and vein in the forearm together to create a reinforced access point for the two dialysis needles. This reinforcement is crucial because, unlike a one-off blood withdrawal during a health check or blood donation drive, the vein has to be sturdy enough for repeated use.  Those are the experiences that Job Loei, a CKD patient of 39 years, is all too familiar with. “Kidney patients can be very conscious of our fistulas,” Loei shared when asked about his. “An experience I had on the MRT was with two youths who reacted visibly shocked when they saw my arm, like, why does it look like that?” he said of the thick, keloid-like protrusion running down the length of his left forearm.   But lest you think the 57-year-old, who works as a manager at a non-profit organisation, is a pale, frail recluse, you’d be in for a surprise. In the online interview with CNA Lifestyle, it was evident that his deep tan and trim figure could pass him off as an active 40-something. Loei’s fit appearance isn’t the only thing that surprises most people. At an unusually young age of 18, he was diagnosed with chronic glomerulonephritis in both kidneys, which refers to the inflammation of the organs' tiny filters. It came as a shock to him as he was a school athlete then and didn’t have a family history of kidney disease – or any prior medical history for that matter.  “It was one of the most unforgettable experiences in my life,” said Loei of the results he received from his medical check-up for national service. “I was naive and didn’t realise that it was a serious condition. I thought it could be treated.”  The avid runner enlisted nonetheless but life was an emotional yoyo from then on. There were frequent hospital visits to make and urine samples to submit. “I’d get panic attacks and feel nauseous from the fear of hearing more bad news. And the anxiety would last a few days after each appointment,” he said.  “But after a while, my life would reset to normal. It’s how we are as humans, right? We become accepting of our situation and go back to our lives. But the anxiety would peak again at my next appointment. That was my life then.” Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is when the kidneys are not able to function normally, which leads to the body’s inability to remove waste and water effectively, said Dr Alvin Ng, a senior consultant nephrologist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital’s The Kidney & Transplant Practice.  “CKD is irreversible as the kidneys would already have undergone damage before the disease is detected,” he said. “The severity of kidney disease can range from mild to moderate and severe kidney impairment.” The disease's prevalence increases with age with nearly 30 per cent of CKD patients coming from the 70-to-74 age group, according to Singapore's National Population Health Survey 2020. Older patients also typically suffer from diabetes, hypertension or have a family history of kidney disease.  In contrast, the causes of CKD in young people are usually ""urine blockages, reflux nephropathy (the backflow of urine into the kidney), birth defects or nephrotic syndrome (your body passes out too much albumin, a protein that helps your body to get rid of excess fluid)”, said Dr Ng.  DON'T EXPECT TO LIVE LONGER THAN SEVEN YEARS It was in his 20s when Loei started to feel the symptoms of kidney failure, which can include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, fatigue, sleep problems, urinating more or less, decreased mental sharpness and/or muscle cramps. “Kidney disease is such that you don’t feel any symptoms in the beginning. I was at age 24 or 25 when my symptoms started to surface,” he said. In addition, he developed very painful gout and mild hypertension as well. That was also the time he started dating and he wanted to know where his future was heading. How long could he expect to live? Is his condition hereditary? Would his offspring develop kidney disease, too? “My girlfriend knew about my health and was accepting of it,” he said. Her parents? Not so.  “I was told that my kidneys were damaged but I had no idea to what extent,” he recalled. “The doctor did not explain to me my CKD stage, like if you’re Stage 3, you can slow down the kidney deterioration by watching your diet,” he said. Instead, the young man was told: Don’t expect to live longer than seven years.  “It was difficult in the beginning. I visited her parents and I was honest with them. I am thankful that they eventually gave us their blessings. She’s now my wife,” he said, smiling. At age 27, nine years after he was first diagnosed, Loei’s doctor brought up the need for an AV fistula procedure before he could undergo haemodialysis. “I didn’t know about other options such as peritoneal dialysis, which didn’t require a fistula. At that time, there weren’t any renal coordinators or medical social workers like what they do now in hospitals,” he said. “I had no such provisions. I had to believe what the doctor told me”. It was only a year after his fistula procedure that Loei began dialysis. (He didn't require dialysis immediately and moreover, a fistula takes about six to 12 weeks to mature before it can be used.) “The first thing that came into my mind was, without this machine, I could die. This was it. I would be stuck to this chair for the rest of my life. “That was the day I thought to myself: I had to give up my dreams. I love to travel. I wanted to work in the air force or become an air steward. But it was no more. I couldn’t even dare to imagine the chance to travel,” he said. COMING OUT OF THE DARK Dark days for the father of one followed and he became “depressed and fearful”. “My son was about two years old when I started my dialysis,” he said, describing how his boy would shy away from him when he saw the tubes of blood.  His wife and son would sometimes accompany him on those four-hour sessions at the dialysis centre. “My wife felt very helpless and didn’t know what to do. My parents started blaming themselves for how my health turned out,” he said.  Loei couldn’t let the negativity inside him affect his loved ones after seeing the change in them. “That was the turning point. I had to be strong, at least for my boy. I probably wouldn’t live very long but even so, I could still give my son a good childhood. So I decided to change.”  Two of the milestones he’d achieved in the dialysis chair was earning his master's degrees: One in social work and the other in counselling from Monash University in Australia. “I think I’ve spent over 4,000 days on dialysis so far,” he said, based on the thrice weekly sessions he’d been going for. “I myself am overwhelmed. But I’m thankful I have the chance to live this long.”  Haemodialysis: The dialysis machine removes blood from the patient, cleanses it of toxins, extra salt and fluids, then returns the cleaned blood to the patient. It also helps patients maintain balance in their potassium, sodium and chloride levels as well as keeps blood pressure under control. Peritoneal dialysis: A fluid is introduced into the patient’s abdomen through a permanent tube placed in the peritoneal cavity. The fluid circulates through the abdomen to draw impurities from the surrounding blood vessels in the abdominal cavity and is then drained from the body. There are two types of peritoneal dialysis: Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and automated peritoneal dialysis (APD). Haemodiafiltration: The process is similar to haemodialysis but it can also remove more middle-molecular-weight solutes. The advantages of this treatment are better control of hypertension and hyperhydration. TAKING CHARGE Loei’s zest for life is evident in his pictures. A gleeful, pre-pandemic photo of him paragliding in Switzerland, a fitspo selfie captured in the office gym… they all point to a man who is making lemonade with the lemons that life has given him.  Take his wish to see the southern lights, for instance. The nearest country for that is New Zealand but “it would have been impractical for me to travel long hours to get to the dialysis centre there”, he explained. “And I’m not comfortable to perform my own dialysis on a portable machine.” So he did the next best thing – and upgraded to a trip to Switzerland instead. “There was paragliding and it was something I’ve always wanted to try. I am very thankful that my wife told me to travel before I reached 55,” he laughed.  There are currently more than 8,500 dialysis patients in Singapore, according to the Singapore Renal Registry Annual Report 2020. About 5.7 new patients are diagnosed daily. However, 95 per cent of people with mild chronic kidney disease (CKD) do not know they have it. Almost half of people with severe CKD are completely unaware they are ill.  “In most cases of progressive kidney disease, the body can adjust to the build-up of toxins and the patient will only feel unwell once their kidney function falls below 15 per cent,” said Dr Alvin Ng, a senior consultant nephrologist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital’s The Kidney & Transplant Practice.  ""It is recommended for anyone from age 30 to have a kidney health check,"" said Dr Ng. If the person has risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, a family history of kidney disease or is a smoker, they should check earlier."" CKD can be detected with a urine and blood test. Most times, an ultrasound scan of the kidneys is also done, he added. He was also among the first kidney patients to go for the COVID-19 jabs, including the booster shot. “I seized the opportunity. Some patients are concerned about the side effects. I was aware of them and I’ve read about people dying from the side effects. But I believe the shots are for my own protection. That’s why knowledge is very important. You need it to make informed decisions.”  Loei’s mantra ""knowledge is power"" hasn’t gone unnoticed at work and among hospital staff; he is often asked to counsel kidney patients. “Just before the pandemic, I was asked to talk to a 19-year-old, who was about to enlist in the army and was diagnosed with kidney disease,” he shared. “He had to undergo certain procedures that totally freaked him out. It reminded me of myself. “Immediately after getting the call, I went down to the hospital. He was crying when I got to the ward,” he said. “Some of the procedures were unpleasant. I told him, ‘You don’t have to go through them. You have the right not to. I believe the doctor can find other ways and means to help’. I was able to calm him down.” ANOTHER HEALTH SCARE Loei’s positive attitude has stood him in good stead, even when he had another health scare after 10 years of dialysis. “I was diagnosed with a pulmonary valve leak and I needed a bypass. I was scared and sad. But I had 10 years of experience dealing with my health, so I knew what I can do to help myself.” So, Loei did something most patients wouldn't think of doing: He took up jogging – and was able to eventually forgo the bypass surgery. “The beginning was difficult as I hadn’t been exercising for a long time. It took a lot of willpower and discipline. Finally, I was able to jog three or four times a week; each time covering 10km. And I jogged regularly for many years.”  These days, he’ll wake up at 4.45am to jog at Bedok Reservoir on his non-dialysis days. “I’ll finish with stretching and a shower at around 7am and start my work at home.”  Even though he is taking things slower now (he covers 6km instead), his fitness routine is still enough to put some individuals half his age to shame. When he’s not jogging, he’ll spend three to four hours riding his foldable bicycle from Tampines to Pasir Ris Park and sometimes, all the way to East Coast Park.  EXERCISE IS KEY How does Loei cope with exercise-induced thirst when, as a CKD patient, his fluid intake has to be severely limited? “Because I lose fluid through perspiration, I am allowed more water than the average patient,” he explained, noting that he drinks about one litre of water a day when he exercises. It is a stark contrast to the other patients, who may only be allowed 500ml or 800ml of fluid a day. “That’s why I always encourage patients to exercise,” he said. Being active has also reaped him other health benefits. For one, he no longer has to take medicine for hypertension. “Some patients have 10 different types of medicine. At this point, I only take about four or five pills a day, including my cholesterol meds and multivitamins.” Certainly, a strict diet is crucial to kidney patients but that hasn’t stopped Loei from eating out. “I eat out most of the time. I usually opt for economy rice because I can control what I eat better. And because of my exercise, I no longer have hypertension, so salty food has less of an impact on me.”  However, he still adheres to food that is low in phosphorus, potassium, sodium and oil. “If you don’t control your phosphate intake, it will affect your bone health. If you eat too much high-potassium fruits or vegetables, for example, it will impact your heart,” he explained.  Loei's secret to looking and feeling good is simple. ""Because of how I care for myself, I don’t look like a patient. And sometimes, I forget about my condition,"" he said. His advice for fellow kidney patients? ""Your body needs treatment but you also need to equip yourself with knowledge. You need to control your water intake, eat properly, take your medication, stay compliant with your treatment and exercise. More importantly, you have to stay positive."""

And when these multipurpose compounds are used in food packaging, they have a way of transferring to the food itself. To say that PFAS are difficult to avoid is an understatement. Although these substances have been in use for eight decades, regulators have only recently acquired the scientific understanding and technical capacity needed to test for them at the very low concentrations – measured in parts per trillion – at which they are present in food, according to the Food and Drug Administration. In light of those advances, the FDA recommends not reading too much into the fact that a given product might have “detectable” levels of the chemicals. “Even when there have been detectable levels of PFAS,” the agency said, “our safety assessments have shown no cause for avoiding these foods.” Cava, a fast-casual Mediterranean restaurant whose packaging has high levels of PFAS, according to Consumer Reports, began phasing out the compounds from its products in August but has run into supply chain issues that delayed the process, a Cava representative said in a statement. Nathan’s Famous began phasing out PFAS from its wrappers in 2020, completely eliminating its traditional red and green striped bags, the company said, and will stop using products that include PFAS by design before the end of the year. McDonald’s and Burger King said they were committed to removing all PFAS from their packaging by the end of 2025. From packaging and products, PFAS have found their way into rainwater, soil, sediment, ice caps, and outdoor and indoor plants. The substances have been detected in the living tissues of animals around the world. “It’s in the Arctic. It’s in the polar bears. It’s in trees. It is at the bottom of the ocean,” Keith Vorst, an associate professor at Iowa State University who studies the levels of PFAS in products, said in an interview. “We have literally polluted our planet.” OK, BUT – WHY – ARE THEY EVERYWHERE? Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances are a group of more than 1,000 chemical compounds that were discovered in 1938 by a young chemist named Roy Plunkett who was working at DuPont at the time. Their first use was as the nonstick agent in Teflon. They have since been added to an array of products to make them resistant to heat, water, oil and corrosion. The chemical composition of PFAS – they are created by fusing carbon and fluorine atoms – makes the compounds practically unbreakable. “They’re called forever chemicals because they’re incredibly persistent,” said David Andrews, a senior scientist for the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organisation. “The carbon-fluorine bond itself doesn’t break apart in the environment, and so once the chemicals are released, they typically spread out.” Because they do not easily degrade, they can accumulate in our bodies and the environment when ingested or otherwise internalised. Their indestructible nature also means that they can cross-contaminate everything they touch, Vorst said. And as we now know, everything they touch is, well, virtually everything around us. As an example, Vorst said to imagine a factory that intentionally used PFAS in its products. Even if that factory completely stopped using the compounds today, traces of PFAS would still be found in the company’s products in 10 or 15 years if it continued to use the same production plant. It can take four to 15 years for levels of PFAS to reduce by half in the human body, and it can take centuries for the substances to disappear from the environment, researchers said. “A net-zero PFAS concentration is impossible,” Vorst said. “All we can hope for is getting as close to zero as possible.” DO I NEED TO BE WORRIED? Long-term exposure to PFAS has been linked to an increased risk of some cancers, immune system suppression and problems with fetal development. Some PFAS contain compounds that could accumulate in the lungs and have been linked to more severe cases of COVID-19. “Once they get into the body, they like to hang out in the blood because they like to stick to proteins in our blood and interact with all sorts of different molecules,” said Jamie DeWitt, a professor of pharmacology and toxicology at East Carolina University. “That’s why we think they produce the health effects that they produce.” And although scientists and regulators agree that PFAS should be taken out of use as soon as possible, they also say that the chemical is “not an immediate threat to health,” David Savitz, a professor of public health research at Brown University, said in an interview. “It’s a subtle threat, so people have a hard time knowing what to make of it,” he added. “We want to curtail exposure, but it is not an immediate disaster.” SO HOW DO YOU GET RID OF THEM? ARE THERE ANY EFFORTS TO REGULATE? In short, we will never get rid of them – at least not in our lifetimes. Most current PFAS regulations concern how much of the chemicals can be present in water, but regulations for their use in products have generally been handled at a state level. “Right now the biggest thing we can do is phase it out of production,” Vorst said. In the last decade, many companies have voluntarily removed PFAS from their products, and contamination rates in human blood have decreased, Savitz said. In October, the Biden administration revealed a plan to combat PFAS pollution. In the same month, the Environmental Protection Agency also released a “PFAS Strategic Roadmap” in which it laid out plans for further research into PFAS and for the development of usage guidelines. But advocates say this might be too little, too late. Since the 1960s, the FDA has been aware of how PFAS affect the body, Melanie Benesh, a legislative lawyer with the Environmental Working Group, said in an interview. The first evidence that PFAS were toxic to the body was submitted to the FDA by DuPont, where the chemicals were created, in 1966. But the reports did not immediately spur new regulation. “That resulted in the ultimate lack of regulation and has left us scrambling to try and address this issue now.” Benesh added. “This was really a preventable crisis.” By Isabella Grullon Paz © The New York Times Company This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/apple-huawei-best-smartwatch-track-sleep-steps-2609151,Commentary: Is it weird to develop a relationship with your smartwatch?,"SINGAPORE: Like so many people, working predominantly from home meant that I had pockets of free time in the mornings and evenings after work to fill with exercise. A walk here, a run there, a swim or cycling to the park. Before long, tracking my routine to see how much exercise I had done seemed like a good idea. I caved in and bought a low-end smartwatch.  It worked like any other watch at first but slowly, things began to change. First was the number of steps the watch was counting. I became mildly obsessed with reaching the golden 10,000 number. Because when I did, the watch offered a little celebratory graphic and awarded me a medal (“well done!” never felt so gratifying). If I had had a particularly sedentary day, it would have barely moved past 5,000 steps and I would be annoyed and vow to make up for it the next day. The second thing was the sleep tracker. I was amazed at what the graph produced; there is now evidence of my awful sleep patterns - waking up in the middle of the night on most nights and finding it hard to go back to sleep. I can legitimately tell people this is why I am tired by 8pm. It was validation of the best kind, because, there was now data. The final and best bit was the watch telling me it was time for me to get up and move – aided by a cheerful visual of a man doing stretches. I never questioned the wisdom of this instruction. Whenever it pinged, I sprang out of my chair and did the necessary stretching. And then one day, the watch simply didn’t turn on. It wasn’t the battery and there were strange lines on the interface. In a most unhelpful manner, I tried tapping it on my palm, as if it were a person who had fainted and needed to be revived.  Since nothing worked, I had to leave it alone but after months of getting used to the watch, I felt slightly disoriented. How was I to know what my swim distance was? Or how many steps I'd taken?  It was then that I realised I had formed a relationship with an inanimate thing. Alas, there was simply no turning back. The question is: Is it unhealthy to rely on a watch? Writing in the New York Times in January this year, Lindsay Crouse (whose bio includes her best marathon timing – 2:53), declared that she was all but done with her smartwatch. She argued that she was getting far too addicted to the numbers that her watch was spitting out, making her desperate to know what her watch thought of her workout performance that day. She calls this “self-quantification” – which refers to how data that tells a human being what they did or need to do takes away a critical part of our ability to listen to our bodies. “Once you outsource your well-being to a device and convert it into a number, it stops being yours. The data stands in for self-awareness. We let a gadget tell us when and how to move, when we’re tired, when we’re hungry,’’ writes Crouse. She’s right of course. Like all of our devices, once we are plugged in, there’s no way out of the dependency. Just look at all the Netflix shows we consume or all the social media we scroll.  But unlike Ms Crouse, I love my smartwatch and think its benefits far outstrip the risk of dependency. Indeed, I am part of a million-strong tribe that has embraced wearable technology. According to data provided by analytics firm Strategy Analytics, the Apple Watch outsold the Swiss watch industry in 2019 – 31 million units shipped worldwide, compared to 21 million for all Swiss watch brands.  It’s not just Apple of course. Wearable technology in itself is a growing market. Consultancy firm Deloitte estimates the global electronic wearables market will grow to €77 billion (S$104.5 billion) and the smartwatch market to €22 billion in 2022.  Leading the charge are smartwatches whose market was valued at 68.59 million units in 2020 and is expected to reach 230.30 million units by 2026. In 2019, even the Health Promotion Board partnered with Fitbit to get Singaporeans to sign up – with a free health tracker thrown in. It’s no secret why people have been drawn to wearable technology. Just look at the sheer convenience that it offers – not only do they monitor your health (things like your blood pressure, heart rate and very COVID-19-relevant oxygen levels), but they also allow you to pay for items using a smart wallet, look at messages that come in if your phone is not on hand and even take calls while making a salad. Higher-end smartwatches even have something called a “hard fall” detection alert – the watch recognises a drop in your vitals when you’ve had a bad fall, perhaps an accident, and immediately sends out a message to your emergency contacts.  And this is what apparently happened to a motorcyclist in September last year. The 24-year-old was a victim of a hit-and-run accident in Ang Mo Kio and his watch had sent out a message to his girlfriend who was able to arrive at the exact location.  I imagine that this would be very useful to older folks who are out and about on their own. Psychiatrists have reported that digital dependency has increased in the past two years. They are seeing people who have trouble sleeping and focusing at work – partly due to excessive screen usage. In a way, the smartwatch is like an extension of our smartphones and smart TVs. But unlike watching mindless K-drama shows on Netflix or doomscrolling on social media, a smartwatch offers an altogether different relationship. While it records your every physical move, the truth is, it can also influence you to make better personal choices.  And this is where Ms Crouse and I differ. She sounds like a highly driven athlete. I take two hours to finish a 10km walk and she runs 42km in that time. And because I am not likely to go overboard in my physical activity, my smartwatch is quite an ideal companion. I don’t obsess about the statistics, in fact, I’ve all but given up looking at my sleep data (it is what it is).  But like a good and kind teacher, my watch cheers me on when I have met my goals, it reminds me when I haven’t and mostly, it influences me to keep to my word. I’ve set a goal to exercise for 30 minutes a day and expend about 400 calories.  Truth be told, I hardly reach the daily calorie goal but I do my best to devote half an hour of the day to what I consider to be excellent free mental health therapy. I don’t fret about not meeting my step count anymore, it just gives me an indication of the type of day I’ve had: Sedentary or active. That it even tells me at the end of the day to reflect on the kind of day I’ve had must be a good thing, because I find myself thinking of things to be grateful for instead of griping about all the things that made me cross that day. It feels like I am doing better because my watch tells me to do better. And I can’t imagine this is a bad thing.  After the troubles with my first smartwatch, I’ve decided to invest in a better one. And so far, our relationship is steady. Until of course, suddenly out of the blue, it stops working or horrors, goes missing. Then I may be a bit more bereft than I should be.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-vaccines-sinovac-pfizer-moderna-singapore-study-2625511,People who got Sinovac vaccine nearly 5 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 than Pfizer: Singapore study,"SINGAPORE: People who took Sinovac’s CoronaVac vaccine are nearly five times more likely to develop severe symptoms from COVID-19 than those who received the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine, a Singapore study has found. The study, published on Tuesday (Apr 12), involved about 2.7 million people in Singapore aged 20 and above who received two doses under the national vaccination programme. It covered a seven-week period in 2021 from Oct 1 to Nov 21, when cases in Singapore surged due to the Delta variant. The team, which included infectious diseases experts from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and the Ministry of Health (MOH), observed a lower relative effectiveness of the two inactivated whole virus vaccines - Sinovac and Sinopharm - against COVID-19 infection compared to the mRNA vaccines - Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. Those who received the Sinovac vaccine were 4.59 times more likely to have severe COVID-19 compared to those who received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. They were also 2.37 times more likely to be infected, compared to those who took the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Severe disease was defined as those requiring oxygen supplementation in hospital, intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death. The findings also suggest that the Moderna vaccine is more effective at preventing severe disease than the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Those who took the Moderna were found to be less than half (0.42) times as likely to develop severe COVID-19 than Pfizer-BioNTech recipients, and they are also less likely to be infected. Citing a report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the higher effectiveness of the Moderna vaccine was likely because of the higher mRNA content in the Moderna vaccine and longer time interval between the jabs. (IRR = adjusted incident rate ratio) “Individuals vaccinated with two doses of inactivated whole virus vaccines were observed to have lower protection against COVID-19 infection compared with those vaccinated with mRNA vaccines,” the study stated. “Nevertheless, both mRNA vaccines and inactivated whole virus vaccines provide sufficient protection against COVID-19 severe disease and vaccination remains a key strategy against the pandemic.” As of noon on Tuesday, about 96 per cent of the eligible population in Singapore have been vaccinated under the national vaccination programme. About 73 per cent have received their booster shots. The study’s authors included NCID’s executive director Leo Yee Sin, chair of the expert committee on COVID-19 vaccination Benjamin Ong, MOH senior assistant director Wycliffe Wei, as well as MOH director of communicable diseases Vernon Lee. The study aimed to compare the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines and inactivated whole virus vaccines in the same population. The findings will be useful for guiding policy recommendations to prevent infection and reduce strain on the healthcare system, the paper said. Of the 2,709,899 individuals involved in the study, about 74 per cent received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, 23 per cent took the Moderna vaccine, while 2 per cent received the Sinovac vaccine and 1 per cent the Sinopharm vaccine. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was approved for use under the programme in Singapore on Dec 30, 2020, while the Moderna and Sinovac vaccines were approved on Feb 3, 2021 and Oct 23, 2021 respectively. From Aug 30, 2021, the Sinopharm vaccine was also available at private healthcare institutions, but not part of the national programme. The cohort was restricted to those two weeks after completion of two vaccine doses to allow sufficient immune response, and who had received their second dose within 120 days of the analysis. A total of 107,220 of those vaccinated were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to have COVID-19 over the study period, and 644 developed severe disease. While the study was based on “comprehensive national data”, the team said there were “several limitations”. This included the “residual confounding” from comorbidities as well as factors that influence a person’s choice of vaccine or risk of exposure. There were also asymptomatic cases who did not see a doctor and were not recorded as cases. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/covid-19-shanghai-lockdown-patients-crowdsource-medical-help-2621681,Shanghai patients crowdsource medical help during COVID-19 lockdown,"BEIJING: Shanghai residents have turned online for grassroots help on medical treatment as the city's tough COVID-19 curbs limit access to healthcare and fuel frustration and anxiety. While the city of 25 million has used lockdowns and extensive testing to fight the disease, those suffering from other medical conditions are posting requests for help in mutual-help platforms and social media chat groups. One woman said she sought help online as her worry grew over the risk of infection to her paralysed mother from a urinary catheter used for about a month. ""Typically, replacing the catheter would take 10 minutes, but the nearby hospital that we usually go to is now sealed up,"" said the woman, who wanted to be identified by her surname Zhou. Zhou said about five hospitals had turned her away as their departments that perform the procedure had suspended operations. Even when treatment is available, some patients say they have been unable to access transport or get permission to leave residential compounds. It is also tough to find accurate information on the services each hospital offers, others told Reuters. While the government of China's commercial capital urged hospitals in March to ensure ""green channels"" for non-coronavirus patients with urgent needs, such as dialysis or cancer therapy, many have still struggled to access care. Volunteers have stepped in to help. One, who uses the name Amy, said a patient received detailed instructions on how to navigate a bureaucratic thicket to cross the Huangpu river, which divides Shanghai, and get hospital treatment on the other side. A spreadsheet, created by university students, has drawn about 1,600 requests for help, but a recent drop to about 50 new daily requests, from roughly 200 a week ago, suggests access is improving, the spreadsheet's creator said on condition of anonymity as COVID-19 is a sensitive subject in China. However, uncertainty about access to medical facilities persists despite a tentative easing of lockdown in some parts of Shanghai. Authorities have said curbs would be reimposed if new infections emerge. A health official warned that for the next few days infections will remain high. While China, ruled by the Communist Party, has an uneasy relationship with civil society groups working outside official channels, authorities do not appear to have interfered with efforts to help with health care access in the Shanghai outbreak. Informal networks have stepped up previously, for example offering online help to find antiviral medications in the central city of Wuhan, early in the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak. Asked for a comment on recent such activities, the Shanghai government responded by sharing an article on initiatives to support COVID controls by the city's largest volunteer group, backed by the Communist Party and founded in 1997. It made no further comment. While Zhou's mother's situation has not been resolved yet, and many medical resources are beyond the reach of grassroots platforms, going online has aided some people. A man, surnamed Pei, who was struggling to get cancer medicine for his father, said a volunteer added him to a chatroom that showed which pharmacy was able to supply the medicine, after which members in the chatroom helped deliver it across the Huangpu river. ""It is very helpful,"" Pei said. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/pregnancy-40-above-risks-challenges-2616171,Pregnancy at 40 and beyond: What does it mean for you and the baby?,"In October last year, CNA Women ran a story about a mother who had lost three pregnancies. Among the comments left by readers on social media, one theme stood out: There were women who were trying to get pregnant, or who had given birth, in their 40s.   “I have two angel babies, and I’m still trying hard to get over it. Although I’m turning 40 next week, I’m praying hard and trying hard – hoping I can be as strong and receive a rainbow baby,” wrote one woman.  Said one father: “You never fail unless you give up. My wife and I are over 40 years old and expecting our first baby this coming December.” Said another woman: “I had my baby when I was 43. Never give up and you are halfway there.” Having a baby in your 40s isn’t as uncommon as you’d expect. Statistics from the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority show that the number of live births from women aged 40 to 49 has increased – from 1,618 in 2014 to 1,827 in 2020. There’s “certainly (an) increasing trend” in Singapore for women above 40 who are pregnant or looking to conceive, noted Dr Roland Chieng, the founding medical director of Virtus Fertility Centre.  The usual reasons, he said, include couples marrying later in life, as well as them being “undecided about childbearing”. Getting married later also means having children later, said Dr Jessie Phoon, Director and Senior Consultant at KKIVF Centre, at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH). She added that women aged 40 who came to KKIVF Centre seeking fertility treatment used to comprise a very small group. “However, since 2020, we've seen more women from this age group coming forward for fertility treatment.” Another reason for couples having babies later: “Many young couples are delaying their pregnancies due to long waiting times for their HDB flats or not being able to afford a property when they were younger,” said Dr Tony Tan, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at Tony Tan Women and Fetal Clinic, and Medical Director of Alvernia Obstetric Screening Centre at Mount Alvernia Hospital. THE SUCCESS RATES The question then: Is age really just a number when it comes to pregnancy? And if you’re in your 40s, how can you mentally prepare yourself for a baby – and life as an older mum?   While medical studies tell us that a woman’s fertility declines sharply after the age of 35, it doesn't mean that you can’t ever get pregnant after that. In fact, many women do get pregnant and have healthy children – and well into their 40s, too.   Dr Tan pointed out that the “majority” of pregnant women aged 40 or above who do not miscarry in the first trimester go on to have successful, uneventful pregnancies. “Many medical tests and interventions now exist to reduce some of the risks faced in the second and third trimesters,” he said.  Dr Chieng added: “Age alone should not be the only consideration whether you should have a pregnancy. It is best to always discuss this with your doctor.” However, do note that if you are trying to conceive for the first time, it’s more difficult to get pregnant in your 40s, said Dr Ng Kai Lyn, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at Astra Women’s Specialists at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital.  Even if you have had children before, she advised women in their 40s to seek professional help early if they face difficulties in getting pregnant. “Fertility potential is the highest before 30, and by the age of 40, only two in five of those who wish to have a baby naturally will be able to do so,” said KKH’s Dr Phoon. Diana Cheng, who is 40 and recently gave birth to her fifth child, told CNA Women that although she knew that hers was considered a high-risk pregnancy, she believed that “age is just a number”.  She was 33 when she had her first child. “When we got married, we were keen to have children but chose to prioritise our couple time first, and travelled extensively when we were younger.” WHAT TO EXPECT: INCREASED PHYSICAL CHALLENGES AND EMOTIONAL STRESS   When it comes to managing a pregnancy later in life, you may find it a lot more physically and emotionally taxing as compared to when you were younger, said Dr Ng. Cheng shared the same sentiment: “At night, it would almost feel as if my hip was dislocated, and it was painful to lift up my leg to walk. That was the toughest challenge, as I had never experienced difficulties walking in previous pregnancies.”  She also said she felt the “largest” and “heaviest” in her last pregnancy. Dr Choo Wan Ling, an obstetrician and gynaecologist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, said this was “quite common” in older mums, as the abdominal muscles may get more lax with each pregnancy, which makes them feel less supported.   Then, there’s also the added stress over potential pregnancy complications, Dr Ng said. “As a woman’s age increases, there is a higher risk of the baby having an abnormal number of chromosomes – the most common one being Down syndrome.” The risk of having a baby with Down syndrome is one in 952 at the age of 30, as compared to one in 100 at 40 years, she added. “In a similar vein, the risk of having a baby with genetic problems is one in 66 at age 40, compared to one in 385 at age 35.” Expectant mums in their 40s should expect more visits to see their ob-gyn throughout the pregnancy for frequent checks on maternal and foetal well-being, Dr Ng added.  Aside from tests for Down syndrome and gestational diabetes, which Dr Choo said are offered to all pregnant women regardless of age, preeclampsia screening is an option given to older mums when they're 12 weeks pregnant.  This is especially to put their minds at ease, she explained, adding that if the woman's risk of developing preeclampsia is high, her doctor may start her on aspirin as a preventive measure.  CONSIDER THE SOCIAL CHALLENGES  Some social concerns of having a child in later years include the child losing a parent at a young age, which could be a stressful event, especially in the absence of other siblings for support, Dr Phoon of KKH pointed out.  “It could also mean that the young adult will have to be burdened with the heavy responsibility of caring for his or her aged parents at a tender age. Generational issues and the challenges of meeting the emotional and physical demands of parenting are also very real,” she added.  Additionally, Dr Tan of Mount Alvernia Hospital said that older mothers tend to have more, and heavier, responsibilities at work too – and therefore could be emotionally more stressed than younger mothers.  But there’s an upside to being in your 40s.  Most women would already have a level of financial stability, compared to younger women. Older mums would worry “slightly less” about finances as they would have already set aside a proportion of the necessary expenses, said Dr Ng.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/coolsculpting-cryolipolysis-fat-freezing-linda-evangelista-2612506,Fat freezing and Linda Evangelista’s rare condition: How it all went wrong for the supermodel,"If you’re familiar with the OG supermodels of the 80s and 90s, there's no missing Linda Evangelista. At the height of her career, the Canadian model was fashion industry royalty. She was a muse to photographers and designers (including the late Karl Lagerfeld), and the face that graced more than 700 magazine covers worldwide.  Who can forget that racy Freedom! music video featuring George Michael, Evangelista herself and the rest of the supermodel posse? Or that infamous quote in Vogue: ""We don't wake up for less than US$10,000 a day""? But it wasn't remuneration that kept the model off the catwalk and out of the public eye for six years since 2016. In her interview with People magazine in February this year, the 57-year-old finally revealed her reason.  She had apparently undergone seven sessions of the fat-freezing procedure known as CoolSculpting on her chin, thighs and bra area. The treatments were carried out between August 2015 and February 2016. But three months after the sessions, Evangelista claimed that those areas she’d wanted to shrink were growing, hardening and turning numb.  ""I tried to fix it myself, thinking I was doing something wrong,"" Evangelista told People. She began dieting and exercising more, and ""got to where I wasn't eating at all. I thought I was losing my mind"".  When she finally saw a doctor in 2016, Evangelista was diagnosed with paradoxical adipose hyperplasia (PAH) – a rare condition that accounts for about one in 20,000 treated patients. The same year, she underwent the first of two full-body liposuction surgeries. Post-surgery, she wore compression garments, girdles and a chin strap for eight weeks, which she claimed was to prevent the PAH from recurring. It didn't help, according to her, even after her second liposuction in 2017. ""It wasn't even a little bit better,"" she said. ""The bulges are protrusions. And they're hard. If I walk without a girdle in a dress, I will have chafing to the point of almost bleeding. Because it's not like soft fat rubbing, it's like hard fat rubbing."" In addition, she isn't able to ""put my arms flat along my side. I don't think designers are going to want to dress me with that... sticking out of my body"", she said, referring to the bulge under her arm as seen in the People photo above. HOW DOES COOLSCULPTING WORK IN THE FIRST PLACE? CoolSculpting uses a process known as cryolipolysis. Interestingly, it was supposedly invented serendipitously by observing kids eat popsicles. The co-founders of the process discovered that when children let their icy treats rest in their mouths against the cheeks for several minutes, it produced an effect called cold-induced fat necrosis, according to Harvard Medical School. The effect caused inflammation in the fat but not the overlying skin, leading to the conclusion that fat was more sensitive to cold injury than other tissues.  So they created a cooling device and tested it on pigs in 2007. The result? There was a half-inch reduction in the pig’s fat layer but no damage to the skin. By 2010, the first cryolipolysis technology was approved for use by the US Food And Drug Administration but only for love handles at first; soon, other body parts such as the thighs, abdomen, bra area, underside of the buttocks and chin were allowed.  As for how cryolipolysis really works, no one knows for sure how, according to Harvard Medical School. It suggested that the cooled fat cells die a few days after treatment and over the next few months, macrophages, which form the immune system’s clean-up crew, digest the dead fat cells. WHAT IS THE PROCESS LIKE? Cryolipolysis does not involve anaesthesia, needles, cuts or the insertion of any instrument into the body. Rather, the treated area is “sucked” into an applicator, which then uses freezing temperatures to break down the fat cells, according to Medical News Today.  The non-invasive process is said to be relatively painless, save for the cold sensation and soreness that is similar to that experienced “after an intense workout or minor muscle injury”. There may also be redness, swelling, tingling, numbness or a deepening of the skin’s colour.  In Singapore, only certified doctors are allowed to carry out the procedure. WHO IS A SUITABLE CANDIDATE? “It is not a weight-loss procedure,” said Dr Coni Liu, a dermatologist at DS Skin & Wellness Clinic, where CoolSculpting has been offered since 2018.  “Ideal candidates are people looking for reduction of specific stubborn areas of fat, who are near their healthy weight and not overtly overweight. They have ‘pinchable’ fat at stubborn areas that is difficult to eliminate despite diet and exercise,” she said. WHAT IS PAH EXACTLY? Dr David Loh, a general practitioner and the president of the Society Of Aesthetic Medicine (Singapore), explained that PAH happens when the fat cells ""react by growing into bigger fat deposits with more fibrous connective tissue among them"". ""This presents as a swelling of the treated area. The swelling is also tougher and firmer to touch than normal fat deposits."" When Dr Loh had a tissue biopsy done on a patient who developed PAH in Singapore, he said that “some enlarged fat cells, and increase in blood vessels and cells that suggest an inflammatory reaction” were found. At this point, you might be wondering: Why did Evangelista persist with the CoolSculpting sessions and even purportedly had a total of seven? She might have been encouraged by the “slight reduction” of the areas after each session. Yes, even patients with PAH can notice such improvements, according to Dr Loh.  But afterwards, that’s when things start to go belly up. “PAH generally develops four to five months after treatment but may be seen as early as two months,” said Dr Joyce Lim, who is the dermatologist at Joyce Lim Skin And Laser Clinic.  HOW COMMON IS PAH IN SINGAPORE? Dr Liu felt that PAH is generally “under-reported”. Even so, the local incidence rate is low, she said, ranging from 0.05 per cent to 0.72 per cent as reported in international studies. “None of our patients have experienced PAH, but there is a handful of local reports,” she said. Dr Loh’s aforementioned patient is one such case. “I also had two other patients who had CoolSculpting done by other doctors and were referred to me for the treatment of PAH. And I hear of at least a handful of cases from my colleagues in Singapore,” he said. “The incidence is not at all high, considering the hundreds of CoolSculpting treatments I have done since 2011.”  Dr Lim shared the same observation on the incidence rate in Singapore. “I have been offering CoolSculpting for over 10 years and I have not encountered any PAH cases,” she said.  WHO IS PRONE TO PAH? According to Dr Liu, it is impossible to predict which patients may be prone to PAH after receiving cryolipolysis treatments. “We are unable to predict the factors that predispose patients to PAH as there are currently no tests a patient can undergo prior to cryolipolysis,” she said. However, studies have hypothesised that certain fat tissues may be “naturally selected” to survive cryolipolysis, she added. “It is thought that signalling molecules called hypoxia-inducible factors or HIFs initiate a cascade in the body that causes blood-vessel growth and ultimately, the enlargement of existing surviving fat cells and the creation of new fat cells in PAH,” said Dr Liu. The three PAH patients whom Dr Loh saw were all men in their 30s to 40s. “You could say they were the tough, stocky type” who have “tougher-than-usual skin and fat deposits”, he said. “Of course, in my small sample size, this could be just a coincidence,” he continued. “But my theory (male with a tough, stocky body type being more prone to PAH) has been corroborated in various meetings with overseas colleagues, though not in published studies.”  According to Dr Loh, ethnic groups with dark skin tones such as some Asians, Africans and Polynesians may have a higher risk than Caucasians of PAH as “they tend to have thicker skin and denser fat deposits”. “Males are more likely than females for the same reasons,” he said. However, Dr Loh’s hypothesised profile of the typical PAH patient does not match the supermodel at all. What does it mean then? “We don’t have the actual answers as PAH is a rare and new phenomenon,” he said. “There isn’t much found in medical literature.” CAN PAH BE TREATED? Yes, it can, according to Dr Loh. But it will involve the invasive techniques that patients wanted to avoid in the first place such as liposuction. You wouldn’t want to use another non-invasive method to treat PAH, he explained, as it may, “in theory, cause a similar reaction with the fat cell deposits expanding instead of dying”. “Only when we physically remove the fat deposits do we then resolve the problem,” he said.  Even so, you’ll want to wait and see first before going straight for the cannula. “We know that the dense fibrous tissue in PAH is a reaction to the thermal shock of CoolSculpting,” said Dr Loh. “So, in the absence of any further shocks, it may gradually resolve. But how long will it take to resolve, if at all, we don’t really have the answers yet.”  The best treatment result is also often had after the affected area has softened first, according to Dr Liu. This normally occurs in six to nine months after the initial cryolipolysis procedure, she said. Then, fat-removal procedures such as power-assisted liposuction, vaser liposuction, liposuction or abdominoplasty (aka tummy tuck) may be used.  Dr Loh’s first PAH patient, for instance, waited nine months. It was only after the “PAH did not change a single bit” that he decided on a fat-removal procedure. The PAH was “successfully removed” after two rounds of treatment, followed by wearing a compression garment to bring down “the usual two to three weeks of swelling”. The second patient required only one round of fat-removal treatment; the last patient opted to “wait and see” but did not return for further treatment."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/30-minutes-exercise-day-benefits-2612691,Is 30 minutes of exercise a day enough and can you squeeze it all into the weekend?,"For anyone interested in the relationship between exercise and living longer, one of the most pressing questions is how much we really need to stay healthy. Is 30 minutes a day enough? Can we get by with less? Do we have to exercise all in one session, or can we spread it throughout the day? And when we’re talking about exercise, does it have to be hard to count? For years, exercise scientists tried to quantify the ideal “dose” of exercise for most people. They finally reached a broad consensus in 2008 with the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, which were updated in 2018 after an extensive review of the available science about movement, sitting and health. In both versions, the guidelines advised anyone who was physically able to accumulate 150 minutes of moderate exercise every week, and half as much if it is intense. But what’s the best way to space out those weekly minutes? And what does “moderate” mean? Here’s what some of the leading researchers in exercise science had to say about step counts, stairwells, weekend warriors, greater longevity and why the healthiest step we can take is the one that gets us off the couch. AIM FOR THE 150-MINUTE SWEET SPOT “For longevity, 150 minutes a week of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity clearly is enough,” said Dr I-Min Lee, a professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. She has extensively studied movement and health and helped draft the current national physical activity guidelines. For practical purposes, exercise scientists often recommend breaking that 150 minutes into 30-minute sessions of speedy walking or a similar activity five times a week. “It is quite clear from numerous large-scale, well-conducted epidemiological studies that 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity most days lowers the risk of premature death and many diseases, such as stroke, heart attack, Type 2 diabetes and many types of cancer,” said Ulf Ekelund, a professor specialising in physical activity epidemiology at the Norwegian School of Sports Sciences in Oslo, who has led many of those studies. Moderate exercise, he continued, means “activities that increase your breathing and heart rate, so the exertion feels like a five or six on a scale between one and 10.” In other words, pick up the pace a bit if your inclination is to stroll, but do not feel compelled to sprint. CONSIDER EXERCISE SNACKS You also can break up your exercise into even smaller segments. “It doesn’t matter whether exercise is done in a long, continuous 30-minute session or is dispersed across the day in shorter sessions,” said Emmanuel Stamatakis, an exercise scientist at the University of Sydney in Australia who studies physical activity and health. Recent studies overwhelmingly show that we can accumulate our 150 weekly minutes of moderate exercise in whatever way works best for us, he said. “Many people may find it easier and more sustainable to squeeze in a few dozen one-minute or two-minute walks between work tasks” or other commitments. “There is no special magic to a sustained 30-minute session of exercise” for most health benefits. Think of these bite-size workouts as exercise snacks, he said. “Activities like bursts of very fast walking, stair climbing and carrying shopping bags provide excellent opportunities for movement snacks.” To concentrate the health benefits of these workout nuggets, he added, keep the intensity relatively high, so you feel somewhat winded. Conceivably, you also could cram all of your exercise into long Saturday and Sunday workouts. In a 2017 study by Dr Stamatakis and colleagues, people who reported exercising almost entirely on weekends were less likely to die prematurely than those who said they rarely exercised at all. But being a weekend warrior has drawbacks. “It is certainly not ideal to spend the work week totally sedentary and then try to compensate” over the weekend, Dr Stamatakis said. You miss many of the health benefits of regular exercise, such as improved blood-sugar control and better moods, on the days you do not work out, he said. You also increase your risk of exercise-related injuries. COUNT YOUR STEPS The exercise recommendations remain the same if you measure your exercise in steps instead of minutes. For most people, “150 minutes of exercise a week would translate into about 7,000 to 8,000 steps a day,” Dr  Lee said. In a large-scale new study by Dr Lee and Dr Ekelund of the relationship between steps and longevity, published in March in The Lancet, the optimal step count for people younger than 60 was about 8,000 to 10,000 a day, and for those 60 and over, it was about 6,000 to 8,000 a day. CONSIDER MORE Of course, these recommendations about steps and minutes focus on health and life spans, not physical performance. “If you want to run a marathon or a 10K race as fast as possible, you need much more exercise,” Dr Ekelund said. The recommended 150 minutes a week also may be too little to stave off weight gain with age. In a 2010 study of almost 35,000 women that was spearheaded by Dr Lee, only those who walked or otherwise exercised moderately for about an hour a day during middle age maintained their weight as they became older. So, if you have the time and inclination, move more than 30 minutes a day, Dr Lee and the other scientists said. In general, according to her research and other studies, the more active we are, well beyond 30 minutes a day, the more our risks of chronic diseases drop and the longer our lives may be. But any activity is better than none. “Every single minute counts,” Dr Ekelund said. “Walking up the stairs has health benefits, even if it only lasts for one or two minutes, if you repeat it regularly.” By Gretchen Reynolds © 2022 The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/post-covid-psychosis-hallucination-delusion-mild-condition-2600786,Commentary: Post-COVID psychosis is a rare but frightening condition,"PERTH: Far from the respiratory disease it seemed at first, COVID-19 can impact almost all parts of the body, including the brain. For a small number of people, COVID-19 infection may be accompanied by an episode of post-COVID psychosis, a break from reality which can be frightening for the patient and their loved ones. Psychosis is a condition characterised by confused thoughts, delusions and hallucinations. People with psychosis can struggle to tell what’s real from what isn’t. Psychosis occurs in “episodes” which may last for days or weeks. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, reports of post-COVID psychosis have come from all over the world. Post-COVID psychosis is different to psychosis seen in other brain illnesses and diseases. So-called “first episode psychosis” is usually seen in teens or young adults in the development of schizophrenia, or alongside dementia in elderly people. But people experiencing post-COVID psychosis are typically in their 30s, 40s and 50s, and are experiencing psychosis for the first time. They usually do not have any family history of psychosis. People with post-COVID psychosis also frequently have insight into the way they are feeling. They can recognise this is not normal for them, and something has changed in the way they are thinking. Based on the small number of reports so far, the start of psychosis has been days, weeks or even months after COVID-19 diagnosis. While the symptoms of post-COVID psychosis can be varied, there are some commonalities: People usually have problems sleeping, followed by paranoid delusions and hallucinations. Some people feel compelled to hurt themselves or others. The scientific evidence of post-COVID psychosis comes mostly from “case reports”, which are research papers describing symptoms and recovery of individual patients. In the first and most widely reported case, a 36-year-old American woman developed psychosis approximately four days after she started having mild COVID-19 symptoms. She became delusional, thinking that her partner was trying to kidnap her children. She was convinced she was being tracked through her mobile phone. After trying to pass her children through a fast-food restaurant drive-through serving counter to protect them, she was taken to hospital for care. After one week of in-patient care to treat her psychosis, she was discharged. Her delusions did not return. In another case, a 43-year-old Bulgarian man began experiencing psychosis two days after he was discharged from hospital for severe COVID-19. He believed the doctors had faked the results saying his COVID-19 illness had resolved. He also had delusions that he had already died and his organs were rotten. He became a danger to his family, believing he should kill them to “spare them the same slow suffering”. After two weeks of treatment in hospital, his psychotic symptoms resolved and did not return. Other case studies have reported people having delusions that patients in the hospital were actors and medical staff were trying to harm them, hearing voices speaking in foreign languages or telling them to take on grand tasks, like saving the earth. The cause of post-COVID psychosis is not well understood. Some scientists think it could be due to persistent inflammation in the brain, prolonged inflammatory signals in the body or due to changes in blood vessels in the brain. There is new evidence that brain areas undergoing change in mild COVID-19 infection may also be areas that change in people who are at risk of, or who are experiencing, first-episode psychosis (that is, not after COVID-19 infection). These areas are the orbitofrontal cortex at the front of the brain, and the parahippocampal gyrus - a key memory region deep in the brain. These regions may shrink in both mild COVID-19 and psychosis. However, more research is needed to understand this link. COVID-19 is not the first virus to be linked to psychosis. During the “Spanish flu” influenza pandemic of 1918 there were reports of post-viral psychosis. Psychosis has been reported after infections with the other human coronaviruses, like those that cause Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Links between coronaviruses, immune system activation and psychosis have also been found, suggesting COVID-19 may not be the only coronavirus capable of causing psychosis. Just how common is post-COVID psychosis? The evidence to date suggests it is rare, occurring in about 0.25 per cent of COVID-19 cases who are not hospitalised (and likely have a mild infection), and 0.89 per cent of people who are hospitalised for COVID-19. Because there have been so many cases of COVID-19 worldwide, isolated reports of post-COVID psychosis may stand out more. The frightening nature of what people might experience means we might hear more and more about them on social media and in the news. Although the risk of post-COVID psychosis is low, people who have had COVID-19 and their families should look out for any sudden changes in personality, paranoia or delusions in the days, weeks and months following infection. If these signs are noticed, seeking medical help is vital. Most cases of post-COVID psychosis resolve quickly with proper psychiatric care and treatment with medication.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/egg-freezing-reactions-singapore-womens-development-white-paper-2611496,Elective egg freezing: A welcome initiative or just more gender bias? Here’s what Singapore women think,"When the White Paper on Singapore Women’s Development was released on Mar 28, the topic that got the most reaction was the recommendation to allow elective egg freezing. It drew countless responses, with many giving their hot take on the issue. The White Paper was debated for over nine hours on Tuesday (Apr 5) with Parliament giving unanimous support for the Paper’s 25 action plans, including social egg freezing. As someone who has suffered multiple miscarriages (a different type of fertility issue), egg freezing would have offered this writer a different route to having children.  When I asked peers, business associates and friends of friends, the responses were varied. Women welcomed the choice to do so, while others felt that more could be done to widen its parameters.  SO, WHAT’S THE BIG DEAL ABOUT EGG FREEZING? The White Paper recommended that women between the ages of 21 and 35 be allowed to freeze their eggs for non-medical reasons, regardless of marital status.  Currently, women can only freeze their eggs, retrieved from their ovaries for medical purposes. One example is if a woman is a cancer patient undergoing chemotherapy, which would affect her chances of conception. The White Paper said that the Singapore Government recognised that women may not have found the right partner at a younger age and elective egg freezing would allow them to preserve their fertility and have a chance to conceive should they marry later on. Elective egg freezing will be implemented in 2023 and pre-procedure counselling will be mandated. Counselling will include learning about the procedure’s invasive nature, its limitations (it does not guarantee a success rate nor a live birth) and the challenges of pregnancy and parenthood later in life. Naturally, this includes the high costs of elective egg freezing such as storage and insurance.  Women who undergo elective egg freezing and choose to use their eggs later on may do so only within the confines of marriage. Currently, assisted reproduction may only be done at approved centres in Singapore, and Singapore citizens, PRs and foreigners alike must be married in order to do so.  WHAT DO WOMEN REALLY THINK ABOUT EGG FREEZING IN SINGAPORE? The women CNA Women spoke to mostly had positive reactions.  Said Jan Jee, 29, a regional corporate communications manager: “It's a bold, yet timely step to support women, regardless of marital status and health issues, in preserving their fertility. It is one way to show inclusivity – by making egg-freezing a choice for women.  “There are limitations still and I think women should be given the freedom to make their own call with their eggs but yet have realistic expectations for any complications that follow.” Another felt this step was important. Theodora Ho, 30, a marketing manager, said: “I welcome the initiative. It empowers women with the choice to delay parenthood for whatever reason.  “While motherhood may not be guaranteed or some might not even use their eggs ultimately, I suppose the key is having the opportunity to try for a baby if and when these women decide to,” she added. Karen Lu, a consultant in her 40s, said: “Early in my 30s, before I settled down and had my child, I looked into egg freezing outside of Singapore. I probably would have done it if the procedure and the cost wasn’t such a challenge.” Other women said the initiative was a long time in coming.  Eunice Ng, a private banker in her 30s, said: “I’m all for this. IVF (in-vitro fertilisation) is allowed but we’ve not had the option (to freeze our eggs) before.”  She added that marriage and children don’t happen like clockwork but at the same time, a woman’s biological clock doesn’t stop ticking. “Egg freezing takes away that stress of having to give birth by that certain age.” THIS IS GREAT BUT… Other women did find issues with the White Paper recommendations on social egg freezing.  #1 WHY MUST I BE MARRIED TO USE MY OWN EGGS? Many felt that if women are enabled to keep their eggs frozen, then they should be allowed to use them in any way they want.  Sarah Ng, 26, an advertising executive said: “Egg freezing is definitely a progressive move. My concern is that it is too restrictive for a woman’s eggs to be used only in a family unit. Even if they had their eggs frozen, they may not find a suitable partner to have children with.  “There should be no discrimination of (marital) status for the use of a woman’s egg,” Ng added. Sue Tay*, 44, a lawyer and mum of three, felt that while the move was a progressive one, its conditions were not in tandem with the current mindset and that as a mum, she would want more for her daughter.  “I want her to have the autonomy to decide what to do with her eggs. If she chooses to freeze her eggs and chooses to marry, have a partner to raise a child or do so on her own, it becomes her decision.” Tay added that she was disappointed that the choice had already been taken away from women from the start.  “What if my daughter is married to someone who’s not present in child rearing? Being married to someone who isn’t 100 per cent into parenting can be more stressful than doing it alone,” she added.  The sentiment was shared by Nadirah Mohd, 27, an early childhood educator. “It is restrictive to only allow married couples to use frozen eggs for procreation. Single women would like to have children too but may not have found a suitable partner to realise this goal. They may still (want to) raise their child independently with the support of their extended family or friends.”  #2 WHY CAN’T I USE MY EGGS AT ANY TIME?  Previously, women who underwent IVF in Singapore could do so up to the age of 45. Women under 40 were allowed to do 10 cycles of IVF while those above 40 were allowed five, until they turned 45.  Since January 2020, these limits have been removed. However, women above 40 still need to consult a gynaecologist who will assess their ability to carry their assisted babies to term – which in effect, still imposes a time limit on women who want to freeze their eggs. The women CNA Women spoke with felt this was ageist and restrictive, considering life expectancy in Singapore is one of the highest in the world and as at 2020, life expectancy was 83.9 years, according to the Singapore Department of Statistics.  Jaclyn Lee, a marketing director in her early 40s, felt that current trends needed to be taken into consideration – such as couples marrying later in life or facing a second chance at parenthood at a later age.  She said: “The trend for marriage and parenthood is later, and later. Similarly, fertility options should follow suit. More people are finding financial stability or reasons to have children a lot later in life. It is only reasonable to allow women to use their frozen eggs any time they want.” Leann Choo*, 40, who works in hospitality, wishes she had been given the option to freeze her eggs in Singapore earlier. She did so overseas when she was undergoing a painful divorce a few years back. Now in another relationship, she said that regardless of age, the choice to undergo assisted reproduction should be left with women.  #3 THANKS BUT NO THANKS, IT’S NOT FOR ME.  Then, there are others who welcomed elective egg freezing but felt it wasn’t in their best interests even if they had the choice.  Nadirah, the 27-year-old early childhood educator, said: “It gives women the freedom to pursue our careers and personal goals first but personally, I would not opt for it as I do not intend to have children.”  Said Ann Kang*, an entrepreneur in her mid 40s: “If I had the choice when I was between 21 and 35, I may have done it at that stage of my life. But knowing what I know now as a parent, I may not want to go through with assisted reproduction due to the rising standards and costs of living, especially raising a child in my 40s in Singapore.”   Her view is shared by Meredith Chan, 39, a product manager. “Were it available to me then, I would have frozen my eggs with the intention of using them in my later years. But that is only if I had the financial means, family support and mental capabilities to get through middle-age with a young child. Otherwise, definitely not, as it would bring about other problems.”   Agnes Ng, 56, a financial consultant and mother of three, felt that elective egg freezing would give women a certain amount of freedom with their youth and fertility – she would encourage her children to do so, but with caveats.  “I am all for it because it doesn’t confine them to getting married and having children by a certain age. But if I didn’t have a partner, I wouldn’t want a child on my own. It’s already challenging to bring up a child with a husband – things like PSLE and exams, teenage angst and all. As much as I love my children, those were tough times. I wouldn’t want to do all of that alone.”      HOW TO MAKE IT MORE INCLUSIVE? The women CNA Women spoke to felt that Singapore needed this option but as a country and society, we’re a long way from what it can be.  Ann Kang, the entrepreneur, surmised: “More needs to be ironed out. It is flawed in some respect as it doesn’t look at the current culture or trends, nor does it cover wider policies which may make it more positive for women to have children.”  Another felt the restrictions could backfire. “The age for egg retrieval and elective freezing should be increased to 42 – women live longer and we’re healthier now anyway. And if the Government is concerned about Singapore’s population growth, the focus should be to aid anyone who is serious about building their family – on their own, or married,” said Yvonne Chan, 44, a business development director.  Making information available to women earlier is also a key factor – regardless of age and fertility issues. Designer Laura Teng, 43, and a mother of one, went through several fertility treatments including IVF in her late 30s before conceiving her child at 40 via intrauterine insemination. “I feel we need to educate women better on these options. If I knew the choices available to me when I was younger, I would have done egg freezing when I was 30, to save myself a lot of heartache and money. In fact, I would encourage my daughter to freeze her eggs as insurance to preserve her own fertility.” Ultimately, elective egg freezing gives women more possibilities and for others, it’s freedom. “I would leave this for my girlfriend to decide. It’s her body and her future. Either way, I’m fine with her decision,” said Calvin Ong, 37.  My own husband summed it perfectly: “Elective egg freezing gives women hope for the future.” And if I took away all the limitations currently in place, I would agree with him too.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/mindfulness-mental-wellbeing-inner-fitness-2611016,Want to become healthier? You might want to start by giving 'inner fitness' a try,"When I first started writing about health more than 20 years ago, my columns mostly focused on the physical body: A healthy diet, exercise and screening for disease were regular topics. But over the years, the health lessons that have stayed with me haven’t been about physical change. The biggest improvements in my own health and well-being have come from inner fitness. Inner fitness means focusing your energy on your emotional well-being and mental health rather than berating yourself about your diet, weight or not getting enough exercise. It can include mindfulness and meditation techniques, a gratitude routine or a variety of other practices. This inside-out approach to health ultimately can lead to changes in your physical well-being, too. Research shows, for instance, that mindfulness can lower blood pressure, improve sleep, lead to better eating habits and reduce chronic pain. “Inner fitness means developing the mental, emotional and spiritual skills and practices that foster resilience,” said Tina Lifford, author of The Little Book of Big Lies: A Journey Into Inner Fitness. “I’d like to see the idea of inner fitness become as ubiquitous, well understood and actionable as physical fitness.” Lately, because I’ve decided it’s time for a change, I’ve been reflecting on the lessons I’ve learned about inner fitness since starting the Well section nearly 15 years ago. As I depart The New York Times for a new opportunity, I’d like to leave you with some of the most memorable tips for inner fitness that I’ve collected in recent years. GIVE YOURSELF A BREAK The field of self-compassion has exploded since I first wrote about it in 2011. The concept is simple: Treat yourself as kindly as you would treat a friend who needs support. About 75 per cent of people who find it easy to be supportive of others score very low on self-compassion tests and are not very nice to themselves, said Kristin Neff, an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin and an expert on self-compassion. If you often berate yourself for perceived failures, like not losing weight or not being a better parent or spouse, try taking a self-compassion break. Start by asking yourself: What do I need right now? BE GENEROUS Our bodies and minds benefit in a variety of ways when we help others. Studies show that volunteering, donating money or sharing advice with friends can release the brain’s feel-good chemicals and activate its reward system. Volunteers had lower stress hormones on days when they donated their time. “One of the best anti-anxiety medications available is generosity,” said Adam Grant, an organisational psychologist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, when I interviewed him for one of my favorite stories of the pandemic, called The Science of Helping Out. PAY ATTENTION Good things happen when we pay attention. We’re more able to manage negative thinking when we take a moment to notice negative thoughts. Watching for small wonders around us when we take an “awe” walk can amplify the mental health benefits of exercise. Identifying your feelings and naming them – something scientists call “affect labeling” – can calm your brain and reduce stress. FIND YOUR CALM Learning to quiet my mind and soothe my anxiety has been the greatest benefit I’ve gained from writing about health. I use meditation apps often – lately I’ve been listening to the teachers of the Unplug app, who helped us create Meditations for Uncertain Times. I learned “five-finger meditation” from Dr Judson Brewer, director of research and innovation at Brown University’s Mindfulness Center. I also like to find mindful moments in everyday activities, like brushing my teeth or savoring a morning cup of coffee. GIVE YOURSELF THE BEST HOURS OF THE DAY What one- or two-hour period in each day do you feel your best? Your most energetic? Your most productive? Now ask yourself: Who gets those hours? Chances are you’re spending those highly productive hours on work demands, paying bills, sorting through emails or managing the needs of the household. But now that you’ve identified the time of day when you’re feeling your best, try giving that time to yourself instead, advises Jack Groppel, an executive coach and professor of exercise and sport science at Judson University in Elgin, Illinois. For me, this advice has been transformative. Giving yourself your best time each day to focus on your personal goals and values is the ultimate form of self-care. MAKE FRESH STARTS Katy Milkman, a professor at Wharton and author of the book How to Change, has studied the science of new beginnings, which she calls the fresh-start effect. She and her colleagues have found that we’re most inclined to make meaningful changes in our lives around “temporal landmarks” – those points in time that we naturally associate with new beginnings. New Year’s Day is the most obvious temporal landmark in our lives, but birthdays, the start of spring, the start of the school year or a new job are all temporal landmarks that create psychological opportunities for lasting change.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/voice-strain-zoom-meeting-honey-water-lozenges-humidifier-2608661,You might not realise it but the pandemic is taking its toll on your voice – here’s what you can do,"A lot has happened in the past two years. We’ve had to get used to wearing masks and working remotely from home. But all those changes don’t mean we’ve reduced our communication. In fact, we now have to work harder at making ourselves heard, be it via Zoom or in our masked selves.  Refrains ranging from the polite (“can you please repeat that?”) to the impatient (“huh?”) often crop up in our conversations – and they may be repeated more often – and in louder and more forceful measures, too – as people struggle to make themselves heard from behind masks or screens.  Not only that. “Because it is hard to read body language clearly from small screen images, you may be filling the silence by talking more than if you were in an in-person meeting,” noted Francoise Lim, a principal speech therapist at Tan Tock Seng Hospital’s (TTSH) Department of Otorhinolaryngology. “Or you may be speaking louder than necessary if you perceive people cannot hear you.” Posture plays a part as well, said Lim. “If you are hunching over your laptop, this adds to the reduced breath support for speech as well as the strain to your neck and back.” Repeat this many times over the course of a day, multiply that by weeks and it’s no wonder that many people are feeling sore in the throat or sounding hoarse. “Since the pandemic started, we have noticed increased functional voice problems among the patients we see,” said Dr Chew Hui Sing, a consultant from the Department of Otorhinolaryngology at TTSH, who is speaking on voice loss at this webinar.  HOW YOUR VOICE IS PRODUCED To put it simply, your voice is produced when air vibrates your vocal folds and those vibrations get shaped and amplified by your throat, mouth and nose. It all happens in your voice box or larynx, where you'll find two bands of muscle tissue known as vocal folds. When you are not speaking, the vocal folds are opened so that you can breathe, according to the US National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders. When you speak, the vocal folds snap together. This action allows air to blow past the vocal folds and vibrate them, creating your voice. As for your pitch (how high or low your voice sounds), tone (how your voice sounds on the whole) and volume, they are dependent on the size and shape of your throat, nose, mouth. Like your very own built-in Esplanade Theatre, they resonate and amplify the vibrations produced by your vocal folds. When the vocal folds fail to close, ""it can result in a weak, breathy voice, vocal fatigue and effortful speech"", said Dr Chew. ""You may also experience choking or coughing, especially on drinking.” What about when you find yourself suddenly unable to produce any sound when you speak? If you were strenuously using your voice within the last 24 hours, a sudden loss of voice could indicate bleeding in the voice box, said Dr Chew. You’ll want to rest your voice and seek early medical attention.  If your hoarseness or voice change persists for more than two weeks – especially when you haven’t had a cold or flu, and you’re a smoker – you should consult a doctor, said Dr Chew. Seek early help, too, if you also have any of these associated symptoms to rule out cancerous growths: SO, DOES HONEY WATER REALLY WORK? In the meantime, should you be guzzling honey water or any other home remedies that are believed to be soothing? Technically, no food or drink comes into contact with your vocal folds, said Lim, otherwise, you would choke. “Drinking honey water, sucking on lozenges, and gargling with salt water may soothe your sore throat, but they work mainly to provide transient symptomatic relief,” she said.  “Some research suggests that drinking honey may help with sore throats due to its antimicrobial and wound-healing properties,” said Lim. “And this may give you some pain relief.” However, do not give honey or honey water to children under the age of one; honey may contain spores that have bacteria that can produce a toxin dangerous to infants, she warned.  Having said that, it is important to increase your fluid intake as fluids hydrate your body on the whole and, in turn, lubricate your vocal cords. “Well-lubricated vocal cords vibrate better and give you a better voice,” Lim explained. But avoid caffeinated drinks such as coffee, tea and cola soft drinks as well as acidic beverages such as fruit juices, she said. “The best drink is plain water.” Sip water throughout the day; you’ll know you’re well hydrated when your urine appears pale or almost colourless, she said. You might also want to forgo lozenges, especially if they contain menthol or peppermint, said Lim. The cooling sensation may numb your throat and temporarily mask the discomfort. But these ingredients can dry out and irritate your voice box, she said. “You may have a false sense that your throat is fine. As a result, you may continue to speak or shout, and further damage your vocal cords.” Instead, a humidifier may be a better bet than lozenges and drinking more water. “The water droplets in humidified air are breathed in rather than swallowed, and therefore, have direct contact with our vocal cords. This helps to improve the lubrication of the voice box,” said Lim.  Be prepared to have an oral scope performed to examine your voice box. Depending on what the doctor finds, you may receive medication, speech therapy or surgery. If you’ve been asked to rest your voice, don’t try to get around it by whispering or speaking softly. “Talking during this healing period can cause scarring and poor voice outcome with potentially long-term voice issues,” said Susan Goh, a principal speech therapist at Tan Tock Seng Hospitals Department of Otorhinolaryngology. “In some cases, your ENT doctor may advise you to rest your voice totally; for example, if you have just had surgery or a bleed on your vocal cord. The best thing to do would be to communicate through writing or text,” she said. If you have consulted a voice therapist, said Goh, you may also have been taught vocal exercises that can help with your vocal cords’ healing as well as techniques for easy voicing and projection.  OTHER REASONS – AND NOT THE CAT – THAT CAN GET YOUR TONGUE Besides straining your voice on video calls, there are some medical factors that can cause you to sound hoarse. “The changes to the voice box and the duration of hoarseness would depend on the cause,” said Dr Chew. Here’s a look at what they are and why they make you sound like the raspy-voiced Awkwafina.  Cold: The most common cause is a cold or respiratory tract infection. “The nasal cavities play an important role in the resonance of your voice,” said Dr Chew, so it is not unusual for you to sound muffled when you are having a cold.  The voice box itself may also be “inflamed or swollen” due to the infection or from “repetitive coughing or throat clearing”, she said, adding that such hoarseness usually resolves by itself within two weeks.  Nasal allergies: Nasal congestions caused by nasal allergies can affect your voice’s resonance, as can the post-nasal drip – the feeling of mucus moving down the back of the throat, said Dr Chew. Because of this back-dripping mucus, your throat gets irritated, making you cough or clear your throat – and those actions, repeated over time, can irritate the voice box and lead to hoarseness.  Reflux related: “Gastric acid can rise and damage the voice box,” said Dr Chew. You’ll know you’re losing your voice to gastric acid when you also have phlegm in the throat, the sensation of a ""lump in the throat"", throat clearing, bad breath or a bitter taste in the mouth, and an itchy and irritative cough. “The voice is usually worse in the morning or after meals,” she added. Benign growths: These include nodules, cysts and polyps, which can arise from the repetitive overuse or misuse of the voice, said Dr Chew. These growths can also be caused by excessive coughing or persisting to talk when you are ill. “Your voice can sound rough, and you may also experience vocal fatigue or discomfort with prolonged speaking,” she said. Muscle tension dysphonia or functional dysphonia: This condition is created by an imbalance in “muscle coordination and breathing during voice production”, said Dr Chew. As a result, there is “excessive muscle tension in and around the voice box when you speak”. You are also likely to feel “pain or tension in the throat while speaking or singing”, she said. Other than sounding raspy, your voice may also sound strained, weak and airy, or there’s no sound at all, said Dr Chew. There may be changes in your voice pitch, your voice breaks or you suffer from vocal fatigue – and these symptoms typically get worse after talking a lot or when you’re stressed or anxious.  Vocal cord paralysis: According to Dr Chew, there is commonly no obvious cause to the paralysis, although viral infections, growths on the voice box nerve (eg. thyroid cancer, tumour at the skull’s base, neck or chest) or damage to the voice box from previous surgeries can be possible triggers.  “Depending on the underlying cause, the paralysis may be temporary or permanent,” said Dr Chew. If the voice box nerve is not severely damaged or severed, “good recovery” can be made between three and nine months – although, in some cases, the recovery may be slower (over a year) and incomplete, she said.  Presbylarynx: Just as the rest of your body loses muscle mass as well as thins and dries out as you age, the same can happen to your voice box, too. In fact, its position can also become lower over time. “Your voice may gradually soften and you may find it more effortful to speak,” said Dr Chew. Hormonal changes may also affect the way you sound as you age, she said. In men, the voice generally becomes higher in pitch; in women, the opposite happens and they may sound lower in pitch. Such changes are gradual and do not affect your ability to communicate, she added. But if the changes occur early in life and/or impacts your daily life, seek medical help, she said. Cancer: It is not common but your risk is higher if you are a smoker, said Dr Chew. “Hoarseness can be the first sign. There may be other associated symptoms such as breathing difficulty, pain in swallowing, coughing out blood or blood detected in the saliva, neck lumps, or appetite or weight loss.” Uncontrolled hypothyroidism: Low thyroid hormones or hypothyroidism may cause the voice box to become swollen and heavy. This condition is known as polypoid corditis or Reinke's edema, explained Dr Chew. The resulting voice is often very low pitched and rough.  Neurological conditions: “Certain neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease can affect the voice,” said Dr Chew. Patients may have difficulty projecting their voices or experience vocal fatigue. When they speak, their voices may tremble or fluctuate in volume. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/vaping-cigarettes-quit-smoking-addiction-reduced-harm-2613571,Commentary: Trying to quit smoking? E-cigarettes may make things worse,"SYDNEY: A major review on the health effects of e-cigarettes reflects what public health advocates have feared: Escalating use of e-cigarettes in school-aged children, early warning signs of increased smoking rates in young Australians and direct health harms of vaping in all ages. The review, which was released on Thursday (Apr 7), was commissioned by the federal health department and conducted by researchers at the Australian National University. Overall, it found that the health risks from e-cigarettes significantly outweighed any potential benefits. The review should silence lobbyists, who have long used data selectively to promote the sale of e-cigarettes. This is despite the fact that previous reports, none as comprehensive and rigorous as this latest review, have delivered similar findings. The review looked at the evidence behind the health impacts of e-cigarettes or “vapes” – a diverse group of devices that aerosolise a liquid for inhalation. These are touted as a safer alternative to cigarettes and an aid to quit smoking. The review found conclusive clinical evidence that e-cigarettes cause acute (short-term) lung injury, poisoning, burns, seizures, and their use leads to addiction. They can also cause less serious harm, such as throat irritation and nausea. Evidence that e-cigarettes produce airborne particles in indoor environments (potentially harming non-users) was also conclusive. Among the evidence ranked as strong, the review confirms what has worried tobacco control experts since patterns of e-cigarette use first emerged: People who have never smoked or are non-smokers are three times as likely to smoke if they use e-cigarettes, compared with people who have never used e-cigarettes. This is a dream for tobacco companies and their retail allies. The review found limited evidence that e-cigarettes assist individuals to stop smoking. But this is no stronger than evidence showing that e-cigarette use might also cause former smokers to relapse and revert to tobacco. There is no conclusive or strong evidence in the review for any beneficial outcome from e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes might help some individuals stop smoking. So they should only be available via a prescription from authorised medical professionals trained in helping people to quit. Any access beyond this risks serious harm for no benefit. Australian Institute of Health and Welfare data shows that the age group most likely to use e-cigarettes in their lifetime are 18 to 24-year-olds. This has risen from 19 per cent in 2016 to 26 per cent in 2019. Of e-cigarette users who identify as smokers, the second largest user group is 14 to 17-year-olds. Dual-use is starting young, from the limited Australian Institute of Health and Welfare data we have. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare data precedes increasingly visible use of e-cigarettes in Australian schools, as reported in the media. The review also shows young males are the leading e-cigarette user group by age and sex. Australian males aged 18 to 24 are also the only age group that, on the latest Australian Institute of Health and Welfare data, is smoking at greater rates than they were three years earlier. Whatever benefits might be delivered by e-cigarettes, such as helping people to quit smoking, would, according to the review, be modest compared with the harms they are likely to cause. Unfortunately, public policy on the regulation of e-cigarettes is at risk of being influenced by powerful commercial interests. In the interests of public health, these forces must be resisted. Federal, state and territory governments have enacted policies aimed at providing e-cigarette access to individuals who might benefit from them to quit smoking while protecting everyone else. But the evidence on how widely e-cigarettes are used shows these policies need to be more tightly enforced. It’s still easy to buy e-cigarettes online, they are available without prescription from petrol stations, tobacconists and speciality “vape” stores, and are re-sold by entrepreneurs – all of them acting unlawfully. Heavy fines will end their cash incentive. The review shows that the risks to public health posed by e-cigarettes will only grow unless governments enforce their laws. This is to protect young Australians from becoming the first generation since trend data was collected to smoke and use nicotine at higher rates than their predecessors.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/exercise-can-help-anxiety-depression-how-2597561,Can moving the body heal the mind? Here's how it works,"When Jennifer Heisz was in graduate school, she borrowed a friend’s aged, rusty road bike — and wound up redirecting her career. At the time, she was studying cognitive neuroscience but, dissatisfied with the direction of her work and her personal life, began experiencing what she now recognises as “pretty severe anxiety"", she told me recently. Her friend suggested biking as a reprieve. Not previously athletic, she took to the riding with enthusiasm, finding it “soothed my mind"", she said. That discovery convinced her to change the focus of her research. Now the director of the NeuroFit Lab at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, she studies the interplay of physical and emotional health and how exercise helps stave off or treat depression, anxiety, stress and other mental health conditions. “The effects of motion on the mind are just so pervasive and fascinating,” said Dr Heisz. That idea animates her new book, Move the Body, Heal the Mind, which details the latest science about exercise and mental health, as well as her own journey from inactivity and serial emotional slumps to triathlon training and increasing serenity. Recently, I caught up with Dr Heisz to talk about her book and what it can tell us about mental health, the benefits of gentle exercise, the strains of the pandemic years and how to choose the right workout, right now, to raise your spirits. Our edited conversation follows. CAN WE TALK ABOUT EXERCISE AND ANXIETY, WHICH MANY OF US ARE FEELING THESE DAYS?   Exercise is extremely beneficial for reducing anxiety. At the end of every workout, in fact, you typically get a brief reprieve from anxiety, due to neuropeptide Y, which increases with exercise. It’s a resiliency factor. It helps soothe the anxious amygdala, which is the part of the brain that recognizes danger and puts us on high alert. For the last few years, with the pandemic, our amygdala has been on hyper-alert, setting off an almost constant stress response. This chronicity of stress starts to make our minds really fearful and you wind up with constant anxiety. Exercise, by up-regulating neuropeptide Y, helps soothe the anxious amygdala, dial down the fear and hyper-vigilance and keep us calmer. ANY PARTICULAR TYPE OF EXERCISE? The really nice thing is that light to moderate exercise, like walking, is enough. Research from my lab shows this kind of exercise reduces anxiety immediately after your workout and then, over time, if you keep exercising, reduces anxiety even more and for longer. It looks like about 30 minutes of this kind of exercise three times a week is good. Walking, cycling, swimming, dancing — a wide variety of activities work. WHAT ABOUT MORE INTENSE WORKOUTS? You need to be careful with really intense exercise and anxiety. If you’re feeling anxiety, you’re already under stress. High-intensity exercise is also a kind of stress. But our bodies only have, in general, one stress response. So, during intense exercise, you add extreme physical stress onto the stress your body already is feeling and it might all become too much. Right before the pandemic, I was training for a triathlon and doing a lot of high-intensity workouts. But once the pandemic started, I was feeling so much emotional stress, I couldn’t finish those workouts. So, I backed off. What I would tell people is that, when you’re already feeling stressed-out, prolonged, intense exercise may not be the right option. WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND PEOPLE DO INSTEAD? Aim for exercise that feels comfortably challenging, so your heart rate is elevated but not racing. For a lot of people, that would mean taking a brisk walk around the park or the block. DOES EXERCISE HELP IN THE SAME WAYS AGAINST DEPRESSION? Classically, depression has been blamed on a lack of serotonin in the brain, which anti-depressants treat. But for some people with depression the drugs don’t work well, probably because serotonin is not their problem. Many of us who study depression now think their problem may involve inflammation, which is linked to stress. The inflammation starts to damage cells in the body, inducing an immune response and increasing inflammation, which can then get into the brain, affecting mood. For those people, exercise may be the medicine they need, because it helps fight the inflammation. In studies, when individuals who haven’t responded to anti-depressants start exercising, they usually see significant reductions in their symptoms. HOW MUCH EXERCISE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? One study that looked at frequency, or how much exercise you need to combat depression, compared 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise a week, which is the standard exercise recommendation for physical health, with a quarter of that. And both groups benefited the same. So, it looks like the exercise prescription for mental health is less than that for physical health, which is kind of nice. IN TERMS OF HELPING TO POTENTIALLY COMBAT DEPRESSION, DO YOU THINK THE EXERCISE INTENSITY MATTERS?    It might. We conducted a study a few years ago with healthy students who were facing high-pressure final exams. Some of them rode stationary bicycles moderately three times a week for 30 minutes and others did shorter, more-intense interval cycling. A third group didn’t exercise at all. After six weeks, the students who hadn’t worked out showed symptoms of fairly serious depression, which had come on shockingly fast, and presumably from their academic stress. The students who had been exercising moderately, though, were less stressed out than they had been at the start of the study and their bodies’ inflammation levels were lower. But what’s really interesting to me is that the intense exercisers showed symptoms of increased stress, both physical and mental. So, it does look as if moderate exercise may be the most beneficial for mental health. YOU TALK FRANKLY IN YOUR BOOK ABOUT YOUR OWN BOUTS OF ANXIETY, STRESS AND OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER, INCLUDING AFTER THE BIRTH OF YOUR DAUGHTER AND LATER, YOUR DIVORCE. DID EXERCISE HELP YOU COPE?   It’s the key. Mental illness can happen to anyone, even people who seem to be handling things well. For me and many other people, life transitions, like divorce and childbirth, can be especially challenging. After my divorce, I really needed something to redirect my life. And I knew how potently exercise, as a stimulus, alters the brain. Someone mentioned triathlons. I was still biking then. So, I added in the running and swimming. AND QUALIFIED FOR THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS? Eventually, yes. But it took years. Then the championships were delayed by the pandemic and now I’m out of shape and will have to start training all over again. But that’s something to look forward to, really. What I find is that, in times like these, there is solace in exercise. In the peaceful moments after a workout, hope is alive. You feel like the world is right again. And that’s really special.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/moderate-drinking-protect-heart-genetic-study-2598261,Does moderate drinking protect our heart? A genetic study offers a new answer,"Last week, two patients asked Dr Stanley L Hazen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, how much daily alcohol consumption would be good for their cardiac health. He gave them both well-accepted medical advice: An average of about one drink a day helps the heart. “I didn’t give it a second thought,” he said. Then he saw a paper published in JAMA Network Open whose findings upended his thinking about what to tell patients. The paper, he said, “totally changes my life"". Its conclusion: There is no level of drinking that does not confer heart disease risk. The risk is small if people have an average of seven drinks a week when compared with none. But it increases quickly as the level of alcohol consumption rises. “Dose matters a lot,” said Dr Krishna G Aragam, a preventive cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and an author of the study. “Just realise that, as you go up beyond modest ranges, the risk goes up quite a bit.”The study, which may help resolve medical disputes over the effects of alcohol on the heart, involved sophisticated analyses of the genes and medical data of nearly 400,000 people who participate in the UK Biobank, a British repository that investigators use to study genes and their relation to health. The average age of subjects selected for the alcohol study was 57, and they reported consuming an average of 9.2 drinks a week. Some researchers have reported that drinking modestly protects the heart because moderate drinkers as a group have less heart disease than those who drink heavily or those who abstain. Aragam and his colleagues also saw that effect. But the reason, they report, is not that alcohol protects the heart. It is that light to moderate drinkers — those who consume up to 14 drinks a week — tend to have other characteristics that decrease their risk, like smoking less, exercising more and weighing less than those who drink more heavily and those who do not drink.   It’s not known why moderate drinkers tend to be more healthy than nondrinkers, Aragam said. But the Biobank study did not ask why people drank or abstained. Instead, it attempted to tease apart the effects of alcohol on the heart from the effects of other habits, behaviours and characteristics. To do that, the researchers used a method called Mendelian randomisation. Researchers have found genetic variants that predispose a person to heavier or lighter drinking. Because the variants are distributed randomly in a population, they can serve in a study as the equivalent of randomly assigning people to abstain or to drink at varying levels. Researchers can ask if those with variants that are linked to greater alcohol consumption have more heart disease and high blood pressure than those with variants linked to lower consumption. The investigators’ statistical analysis showed an exponential curve of risk with the gene variants that suggest they drink more. The risks of heart disease and high blood pressure started slowly as the number of drinks increased, but they quickly gained steam, soaring as people got into the abusive drinking range of 21 or more drinks a week. The actual risks to an individual depend on whether the person has other conditions, like diabetes or obesity. But, Aragam said, extrapolating from the results of the study, a typical middle-aged person in the study who did not drink had an estimated 9 per cent chance of having coronary heart disease. A person who had one drink a day had an estimated 10.5 per cent chance, which is small. After that, though, the risk increases quickly. Many earlier studies of alcohol consumption and heart health were observational, meaning the subjects were followed over time to see if the amount of drinking was linked to heart health. Such studies are only able to find correlation but not causation, researchers say. But the Biobank study’s use of Mendelian randomisation is more suggestive of causality, and so its results might carry more weight. “We have to start thinking about those moderate ranges and inform patients accordingly,” Aragam said. “If you are choosing to drink, you should know that beyond a certain level, the risk ramps up quite a bit. And if you choose to drink less, you will get the bulk of your benefit if you go to the seven drinks a week range.” Dr Amit V Khera, an author of the study and a cardiologist at Verve Therapeutics, said that, of course, the gold standard to assess the heart effects of drinking would be a large randomized clinical trial. Such a study, which would have randomized high-risk people to one drink a day or abstinence, was planned in 2017 by the National Institutes of Health. But it was terminated because the researchers had inappropriate contact with the alcohol industry when they were planning the study. Mendelian randomization techniques, Khera said, “are particularly helpful when a gold standard hasn’t been, or can’t be, done.” Despite the difficulties in doing a randomised trial of drinking, one recent study in Australia offered clues. It involved 140 people with atrial fibrillation, a form of heart disease. At the start of the study, participants reported drinking an average of 17 drinks a week. A randomly selected group of 70 were asked to abstain and managed to reduce their consumption to an average of two drinks a week. Over the six-month study period, those in the control group had atrial fibrillation 1.2 per cent of the time compared with 0.5 per cent for those randomised to abstain. Hazen, the cardiologist in Cleveland, said the new Biobank study made him wonder about the effects of increased drinking during the pandemic. Researchers have noted that people have been drinking more since the pandemic began, and a recent report found that the number of alcohol-related deaths shot up 25 per cent in 2020. Blood pressure also increased in the pandemic. Hazen and his colleagues, examining national data, found it rose on average by nearly 3 millimetres of mercury. “We had no idea how it was happening,” Hazen said. Changes in participants’ body weight did not account for the rise in blood pressure during the pandemic. The increase, which occurred in all 50 states and in Washington, DC, was a puzzle. Now, he has a new thought. “Oh, my gosh. Maybe increased drinking is accounting for the increase in blood pressure,” Hazen said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/squat-best-exercise-how-do-it-right-2587561,"If you can only manage one exercise, do the squat. Here's how","What is the single best strength-building exercise many of us could be doing right this minute but almost certainly are not? Consult enough exercise scientists and the latest exercise research, and the answer would likely be a resounding: Squats. “For lower-body strength and flexibility, there is probably no better exercise,” said Bryan Christensen, a professor of biomechanics at North Dakota State University in Fargo, who studies resistance exercise. The benefits are not confined to the lower body. “It is really a whole-body exercise,” said Silvio Rene Lorenzetti, the director of the Performance Sports division of the Swiss Federal Institute of Sport in Magglingen. “It requires core stability and trains the back.” Some people worry that squats can imperil the knees and hips, but the exercise can actually help protect and improve the workings of these and other joints, said Sasa Duric, an exercise scientist at the American University of the Middle East in Kuwait, who has studied squats. The movement “helps maintain the flexibility, stability and function” of hips, knees and ankles, he said. But perhaps most fundamentally, squats are key to living and ageing well. “When we clean the house or plant a vegetable garden, we need to squat,” Dr Duric said. Ditto for easing into and out of chairs and lowering ourselves to toddler level for face-to-face playtime. In essence, according to a 2014 scientific overview, squats are “one of the most primal and critical fundamental movements necessary to improve sports performance, to reduce injury risk and to support lifelong physical activity.” THE RIGHT WAY TO DO A SQUAT Squatting is simple, portable and potent. “You don’t need a gym,” Dr Christensen said. Anywhere with a few feet of open space will work, whether it’s a living room, office, stairwell, park or closet. And the only necessary equipment is your body weight. If you are new to squats, one of the safest, simplest ways to start, Dr Duric said, is with what is commonly called a box squat, so named because it is commonly done with an exercise box found in gyms. But you can also do these at home, in which case you’ll be using a chair, stool, bench or bedside. If you have lower-body disabilities or past injuries, talk to your doctor first about whether squatting is advisable for you. “Be patient and pay attention to proper technique,” Dr Duric said. “Do not rush the squat.” TO GET STARTED: Step 1: Find a chair or box high enough that, when you sit on it, your thighs are parallel with the ground. Keep your core tense and your chest up, with your back straight. Step 2: Set it a few feet from a wall. The wall’s straight lines can help align your body. Step 3: Stand facing the wall, chair behind you, feet about four inches from the wall. Place your hands on your hips or stretch them to the sides. Step 4: Keep your heels glued to the ground. Bend your knees slowly, through a count of five, lower yourself until your buttocks gently touch the box. Try not to actually sit. Rise from the box and straighten your legs through another count of five. HOLD THAT FORM: When you feel your box squats dialled in, you can ditch the box or chair and move to a free-standing, bodyweight squat. But keep paying attention to your form. “Squats are an excellent, excellent exercise, both to enhance functional capacity and reduce the risk of injury — provided the exercise is performed correctly,” said Brad Schoenfeld, a professor of exercise science at Lehman College in New York, an expert on weight training. The keys to a safe, effective, bodyweight squat for beginners, he and the other scientists agreed, are: Step 1: Situate your feet about shoulder-width apart and facing slightly outward, which is the easiest, most stable stance. Keeping your feet considerably wider or closer together or angled too far in or out, places potentially worrisome loads on the knees or hips. Step 2: Your head and spine should be aligned, chest up, eyes gazing straight ahead. Do not round your back by hunching or arching it. Step 3: Knees should move approximately in line with your toes as you squat — not splayed outward or buckling in — and not extending too far past the ends of your toes. Step 4: Squat as low as comfortably possible. Aim eventually to get your thighs parallel with the ground. But at first, if you cannot get that low, that’s OK. It is still a squat. Within these guidelines, experiment to find the movement that feels right for you. “There is no absolute best form for everyone,” Dr Schoenfeld said. “There are certain biomechanical principles that need to be followed,” he continued, “but then a person needs to determine what is most comfortable for him or her.” PROGRESS TO MORE CHALLENGING SQUATS: When, eventually, squatting with your body weight ceases to be challenging, you may want to pick up a dumbbell. “Over time, you will need to add resistance” if you want to keep growing stronger, Dr Schoenfeld said. This brings us to goblets and land mines. “There are plenty of squat variations,” Dr Christensen said. “The goblet squat is one of the most accessible.” An entry-level weighted squat entails holding a dumbbell or other weight close to your chest with both hands, as if you were cupping a goblet, and squatting (while maintaining good form). In a study he oversaw last year, goblet squats effectively targeted and strengthened the quadriceps, which are our front thigh muscles. The effects were especially pronounced in women. But they were not as good at working the hamstrings, the muscles at the back of our thigh. For that, the study found, you were better off with land mine squats, which are named for the land mine machine at gyms (named, for no apparent reason, after the explosive device), which consists of a pivoting barbell set diagonally into a stand on the floor. At the gym, you load the desired weight onto the pole, grasp the end with both hands, hold it near your chest, lift and then squat. This movement engages both the quadriceps and hamstring muscles, as well as other lower-body muscles, Dr Christensen’s study showed. But do not let yourself be intimidated by the squat-iverse. You know how to squat. We all do. The movement is elemental and essential. “The squat mimics so many physiological tasks of our daily living,” Dr Lorenzetti said. So, the “biggest mistake you can make” with squats, he concluded, “is to not start squatting"".

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tb-tuberculosis-singapore-treatment-cough-losing-job-2590826,Getting TB in Singapore: Recovered patient urges people to learn about endemic disease,"SINGAPORE: In 2020, Kelvin (not his real name) had a double whammy. He was diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) and found himself out of a job for about six months while undergoing treatment.  It all started in May that year when the 23-year-old had a persistent cough that did not improve despite medication and a visit to a doctor. On his second visit to the doctor, he was referred to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), where he was diagnosed with TB. Speaking to the media ahead of World TB Day, which falls on Mar 24 every year, Kelvin said he was not aware of TB before he contracted it. “At first, it was not easy to accept my diagnosis. I felt shocked and found it difficult to accept. I thought it was an ordinary cough,” he said. Losing his job temporarily as a retail associate in a large chain was an even bigger burden, said Kelvin, who did not want to be named for fear of discrimination. “It was not an easy journey, especially when I was not allowed to work. I was worried about finances. My father was unemployed, (so) losing my income was a huge blow to my family,” he said. He managed to return to his job only in January 2021, after getting help from TTSH's TB Control Unit and the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP). “I hope people can learn more about TB first before giving those with TB a ‘death sentence’,” Kelvin said. “People should not feel like they have to keep a distance from those with TB, especially those already taking medicine faithfully and on regular medical follow-up.” Clinical director of the TB Control Unit Shera Tan told media that common symptoms of TB include fever, night sweats, chronic cough and loss of weight. Among the misconceptions about the disease is that patients are infectious throughout their treatment, which takes six to nine months. But they are typically not infectious after two weeks, as long as they adhere to treatment, Dr Tan said. The length of the treatment period cures the disease and prevents relapse and the development of drug-resistant organisms, she added. Patients undergo directly observed therapy, which involves them taking three to four types of medication under the observation of a trained healthcare worker. “The main challenge in the treatment of TB is the long duration of treatment beyond that of symptom resolution and the large number of tablets taken as part of the standard drug regimen,” Dr Tan said. For the first two months, the therapy is required daily, after which it is needed three times a week. Kelvin, who went for his therapy at a polyclinic near his home, completed his treatment in nine months and no longer has any symptoms, he said. Dr Tan said that those diagnosed with TB are not required to be isolated, unlike COVID-19 patients. They however have to wear a mask and are encouraged to go out only for healthcare visits and necessary tasks like buying food. They are also advised to minimise social interaction with people they have not met recently. At home, they don’t have to take any precautions, she said. “Patients who are diagnosed with TB are far more infectious before the treatment was started than after,” she said. Many are under the impression that TB is no longer present in Singapore, while some people think that the disease only affects those of lower socioeconomic status and is associated with poor hygiene, said Dr Tan. But anyone can get infected with TB as it is an airborne disease. At higher risk are those with prolonged close contact with patients such as household members and those with low immunity, Dr Tan added. About half of all TB patients are asymptomatic, she said. Their disease is typically discovered during medical examinations for purposes such as evaluation for employment, application for long-term stay in Singapore, or even incidental findings in the evaluation of other diseases such as cancer staging. Other than active TB, there is also latent TB, where the bacteria is kept under control in a dormant state by the body’s immunity. About 10 per cent of Singapore's population have latent TB, which is not transmissible. “The germs are there, but they are not replicating at a speed that will cause symptoms, so it’s only when they break down from the latent to the active state that they (patients) start to transmit germs to other people,” she said. Last year, there were 1,306 new cases of active TB among Singapore residents, The incidence rate was 32.8 cases per 100,000 population, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a media release last Thursday on World TB Day. This was a slight dip compared to 2020. Older age groups and males continue to make up a significant proportion of new active TB disease cases, MOH said. TAFEP said it has received an average of six complaints a year over the past five years about workplace discrimination due to medical conditions, including TB.   A spokesperson for the watchdog noted that employees with TB are able to return to work after two weeks, as they are generally deemed to be non-infectious after completing the first two weeks of treatment. “Nevertheless, there may still be misconceptions amongst employers and co-workers about the spread of the disease at the workplace,” the spokesperson said. Senior medical social worker Chiam Ai Ling said that the TB Control Unit continues to be actively involved in the education of medical professionals and the public. She added that the TB Control Unit helps patients who face stigma or discrimination and dispel misconceptions. ""For those grappling with fears of TB transmission, we engage them with facts and work to put those fears to rest,"" she said.  In Kelvin's case, his situation improved after a friend who was a canteen stall operator hired him on a part-time basis while he was unemployed. Kelvin did not tell him of his disease initially, but when he did, James did not write him off. He spoke to a medical social worker from the TB Control Unit to find out more about the disease. The 62-year-old felt reassured after he learnt that Kelvin was not infectious if he adhered to his treatment. He also wanted to give Kelvin a chance as he felt that he himself caught a break in life. “I lost some vision in my right eye due to an accident in primary school. I would not have been able to work or start a family if people had not given me a chance,” James said. Things got better for Kelvin after James employed him. “He gave me a lot of encouragement and support. It gave me confidence and hope that things could get better,” he said. Having recovered from TB, Kelvin said that there is “no need to be too worried about the disease”. “Just take medicine as instructed by the doctor and live life as usual,” he said. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/alopecia-areata-jada-pinkett-smith-hair-loss-2592686,"What is alopecia areata, the medical condition behind Jada Pinkett Smith's hair loss?","If you caught the recent footage of Will Smith storming the stage during the Oscars to slap host Chris Rock after he made a joke about wife Jada Pinkett Smith’s bald head (who hasn't?), you might just have a question or two.  One: Was the slap scripted? (No, it wasn’t). Two: Why was Pinkett Smith’s head shaven in the first place, which was what brought on the comedian’s unfortunate quip: “Jada, can’t wait for GI Jane 2”.  The latter, as we all know by now, is caused by alopecia areata, an autoimmune disease where the body attacks its own hair follicles, leading to hair loss anywhere on the body, according to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD).  WHAT IS ALOPECIA AREATA? The hair loss experienced in alopecia areata tends to be patchy and unpredictable, noted the AAD website. “When the hair regrows, it may fall out again – or it may not.” This erratic hair loss and regrowth often occur on the scalp. Patients may also lose part or all of their eyelashes, brows, beard, or hair in the armpits, nostrils or ears.  There are a few main types of alopecia areata such as alopecia totalis (all hair on the scalp is shed) and alopecia universalis (a rare condition where only body hair is completely lost), according to the AAD.  Alopecia areata is unlike male and female pattern hair loss. Male pattern hair loss is characterised by a receding hairline and hair loss on the top of the head; in women, hair tends to thin at the top, starting with the widening of the hair’s parting. Male and female pattern hair loss are caused by a combination of hormones and genetic disposition.  WHO IS PRONE TO DEVELOPING IT? Alopecia areata can begin at any age, noted the AAD website. “However, most people develop it during childhood or their teenage years.” Women are more likely to develop the disease and among them, black women have a “greater lifetime incidence of (alopecia areata)” than white women, according to a 2018 study.   In another study based on the US population, it found that Asians have an even lower odds than Caucasians at developing the autoimmune disease. It would appear that genetics are involved, according to Medical News Today. One in five people with the disease has a family member who has developed alopecia areata.  “Other research has found that many people with a family history of alopecia areata also have a personal or family history of other autoimmune disorders such as atopy, a disorder characterised by a tendency to be hyperallergic (and develop) thyroiditis and vitiligo,” noted the same website.  Despite what many people think, there is very little scientific evidence to support the view that alopecia areata is caused by stress. Extreme cases of stress could potentially trigger the condition, but most recent research points toward a genetic cause. WHAT IS ALOPECIA AREATA’S IMPACT? The condition has few physically harmful effects (it can also cause nail changes such as roughness, pitting and splitting) and doesn't cause pain. But it can create anxiety and depression in patients – more so in women. “Hair loss in women often has a greater impact than hair loss does on men, because it's less socially acceptable for them”, noted an article on Harvard Medical School’s website. “Alopecia can severely affect a woman's emotional well-being and quality of life.”  That was the situation for Pinkett Smith. In a 2018 episode of Red Table Talk (see video above), a web show she co-hosts on Facebook, the 50-year-old revealed for the first time why she’d kept her hair short. “I’ve been getting a lot of questions about why I’ve been wearing this turban. Well, I’ve been having issues with hair loss.” The Matrix actress recalled the ""terrifying"" moment when she first noticed she was losing ""handfuls of hair"" in the shower. ""It was one of those times in my life where I was literally shaking with fear,"" she said. ""That's why I cut my hair and continued to cut it.""  In 2021, she documented her decision to shave her head on Instagram. “Now at this point, I can only laugh,” she said in her video. “Y’all know I’ve been struggling with alopecia and just all of a sudden one day, look at this line right here.”  In the caption of her video post, she wrote: “Mama’s gonna have to take it down to the scalp so nobody thinks she got brain surgery or something. Me and this alopecia are going to be friends… period!” WHAT TREATMENTS ARE AVAILABLE? There is no cure for alopecia areata. But because it is an autoimmune disease, some of the treatments available, such as corticosteroids, involve suppressing the immune system to stop the body from attacking the hair follicles. These may be administered through injections, topically or orally. Other forms of treatment involve stimulating hair growth, such as Minoxidil, which may work better for those with less severe hair loss, according to Healthline. However, the success rate differ from patient to patient and hair loss might recur. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/surreal-freeing-singapore-residents-first-day-lift-outdoors-mask-mandate-2593246,'Surreal' and 'freeing': Singapore residents on walking around outdoors without a mask,"SINGAPORE: ""Surreal."" ""Freeing."" ""Liberation."" After two years of having to wear a mask anywhere outside their homes, some Singapore residents described their elation at being able to shed their face coverings on Tuesday (Mar 29), as the country lifted its outdoor mask mandate. Singapore rolled out its most significant easing of COVID-19 measures from Tuesday, including making the wearing of masks outdoors optional and doubling the group size for social gatherings to 10 people. Mr Sam Lee, 28 and Ms Winnie Fok, 26, took off their masks after exiting Mandarin Gallery along Orchard Road. ""My face can finally feel the wind,"" Mr Lee told CNA. ""I'm quite happy to take off my mask, but it was a bit awkward at first. We were just looking around to see, actually not a lot of people have taken off, so we were worried if it's the correct date,"" he said. Observing that most people they saw walking along Orchard Road still had their masks on, Ms Fok said that most Singapore residents seemed to still be ""quite cautious"". Not having to wear a mask, however, was ""very freeing and surreal"" for her, she added with a smile. When CNA visited Ang Mo Kio Central and the areas near Chong Boon Market and Food Centre on Tuesday morning, the only people who were not wearing masks were eating or drinking. Most people also put their masks on after they finished their meals and left the food centre. Lunchtime at the central business district painted a similar picture as colleagues headed out to eat together. Even after leaving their office buildings, the majority of workers kept their masks on. Some had their masks off while carrying their takeaway food. There were also several people sitting around Raffles Place Park without their masks. At about 1pm in Orchard Road, there were some people walking along the streets without their masks - more than in the heartlands - but most still kept their masks on after exiting shopping centres. Wesley, a 31-year-old financial advisor who was in the Somerset area, said he decided not to wear a mask because the weather was very warm. ""I don't want to sweat in my mask,"" he said with a chuckle. ""It feels like liberation. I'm happy about it."" When asked whether he felt safe shedding his face covering, he shared that he would mask up if there was a crowd. ""If I do see a crowd like this, then I'll put on my mask or walk away. But otherwise, I'll just not wear one outside,"" Wesley said, gesturing at a crowd gathered at a pedestrian crossing nearby. ""This whole infection thing really depends on the viral load. If it's outdoors, anybody who coughs or sneezes, it all disperses very quickly. ""But if it's indoors, not so much... I don't think they should remove it indoors."" Wesley added that he believed most people were still wearing masks outdoors ""out of habit"" and that ""sooner or later"", people would do away with them. Other people CNA spoke to were more cautious. Although Ms Kannagii, 57, was happy to hear that the COVID-19 restrictions were being eased, she still left the house wearing a mask this morning. ""If you go inside somewhere, you still need to wear a mask. What if you forget to bring out the mask? And also for our personal safety,"" she added. Ms Kannagii, who was having breakfast with her brother at Chong Boon Market and Food Centre, said she would consider doing away with the face covering if the COVID-19 situation improved or if the mask requirement was lifted for indoor areas as well. ""If I'm going to a park for a walk, and I'm coming straight home, then it's fine to go without a mask. But if I'm going to a market or a hawker centre, then I might as well wear one,"" she said, adding that it ""doesn't make sense"" to take off her mask for the short walk from her home to the market. Even though she will continue to wear her mask outside for now, Ms Kannagii said the easing of restrictions was ""still a good sign"" that the COVID-19 situation was improving. Retiree Mdm Tan (not her real name) said she would continue to wear a mask even if restrictions are eased further. The 63-year-old was wearing two masks, a reusable one under a disposable one, while resting on a bench outside Chong Boon Market and Food Centre. ""I'm already used to it, it's already a habit,"" she added. She said her husband was very happy when the announcement was made last week, and declared that he would stop wearing masks. He has heart problems, and feels like he can breathe better when he is not wearing one, Mdm Tan explained. Despite what he said, he still left the house wearing a mask this morning. ""We're quite old, so I think it's better to protect ourselves,"" she added. For Ms Jen Yang and Lyn (who declined to give her full name), masking up outdoors remains a form of protection for them. The two friends had their masks when they left the house, and did not remove them the whole day, even as they waited at the traffic light outside Takashimaya. ""It's troublesome to take it off and put it back on,"" said Lyn, 30. ""I think I will wear one for quite a while."" Ms Yang, 28, said she would stop wearing a mask outdoors when the majority of people in Singapore do the same. ""I'll remove it when I can remove my mask anywhere. Now it's very troublesome, especially if you forget to bring one, and I don't like to pull it down on my chin."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/how-floss-plaque-bleeding-2578926,Flossing your teeth: Why do my gums bleed? Should I brush or floss first? Is there a right way?,"Flossing is an important habit one should have to get rid of plaque, that sticky, whitish biofilm of bacteria that forms on teeth.  When plaque is allowed to accumulate along the gum line, the bacteria can trigger inflammation in the gums and lead to gingivitis or gum inflammation, said Dr Haw Sue Yi, a dental surgeon with SingHealth Polyclinics. Those red and bleeding gums you might have? Those are signs of gingivitis.  “If left untreated, gingivitis can progress into periodontitis, where there is loss of supporting bone, which can result in shaky teeth,” said Dr Haw.  And it doesn’t take long for plaque to form, mature and harden into tartar – just 24 to 72 hours – after which gingivitis starts to develop, she said. Tartar is much harder to remove than plaque and can only be done at the dentist.  Got other questions on flossing? Here are the answers. DO I FLOSS OR BRUSH FIRST? It might be a better idea to floss first, then brush your teeth, said Dr Haw. Doing so “allows the debris to be removed from the interdental spaces and subsequently, brushed off”, she said.  “Flossing first also means that a larger clean tooth surface area will be exposed to the fluoride content in the toothpaste.” HOW SHOULD I BE FLOSSING? Don’t hold your piece of floss straight and just go up and down with it. And never snap the floss onto the gums as it can hurt them, said Dr Haw. Instead, curve the floss around the base of the tooth in a C-shape, and gently use an up-and-down motion to clean the surface of the tooth, she said. “Make sure you reach slightly below the gum line.” WHAT IS THE BEST TIME TO FLOSS? At night – and the good news is, you only need to floss once daily.  Right before bedtime is best because “our salivary flow is reduced when we sleep”, said Dr Haw. This means that the acid produced by plaque bacteria isn’t washed away by saliva and the overnight exposure to the acid bath can result in more decay.   WHY DO MY GUMS BLEED WHEN I FLOSS? It is normal as long as the bleeding stops by the time you’ve finished flossing and brushing. The bleeding could be caused by a rough or improper flossing technique. Or your gums just aren’t used to the stimulation created by flossing.  However, don’t let the bleeding deter you from flossing the area (if you’ve ascertained it isn’t caused by dental or health issues). Avoiding flossing can “ultimately become a vicious cycle and result in the further buildup of plaque or tartar”, said Dr Haw.  Keep at it and you should be able to floss without seeing blood after seven to 10 days. But “if you find that your gums bleed frequently, make an appointment to visit a dentist”, said Dr Haw. It may be due to gum disease such as gingivitis or periodontitis.  I DON’T THINK I’M DOING IT RIGHT There are alternatives to the dental floss such as interdental brushes, said Dr Haw. These are small, narrow brushes that come in different widths to suit the size of the gaps between your teeth.  In fact, if you have “black triangles” (large interdental spaces between your teeth that look like, well, black triangles), interdental brushes may be more effective for you, she said. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/heres-how-singapores-covid-19-measures-will-change-mar-29-2590851,Here’s how Singapore’s COVID-19 measures will change from Mar 29,"SINGAPORE: Singapore will see its most significant easing of measures in its fight against the COVID-19 pandemic from Tuesday (Mar 29).  For two years, masks were the norm - indoors, outdoors, even during exercise. As the number of COVID-19 cases surged and eased, permitted group sizes went from eight people to five and then two, and was most recently at five again. At some points, children could not go to school and residents mostly worked from home. Last week, however, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced the easing of a raft of measures in “a major step towards living with COVID-19”, but stopped short of a complete opening up.  From tomorrow, people will be able to remove their masks when outdoors. Individuals can gather and dine-in at restaurants in groups of up to 10 people. More people will see their colleagues in the office, and live performances will return.  “Resume more normal lives, enjoy larger gatherings of family and friends, go outdoors without masks, or reunite with loved ones abroad. But do not throw all caution to the wind,” said Mr Lee in his speech last week.  Here’s a recap of what will change from tomorrow:  1. Wearing a mask outdoors will be optional Wearing a mask indoors will still be required. This refers to all buildings or places with clearly defined entrances or exits, said the Ministry of Health (MOH).  For example, people will have to wear masks in office buildings, shopping malls, on public transport and in classrooms.  Hawker centres, coffee shops, wet markets and other HDB retail shops or shophouses also count as indoor spaces.  Places that are sheltered but with open access will generally be regarded as outdoor areas. These include HDB void decks, bus stops, open-air sheltered walkways and bridges, as well as parks, fields and nature trails. The 1m safe distancing rule will still be required in all mask-off environments.  2. Group sizes for social gatherings doubled from five to 10 people Individuals can gather in groups of up to 10 people, up from five previously. The largest group size permitted in previous iterations of safe-management measures was eight people.  This means that each household can receive up to 10 visitors at a time. Groups of 10 vaccinated people will also be allowed to dine in at food and beverage outlets.  This also applies to hawker centres and coffee shops where full checks on vaccination-differentiated safe management measures (VDS) are implemented at their entrances, said MOH.  To ease the operational burden for F&B operators, all establishments will be allowed to seat smaller groups of up to five fully vaccinated persons without the need for full VDS checks at their entrance.  Instead, random spot checks will be done to ensure that the vaccinated diners-only rule is adhered to, said the Health Ministry. At F&B spots, the current restriction on the sale and consumption of alcohol after 10.30pm will be lifted from Mar 29. Live performances will also be allowed to resume at all venues.  Those involved in the performances will have to comply with the prevailing safe management measures such as keeping to a group size of 10. Screening of live broadcast programmes and recorded entertainment in F&B establishments will be allowed again. 3. Up to 75% of employees who are able to work from home can return to the workplace  Get ready to see more of your colleagues (or your boss) back in the office. Up to 75 per cent of employees who are able to work from home will be allowed to return to the workplace from Mar 29, up from the current limit of 50 per cent.  The rules for social gatherings in workplaces will be the same as that of social settings, as long as the general group size and masking rules are in place.  Workers in all sectors will also no longer need to undergo rostered routine testing from Mar 29.  MOH had already from Feb 18 narrowed rostered routine testing requirements to only workers in healthcare, eldercare and those who work with children below five, as well as some essential service workers. Previously, the requirement applied to groups such as border frontline workers, transport workers, dormitory-dwelling workers, service industry employees, as well as those working with children under 12. With this, government subsidies provided to companies for rostered routine testing will also come to an end, said MOH.  Larger-scale social gatherings and events like gala dinners, corporate dinner-and-dance events, birthday celebrations and anniversaries will also be allowed to resume.  There should be no more than 10 people per table and a safe distance of 1m between tables.  4. Singapore to reopen its borders to all fully vaccinated travellers from Apr 1  In doing so, all existing vaccinated travel lanes and unilateral opening arrangements will be removed, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore announced last week.  Singapore will transition to a new simplified vaccinated travel framework where countries and regions will be classified into two categories - general travel or the restricted category. All fully vaccinated travellers, as well as children aged 12 and below, will be able to enter Singapore with just a pre-departure COVID-19 test from 11.59pm on Mar 31. They will no longer need to apply for entry approvals or take designated VTL transport to enter Singapore quarantine-free. The quotas on the number of daily arrivals will also be lifted.  While travellers will still need to take a pre-departure test within two days before departure for Singapore, they will not need to serve a stay-home notice or undergo an unsupervised antigen rapid test (ART) after arriving in Singapore. Long-term pass-holders and short-term visitors aged 13 and above who are not fully vaccinated will generally not be allowed to enter Singapore, with a few exceptions. This includes long-term pass-holders who are medically ineligible for vaccines as well as those who have valid entry approval such as compassionate reasons. For this group, they will be required to take a pre-departure test within two days before departure for Singapore, undergo a seven-day stay-home notice, and take a polymerase chain reaction test after their isolation period.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/eating-leftovers-meningococcal-disease-bacteria-infection-amputation-2581246,The strange case of the teenager who lost all fingers and both feet after eating leftovers,"In Singapore, we occasionally read about food poisoning cases landing victims in hospitals or even worse. But in one unusual case in the US, eating contaminated food caused a 19-year-old to lose both of his feet and all of his fingers.  Anyone who has suffered from food poisoning before would already know that it is no joke. Your stomach feels like it’s being wrung and turned inside out as you clock your personal best timing racing between your bed and the toilet bowl. It’s like the movie The Purge playing to an audience of one – you.  But in the case reported in The New England Journal Of Medicine (NEJM) in March 2021, the teenager had it a lot worse. He was admitted to hospital with vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, general weakness, chills and shortness of breath 20 hours after eating leftover chicken and noodles brought back by his roommate from a restaurant. The said roommate also felt sick and vomited after eating the food but did not suffer the same fate (more on his situation later).  Sounds like your regular case of food poisoning, right? What wasn’t regular was that the first teen also had neck stiffness and blurry vision, while his skin had a “mottled appearance"".  That wasn’t the last of his ordeal. According to the report, the teenager’s breathing became faster while in hospital but the oxygen level in his blood was low. His blood pressure dropped to half of what it was when he arrived at the emergency room. Doctors also noticed reddish-brown spots starting to appear all over his body like bruises.  Antibiotics were administered but they didn’t manage to turn things around and the patient had to be transported to another hospital with more resources. Over the next few days, his condition stabilised – except for the issue of the bruise-like patches all over his body. As it turned out, the “bruises” were signs of blood clots caused by internal bleeding – and these clots were cutting off oxygen to his hands and feet. The patient had to have them amputated as the tissue in those extremities started to necrose and turn gangrenous.  WHAT IS GOING ON? How did eating leftovers cause the teenager to lose his fingers and feet? While it may appear to be an extreme case of food poisoning, experts such as Dr Brenda Mae Alferez Salada, a senior resident physician with National University Hospital’s Division of Infectious Diseases, noted that it wasn’t.  First, the neck stiffness and haemorrhagic rash are signs pointing to meningococcal disease caused by the bacterium, Neisseria meningitidis, said Dr Salada. This is the same organism behind the inflammation of the brain’s and spinal cord’s lining seen in newborns and babies known as meningococcal meningitis.  Secondly, Neisseria meningitidis is not foodborne, said Dr Salada. Instead, it is transmitted “through direct contact with airborne droplets” from an infected person or carrier. You can also be infected “through contact with objects that are freshly soiled by an infected person’s or carrier’s nasal secretions”, said Dr Salada.  According to the US Centers For Disease Control And Prevention, one in 10 healthy people carry the bacteria in the back of their nose and throat without being ill.  “The bacteria colonising the upper respiratory tract may penetrate the mucosal cells to enter the blood stream, resulting in severe sepsis like the patient in the NEJM article,” said Dr Salada. She continued: “The disease progresses rapidly after an incubation period of three to four days. Over the following hours or days, patients might complain of severe headache, vomiting, neck and back pain with rigidity, followed by altered consciousness and coma. Half of the patients develop shock or severe infection with low blood pressure.” And there are repercussions after overcoming the infection. About 10 per cent to 20 per cent of survivors have long-term complications such as neurologic disability, deafness or loss of digits or limbs, said Dr Salada.  The NEJM case study did not explain how the bacteria got onto the food that the teenager ate. It did note that his roommate had eaten the same leftovers the night before he did and had vomited as a result. But that was it.  So why was his roommate spared the horrible fate? The answer lies in the two teenagers’ vaccination status. The patient, who had it worse, only received one dose of the meningococcal vaccine just before he entered middle school and did not get his booster shot by age 16. His roommate, however, had his vaccination covered.  COULD YOU GET INFECTED, TOO? Locally, meningococcal disease presents as single cases or small clusters, said Dr Salada. “So far, only nine cases were reported in 2018.” According to her, the disease occurs worldwide but has the highest incidence in sub-Saharan Africa, where “large epidemics occur semi-annually, particularly from November to June”. It's not just the location; congregating in large numbers while overseas can increase your risk of meningococcal disease as well. Staying in college dormitories in countries such as the US and UK, for instance, can be a risk factor, said Dr Salada. In fact, the meningococcal vaccine is required for those travelling to Saudi Arabia to perform the haj or annual pilgrimage.  The meningococcal vaccine (given in just one dose and protects against the four strains, A, C, W and Y) isn’t included in Singapore's National Childhood Immunisation Programme as it is not endemic locally. So, if you’re travelling to somewhere risky, it is recommended that you get your jab two weeks before departure. A booster shot is required every three years.  COULD IT INFECT YOU THROUGH FOOD, TOO? “Food poisoning” is a loosely used term for gastroenteritis, said Dr Reuben Wong, a gastroenterologist at Gleneagles Hospital. This “very common condition” is caused by the “contamination of food by viruses or bacteria, resulting in symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps and fever”.   The common food-poisoning culprits, at least in Singapore, are “enteric pathogens such as E coli and salmonella”, said Dr Wong. As for health issues created by Neisseria meningitidis locally, they are “markedly less common” in comparison, he said.  Still, it pays to be careful when handling and consuming leftovers. “Ensure that leftovers are uncontaminated before you save them for consumption later,” said Dr Wong.  “For example, a half-eaten sandwich or half-drunk bowl of soup, where there has been contact with someone’s mouth and saliva, is contaminated with oral microflora and should not be kept.” If the portion is too big and you foresee leftovers, scoop or separate out portions for keeping using a serving spoon first before digging in. Also, note that foods that contain dairy components such as milk, cheese, cream and nutrient-rich broths are more prone to bacterial growth and proliferation, warned Dr Wong.  “As a rule of thumb, uncontaminated leftovers should be refrigerated and consumed within 24 hours. And certainly avoid keeping leftovers of leftovers,” he said. "

And with that we can progress further in our journey towards COVID resilience,” said Mr Gan.  Here’s how life will change from Mar 29.  1. You can take off your mask outdoors But wearing a mask indoors will still be required. Indoor places refer to all buildings or places with clearly defined entrances or exits, said the Ministry of Health (MOH).  For example, people will have to wear masks in office buildings, shopping malls, on public transport and in classrooms.  Hawker centres, coffee shops, wet markets and other HDB retail shops or shophouses also count as indoor spaces.  Places that are sheltered but with open access will generally be regarded as outdoor areas.

You can eat out or visit a friend’s home in groups of 10 If you have yet to make restaurant reservations for next week, now might be a good time to get on the phone. From Mar 29, the maximum group size allowed for social gatherings will be doubled from five to 10 people.  Groups of 10 vaccinated people will be allowed to dine in at food and beverage outlets, and each household can receive up to 10 visitors at a time.  This also applies to hawker centres and coffee shops where full checks on vaccination-differentiated safe management measures (VDS) are implemented at their entrances, said MOH.  To ease the operational burden for F&B operators, all establishments will be allowed to seat smaller groups of up to five fully vaccinated persons without the need for full VDS checks at their entrance.  Instead, random spot checks will be done to ensure that the vaccinated diners-only rule is adhered to, said the Health Ministry. 3.

Live performance will also be allowed to resume at all venues, including at F&B establishments.  Those involved in the performances will have to comply with the prevailing safe management measures such as keeping to a group size of 10. ""We will also lift the restriction on the screening of live broadcast programmes and recorded entertainment in F&B establishments,"" said MOH. 4. You might see more of your colleagues back at the workplace  Up to 75 per cent of employees who can work from home will be allowed to return to the workplace from Mar 29.  The rules for social gatherings in workplaces will be aligned to that of social settings, as long as the general group size and masking rules are in place.  Larger-scale social gatherings and events like gala dinners, corporate dinner-and-dance events, birthday celebrations and anniversaries will also be allowed to resume.  There should be no more than 10 people per table and a safe distance of 1m between tables.  5. Singing will be allowed in some settings  With masks worn throughout the “vocalisation activity”, singing in general settings, including in schools, will be allowed to resume.  Congregational singing and chanting will be allowed. Audiences, spectators and participants at events will also be allowed to cheer.  As for nightlife businesses like bars, pubs, karaoke establishments and nightclubs, the task force is separately looking into their resumption.  These are activities with much higher risks of transmission, and participants in these settings will have more difficulties complying with the prevailing safe-management measures.  The Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Home Affairs will provide an update on the reopening of this sector in the coming weeks. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/long-covid-symptoms-cough-breathless-fatigue-pasc-therapy-recover-2579021,Still feel unwell after testing negative for COVID-19? How to manage post-infection symptoms,"SINGAPORE: Although more than 99 per cent of COVID-19 cases in Singapore in recent weeks are considered mild infections, some people have experienced lasting symptoms even after testing negative for the coronavirus. Patients have reported persistent coughs and airway irritation, breathlessness, fatigue, brain fog, palpitations, chest tightness or pain, and digestive issues such as acid reflux and not being able to tolerate food that they could eat before. There can also be a negative impact on mental well-being, said Dr John Cheng, Head of Primary Care at Healthway Medical Group. Local data from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) last year showed that 16.9 per cent of a group of COVID-19 patients – who were unvaccinated – reported persistent symptoms at 30 days post-infection. And 11.7 per cent reported symptoms six months after contracting the virus, said Dr Edgar Tay, a cardiologist at the Asian Heart & Vascular Centre, Mount Elizabeth Hospital. He added that data suggests these symptoms may be reduced in those who were vaccinated. Previously termed “long COVID”, the condition has recently been renamed post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (PASC). CNA asked some medical professionals how people can manage such post-COVID symptoms: Physiotherapist Jaclyn Chow said that inflammation in the cells infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus can persist even after one tests negative, leading to lingering symptoms like a cough, airway sensitivity and discomfort in the upper respiratory tract. If the cough is leading to sleeplessness or discomfort, cough medication can help to relieve the symptom. Pharmacists or doctors can recommend the appropriate medicine based on the cause of the cough, its duration and other clinical signs such as fever or muscle ache, said community pharmacist Shawn Lee.  In most cases, cough mixtures given at the clinic are similar to what is sold at retail pharmacies, said Mr Lee, a member of the Pharmaceutical Society of Singapore. But note that these medicines do not cure the viral infection, he added.  If the patient coughs more when lying down, it could be caused by watery mucus dripping down the back of the throat. In such cases, consider sleeping with an additional pillow to prop up the head or take an antihistamine, which is typically used for runny nose.  A good way to manage breathlessness is to make sure one is breathing well.  Ms Chow said that some people develop a different breathing pattern after COVID-19, and start breathing with their mouth as their nose was blocked. But breathing through the nose warms and moistens the air, while air breathed through the mouth can be “more of an irritant”. Breathing through the nose also produces nitric oxide, which opens up the airways. For people who are mouth breathers, she will first train them to go back to nasal breathing. She will also make sure that they are breathing using their diaphragm rather than their upper chest. Diaphragmatic breathing is more efficient and leads to less fatigue, she said. Posture is important as hunching limits the flexibility of one’s chest walls, and one’s breathing capacity. Chest stretches can help with this. Improving posture can add up to 50ml of air per breath, or about 10 per cent of one’s usual air intake, said Ms Chow. When patients start breathing better, she recommends exercises to help them regain stamina. Using one’s muscles increases oxidative capacity, or their ability to use oxygen, she added. There can be many factors leading to fatigue but breathing exercises can help some patients deal with this, said Ms Chow. A patient who breathes at a fast rate lowers the carbon dioxide level in their blood, causing narrowing of airways and blood vessels. If the level is far too low, it can limit blood flow to the brain causing headaches, fatigue and dizziness. “We try to slow the breathing rate … so that you can reverse the blood vessels narrowing, the airways narrowing and that helps with the symptoms of fatigue, if the cause is a breathing pattern disorder,” she said. Healthway’s Dr Cheng said that for fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance, a gradual plan to recover and not over-exert the body is recommended. “There should be a gradual return to the usual activity programme based on level of fatigue experienced by the patient. We also recommend taking regular breaks in between exercise or strenuous activities.” With cardiac symptoms, the most important aspect is to ascertain that there are no serious cardiac conditions in patients with persistent symptoms, said Dr Tay.  “Some patients with pre-existing cardiac illnesses may also be more symptomatic after COVID 19. So being vigilant here is important.”  The risk of cardiovascular events may also increase after COVID-19 infection. Patients should monitor for the following:
• Any new type/new onset of chest pain
• Worsening of chest pain, shortness of breath or any new symptoms of feeling unwell There are no standard recommendations, but it is better to seek medical attention if there are other persistent symptoms lasting beyond four to six weeks, experts said. For patients who remain symptomatic after ruling out serious illnesses, a test such as cardiopulmonary exercise testing may be useful.  This can shed light on whether the lung or heart or deconditioning is causing the patient’s symptoms. Following this, cardiac rehabilitation may be useful, said Dr Tay. Tailored exercises to patients’ symptoms are important, he added. Respiratory specialist Dr Adrian Chan advised patients to seek medical evaluation if symptoms are more severe and are not improving despite recovering from COVID-19.   If a patient reports a pulse oximeter reading of 94 per cent and below, they should seek medical advice as it may be an indication of ""residual lower respiratory tract involvement by COVID"", said Dr Chan, who is from Respiratory Medical Associates, Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. Dr Tay also recommended seeking help if symptoms impact patients such as by affecting sleep or limiting exercise. Post-recovery patients planning to start or resume strenuous exercise should consider a further evaluation if they have residual symptoms such as chest pain or tightness, he said. “There is a group of patients who may have myocarditis following COVID-19 infection which would require treatment and temporary avoidance of exercise,” he said.  He added that there could be pre-existing heart conditions brought to light following COVID-19 which warrant treatment. Dr Chan said that most patients will recover with time, but patients should manage their symptoms to optimise function and quality of life during the period of symptoms.  As mentioned, these measures can include breathing exercises, a gradual return to physical activities or medications to treat upper respiratory tract symptoms.  “The optimal approach can be tailored according to the advice from the specialist,” he said. Dr Cheng said that his general advice would include keeping up a healthy lifestyle and getting enough sleep and hydration. “The best way to reduce risk of persistent symptoms still boils downs to the basics – prevention is still the key. Some of our suggestions include: Maintaining an active and healthy lifestyle for better immunity and easier recovery period; getting vaccinated against COVID-19 including the booster shot.”  This is as studies have suggested that vaccination reduces the risk and severity of persistent symptoms.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/long-covid-coronavirus-breathless-cough-fatigue-doctors-therapy-2578961,"Breathlessness, fatigue, persistent cough: Doctors see more cases of 'long COVID' in Singapore","SINGAPORE: Ms Doris Ong, 49, has been feeling breathless after walking short distances ever since getting COVID-19 in November. She used to be able to walk home from the bus stop with two bags of groceries –taking about 10 minutes. But after her coronavirus episode, she once took more than 20 minutes to walk home carrying a coconut, which she was drinking. She felt so tired that she had to stop to rest a few times, she told CNA. A month ago, she also felt that her heart was “squeezed” while eating laksa, Ms Ong said. Her symptoms have eased recently, but she still feels “weak” compared to before; and until now, she’s not sought medical advice. “I feel that it’s still manageable, It's not (as though) I need to go to A&E … if I really cannot (take it), then I will call 995,” she said. About one in 10 people report some symptoms up to six months after contracting COVID-19, based on data that was published in 2021, said Dr Barnaby Young, head of the Singapore Infectious Disease Clinical Research Network at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). NCID’s “long COVID” clinic has been seeing patients with persistent symptoms after COVID who were referred by general practitioners, polyclinics and hospitals, he said.  “An important caveat is that it is difficult to determine which of these symptoms were actually due to COVID versus another condition. Breathlessness is a symptom typically reported after a severe infection,” said Dr Young.  “With primary vaccination, boosters and the emergence of the Omicron variant, severe infection and by extension persistent breathlessness post-acute COVID is much less common.” Recovered COVID-19 patients have reported a variety of symptoms other than breathlessness, including brain fog, fatigue, wheezing, palpitations and persistent coughs. This can last for weeks or months after testing negative for the virus. Ms Jocelyn Ng, who is in her 40s, said that she has become “very sensitive” to any smell or smoke that irritates her throat or airways, setting off a bad, wheezing cough. She recounted how her hand once “hardened”, swelled and became completely numb after she fell asleep on it.  “I had never felt such excruciating pain before … I was crying,” said Ms Ng. She described how her hand was pulsating, as though her blood was trying to flow but could not. She went to a doctor, who advised her to go to the hospital. But as there was a large number of COVID-19 cases being treated by the hospitals at the time, she did not go, Ms Ng said.  She finds it hard to do housework – when she tried to mop the floor at home, her hand “cramped up and hardened” – so she has hired a part-time helper. And she has trouble buying groceries as her hand “stiffens” when she tries to carry things, said Ms Ng. The painful swelling happens fairly regularly on both hands, so she has been getting a massage every week to deal with this symptom, she said. She’s also put on weight and feels that she cannot exercise as her “body is very lethargic”. Medical professionals told CNA that they have been seeing more patients with such symptoms as the number of COVID-19 cases here surged in recent months. What was termed “long COVID” has recently been renamed post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (PASC), said Dr Edgar Tay, a cardiologist at the Asian Heart & Vascular Centre, Mount Elizabeth Hospital. Sequelae refers to the aftereffects of a prior disease or injury. The World Health Organization defines this as a condition that occurs in individuals usually three months from the onset of COVID-19, with symptoms that last for at least two months, and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis, he said. Patients who have had at least two vaccine jabs are much less likely to develop post-COVID symptoms, he added. Dr Adrian Chan, a respiratory specialist from Respiratory Medical Associates, Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, said that he has seen more patients with PASC at the clinic daily. Most report mild upper respiratory tract symptoms and some have more serious signs like breathlessness, wheezing, chest pain and palpitations. “Fortunately, for most patients, they will recover with time. The goal of medical management is to optimise function and quality of life during the period of symptoms,” he said.  Doctors advised that patients who have persistent symptoms or develop new or worsening symptoms after recovery from COVID-19 go for a medical evaluation. They should also seek help for symptoms that impact their lives, such as those affecting sleep or limiting exercise. Dr Steve Yang from The Respiratory Practice said that he will do tests to see if there is lung scarring or heart inflammation and to rule out other conditions, such as asthma exacerbation, lung fibrosis or emphysema. If these are not the cause, then he advises patients to gradually resume exercise and other activities. “You can expect to have (these symptoms) for the medium to long term, perhaps up to eight months or so. Therefore don't expect to bounce quickly out of this,” said Dr Yang.  “If you do recover quicker then that is good news. It's basically a gradual increase in activity … do small things, and slowly increase the duration and extent of these activities.” Mr Tan Wen Chuan, 32, was breathing more heavily than usual after walking for about five minutes from the car park to the interview location. He has been feeling breathless after walking or light activity since November or more than four months after his bout of COVID-19. Mr Tan, who had asthma as a child, said it can feel like an asthma attack, as he can’t breathe, and he feels like he can’t “fill up” his lungs. This can happen from time to time, even when he’s not active, he said. He described how he sometimes feels a “knot” in his chest at a particular spot whenever he inhales. “It's just a constant state of knowing that I have to breathe harder,” he said. When Mr Tan went to see a general practitioner, he was told that the symptoms would go away in time.  He said: “I felt helpless, because the doctor said there was nothing you can do about it.” Later, on a friend’s recommendation, he saw a physiotherapist. His therapist, Ms Jaclyn Chow of Heart & Lung Physio, said there are things that can be done to improve one’s breathing and body conditioning while one waits for recovery.  Inactivity, meanwhile, could lead to structural changes like losing muscle mass, which could lead to longer-term issues. Ms Chow explained that the SARS-CoV-2 virus “hooks” onto angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the body, and these cells are concentrated in the upper airways. “Even when you (test) negative, there might still be some inflammation, that’s why people have residual symptoms … it also causes sensitivity to the receptors when it detects stimuli like dust, change in temperature or wind blowing on your face,” she said. This could be why some people have a dry cough even after testing negative for COVID-19. The sensitivity may also cause airways to narrow – resulting in “air hunger”, and can also cause a feeling of not being able to breathe out fully. Mr Tan has since learned techniques and exercises to help him breathe better, and is on an endurance exercise programme. He’s much more conscious of his breathing and posture, and that has helped him to manage the episodes of breathlessness, he said. NCID’s Dr Young said that post-acute COVID syndrome is “complex and highly variable”. “Investigation and treatment is tailored to the individual and the symptoms they are experiencing,” he said.  “Fortunately for the majority, post-acute COVID syndrome is a self-limiting condition and does not require medication. Most will recover with time and a (gradual) return to exercise and other usual activities.” Lung specialist Dr Yang warned against deliberately trying to catch COVID-19 to “get immunity”, saying that there can be long-term implications after contracting the virus. He added: “Employees and employers should recognise that this is a problem that we are facing, they are not trying to malinger or trying to find ways to escape work. And I think people should understand when people have all these symptoms.” "

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/tongue-cancer-singapore-symptoms-causes-treatment-2554506,'I didn’t want to die in pain': This young mum had stage 4 tongue cancer when she was 29,"It was in December 2014 that I realised I was getting a mouth ulcer quite often. It would appear in the same spot – at the back of the left side of my tongue – then subside for a few weeks before reappearing. In April the following year, when I was on holiday with my husband and eldest child, who was then three years old, I noticed that the ulcer was growing bigger. It was bleeding too – and that was when I felt something was amiss.  After we returned to Singapore, I came down with a fever, and felt uneasy about it. I went to a general practitioner who gave me an ulcer cream to apply, but it didn’t subside, even after three days. I then went to a dentist, who looked at the ulcer and said something wasn’t quite right. He suggested I see an oral specialist.  I managed to find one but the earliest appointment was in August, which was three months away. I was panicking slightly by then, and went to see another dentist instead.  FINDING OUT IT WAS CANCER  The moment the dentist saw the ulcer, her face changed and I knew that something was definitely wrong. She said she suspected it was cancer, and that she’d need to do a biopsy to be sure. The dentist set up an appointment with an oncologist for me. I did the biopsy, and one week later, the results confirmed it. I had cancer. I met with the oncologist a few days later, and he suspected it was stage two tongue cancer. He told me that it wasn’t so bad, and I’d be able to survive with surgery (which would remove the small cancerous portion on the left side of my tongue).  He assured me that everything would be fine, and that there wasn’t a need to go for chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The surgery was scheduled for a few weeks after. What it is: The tongue is the most common site for cancers of the oral cavity, said Clinical Assistant Professor Natascha Ekawati Putri, a consultant at the Department of Head and Neck Surgery, Division of Surgery and Surgical Oncology at Singapore General Hospital and National Cancer Centre Singapore. It’s because “cancer cells most often arise from the superficial layer of cells that line the surface of the tongue”, she explained. What causes it: Chronic exposure to environmental carcinogens such as tobacco (from smoking), and alcohol consumption are established causes, along with the human papillomavirus (HPV), said Clinical Asst Prof Putri.  Incidence rates in Singapore: There were 411 new cases of tongue cancer in Singapore between 2013 to 2017, according to the Singapore Cancer Registry 50th Anniversary Monograph. Oral cancer patients in Singapore used to mostly be in their 60s and 70s but Clinical Asst Prof Putri said more now are in their 50s and 60s, although the reasons are “unconfirmed”.   Treatment and prognosis: “Treatment typically involves surgery to remove the cancer; radiation therapy and chemotherapy; and/or targeted drug therapy – in addition to the surgery – if the cancer is found to be at an advanced stage. “As the tumour progresses, the portions of the tongue that need to be removed become more extensive, and additional treatment may be required,” she added. When detected early, the chance of treating tongue cancer is high. GETTING CANCER SURGERY WHILE PREGNANT  A few days after the consultation, I found out that I was pregnant with my second child.  I remember asking my doctors repeatedly if my pregnancy would be affected since I would need to undergo general anaesthesia during the four-hour surgery. My gynaecologist reassured me that it was safe to go for the operation.  My medical team had planned to do CT and MRI scans to prepare for the surgery but because I was pregnant, they could only do a neck ultrasound. I was sent home after that as the team wanted to discuss the results with my doctor.  The evening before the surgery, I checked into the hospital as planned. One of the doctors assisting my surgeon visited me and said that the ultrasound showed that the cancer had spread. Instead of merely removing the cancerous spot, they would now need to remove a portion of my tongue and also cut my neck to remove the lymph nodes there. Everything was happening so fast. I was so shocked and unsure. I asked my doctor if I had done something wrong with regards to my lifestyle. I asked my mum if I had committed a “big” sin. Both my husband and my mum said no, it was just something that we had to face. I had been feeling angry about my cancer diagnosis but now I just felt so sad. I felt resigned to the situation and I didn't know what to do. My mind was a blank.  COPING WITH UNCERTAINTY POST-SURGERY I spent about a week after the surgery in the hospital. During that time, I could see that my parents, husband and siblings looked very sad. I could see that they had been crying.  The first thing I asked my mum was if the gynaecologist had checked my baby on the ultrasound to make sure he or she was okay. She assured me that everything was fine but that the surgery had taken about eight hours.  Up until then, I had not looked in the mirror. When I finally did, on the fourth day after the surgery, I understood why everyone looked so sad – the scar on my neck was about 15cm long.  When I came home after the surgery, my three-year-old daughter didn’t want to come near me. My post-surgery state must have shocked her quite a bit. I had no energy to hold her or do anything. I would lie on the bed and my sister would play with her beside me, and I’d watch them. A week later, when I went back to the hospital to remove the stitches, my doctor told me what they had found during the operation.  The cancer had spread and advanced to Stage 4A, he said, and it was no longer confined to the left side of the tongue; it had moved to the right side. To contain the spread, my doctors had removed all the lymph nodes in my neck and half of my tongue.  When you hear the words Stage 4, even if you don’t know anything about cancer, you’d think that you’re most likely going to die, and that you don’t have much time left.  My doctor explained that Stage 4A oral cancer is not the same as lung or colon cancer where the chances of recovery are very low. I still had a chance to make it through, I was told.  STARTING URGENT CANCER TREATMENT AND DECIDING ON HER PREGNANCY  Because the cancer had spread on my tongue and to the neck, I now had to do radiation and chemotherapy. The first thing that came to my mind was: What’s going to happen to my baby? I was feeling so fearful. My doctor referred me to a radiation oncologist, who told me that I needed about 32 sessions of radiation therapy, and three cycles of chemotherapy. My husband and I talked and it was as if we both knew that the chances of keeping our baby were low. Despite wanting a second child, we decided to terminate the pregnancy – I was 10 weeks pregnant at that time.  That was the most difficult part of the whole ordeal, and one of the most painful decisions I've ever had to make as my husband and I had always planned to have a big family. I didn’t want to remember anything about it.  I had to undergo more tests to determine which parts of my body needed radiation therapy. I asked my doctor to be honest with me: What were my chances of survival?  Her reply was that it would all depend on the scan – if the cancer cells had not spread to my major organs, I had a 60 per cent chance of surviving; if it had spread, I’d probably have only six more months to live. I didn’t want to die in pain, and in the hospital. I wanted to die comfortably at home, with my mum, dad and husband. I remember exactly what I told my family then: If the scan showed that the cancer cells had spread, I didn’t want any treatment. I just wanted to be home. My mum and husband were very sad as they wanted me to fight on but I said no. On the day that I got the scan results, the radiation oncologist told me that the cancer had not spread and there was still a chance of survival. She said they were “going all out” in the treatment plan to make sure I would survive, as I was only 29 then.  I held on to that chance and clung on to hope. I had everything going for me – I had one child, I was at the peak of my career as a public service officer and I had a bright future ahead. ‘I ALMOST COULDN’T RECOGNISE MYSELF’ My mum accompanied me to the first chemotherapy session. But when I entered the ward, I started walking backwards because I was so scared. I could hear people vomiting, even as they were fighting for their lives.  I wanted to run away and go back home. I asked my mum if I really needed to do this. The session lasted six hours, until the evening.  After that first session, I couldn’t walk. I lost 20kg throughout the whole ordeal, from the diagnosis to the end of treatment – I almost couldn’t recognise myself.  My husband said I was literally a bag of bones. Due to radiation therapy, there were so many ulcers in my mouth that I couldn’t eat. I experienced other side effects, including vomiting and weakness in my legs. I was on a liquid diet for months. To stop me from losing more weight, the doctor asked if they could put a feeding tube in me. I refused. If I put in the feeding tube, my daughter would be scared of me.  He told me I needed to drink, but it was so painful. But the thought of not having my daughter come near me was even more frightening than the pain. I endured it and managed to drink packets of milk. MOVING FORWARD AND BECOMING STRONGER  My doctor mentioned that it’s usually men above 45 or smokers who have a higher risk of getting tongue cancer, so I didn’t understand why it would happen to me. I was young, and I didn’t smoke or drink.  I decided to stop myself asking why I got cancer, and start thinking about hanging on, fighting it and going back to normal. My husband was a mess – he was wearing crumpled clothes – and I told myself I needed to fight and not give up.  During the recovery process, I went for speech therapy for nearly a year to learn how to eat and speak again, as I had lost half of my tongue. During the first few months, I tried writing to communicate. But my therapist told me to practise speaking often so that I could regain my speech. Today, I’m on lifelong medication for hypothyroidism (thyroid issues are a common side effect of radiation therapy). My taste buds have also been affected – I can’t eat spicy or fried food, and prefer to have soup with my meals.  I asked my doctor if I could try getting pregnant again. My husband and I still wanted more children, and I also saw that my eldest daughter was very lonely. We wanted to make sure she wouldn't grow up alone and would have a friend.  My doctor said yes: If I completed the treatment with no relapse, we could then think about it after five years, which would be in 2020. My family and I were so happy when I managed to get pregnant in 2020.  My family has gone through a lot. The only way I can repay them is to try my best to continue living as normal a life as I can – go to work, fetch my daughter, and go to the market.  I took an extended break from my job for 10 months to focus on my surgery and recovery, and went back to work part-time in February 2016 at the same organisation. I’m still working part-time there today.  I am now 36 years old. Every year, I look forward to celebrating my birthday as it reminds me that I’ve passed one more year. As a goal, I’ve started to look at one year at a time. CNA Women is a section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/brain-spring-clean-mental-declutter-2567126,Spring cleaning isn't just something you do for homes – why not do it for your brain?,"The pandemic has not been declared over but after living in survival mode for the last two years, some would say we are emerging into a “new normal”. Though that doesn’t mean our minds are at ease. Many have endured illness, economic upheaval, the climate crisis, grief and racial inequities – and now, supply chain issues and the ripple effects of Russia’s war with Ukraine. Even though we don't experience seasonal changes here, experts say the arrival of spring can serve as a natural point to take stock of our mental well-being and reconnect with the things that bring us purpose and joy, offering our brains a respite when possible. “It really is – for a number of reasons – a perfect time for folks to turn their attention to taking an inventory. Where do I find myself? What have I been through?” said Paul Napper, a psychology consultant to business leaders and co-author of The Power Of Agency: The 7 Principles To Conquer Obstacles, Make Effective Decisions, And Create A Life On Your Own Terms. Creating a clear, more focused mind starts by making decisions about how we spend our time every day. When those choices are in line with our values, interests and passions, this is referred to as personal agency. “You do always have a choice,” Dr Napper said. “It may not be a great choice,” he added, but examining your options helps you to adapt to your circumstances. Here are five ways to declutter your mind as we enter a new season. 1. PRACTISE MINDFULNESS “Being a human, particularly right now, is stressful,” said Nkechi Njaka, a meditation guide in San Francisco with a background in neuroscience. “And when we think of how degenerative stress is and how harmful to the body, we need something that can help mitigate it.” Mindfulness meditation, a practice that helps you remember to return to the present when you become distracted, has been shown to reduce the stress of daily life. When people notice that their mind is racing or they start to become anxious, they are typically thinking about something in the past or in the future. To refocus on the here and now, you can start by noticing the sensations in the body, Njaka said. “Can we feel the ground below us? The heat of the sun?” It is normal for the mind to wander. If this happens, gently return your awareness to your breathing and come back to the present. If you are compassionate with yourself and approach the practice with curiosity, openness and forgiveness, you will be more likely to try it again, she added. Take advantage of the transitional moments of the day to practise mindfulness – when you wake up, right before or after a meal, or when you change your physical location, for example – so that you can start to form a routine. 2. TRY THE BULLET JOURNAL METHOD Studies have found that jotting down thoughts in a journal can improve well-being. One method that has gained popularity in recent years is a practice created by the digital designer Ryder Carroll and outlined in his best-selling book, The Bullet Journal Method: Track The Past, Order The Present, Design The Future. The Bullet Journal is an organisational system but also an exercise in mindfulness – one that requires you to continually re-evaluate how you are investing your time and energy and then decide whether those things are worth it. Otherwise, Carroll said, “you can be very productive working on the wrong things”. Carroll, who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, initially started journalling to help him stay focused and succeed in his career, but then he began exploring how he felt about the tasks he was accomplishing. “Did it give me energy? Did it take it away?” he asked himself. Through journalling, he discovered a pattern: The experiences that gave him a sense of purpose or pride all involved helping others and performing acts of service. “If you don’t know what you want, you will never be satisfied with anything you have,” he added. 3. REDUCE INFORMATION OVERLOAD We have all been inundated by a relentless news cycle, a fire hose of information coming at us in the form of breaking news notifications, social media posts and email newsletters (among other sources) that can leave us feeling anxious, angry or even helpless. “Now is the time to completely overhaul your news consumption,” said Cal Newport, a computer science professor at Georgetown University and the author of Digital Minimalism: Choosing A Focused Life In A Noisy World. Choose just one or two reliable sources and read them at a specific time each day, he advised. For example, you can listen to a news roundup podcast while commuting to work or read a newspaper at breakfast, Dr Newport said. Dr Newport, who is 39 and has managed to avoid social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram and TikTok for his entire adult life, also recommends taking a 30-day break from the technologies in your life that are optional. In his book, he described what happened when 1,600 people gave it a try. Those who lasted the full 30 days were “cheerily gung-ho and positively aggressive about trying to fill in the time”, he said. So instead of reflexively watching TikTok or scrolling through Instagram during your free time, think about what you would be doing if you weren’t on either of those platforms: Reading a novel? Taking a restorative walk in nature? Relaxing and listening to music? Set aside time for those activities. 4. DECLUTTER YOUR PHYSICAL SPACE During the pandemic, and especially during lockdown, many people finally began to clear the junk out of their homes, a phenomenon The Washington Post referred to as the “great decluttering”. If you haven’t tackled your pile of clutter, now might be a good time to do it. “Messy spaces tend to prevent clear cognitive thinking,” said Catherine Roster, a professor at the Anderson School of Management at the University of New Mexico, who has researched how cluttered homes affect people. “It has a distorting effect that can bleed into other aspects of a person’s life – not only their emotions but their productivity.” Hiring a professional organiser to help sort through the mess is not within everyone’s budget, so Dr Roster suggested relying on a buddy – ideally someone who is also decluttering their home. Together, the two of you can serve as a sounding board for each other to make decisions about what to keep and stay on schedule. Listening to music while you sort and organise can also help motivate you, she added. 5. RECONNECT WITH THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE “What I’m seeing with my patients is that many seem to be emotionally cluttered,” said Barbara Greenberg, a clinical psychologist in Fairfield County, Conn. Information overload coupled with either social isolation or not getting your needs met socially or emotionally “is a really bad brew,” she added. If there are people you care about whom you have lost touch with during the pandemic, don’t be shy about getting back in touch, she urged. “We need the support and levity of people who make us feel good,” Dr Greenberg said. If it has been a while, it might feel awkward at first to re-establish contact. But just be honest, Dr Greenberg advised. For example, you might say: “We lost touch during the pandemic but now things are calming down and I would really love to see you. Not seeing you has been one of the things I’ve missed”. It might even inspire a “chain of positivity” where the person you contacted feels inspired to do the same with others. “Truly, everybody wants to get that call,” she said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/women-sex-drive-libido-stress-hormones-2559256,Women and low libido: Is it stress or hormones? How do you get your sex drive back?,"Are there any proven treatments for low libido in women? “Proven” is a strong word – and one that makes scientists squeamish. But it is safe to say that there is “very strong evidence” for increasing sexual desire through certain types of psychological interventions like cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness meditation, said Lori Brotto, a psychologist and professor at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and a renowned expert in women’s sexual health. When it comes to medications, however, it’s a different story. In recent years, two new medications for women with low libido have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, “though their efficacy is marginally better than a placebo”, said Dr Stacy Tessler Lindau, a gynaecologist at the University of Chicago Medicine and the creator of WomanLab, a website about sexual health. These drugs, flibanserin (a pill) and bremelanotide (an injection that is self-administered about 40 minutes before sexual activity), were approved for the “very small subset of women” who are premenopausal, have low libidos and do not have any identifiable physical, mental or relationship problems, Dr Lindau said. “They may have modest benefit, but they also come with side effects and cost,” she added. “So far, insurance coverage has been limited.” In the end, the most beneficial solution will depend on the reason you are experiencing low libido and why you consider your libido to be a problem. For older women, loss of oestrogen during menopause is commonly associated with a change in libido because it can cause vaginal dryness and tightness that can make intercourse painful. Some women also find it more difficult to get aroused. And when menopause is accompanied by hot flashes and night sweats, that can make sex seem less appealing, too. Untreated conditions like depression and anxiety can also be problematic for libido. However, some medications, including certain antidepressants, have been shown to negatively affect sexual desire, arousal and orgasm. So it’s best to speak to your doctor about all of the available options. Certain medical procedures may also lower libido, for example, if a woman had her ovaries removed or her oestrogen blocked to treat cancer. “When possible, replacing oestrogen can be a helpful adjunct to addressing low libido in some women,” Dr Lindau said, as can lubricants, exercise and speaking with a therapist. The hormone testosterone may also improve sexual function in postmenopausal women, who are distressed by a chronic loss of interest in sex, but there is limited data on its safety and effectiveness. Oftentimes, problems with libido are not purely physical. Stress is one of the most common reasons a woman’s sex drive plummets, the experts said. Low libido also can stem from energy and sleep issues, body image, relationship quality, gender inequities and other concerns. “I would encourage people complaining of low desire and those who hear the complaints to think about all the influences that exist on desire, including and beyond inside bodies,” said Sari van Anders, a professor who studies sexuality and testosterone at Queen’s University in Ontario. “Desire does not just come from a drive within our bodies; it reflects and responds to all sorts of life and societal situations.” An journal article written last year by Dr van Anders, Dr Brotto and others suggested that four factors, each influenced by societal expectations of women, contribute to the low sexual desire experienced by women in heterosexual relationships. They are inequitable divisions of household labour, the tendency for women to take on a caregiver-mother role with their male partners, an emphasis on a woman’s appearance over her own sexual pleasure – which can make her own feelings of desire contingent upon her perceived desirability – and gender norms that influence which partner initiates sex. For example, women are not typically socialised to initiate sex or prioritise their own pleasure, and they may feel uncomfortable experiencing or initiating pleasure unrelated to penetrative intercourse. The paper also noted that “low desire” might mean different things to different people. Some people want sex more than others, and it is normal for sexual desire to fluctuate over the years. The experts suggest asking yourself: Are you dissatisfied with the amount of sex that you crave? If so, why? “Low erotic desire is not a problem in and of itself unless and until partners, health professionals, media and/or culture make it into one,” Dr van Anders said. “A promising way forward is to consider that low desire itself may reflect a problem, for those who aren’t asexual, rather than be a problem in and of itself.” For example, some women may be concerned not about their own lack of desire but about a mismatch between their libido and a partner’s higher libido. “If their discrepant desire is creating a problem for the relationship, then a couples sex therapy approach is warranted,” Dr Brotto said. If therapy is not possible – perhaps you cannot find a therapist with openings or one who is affordable – Dr Brotto suggested having a conversation with your partner. Discuss planning sex during times when the person with lower desire feels most ready to do so, and increasing the amount of sexual activities that do not involve penetration. These activities may be more likely to provide pleasure to the person who has less desire. And here’s another thing to keep in mind: Feeling like you’re not in the mood doesn’t necessarily mean that you have less desire or that your level of desire is somehow insufficient. Not everyone experiences desire, then arousal. Some people need to be aroused first to experience desire. “Libido has historically been equated with spontaneous sexual desire – that feeling of wanting sex that happens out of the blue,” Dr Brotto said. “It is far less common than responsive desire – the kind of desire that is present after a sexual encounter begins.” If you tend to feel physical arousal first and mental desire second, don’t just wait for the sudden urge to have sex. Instead, set aside time to be intimate and prepare to put yourself in the right mind-set to connect physically with your partner. This might involve taking time out of your day to think about sex, masturbating, listening to a musical playlist that makes you feel sexual or watching a movie that arouses you. Talk with your partner about the different types of desire (spontaneous versus responsive) and the specific things that help you get in the mood. That way, your partner will also be thinking about how to help you build feelings of desire rather than just jumping right into it. The more you understand and respond to each other’s needs, the better your sex life will become. Finally, being mindful – a practice that helps you remember to return to the present when you become distracted – can be especially helpful when you are thinking about sex or engaging in sexual activity. “Cultivating attention to the present moment is really important for the brain-body connection that gives way to sexual response,” Dr Brotto said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/runners-itch-exercise-induced-vasculitis-itch-rash-2557431,You’re running and your legs suddenly develop a bad case of itchy rashes – what’s the reason for that?,"You’ve got your running shoes on. Your smartwatch and playlist are cued, and off you go on the PCN path. But barely minutes into your run and your legs start to itch. It’s like hundreds of ants are crawling underneath your skin – and more are coming in.  You try to ignore the irritation by focusing on your breathing, the music, the scenery… but it is soon apparent that you have to stop and scratch. And that’s when you notice that your legs have developed welts or spots where the itch is. What is going on? You might have what some runners already know as runner’s itch or what the doctors term exercise-induced vasculitis, said Dr Suzanne Cheng, a senior consultant with National Skin Centre. It sounds like an oxymoron but the itch appears “only after physical exercise in healthy people”, she said. “This condition is usually painless (65 per cent), but patients can also present with a burning or painful sensation of heaviness,” Dr Cheng explained, adding that the itch and rash are typically confined to the lower limbs. The intense itch may also be experienced on the abdomen, although there are usually no rashes, she said.  AN ITCH THAT GOES BEYOND THE SKIN Runner’s itch, which is typically felt underneath the skin, is an indication that its cause is more than skin deep. “During increased physical activity, blood flow to the lower limbs increases,” explained Dr John Wang, a visiting consultant at PanAsia Surgery, who specialises in open vascular and endovascular surgery.  “The increased blood flow causes your blood vessel network to expand, resulting in the stimulation of the nerves that surround the vasculature and surrounding tissues, which is perceived by the brain as an itching sensation,” he said.  The increased blood flow aside, your body also releases histamine during exercise to prevent fatigue, said Dr Wang, citing some research. Those same chemicals that you associate with allergies can expand your blood vessels to allow the increased blood flow to come through, he said. Unfortunately, histamine also sends the itchy message to your brain.  What about the rashes that accompany the itch? Being under the sun a lot can cause the small blood vessels known as arterioles to get inflamed and lead to the red patches, said Dr Wang.  Sometimes, you might get purplish spots or patches instead. This happens when the arterioles burst and blood starts to pool underneath the skin. “This can happen to people who engage in prolonged ambulation, such as marathon runners, especially when they run in hot weather or at high altitudes,” said Dr Wang.  WHO’S PRONE TO RUNNER’S ITCH? Took a hiatus from your CrossFit routine? Haven’t been attending your HIIT classes and you’re now going for more classes to make up for the absence? It’s not always about running; any activity that you’re not used to, such as going for a longer-than-usual walk, new golf lessons or even standing in line under the sun can trigger runner’s itch. It is not surprising that the condition is also known as Disney rash, noted Dr Wang.  Said Dr Cheng: “The rash’s sudden development is most likely from an episode of prolonged exercise, unaccustomed intense exercise activity and heat exposure”. Interestingly, not many people seek medical help for runner’s itch, she said, because it is usually self-limiting. “Most cases resolve spontaneously within 10 days.” But if the symptoms don’t abate, you should seek medical attention as some “autoimmune conditions can mimic exercise-induced vasculitis and should be investigated”, said Dr Wang, adding that genetics or a family history may also make you more prone to runner’s itch.  Dr Wang, who is a runner himself, has encountered others complaining of runner’s itch. He isn’t aware of any local registry that keeps track of cases in Singapore but said that “most trainers and coaches estimate that about 30 per cent of people who run experience runner’s itch”. The good news is, the “frequency and intensity of the itch usually reduce as the individual gets conditioned and more used to the level of physical activity with improved stamina”, he said.  WHAT CAN YOU DO? One more reason to not disrupt your fitness programme: Exercising regularly can condition your body for the changes in blood vessel dilation and take care of runner’s itch, said Dr Wang. Of course, each time you take a long break from your fitness routine, your body will need to be re-conditioned again, he said.  If you’re not opposed to taking medication, you could try antihistamines 30 minutes before a run or workout, said Dr Wang. Opt for non-drowsy, over-the-counter antihistamines such as loratadine, cetririzine or fexofenadine, he said. To improve blood circulation, wearing compression socks or elevating your legs for 15 minutes a few times a day may also be helpful, he said. If you’re restarting your running sessions or workout programme and want to avoid runner’s itch, consider exercising at a lower intensity and shorter duration, suggested Dr Cheng. And avoid exercising during the hottest hours of the day as heat is a major contributory factor, she said.  It’s also worth considering switching to lighter clothes made of quick-drying material, she said. Still on the topic of workout attire, Dr Wang said that removing your sweat-drenched clothes immediately after exercise, followed by a warm – but not hot – shower, can be helpful.  But if you still develop runner’s itch, you could try home remedies such as soaking yourself in a warm (not hot) bath with oatmeal, Epsom salt or baking soda, said Dr Wang. Or try applying a cold compress to the affected area to ease the itch, he said. Applying a mild steroid cream to the affected area may also help, said Dr Cheng. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/overworking-health-effects-heart-disease-stroke-fatigue-high-blood-pressure-2548416,"How overworking makes you really sick: What happens to your body, spotting the danger signs","It’s no longer surprising that people who work from home complain that they're clocking in longer hours than before the pandemic.  The line between office and home is blurred, and we've all heard complaints about supervisors who don’t respect the sanctity of after-work hours. It also doesn’t help when bosses have been kickstarting each week with back-to-back Zoom meetings for the past two years now.  And with Omicron cases still on the high side, uninfected staff has to work even harder – whether onsite or from home – to pick up the slack left by COVID-19-positive colleagues. This particular observation has been noted by doctors such as Dr Lim John Wah, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Occupational and Environmental Medicine Department.  “The work tends to be delegated to the remaining employees, who are forced to either work extra hours in the office or bring work home,” he said.  “Some may feel like there is not enough time in the day to accomplish their tasks”; they are not “able to complete a to-do list” and they feel “like they are never able to keep up with the constant flow of additional work”, said Dr Lim.  Technology, which serves as a boon to modern living, has proven to be another bane during the pandemic. “Some employers expect their employees to be available at all hours of the day due to the convenience of technology,” he said. MORE OVERWORKED PEOPLE While “non-specific complaints such as gastric and bowel problems, muscle and joint pains” – which are signs of overworking – have not increased at the hospital level, it is more likely because patients typically address them at their family physician’s rather than at a tertiary healthcare level, opined Dr Lim. Indeed, family doctors such as Dr Shimona Khoo from Raffles Medical have noticed an increase in the number of patients with such “symptoms suggestive of being burnt out”. “Common complaints and signs include insufficient sleep or poor sleep quality, fatigue, feeling emotionally drained, poor mood, and increased irritability,” she said.  “Coupled with physical isolation, with little to no interaction with peers and colleagues, it is not surprising that one’s physical and mental health can deteriorate over time,” said Dr Khoo.  ARE YOU OVERWORKING OR JUST GETTING OLDER? Just how detrimental to health is overworking? According to a joint paper published by the World Health Organization and the International Labour Organization in 2021, three-quarters of a million people worldwide die from ischaemic heart disease and stroke brought on by long working hours. And by “long hours”, they mean longer than 55 hours per week. The insidious thing about overworking is that the signs can be confused with getting older. Can’t keep your eyes open after burning the midnight oil to rush out a report? You’re not a spring chicken anymore. High blood pressure, increased cholesterol levels and weight gain? That’s all part and parcel of a dwindling metabolic rate caused by getting older, isn’t it?  “It is difficult to discern if the symptoms one experiences are due to overworking or are part of the natural ageing process,” said Dr Khoo. “For instance, longer working hours can result in poor sleep, insufficient time to exercise and binge eating, which lead to an increase in blood pressure, cholesterol and weight gain.” Dr Lim also agreed: “It is not easy to differentiate these two, as there is an interlink between overworking and other common health issues”. However, “people who chronically overwork may experience these health issues earlier compared to their peers from the same age group”, he added. WHY GOING ON LEAVE IS NOT ENOUGH Well, you could go on leave and finally use up some of those days your boss has been reminding you to clear. But here's the thing: Going on leave is only a temporary measure, said Dr Lim. ""When we return to the work environment that requires us to work long hours, the same problems tend to recur. It is best to target the underlying cause of overworking, instead of the symptoms of overworking,"" he said. Furthermore, not everyone can afford the luxury to take long breaks, such as two weeks, from work, said Dr Khoo. Or you may be busy with family commitments while on leave. Still, Dr Khoo said a short break here and there ""is equally important"" as it can provide a breather. ""However, achieving work-life balance is the only way to address the health effects from overworking,"" she said. WHAT IS THE DAMAGE? Working long hours induces your body to release excessive amounts of stress hormones, primarily cortisol, said psychologist Dr Adam Borland on the Mayo Clinic website, which can lead to brain fog, high blood pressure and a host of other health problems.   “It’s like a car trying to run with a very limited amount of gas in the tank,” says Dr Borland. “We’re expecting ourselves to perform physically and cognitively on such a high level but in reality, our reserves are tapped out.” According to Dr Lim, overworking isn’t a condition that occurs overnight. It is a risk that “accumulates over the years” and “preventing it from becoming chronic may reduce the long-term complications of diseases associated with overworking”, he said. Here’s a look at the damage that can happen to your health when you allow yourself to be chronically overworked and what you can do about it. However, if you experience prolonged insomnia, poor appetite, low mood, irritability, or develop suicidal thoughts, Dr Khoo strongly advises you to seek help early from a medical doctor. Having enough sleep (at least seven hours per night) doesn’t only make you more alert and productive in the day. The lack of zzzs can also increase your risk of chronic diseases such as Type 2 diabetes and heart disease.  “From a preventive medicine perspective, we recommend people who work for long hours to go for a yearly health screening to detect risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, such as the ""4 highs"": High blood pressure (hypertension), blood sugar (diabetes), cholesterol and BMI,” said Dr Lim.  For Dr Khoo, it is important to draw the distinction between work and home, so that your brain can switch off for the day. Simple routines to help you transition from ""work you"" to ""home you"" can be as easy as removing your contact lenses, changing into home clothes or taking a short walk in the park. ""When work is over, leave your workspace entirely and turn off all work-related devices,"" she said. ""As best as you can, avoid using your personal devices for work and reserve them solely for personal use only."" To help them relax, overworked individuals are at risk of turning to alcohol to cope. In fact, a study found that working more than 40 hours a week can make you more likely to drink “risky amounts of alcohol”, which translates into at least 14 drinks for women and 21 drinks for men per week.  For starters, don’t keep alcohol at home as the temptation to imbibe is within grasp. Sip your drink slowly if you must have one and chase it down with soda, juice or water (the best option), advised the Harvard University website.  Those stress hormones that your body keeps pumping out can take their toll on your vascular system and affect the heart and brain. “In a meta-analysis of 600,000 workers in the western world, those working 55 hours or longer were 23 per cent likelier to develop coronary heart disease. Additionally, the risk of stroke was elevated by 33 per cent,” said Dr Khoo.  Get moving (preferably aerobic exercise to increase your heart rate) to get those stress levels in control. Exercise increases your brain’s feel-good hormones known as endorphins and can reduce cortisol levels, according to the Mayo Clinic. If you can’t run, go for a walk around the neighbourhood before or after work. Walk to the coffeeshop a few blocks away to get your lunch instead of ordering online.  Being consistently exposed to cortisol can weaken your immune system, according to Dr Lim. This can lower your ability to fight against common infection, said Dr Khoo. And in these COVID-19 times, that is not good news at all.  Your solution: Take micro-breaks using the 20-20-20 rule, said Dr Lim. For instance, for every 20 minutes spent looking at a screen, look at something 20 feet (6m) away for 20 seconds. Don’t skip breakfast and don’t work through lunch. Missing meals and keeping irregular mealtimes can exacerbate existing gastrointestinal conditions and create new ones such as nausea, bloating and heart burn, said Dr Khoo. It is important to give yourself a scheduled time and place to eat so that you can focus on resting and recharging, she said.  Stooping over the keyboard doesn’t spell good news for your muscles and joints. “Chronic stress from overworking causes our muscles to remain taut and tense, resulting in aches in the shoulders, neck, and the back,” said Dr Khoo. “Patients may even go on to develop tension-type headache if the facial muscles become involved.” Contrary to popular belief, it is not normal to have back aches, and stiff shoulders and neck. Your body loves motion and the discomfort you feel is your body rebelling from being forced into the seated posture at your desk for hours on end.  You could do some stretches, or get up from your seat periodically and walk to the window to admire your houseplants. Or you could try to minimise distractions while working and reduce the number of hours ""at work"", said Dr Khoo.  ""The simple act of minimising the number of active programmes and apps on your work devices can help one to focus on work-related activities and improve efficiency.""  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/suffering-back-pain-heres-how-simple-exercises-may-save-your-lower-back-2537321,Suffering from back pain? Here's how simple exercises may save your lower back,"The past few years have not been kind to my lower back. Between the physical tolls of pregnancy, parenting and working from home, I have a constant stiff, achy feeling in my lower spine. I am not alone: It’s estimated that up to 80 per cent of Americans will develop lower back pain during their lifetime, with 15 to 20 per cent of adults reporting it in an average year. Could exercise prevent some of this pain? The short answer is maybe. A consistent mixture of cardio and dedicated core work can help. However, exercise alone is not a guarantee of pain relief, as there are a number of mistakes that many of us, even experienced athletes, may make. THE SPINE IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO PAIN WHEN CORE MUSCLES ARE WEAK. “The lower back is the centre point of our whole body,” said Dr Krishna Shah, an interventional pain specialist at Baylor College of Medicine. The spine has to be mobile, able to bend and twist in multiple directions, while also bearing the weight of our body. Surrounding the spine are the core muscles. Although we tend to think of our core as the abdominals, it also includes the deep back muscles, as well as the hip muscles, quadriceps and hamstrings, which support our spine and pelvis. Core muscles work similarly to a back brace, keeping the midsection stable and upright. That’s why wearing a brace provides short-term pain relief for patients with lower back pain, but relying on one too much can weaken their core muscles. Instead, the goal should be to strengthen those muscles enough to do the brace’s job. “If you can develop your own internal brace, that is more effective,” said Dr Sean Barber, a neurosurgeon and spine specialist at Houston Methodist Hospital. Acute back pain is often the result of pulling or straining a muscle while trying a movement that requires a muscle that has become weak or stiff. If this muscle can’t provide the needed force, then the pressure shifts to the spine in a way that leads to pain. Developing core strength, flexibility and muscular control can help you avoid these pulled or strained muscles. EXERCISE STRENGTHENS THE SPINE. The simplest way to strengthen your spine is to move regularly throughout the day, in whatever capacity works for you. This might mean increasing your daily steps, taking short walks during the workday or prioritising a slightly longer walk in the morning or evening. People who are physically active tend to have lower rates of back pain, and a recent meta-analysis of 25 studies found that the most effective way to prevent lower back pain from recurring was regular exercise, preferably combined with some form of physical education. “Exercise doesn’t cure everybody, but on average, it’s an effective intervention,” said Mark Hancock, a professor of physiotherapy at Macquarie University and one of the authors of the study. There is no single type of exercise that has been shown to be effective, he said. “If you are doing a variety of exercises, then you are likely getting all the things you need,” he said, adding, “It’s just like your diet.” Physical activity also strengthens the bones and cartilage of the spine, protecting against age-related degeneration, and increases blood flow to cartilage discs in the spine that don’t receive a lot of blood supply, Shah said. If you have time, try some fast walking or jogging. A number of studies suggest that runners have thicker, healthier cartilage discs in their spine than people who aren’t active. WORK THE NEGLECTED DEEP CORE MUSCLES. Working the core is crucial to avoiding future back pain, but that doesn’t mean shredding your abs to look like Chris Hemsworth. Popular core-strengthening exercises, such as crunches or situps, primarily work the larger, exterior muscles, while neglecting the deeper muscles. For instance, the transverse abdominis is a delicate sheetlike deep muscle that wraps the midsection like a corset. There is also the multifidus, a muscle that lines the spine, with a number of extensions that wrap each individual vertebra, similar to the way a bicycle chain wraps the sprocket. “It doesn’t take that much effort to activate these deep muscles, but they are neglected because you can’t see them” when you are at the beach, said Femi Betiku, a physical therapist at the New Jersey Center of Physical Therapy who specialises in treating lower back pain. People with six-packs can still have lower back pain, he added, if they are working only the stronger, outer muscles. The deeper muscles get engaged during movements requiring more control than raw power. One way to activate your deep core muscles is by doing planks, whether it’s a regular plank, a side plank or some of the many other variations. If holding a regular plank is uncomfortable, start with your knees on the ground, then progress to balancing on your toes. Shah also suggested squats, push-ups and bridges. To build and maintain core strength, he recommends two to three sessions of dedicated core work a week. “This is a lifestyle change,” he said. There are also sports and physical activities that require light contraction of the core, such as kayaking, cycling, dancing, barre classes, boxing, rock climbing and swimming. Any activity that requires a certain level of control over the midsection will help activate and engage those deeper muscles. WORK ON CONTROLLING THE SPINE. In addition to strengthening exercises, emerging research suggests it’s important to develop muscular coordination and spine control. This is just as true for athletes, who focus on performance and sometimes neglect exercises aimed at controlling the spine and pelvis. In a 2018 study, researchers compared elite athletes to a population of moderately active people. Half of each group had lower back pain. To the researchers’ surprise, both elite athletes and regular people with lower back pain had a similar stiffness in and lack of control over their spine, which is indicative of a similar pattern of weakness in their back muscles. “The key factor is how able you are to control your muscles,” said Maria Moreno Catala, a researcher at the Humboldt University of Berlin and the lead author of the study. To combat this, Betiku recommends Pilates because, in addition to strengthening the deeper core muscles, the exercises promote muscular control. For a number of the exercises, the spine either remains stable or moves very slowly, which develops muscle control along the spine when it is in different positions. Incorporating Pilates into your fitness routine can be as simple as doing short workout videos, many of which require little to no equipment, two to three times a week. INCORPORATE AN ELEMENT OF INSTABILITY INTO YOUR WORKOUT. The slow, controlled movements in exercises like Pilates teach your muscles to move the spine efficiently. The next step is to start exercising in a more variable environment, which develops even more coordination and control. In another study, Moreno Catala and her collaborators found that adding instability to exercises – like balancing on an uneven surface or even working out in a noisy environment – was effective at relieving lower back pain. Moreno Catala said it is less about the amount of muscular strength and more about the ability to finely control the activation and deactivation of all the muscles that stabilise the spine. “We think the size of the muscle is the most important quality, but it’s also the quality of activation that is important,” she said. Choosing sports that include an element of reactivity, whether it’s hiking on a rocky surface or reacting to a sudden tennis volley, can result in a similar level of muscular development and control. Body weight exercises, such as push-ups, pull-ups, burpees and squats, also help, since they require full-body coordination, rather than the isolated movement of lifting weights. Like many, I am guilty of working the outer core muscles while neglecting the deeper ones. But for the past few weeks, I’ve started doing some short Pilates videos, 10 to 20 minutes each, focusing on slow, controlled movements. Two weeks in, the stiff feeling in my back started to fade, disappearing for hours at a time. As it turned out, all my lower back really needed was to develop a little more coordination and control.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/how-coronavirus-steals-sense-smell-making-food-tasteless-and-odours-noxious-2556926,"How the coronavirus steals the sense of smell, making food tasteless and odours noxious","Few of COVID-19’s peculiarities have piqued as much interest as anosmia, the abrupt loss of smell that has become a well-known hallmark of the disease. COVID-19 patients lose this sense even without a stuffy nose; the loss can make food taste like cardboard and coffee smell noxious, occasionally persisting after other symptoms have resolved. Scientists are now beginning to unravel the biological mechanisms, which have been something of a mystery: The neurons that detect odours lack the receptors that the coronavirus uses to enter cells, prompting a long debate about whether they can be infected at all. Insights gleaned from new research could shed new light on how the coronavirus might affect other types of brain cells, leading to conditions like “brain fog,” and possibly help explain the biological mechanisms behind long COVID – symptoms that linger for weeks or months after the initial infection. The new work, along with earlier studies, settles the debate over whether the coronavirus infects the nerve cells that detect odours: It does not. But the virus does attack other supporting cells that line the nasal cavity, the researchers found. The infected cells shed virus and die, while immune cells flood the region to fight the virus. The subsequent inflammation wreaks havoc on smell receptors, proteins on the surface of the nerve cells in the nose that detect and transmit information about odours. The process alters the sophisticated organisation of genes in those neurons, essentially short-circuiting them, the researchers reported. Their paper significantly advances the understanding of how cells critical to the sense of smell are affected by the virus, despite the fact that they are not directly infected, said Dr Sandeep Robert Datta, an associate professor of neurobiology at Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the study. “It’s clear that indirectly, if you affect the support cells in the nose, lots of bad things happen,” Datta said. “The inflammation in the adjacent cells triggers changes in the sensory neurons that prevent them from working properly.” Indeed, many complications of COVID-19 appear to be caused by the immune system’s friendly fire as it responds to infection by flooding the bloodstream with inflammatory proteins called cytokines, which can damage tissue and organs. “This might be a general principle: That a lot of what the virus is doing to us is a consequence of its ability to generate inflammation,” Datta said. The new study is based on research carried out at Zuckerman Institute and Irving Medical Center at Columbia University in New York; the New York University Grossman School of Medicine; the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York; Baylor Genetics in Houston; and the School of Medicine at the University of California, Davis. The research was published online in Cell in early February. The scientists examined golden hamsters and human tissue specimens from 23 patients who succumbed to COVID-19. After the hamsters were infected with the original coronavirus, scientists tracked the damage to their olfactory systems over time. (How do you know a golden hamster has lost its sense of smell? You don’t feed it for several hours and then bury Cocoa Puffs in its bedding, said Benjamin tenOever, a professor of microbiology at NYU Langone Health and an author of the new research. Hamsters that can smell will find the cereal in seconds.) The virus did not invade neurons, the researchers learned, only the cells that play supporting roles in the olfactory system. But that was enough to alter the function of the nearby neurons, leading to a loss of smell. The immune response altered the architecture of genes in the neurons, disrupting production of odour receptors, said Marianna Zazhytska, a postdoctoral fellow at the Zuckerman Institute and one of the paper’s first authors, along with a graduate student, Albana Kodra. “It is not the virus itself causing all this reorganisation – it’s the systemic inflammatory response,” Zazhytska said. “The nerve cells are not hosting the virus, but they are not doing what they did before.” The ability of the olfactory receptors to send and receive messages is disrupted. But the neurons don’t die, and so the system can recover after the illness resolves. Earlier work at the Zuckerman Institute showed that neurons that detect smells have complex genomic organisational structures that are essential to the creation of odour receptors, and the receptor genes communicate among themselves very intensively, said Stavros Lomvardas, one of the paper’s corresponding authors. “We saw early on that upon infection, the genomic organisation of these neurons changes completely – they’re unrecognisable compared to how they normally are,” Lomvardas said. “There is a signal released from the infected cells that is received by the neurons that normally detect odours, and tells them to reorganise and stop expression of olfactory receptor genes,” he said. He suggested this may represent an evolutionary adaptation that offers a form of antiviral resistance and whose main purpose may be to prevent the virus from entering the brain. “That was a relief for us,” he said. “That was one piece of good news.” By Roni Caryn Rabin © 2022 The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/doctors-welcome-move-enrol-family-health-cos-debate-2557581,'Preventive health is the cheapest medicine': GPs welcome move to get people to enrol with family doctor,"SINGAPORE: General practitioners (GPs) said that a move to get people to enrol with a family doctor as their first line of care will allow them to detect and diagnose diseases earlier and potentially buy their patients years of better quality of life. The move to invite residents to register with a GP or polyclinic doctor of their choice from next year was announced by Health Minister Ong Ye Kung during his ministry’s Committee of Supply debate on Wednesday (Mar 9). The initiative will likely start with those in their 40s and above, Mr Ong added. Speaking to CNA following the announcement, Dr Mark Yap, who runs a clinic in Bukit Panjang, gave the example of a patient whose parents have diabetes. Given the family history, it is likely that the patient will get diabetes in his lifetime, he said. “The earlier I can see you and I can educate you and we can delay the onset of diabetes, let’s say instead of catching it at 30, you catch it at 50. I am buying you 20 years of quality of life,” he said. He added that this may in turn reduce the chances of further health complications as a result of diabetes. In addition, healthcare resources can be better managed and this will help patients spend less on medicine over the long-term, Dr Yap said.   “Preventive health is the cheapest medicine,” he said, adding that the move is ""long overdue"". Similarly, Dr Elly Sabrina, a GP in Woodlands, said that detecting abnormalities with a patient she is already familiar with is much easier. “You've seen the patient for years and suddenly you detect certain symptoms and signs, for example, they might be developing Parkinson's, rather than if I see the patient for the first time. It's not easy to work on an empty page,” she said. Dr Philip Koh, who runs a clinic in Tampines, said that beyond allowing doctors to pick out diseases early, seeing the same doctor will boost familiarity and trust between both parties. “This doctor-patient relationship is sacred to the well-being of a patient through his life. It takes time for trust to be built and at the end of the day, it’s all about trust,” Dr Koh said. Illustrating his point, Dr Koh recounted a time when a patient’s family called for advice on a life-or-death situation. Diagnosed with cancer and with possibly only one week left to live, the family wanted to know if the patient should undergo an expensive treatment. “As you grow older, you will encounter decisions of this nature … sometimes, in the state of sickness you're not able to make the right decision yourself. You need someone who you trust and who is able to give you the best advice,"" he said. Associate Professor Tan Tze Lee, the president of College of Family Physicians Singapore, echoed the view.  The essence of having a family doctor is the development of a deep and meaningful relationship between patients and their chosen family doctor, he said. “(It is) the deep trust and confidence they have that their doctor would do the best for them and will seek the best care for them,” said Assoc Prof Tan, who has a clinic in Choa Chu Kang. “It is this relationship that is built up and developed over time that helps to promote better health and better outcomes.” GPs who spoke to CNA said that more of them are now specialised in family medicine. “I think all these years, the impression of most of the public is that we are cough and cold doctors … though we can do much much more,” said Dr Vincent Chua. For instance, he offers knee injections, and is trained to stitch up wounds in his Tiong Bahru clinic.  In addition, GPs also do vaccinations and conduct house calls to the elderly who are home-bound, said Dr Yap. “Family medicine is actually quite holistic in the sense that not only do you look at acute problems, you look after chronic problems, not only do you look at a certain age group, but it cuts across all age groups,” he said. While the doctors largely supported the move to have patients enrol with one primary care doctor, they also pointed to potential pitfalls. One common scenario they brought up was of working adults seeking treatment at clinics under their company’s insurance coverage. Dr Chua said this “big category” of working adults is a group of patients for whom this scheme is “not likely to work”.  “The reason why they see a doctor is not that they like me or I'm good. It’s because they don’t have to pay,” he said. Assoc Prof Tan added that if patients are restricted to one clinic, they might have a problem if the clinic is closed when they are unwell. While changing doctors may be inevitable for some patients, one way to minimise disruption is to get a recommendation from the first doctor, said Dr Koh. He added that he has recommended his patients to other doctors, and has also received new referrals. “Because of that communication, if there's anything (I need to find out), I can always go back to that doctor,” he said. The doctors CNA spoke to said they all look forward to seeing how the scheme will be rolled out. “Everybody agrees that the devil is in the details,” said Dr Yap. The Health Ministry had announced that over the next few months, it will consult stakeholders, including members of the public, GPs, healthcare workers and community partners, to gather their views. It will then provide more details in a White Paper and table it for debate in Parliament, adding that it will share more details of the public consultation plans when ready."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-measures-streamlined-safe-distancing-masks-household-visitors-mar-15-2557936,Singapore to implement streamlined COVID-19 measures from Mar 15 as Omicron wave wanes,"SINGAPORE: Singapore will implement streamlined COVID-19 safe management measures on Mar 15 as the Omicron wave has peaked, announced co-chair of the multi-ministry task force Gan Kim Yong on Friday (Mar 11).  The measures, covering areas such as safe distancing, the number of household visitors allowed and event capacity limits, were announced last month, but they had to be postponed due to a spike in COVID-19 cases. “We are keeping the key safe management measures like mask-wearing and group sizes for social gatherings and dining. So this is not a relaxation but a streamlining (of rules),” said Mr Gan, who is also Minister for Trade and Industry.  “The streamlining of SMMs (safe management measures) is important, as it will be easier for businesses and individuals to understand and comply with and also encourage a greater sense of personal individual responsibility.”  The streamlined rules will focus on five areas - group sizes, mask-wearing, workplace requirements, safe distancing and capacity limits.  The maximum group size for social gatherings remains at five. But as previously announced, the maximum number of unique visitors per household will be adjusted from five people per day, to five people at any one time.  “This can be perceived as an easing of measures, as many infections do take place at home. However, households typically do not receive multiple sets of visitors outside of festive periods and those who want to meet multiple groups of friends have been doing so outside of their homes,” said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a media release.  “We urge everyone to continue to exercise restraint in meeting multiple groups of friends, be it outside or at home, and especially if you live with vulnerable persons.”  From Mar 15, unvaccinated children aged 12 and below also do not need to be in the same household to be included in a group entering places with vaccinated differentiated measures. Wearing a mask will continue to be the default, said co-chair of the task force Lawrence Wong.  However, in settings with masks on, safe distancing will no longer be required although it is encouraged, he added. Safe distancing is still a must when masks are not worn, said Mr Wong, and the required distance will be fixed at 1m for all settings. For event sizes, they will be set based on the capacity of the venue. Specific size limits for events like religious services, business events, funerals, solemnisations, wedding receptions and mask-on classes will be lifted, said MOH. Zoning requirements will also be removed, since the “main protection” is through masks and COVID-19 vaccination, it added. For settings or events with 1,000 people or fewer, these can proceed without being subject to any capacity limits, said the Health Ministry. But for large events and settings with more than 1,000 people, a capacity limit of 50 per cent will be imposed “as a precaution” due to “greater infection risks”, the ministry added. These include attractions, cruises, MICE and large work-related events, as well as large performing arts venues and sports stadiums.  At the workplace, the current arrangement of allowing up to 50 per cent of employees who can work from home to return to the office will continue, said Mr Wong.  As announced by the task force previously, the rules for social gatherings will now apply to workplaces and other social settings, as long as general group size and masking rules are adhered to, said MOH. “As economic activities pick up, we will also remove the specific restriction on cross-deployment of employees across workplaces, although employers may continue to do so for business continuity reasons,” the ministry added. Stressing that this is not meant to be an easing of rules, Mr Wong said: “We have assessed this very carefully, distilled this to the most important and effective SMMs, and we believe doing so will not result in additional risks or transmission risks, because this is not meant to be an easing of rules, it’s meant to be a streamlining exercise.” Now that Singapore is past the peak of the Omicron wave, the stress on the healthcare system is likely to ease “in the coming weeks”, he added. “Exactly when this will happen, it’s still early to say because the system is still very busy now, but as the curve comes down as the infection rate comes down, we will see some easing of the pressures on our healthcare system. “And if this continues … we will take further significant steps to ease up, and that means allowing freer international travel, and relaxing further our SMMs.” For instance, group sizes could be increased, and mask-wearing rules could change for indoor or outdoor settings, said Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister.  Rules for other specific settings or higher-risk activities and venues like the 10.30pm cut-off time for alcohol consumption, intermingling across tables and nightlife activities will be reviewed as part of Singapore’s “broader easing”, he said. “We will continue to study these different parameters very closely while keeping a close watch on our healthcare system, and we will provide further updates when we are ready.” Watch the full news conference, including the Q&A session with journalists: "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/first-person-receive-pig-heart-transplant-dies-after-2-months-2552651,First person to receive pig heart transplant dies after 2 months,"The first person to receive a pig heart transplant has died two months after the historic procedure, the hospital that carried out the surgery said Wednesday (Mar 9). David Bennett, 57, who passed away Mar 8, had received his transplant on Jan 7, University of Maryland Medical System said in a statement. ""His condition began deteriorating several days ago. After it became clear that he would not recover, he was given compassionate palliative care. He was able to communicate with his family during his final hours,"" the statement said. The surgery, performed by a team at the University of Maryland Medicine, was among the first to demonstrate the feasibility of a pig-to-human heart transplant, a field made possible by new gene editing tools. After Bennett was implanted with a pig heart that had been genetically modified to prevent rejection, his son called the procedure ""a miracle"". ""Before consenting to receive the transplant, Mr Bennett was fully informed of the procedure's risks, and that the procedure was experimental with unknown risks and benefits,"" the hospital said. Pigs have long been a tantalising source of potential transplants because their organs are so similar to human organs. A hog heart at the time of slaughter, for example, is about the size of an adult human heart. Other organs from pigs being researched for transplantation into humans include the kidneys, liver and lungs. Prior efforts at pig-to-human transplants have failed because of genetic differences that caused organ rejection or viruses that posed an infection risk. About 110,000 Americans are currently waiting for an organ transplant, and more than 6,000 patients die each year before getting one, according to organdonor.gov. Bennett first came to the University of Maryland Medical Center as a patient in October and was placed on a heart-lung bypass machine to keep him alive, but he was deemed ineligible for a conventional heart transplant. For Bennett, the procedure was his last option. On Dec 31, the US Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency authorisation for the surgery in the hope of saving his life. The transplanted heart performed ""very well for several weeks without any signs of rejection,"" the hospital said on Wednesday. Bennett's genetically modified pig heart was provided by Revivicor, a regenerative medicine company based in Blacksburg, Virginia. In the heart implanted in Bennett, three genes previously linked with organ rejection were ""knocked out"" of the donor pig, and six human genes linked with immune acceptance were inserted into the pig genome. Researchers also deleted a pig gene to prevent excessive growth of the pig heart tissue."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/family-doctor-gp-healthcare-healthier-sg-2551331,Singapore residents to be invited to enrol with a family doctor as first line of care,"SINGAPORE: Residents here will be invited to enrol with a general practitioner (GP) or polyclinic doctor of their choice as their first line of care from next year, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Wednesday (Mar 9). The GPs and polyclinic doctors, also called family physicians, will support these individuals throughout their life for different health needs to ensure continuity of care, MOH said in a press release. Speaking during his ministry’s Committee of Supply debate, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said that MOH will probably start with people in their 40s and above. “That is when chronic illnesses may start to set in. We will have to build up the participation base progressively,” Mr Ong said. Residents will be enrolled based on where they live. Currently, close to nine in 10 residents visit a family physician or hospital near their home.  However, people can choose doctors far away from their home, MOH said, giving the example of those who continue to visit doctors from their childhood. Even after enrolment, people can make changes when the need arises, for instance, when they move to a new house.  The initiative is a major part of a new strategy called Healthier SG which outlines a “major reform of the healthcare sector”, including the integration of GPs into the public healthcare ecosystem and focus on preventive care. “Studies have shown that people who go to only one family doctor consistently are generally healthier and have fewer hospitalisation and emergency department visits,” Mr Ong said. This is because the doctor and the care team know them well and can better detect early signs of any problems timely and accurately, he added. Only three in five Singaporeans currently have a regular doctor, he noted. The rest tend to doctor-hop, for instance, to one doctor for hypertension medicine and another doctor for a medical certificate for cough and cold, Mr Ong said.  “There is no one family doctor who knows our overall health condition and family health history well enough, to be able to see the link between different care episodes,” he said.  “We can leverage GPs to attend to more patients, not for coughs and colds, but devoting time to provide preventive care.” MOH will partner the three healthcare clusters - National University Health System (NUHS), National Healthcare Group (NHG) and SingHealth - to support the GPs who are operating within their region and integrate them into the overall health system, such as by enabling data sharing and building up team-based care.  The national enrolment programme will be coordinated by the three healthcare clusters, with each cluster looking after a region of up to 1.5 million residents. The clusters will work with GPs and other partners in the region to engage residents and strengthen care for them.   “Family physicians may work with the polyclinic or hospital in the management of patients with more complex needs,” MOH said. MOH added that upon discharge, hospitals would refer patients to the family physician they are enrolled with, to ensure continuity of care.  “There could also be shared care between family physicians and specialists or other allied health professionals to jointly support patients based on their care needs.”  More details of Healthier SG are being worked out, MOH said. Over the next few months, the ministry will consult stakeholders, including members of the public, GPs, healthcare workers and community partners, to gather their views. It will then provide more details of Healthier SG in a White Paper and table it for debate in Parliament, it said, adding that it will share more details of the public consultation plans when ready. MOH also announced it will move to a capitation model in its funding of the three healthcare clusters, in which NUHS, NHG and SingHealth will get a pre-determined fee for every resident living in the region that they are looking after. “With this funding shift, there will be a natural incentive for hospitals to try to keep residents healthy through preventive care,” MOH said. The new model will also allow them “greater latitude” to determine how they will support the residents, MOH added.  Currently, clusters are funded based on a workload-based model, which means funding is based on the volume of services they provide, such as the number of surgical operations and patient load. “It’s to put the funding in the hands of the clusters, incentivising them to think of how they would save some of the funding,” MOH said, explaining the rationale for the change. It added that this could be by moving patients into other care settings that could possibly cost lower. The scope of the model will be “progressively broadened as various aspects of clusters’ operations are ready”, the ministry said. Complementing this new basis of funding is a set of key health outcomes, said Mr Ong. Some “salient indicators” include quality of care, uptake of healthy lifestyles and habits, prevalence of chronic illness and cost effectiveness of treatments, he said. Under the new system, the absolute budgets of each healthcare cluster will not be affected, added Mr Ong. “In fact, the budgets will go up a little bit. What will change is the basis of calculating the budgets,” he said. To support the healthcare reform and shifts needed, MOH said it will invest further in manpower and build up “critical support pillars in technology and data”. In terms of manpower, the Government has placed a strong emphasis on family medicine training and education in recent years, MOH said.  “We will explore further measures to ensure new graduates have a more broad-based experience,” it said, adding that post-graduate training in family medicine is also being strengthened. The ministry will study how it can provide better data support for family physicians, such as giving them access to patients’ medical records and tools like clinical dashboards to better track their patient’s conditions and health trends over time. To support this, MOH pointed to the National Electronic Health Record (NEHR) system it has been developing to synchronise information and enable access by the patients’ care team across settings. New legislation, a Health Information Bill, will be put in place to govern this, MOH said.  “With more accessing shared data and handling individual records, there is a need to ensure and facilitate secured data sharing, and for users to take greater responsibility for data access,” MOH said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/salt-intake-singapore-moh-measures-curb-consumption-2551416,MOH to introduce measures to curb salt consumption,"SINGAPORE: Singaporeans are eating too much salt, and the Ministry of Health (MOH) will introduce measures to curb its consumption, said its Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu Mahzam in Parliament on Wednesday (Mar 9). Speaking during her ministry’s Committee of Supply debate, Ms Rahayu said people in Singapore consumed almost double the recommended daily salt limit. Singapore residents consume an average of 3,600mg of sodium a day or more than one-and-a-half teaspoons of salt daily, Ms Rahayu said.
 
This is almost double that of the World Health Organization’s recommended limit of less than 2,000mg of sodium a day. ""High sodium intake is associated with increased risk of hypertension, which is in turn associated with higher risks of cardiovascular complications such as stroke and heart attack,"" she said. She also cited figures that show that more than one in three Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years had hypertension between 2019 and 2020.  The Health Promotion Board (HPB) will work with salt suppliers and the food service sector to encourage the substitution of regular salt used in cooking with lower-sodium alternatives, MOH said in a separate press release. Such alternatives include lower-sodium salt, which contains 30 per cent less sodium at the same quantity. “The food service sector is a major contributor to our sodium intake and the impact is set to grow as more Singaporeans eat out,” MOH said. HPB will ramp up existing efforts under the Healthier Ingredient Development Scheme to spur industry reformulation of lower-sodium salt, sauces and seasonings to further increase the range and variety of healthier choices for Singaporeans. It will also invest in “upstream prototyping” for sauces and seasonings using lower-sodium salt, focusing on products commonly used by the food service sector to spur business innovation, MOH added.  On top of existing public education efforts, HPB will launch a nationwide campaign to encourage Singaporeans to take steps to reduce their sodium intake.  “The campaign will educate on the harms of consuming too much salt, build awareness of salt substitutes and highlight how consumers can replace salt in their foods while retaining flavour,” MOH said. Speaking specifically on healthcare support for ethnic minorities, Ms Rahayu said HPB will partner the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth to establish a S$1.5 million Our Healthy Singapore Fund. The fund will support community volunteers and partners to develop programmes that are “closely in tune” with their communities’ needs, and therefore be more targeted and effective in developing a healthier nation, she said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/how-lower-high-cholesterol-levels-medicine-diet-exercise-2524571,High cholesterol levels: Why taking your medicine diligently is more effective than changing your diet,"No one likes the idea of popping pills every morning. Take cholesterol-lowering medicines or statins, for example. To get themselves off the hook, many patients with high cholesterol levels tend to believe that diet changes and other lifestyle modifications alone would work.  Interestingly, when it comes to lowering cholesterol levels, being diligent with your medicine is far more beneficial than giving up wagyu beef. A local study by SingHealth Polyclinics (SHP) has found “adherence to medication to be the most critical factor” compared to other considerations such as ethnicity, diet, exercise and smoking.  Just how much more effective? Professor Tan Huay Cheem, a senior consultant with the Department of Cardiology at National University Heart Centre, Singapore, who isn’t part of the study, provided the breakdown below: Dr Tan Ngiap Chuan, who led the study and is the director of research at SHP, said the findings could prompt doctors to prioritise starting or adjusting medications with their patients. ""We usually focus on other lifestyle factors first. We may switch the order now."" HOW DO THESE MEDICINES WORK? In Singapore, nearly two out of 10 adults aged 18 to 69 have high cholesterol, according to the SHP study.  If you’re one of them, you’re probably put on statins (including atorvastatin and rosuvastatin), the most commonly prescribed medicine, said Prof Tan.  Statins are also known as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and they “work in the liver to prevent cholesterol from forming and reduce the amount of cholesterol circulating in the blood”.  “They are most effective at lowering LDL (bad) cholesterol, but also help to lower triglycerides and raise HDL (good) cholesterol,” said Prof Tan.  In addition to statins, a new class of injectables have emerged in recent years. They provide an alternative for patients “who are unable to achieve their targeted cholesterol levels, who are statin intolerant, or unable to adhere to regular therapies”, said Prof Tan.  These include the PCSK9 inhibitors (such as evolocumab and alirocumab), which are injected once every two weeks.  There are also the small interfering RNA or siRNA, which requires subcutaneous injection only once every six months. These siRNA include inclisiran, which was recently approved by Singapore’s Health Sciences Authority and the US Food and Drug Administration, said Prof Tan. “The injectables can be used in combination with oral medicines.” Unfortunately, the commonly prescribed statins have received bad press on social media, said Prof Tan, even though they have been “proven to be effective in preventing heart attacks, strokes and death – even among low-risk patients”. It has led patients to develop “unfounded fears” for statin-associated side effects, he said.  Here, Prof Tan tackles some of the common misconceptions patients have about statins: MISCONCEPTION 1: Doctors prescribe statins as a catch-all Statins are widely used as they satisfy two crucial functions in disease management: Preventing the onset of disease before it begins; and reducing the severity or impact of a disease if it already has by “halting its progress and preventing recurrences”, said Prof Tan.  “Certainly, patients who are at low risk for heart attack and stroke will benefit less from taking statins,” he said. But “among medical experts, there is little debate on whether statins work in high-risk patients”.  Having said that, statins aren’t prescribed indiscriminately. According to Prof Tan, patients are usually started on a course only if they satisfy any of these criteria: MISCONCEPTION 2: Once you start on statins, you have to be on them for life This is true, though. The cholesterol-lowering benefits conferred by statins will only continue for as long as you take the medicine, said Prof Tan. “The cardio-protective effect is lost when the statins are stopped.” You would have considered to have discontinued your medication if you stopped for more than a year.  Perhaps the more pertinent question is: What are the effects of being on statins in the long run? “Studies have shown that statins are safe and well tolerated. They have been used for more than 30 years to lower cholesterol. In fact, statins work best when you take them for a long time,” said Prof Tan.  Look at it as insurance for a longer life and to prevent heart attacks and strokes, he added.  MISCONCEPTION 3: Statins cause diabetes Statins have been found to slightly elevate blood sugar levels in clinical trials, said Prof Tan. And this creates the impression that statins can lead to diabetes.  “However, people experiencing this side effect are already prediabetic or have higher than normal blood sugar. For those who are borderline diabetic, this mild increase in blood sugar can lead to a diabetes diagnosis about five weeks earlier than it would be otherwise,” he said. But if you’re not already predisposed to diabetes, that is, your blood sugar levels are normal, statins do not induce diabetes, said Prof Tan.  “Additionally, the benefits of reducing cardiac events in someone who has prediabetes or is diabetic greatly outweigh the slight increase in their blood sugar which may occur,” he said. MISCONCEPTION 4: Statins destroy muscle tissue The muscle-destroying conditions that you might have read about are known as myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. “Serious muscle damage such as myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are rare,” said Prof Tan.  Myopathy refers to any disease that causes the muscles to lose control, leading to muscle weakness. Rhabdomyolysis, on the other hand, results from the disintegration of the muscle fibres. Both conditions have been linked to the frequent use of statins.  Prof Tan said that statin-associated muscle symptoms have been reported in studies in varying frequencies, from 10 per cent to 15 per cent in patients. However, he claimed that the incidence rate may be overestimated due to the nocebo effect.  “This is when a patient with negative expectations of a medicine would experience its potential side effects at a much higher rate than he otherwise would,” said Prof Tan.  If you suspect you have statin-associated muscle symptoms, the ache and tenderness typically involve large muscle groups such as the shoulders and the thighs, and are usually bilateral. They also tend to be more pronounced after physical exercise, said Prof Tan.  Speak to your doctor who can put you on a different statin or reduce the dose, he said.   MISCONCEPTION 5: Statins do not really prevent vascular disease Vascular disease refers to any condition that affects the blood vessels in your body. As you’d already know, having a high cholesterol level means that you have a high amount of fat and cholesterol deposits coursing through your blood vessels that can accumulate and block the vessels. When that happens, you run a high risk for cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and strokes.  “Lowering cholesterol levels reduces the risk of such events,” said Prof Tan.  And what about statins’ contribution? “In the high-risk populations studied, those who took statins had 20 per cent to 40 per cent fewer heart attacks, strokes and deaths than those who did not over two to five years,” said Prof Tan.  “Statin therapy is also the standard of care for patients with peripheral artery disease (that is, blockages that occur in the lower limb arteries) in all the international guidelines.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-insider/full-time-caregiver-depression-burnout-maid-dementia-2519056,"She put her life on hold to care for mum. Despite loneliness and depression, she isn't giving up","SINGAPORE: Nadia Daeng’s life changed dramatically when her mother had a stroke. It was 2019, and the then 36-year-old was working for a global public relations and sports marketing agency in Singapore. She was good at her job and enjoyed travelling the world, attending events and meeting VIPs. She was renting a flat in the central business district with her eldest brother, Andy, and was in a committed relationship with her partner, Wayne Ree. But her mother’s health was deteriorating. The septuagenarian had a mild heart attack in September, which made Nadia “start to panic” and to pull back on projects at work. Then in October, the stroke happened, affecting her mother’s memory, mobility and speech. It was a trigger for her to stop working and become her mother’s full-time carer. Today, Nadia has battled loneliness and caregiver burnout. Her life is on hold, and she still has no idea where it is heading. But she has made the best of things as seen in Altered Lives, a four-part series on the disconnect some people suffer and how circumstances change lives. Despite having to sacrifice her career, it did not take much for Nadia, the youngest of four children, to make the decision. “I always get the question, why don’t you just get a maid?” she said. “I don’t see how I’m expected to just leave my mother in the hands of someone she doesn’t know, in such a private and almost … invasive manner on a daily basis.” Besides, she added, her mother looked after her and her siblings in the same dutiful way when they were children. Her brothers help with expenses and do what they can, while elder sister Lynda has special needs. She and Andy also gave up their flat and moved into their mother’s one-room rental unit. During her mother’s initial months of recovery in hospital, Nadia was there almost every night, observing how the nurses took care of her mother and learning from them. “They essentially gave me four months of intensive caregiver training,” she said. Her daily duties include helping her mother clean herself, giving medication and even checking her mother’s stool for blood. “For some reason, I’m not disgusted by it,” she said. “I think (it’s) because I look at it from a project management perspective, which is what I used to do.” She struggles, however, with loneliness, loss of self-identity and having to navigate depression. The only time she has for herself is during her mother’s twice-weekly physiotherapy sessions at a senior care centre. “I’m grieving the non-existence of my personal identity, because right now I feel like I’m living in the service of others,” she said. For two years, she did not go out at night and saw Wayne only twice or thrice a week for lunch. But those precious lunches sometimes had to play second fiddle too. In one instance, the couple had an anniversary lunch that had to be cancelled at the last minute as her mother’s senior care centre had a patient who tested positive for COVID-19. “Naturally, I was disappointed,” said Nadia. “But I think this is my life now.” With all the curveballs now, her motto is, take things one day at a time. But this also means she is unable to make plans for her future, such as her wedding. After Wayne proposed at the end of 2019, she entertained hopes of a wedding reception at The Fullerton Hotel, where Andy works. Saved on her phone are photos of what she imagines her dress will look like. But with a lot on her plate, she has been walking around with an engagement ring without any idea when she can tie the knot. “The thing about caring for an elderly loved one is you wonder how long you have them,” she said. “I’m doing everything I can to keep my mum happy and comfortable for as long as I have her. But I don’t know how long we have her.” She and Andy have also decided to pool their Central Provident Fund savings to apply for a flat. She wants her family to have a home, one where her mother has access to all her children easily. This means building a nest egg and planning for a marital home must also be postponed indefinitely. “That breaks my heart,” she said. “(But) it’s a sacrifice I’m willing to make because that (family home) takes precedence.” She hopes to get a flat in the north-east part of Singapore, which would be closer to her other brother, who is married with children. But so far, they have been unsuccessful. Even before her mother’s stroke, however, Nadia was no stranger to the risks of caregiver burnout. After her father died in 2004, she became a secondary carer for Lynda, accompanying her sister to appointments at the doctor’s and therapy sessions. Lynda was first admitted to the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) in 1995 and was formally diagnosed with borderline personality disorder a decade later. She was recently re-diagnosed with intellectual disability. She struggles to manage her emotions, said Nadia, and when she does not get what she wants, she may resort to violence. “You try your hardest to be as kind and compassionate as possible but still have to face abuse from the person you’re providing care for,” remarked Nadia. Yet, she felt as if she was not doing enough. She felt guilty about having opportunities in her career and personal life, compared with her sister. She felt “awful” about not providing more for her family, despite contributing half her salary towards her family’s expenses when she was working full-time. “I wanted so badly to be able to provide them with a comfortable life because (my mother and sister) had already had to suffer so much,” she said. Owing to caregiver burnout, she was first diagnosed with depression in 2016 and contemplated suicide.  Her best friend, Rubyni Karun, was not only worried but “absolutely scared”. “You’d really broken down in front of me,” she recounted to Nadia. “That made me realise how serious it was … I was panicking inside.” The incident gave Rubyni a “huge push” to help her friend. Among other things, she introduced her to reiki, a form of alternative therapy that Nadia has continued with until now. Nadia also sought professional help from the IMH, which was where she stumbled across the Caregivers Alliance Limited, a non-profit organisation that provides support for carers of those with mental health conditions. She started attending a support group there and volunteering for the organisation in her free time. “It was such a game-changer for me,” she said. Last year, she and Wayne decided to attend couples therapy as well, which she said has helped them “tremendously”. Their relationship had been under a lot of strain, she acknowledged, as she tended to take her stress out on him. Sometimes she worries about not being “entirely present” for him. “Much as I don’t want to lose him, I also don’t want to hold him back from any other version of happiness he might be able to have,” she said. But he has remained supportive throughout. “We’re not going to kill ourselves trying to plan the wedding if we don’t have the right mental headspace for it,” he said. “The engagement ring is a promise that we’ll get married, and we’ll just see when we can.” He thinks she has done very well, considering. “I’m just happy to see her … after everything, still smiling,” he added. WATCH: I gave up my PR career to care for Mum — despite battling depression and burnout (11.58) Since the final episode of the series in December, Nadia’s mother’s dementia has worsened, and she has been in and out of hospital. This is why Nadia and her brothers decided to get Lynda discharged from the IMH to live with their mother instead, despite the family not having secured a flat of their own. “What’s more important to us is that my sister spends time with my mum while she can,” Nadia said to CNA Insider recently. It turned out to be a blessing: Lynda can help with some of the caregiving duties, like changing her mother’s diapers, giving her mother a bath and even giving her medication. With the extra help, Nadia can have some evenings off to spend with Wayne or have a social catch-up. Being able to help their mother has also given Lynda a sense of purpose, Nadia said. Another silver lining: The relationships between the Daeng siblings have improved significantly over the past few years. Prior to her mother’s stroke, they barely spent time together, according to Nadia. “We’d grown apart and led our own lives. But suddenly, I realised my brothers have a sense of humour that’s quite cute … and stuff like that,” said Nadia, who was encouraged and grateful that her family “came together” for their mother. Nadia has also come to be in a “much better place” following the documentary. “Surprisingly, being a part of the documentary in itself and talking about it (her caregiving journey) to such an extent was healing,” she said. She rates her current mental state an eight out of 10, compared with four when filming started. And she is heartened by the responses from viewers as friends, family and even strangers sent her messages of encouragement. Some of them shared their own caregiving experiences. She has also received several anonymous donations, which have been channelled to her mother’s and sister’s expenses as well as home essentials like diapers and groceries. “Realising that you’re not alone makes a huge difference,” she said. “I’m not saying it takes your problems away immediately. But knowing that there are people who stand in solidarity with you is very, very powerful.” Her message to other carers is that they “don’t have to do it by themselves”, because “there’s a community willing to … provide the support you need”. She has not thought much about how her life will change when her mother is gone, but this much she knows: She hopes to continue caring for her sister and, ultimately, to work again but this time in mental health or the broader healthcare sector. “I don’t think enough organisations realise that if you have a team that’s happy and healthy, you get more productivity,” she said. “I want to be able to use my skill set for raising awareness and normalising that type of mindset or environment going forward.” Watch the series Altered Lives here.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/3-seconds-day-resistance-exercise-2534256,Want to strengthen your muscles? New study shows all you need is 3 seconds a day,"Could three seconds a day of resistance exercise really increase muscular strength? That question was at the heart of a small-scale new study of almost comically brief weight training. In the study, men and women who contracted their arm muscles as hard as possible for a total of three seconds a day increased their biceps strength by as much as 12 per cent after a month. The findings add to mounting evidence that even tiny amounts of exercise – provided they are intense enough – can aid health. I have written about the unique ways in which our muscles, hearts, lungs and other body parts respond to four seconds of strenuous biking, for instance, or 10 seconds of all-out sprinting, and how such super-short workouts can trigger the biological responses that lead to better fitness. But almost all of this research focused on aerobic exercise and usually involved interval training, a workout in which spurts of hard, fast exertion are repeated and interspersed with rest. Far less research has delved into super-brief weight training or whether a single, eyeblink-length session of intense resistance exercise might build strength or just waste valuable seconds of our lives. So, for the new study, which was published in February in the Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports, scientists led by Masatoshi Nakamura at the Niigata University of Health and Welfare in Niigata, Japan, asked 39 sedentary but otherwise healthy college students to do three seconds of weight training every day. They also recruited an additional 10 students who would not work out to serve as a control group. The exercising volunteers gathered during the workweek at the lab for strength testing and weightlifting, of a kind. They sat at a machine called an isokinetic dynamometer, which has a long lever arm that can be pushed and pulled, up or down, with varying levels of resistance, allowing researchers to precisely control people’s movements and effort. The volunteers manipulated the weighted lever with all their strength, straining and contracting their biceps to the fullest possible extent. Some of the participants slowly lifted the lever’s weight, like curling a dumbbell, producing what is called a concentric contraction, meaning the biceps shortened as they worked. Other volunteers slowly lowered the lever, creating a so-called eccentric contraction. You get an eccentric contraction when you lengthen a muscle, like lowering a dumbbell during a curl, and it tends to be more draining. A third group of volunteers held the lever’s weight steady in midair, fighting gravity, in a type of contraction where the muscle doesn’t change length at all. And each of the participants did their biceps exercise for a total of three seconds. That was it; that was their entire daily workout. They repeated this exceedingly brief exercise routine once a day, five times a week, for a month, for a grand total of 60 seconds of weight training. They did not otherwise exercise. At the end of the month, the researchers retested everyone’s arm strength. Those three-second sessions had changed people’s biceps. The groups either lifting or holding the weights were between 6 and 7 per cent stronger. But those doing eccentric contractions, lowering the lever downward as you might ease a dumbbell away from your shoulder, showed substantially greater gains. Their biceps muscles were nearly 12 per cent stronger overall. These improvements may sound slight, but they would be biologically meaningful, especially for people new to weight training, said Ken Nosaka, a professor of exercise and sports science at Edith Cowan University in Joondalup, Australia, who collaborated on the study. “Many people do not do any resistance training,” and starting with very short workouts may be an effective way for them to begin a strength training regimen, Dr Nosaka said. “Every muscle contraction counts” and contributes to building strength, assuming you lift a weight near the maximum you can handle and it lasts at least three seconds, he said. The three-second workout could also be useful as a stopgap to help maintain or even add to our arm strength for those of us who are buried under work or family commitments and are unable to get to the gym. The exercise routine is easy enough to recreate at home, Dr Nosaka said, no dynamometer needed. Just find a dumbbell that feels heavy – you might start with a 10-pound version, for instance, if you are new to weight training. “Lift it with both hands,” Dr Nosaka said, to start a biceps curl, then “lower it with one hand” through a count of three seconds to complete a short, sharp and draining eccentric contraction. This approach, though, has some obvious limitations. While the volunteers in the study got stronger, they did not add muscle mass. “Strength is only one outcome” of resistance exercise, said Jonathan Little, a professor of health and exercise science at the University of British Columbia in Kelowna, who has studied brief workouts but was not involved with this experiment. More traditional weight training typically also bulks up muscles, which has additional benefits for metabolism and other aspects of health and wellness over the long term. The study also looked only at people’s biceps. Whether other muscles, especially in the legs, would strengthen after a few intense seconds of “lifting” is uncertain. More broadly, framing exercise as something that should be dispensed with as quickly as possible could make workouts seem like just another chore and maybe easier to skip. Dr Nosaka said he and his colleagues plan to study whether repeating three-second contractions multiple times throughout the day increases muscle mass, as well as strength. They are also exploring how to translate this approach to the legs and other muscles. In the meantime, he said, we should probably think of three seconds of daily strength training as the least we can do. “It is definitely better,” he said, “to do one contraction a day than nothing.” By Gretchen Reynolds © The New York Times Company The article originally appeared in The New York Times.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/eating-tips-ageing-well-2528081,Ageing well begins with eating better – here are 6 simple ways to get you started,"Small changes in your eating habits can lower your risk for many diseases associated with ageing. The good news is it’s never too late to get started. Here are five tips to keep in mind. AVOID PROCESSED MEAT A number of studies have found associations between eating a lot of processed meats and poor health. A Harvard review found that eating one serving a day of processed meats, like bacon, sausage and deli meats, was associated with a 42 per cent higher risk of heart disease and 19 per cent increased risk of diabetes. EAT BLUE (AND OTHER COLORS) One study found that eating the equivalent of a cup of blueberries a day lowered blood pressure. Most of us can’t eat a daily cup of blueberries, but the lesson is to add darkly coloured fruits and vegetables – blueberries, cherries, spinach and kale – to your diet. They are loaded with nutrients, fiber and carotenoids. PASS ON PACKAGED FOODS How do you know if a food is processed? One good indicator is if it comes in a package that has to be ripped open. Think chips, granola bars, junk food, fast food, frozen pizza, etc. There are, of course, some exceptions to the rule. Some whole, unprocessed foods that are good for you come in packages by necessity. Think nuts, eggs, olive oil and milk to name a few. REMEMBER THE ONE-INGREDIENT RULE If a packaged food contains only one ingredient (ground turkey, for instance) it’s probably a reasonable choice. SKIP THE SUPPLEMENTS Study after study has seemed to debunk the benefit of taking supplements. The best advice: Save the money you would spend on them and invest in a new pair of walking shoes, a gym membership or a delicious and healthy meal with your family. All of those are likely to do more for your health than a supplement. By Tara Parker-Pope © The New York Times Company The article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/dreams-ex-lovers-partners-meaning-2527816,Why do we sometimes dream of ex-lovers? Present relationships may be a trigger,"If you’ve slept, perchance you have dreamed about an ex and woken up wondering, “What was that all about?” The good news for chronic analysers: An intense dream about a person you cared about months or even decades ago doesn’t mean you’re secretly pining for them. Deirdre Barrett, a dream researcher at Harvard University and author of Pandemic Dreams and The Committee of Sleep, who has a doctorate in clinical psychology, said a number of factors can spark a dream about an ex-partner. “Triggers can include an anniversary of a death or a breakup or a divorce decree,” she said. “But dreams can also be a reaction to how we feel about our present relationships.” Instead of looking at dreams about exes as a sign of still being hung up on them or as a signal to look them up on social media, Barrett said to think of them as a chance to examine your current emotions and how you’re coping with them. “The whole idea that we process deaths or breakups in an ‘all or nothing’ way is deceptive,” Barrett said. “Life is a continuous ‘getting over it.’ These things never fully disappear.” Here, Barrett and another expert parse the takeaways from three such dreams. To protect the privacy of both parties, we are using first names only for the dreamers and not naming their exes. AN EX-SPOUSE REAPPEARS Andrew, 47, had been divorced for three years when he had a dream about his ex-wife that stuck with him. At the time, Andrew, who is now in another relationship, had been considering reaching out to his ex, to whom he had been married for 10 years, to catch up. In the dream, he was meeting his sister at his parents’ house for dinner, and they arrived to find his ex-wife in the backyard, sitting calmly at a picnic table. He and his family then went inside the house and looked through a window at his ex-wife. Andrew said he woke up feeling like he had “dodged a bullet,” and later decided that contacting his ex would be a bad idea. That Andrew’s dream provided enough insight to change his course of action, Barrett said, supports what is commonly known as continuity hypothesis: A theory that states that anxieties in our dreams may mirror the ones in our waking life. “He said he’d been thinking it might be reasonable and even pleasant to start getting together with his ex occasionally,” she said. “But something in his dream made him abandon this plan.” Ian Wallace, a psychologist in Inverness, Scotland, and author of Decode Your Dreams: Unlock Your Unconscious and Transform Your Waking Life, was struck by the placid imagery: The calm face of Andrew’s ex and the picnic table. “The picnic table could symbolise that he now has the opportunity to make things easier and more pleasant for himself,” he said. TAP DANCING FOR ATTENTION Five years after Zach, 31, broke up with his on-and-off girlfriend of three years in 2014 because of issues related to dating long-distance, he had a dream about them meeting at what Zach described as a “magic academy,” like the one in the TV series The Magicians. The two were on a great lawn, and Zach heard an old phonograph playing what he said might have been a love song in the distance. He began to tap dance, hoping his ex-girlfriend would see him, but she had fallen asleep on a blanket. Later, he was in a room inside the academy. “All of the rooms are locked by a magical spell that can only be broken by the occupant of the room,” Zach said. When he heard a knock on the door, he opened it to find his ex-girlfriend there. Zach, who is in another relationship, said he rarely dreams about his ex-girlfriend and that he woke up wishing that he was at the magical academy. According to Barrett, “each room being locked with a spell only its occupant can break” could be associated with the issues that Zach and his ex faced by dating long-distance. That Zach woke up wishing he was at the academy could suggest an openness to reconnecting. “I wouldn’t be amazed to see this dreamer give it another chance”, she said. The dream’s mystical quality, Wallace said, suggests that Zach is seeking a perfect relationship. “In waking life, we can sometimes delude ourselves with magical thinking as we try to idealise a romantic relationship rather than engaging with practicalities,” he said. REKINDLING A RELATIONSHIP Right around the start of the pandemic, Justy, 34, said she started having one or two dreams a month about her ex-husband, whom she divorced in 2014 after two years of marriage. In one dream, Justy, who is currently single, arrived at a hotel in the area where her ex grew up. There, she discovered that he was getting married to someone else. Soon she was surrounded by his family and friends, who told her that they wished it was her and him getting married again. Then, Justy and her ex were somewhere else, alone. He was holding her and saying that he wanted to be with her. Justy said the dream stayed with her because of how emotional it felt, despite the fact that she and her ex-husband no longer share romantic feelings. “I think a big part of why these dreams started during the pandemic is there’s this nostalgia for when I was married,” she said. “I really liked where my life was at and where my career was going.” The past two years have changed so much about our lives that past relationships may have an added appeal because new ones are harder to imagine, said Barrett. The dream may be more about a nostalgia for a time that her ex represents, rather than the person himself. “Past relationships may have an added appeal as brand-new ones are harder to initiate right now because of the pandemic”, she said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/cold-water-plunges-reduce-anxiety-depression-2524526,Can cold water plunges really reduce anxiety and depression?,"In a TikTok video from January, self-help author Mel Robbins held a hammer in 12-degree weather in her backyard in Vermont. “We’re about to do the cold plunge,” she said to the camera, after breaking through a layer of ice on the surface of a barrel to expose the water below. She then climbed into the barrel and, taking a deep breath, sank into the water chest deep. Robbins took up the Wim Hof method, which pairs cold exposure with breathing and meditation, to help manage anxiety and stress. The frigid water brings on what feels like a panic attack at first, she said in a recent interview. But eventually, her body relaxes and her mind quiets. “The water is still cold but your anxiety response is gone,” she said. Cold water immersion has garnered a lot of attention lately, especially for its supposed mental health benefits. Wim Hof, an extreme athlete and fitness guru who developed the technique, was featured in a recent documentary by the musician and influencer Jacob Sartorius. His regimen was also the subject of an episode of Netflix’s The Goop Lab, released last year. The Wim Hof method typically involves soaking in an ice bath or a cold shower, but others have turned to a more active version to manage their mental health. Mental Health Swims, a non-profit that organises cold-water swimming throughout Britain, has grown from one meet-up group to more than 80 since 2019. People have used cold water to promote health for centuries. Hippocrates believed that water therapy could alleviate fatigue, and doctors in the 18th century recommended cold baths to treat conditions like fever and rickets. Nowadays, those who swear by the benefits of cold water say it leaves them feeling invigorated, clear-headed and better able to handle stress. Some say that it has helped them cope with grief, anxiety, depression and other mental health challenges. Preliminary evidence suggests they may be onto something, but the science behind how or why cold water affects mental health is still unclear. CAN COLD WATER REALLY IMPROVE YOUR MENTAL HEALTH? No studies have shown that the Wim Hof method or cold water immersion alone boosts mental health, but some research suggests that cold-water swimming can improve mood and well-being. Several teams of researchers, especially in Europe, have explored the psychological effects of cold-water swimming and seen encouraging results. A 2020 study conducted in Britain found that 61 people who took a 10-week course to learn to swim in cold seawater experienced greater improvements in mood and well-being than 22 of their friends and family members who watched them from shore. Some scientists also suspect that a dip in frigid water might help treat mental illnesses, such as anxiety and depression. A 2018 case study, also in Britain, describes a 24-year-old woman with depression and anxiety who undertook cold-water swimming and, after four months, no longer required medication. Since then, researchers have followed up with a larger trial but the results have yet to be published. These early findings are promising, but getting strong evidence is challenging, said Jeremy Howick, a senior researcher at the Centre for Trials Research at Cardiff University who studies evidence-based medicine. Researchers can’t hide the fact that someone is getting cold water treatment, he said, and their positive expectations may lead them to experience a placebo effect. Hof has suggested as much in his book The Wim Hof Method, writing that “to get the most out of the method, you have to mentally invest in it.” Even if it’s not the placebo effect, it’s still unclear which component of cold-water swimming may contribute to reported improvements in mood and well-being, said Dr Mike Tipton, professor of human and applied physiology at the University of Portsmouth in the United Kingdom, who studies the body’s reaction to extreme environments. Not only are swimmers immersing themselves in frigid water, but they are also often exercising, socializing, spending time outdoors and taking on a challenge – all of which may boost mental health. “No one has done the studies that tease out the active ingredient,” he said. WHY DO PEOPLE THINK COLD WATER IS KEY? There are several reasons to think that cold water might provide mental health benefits. Immersing yourself in icy water triggers the release of stress hormones, such as noradrenaline and cortisol. This is likely why people say that a dip in cold water wakes them up, Dr Tipton said. Some studies have also reported increases in brain chemicals that regulate mood, such as dopamine, following a cold soak, which may explain the post-swim “high” people feel. In addition, putting your face in cold water can activate the parasympathetic branch of the nervous system, which prompts the body to relax after a stressful event. This may help people feel calm and tamp down inflammation. Several conditions, including depression are tied to chronic inflammation, said Mark Harper, an anesthesiology consultant at Royal Sussex County Hospital, who is studying cold water swimming as a treatment for depression. Some researchers also hypothesise that adapting to the shock of cold water may improve a person’s ability to cope with other stresses. A small 2010 study showed that people who were habituated to cold water had a reduced stress response when they were subjected to another strain – in this case, working out in a low oxygen environment. But enduring hypoxic exercise is not the same as enduring psychological stresses, however, and more work is needed. Although cold water immersion clearly has some physiological effects, “there have not been enough high-quality studies” to recommend it as a mental health treatment, said Sophie Lazarus, a clinical psychologist at Ohio State University. Other treatments for anxiety and depression, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, have more scientific backing, she said. They may also be safer. CAN COLD WATER IMMERSION BE HARMFUL? Yes. Researchers know more about the dangers of cold water than its potential therapeutic effects. One of the most obvious ones is hypothermia, which usually sets in after about 30 minutes in adults. But cold water presents significant risks long before that. The initial shock of being plunged into icy water can cause arrhythmias and heart attacks. The risk of arrhythmias is increased when people put their faces underwater while experiencing this initial “cold shock.” The combination activates opposing branches of the nervous system, which send conflicting signals to the heart. Cold shock also triggers the gasp reflex, followed by hyperventilation. If your airway is underwater, this can lead to drowning. Adding to the risk of drowning is the fact that swimming in frigid water quickly leads to exhaustion. Most experts recommend checking in with your doctor before taking a cold plunge. People planning to swim outdoors should also consider joining a group, make sure they know about local water hazards, avoid diving in head first and ensure they have a way to get out of the water before they get in. SHOULD YOU TRY COLD WATER IMMERSION? Done safely, cold water immersion may be worth a shot. “It’s not going to cure you,” Dr Harper said, but it may help people manage their mental health. It also doesn’t require any specialised equipment. Although you can spend thousands on a plunge pool, your bathtub or a nearby body of water can do the trick. Researchers still don’t know the best way to reap the mental health benefits of cold water or the minimum “dose” required. If it turns out that the initial cold shock is important, though, the water doesn’t have to be glacial. The cold shock response peaks between 50 and 59 degrees Fahrenheit (10 and 15 Celsius), and a few minutes in the water is probably enough to experience its effects. It’s important to remember that more is not necessarily better when it comes to cold water immersion, Dr Tipton said. “A little bit is good for you, too much is not,” he said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/endometriosis-menstrual-cramps-gp-singapore-specialist-2534731,Endometriosis and painful periods: New guidelines now help GPs diagnose the condition earlier,"There’s a need to help general practitioners diagnose endometriosis better as it can be challenging for both patients and doctors to recognise the symptoms, said doctors at a media session on Wednesday (Mar 2) to launch two initiatives targeted at the gynaecological condition. “Diagnosing endometriosis can be difficult because the symptoms can vary; some have no symptoms while others experience bad pain,” said Dr Andy Tan Wei Keat, a consultant at the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Centre, Singapore General Hospital (SGH).  “It can also mimic other conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and pelvic inflammatory disease,” Dr Tan added. The Endometriosis Protocol and Checklist aims to help and support GPs in the diagnosis and early treatment of endometriosis, provide guidance in counselling patients, and when to refer them to specialists.  “There are about 8,000 primary care physicians in Singapore, according to the MOH website. We hope to reach out to as many as possible to increase endometriosis awareness and this protocol also serves as a quick reference guide to enable the GPs to diagnose endometriosis confidently and start treatment if necessary,” said Dr Tan. Women themselves are also encouraged to be proactive about identifying endometriosis symptoms, which include:  As part of an initiative to raise awareness about the condition, global pharmaceutical company Bayer and gynaecologists from KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH), National University Hospital (NUH) and SGH, co-developed the Endometriosis Symptoms Questionnaire, an online self-assessment quiz to help women identify and assess endometriosis-associated symptoms.  “If you have a high score (from the questionnaire), you may be directed to see a doctor for advice – and not believe that menstrual pain is normal. If the pain is so severe that it’s affecting your job and quality of life, it can’t be normal anymore,” said Dr Anthony Siow, a senior endometriosis specialist in private practice. Of the more than 2,500 Singapore women who had taken the questionnaire since it was launched in March 2021, 55 per cent had symptoms that suggested possible endometriosis, validating a visit to see a gynaecologist, said Dr Celene Hui, a consultant at the minimally invasive surgery unit of the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Division at KKH. Dr Siow said that there’s also a distinct difference between adolescent and adult endometriosis. “Patients in their adolescent period tend to report more non-menstrual and non-cyclical pain such as headaches, pain in the pelvis, and other non-menstrual symptoms like nausea and stomach upset,” he said. If you suspect you may have endometriosis, you can take the Endometriosis Symptoms Questionnaire at the Singapore Endometriosis Support Group website here. It is also available on the KKH, NUH, SGH websites. PROVIDING GYNAECOLOGISTS IN ASIA WITH A NEW CONSENSUS GUIDE  A new consensus guide that provides guidance on the clinical diagnosis and early management of endometriosis in Asia will also be distributed to the 350 obstetricians and gynaecologists in Singapore by the end of March, said Dr Ma Li, consultant at the Division of Benign Gynaecology, at NUH’s Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, at the media session. Said to be the first in the region, the guide was developed by 19 senior doctors from Asia, including Dr Ma, Dr Siow and Dr Fong Yoke Kai, a senior endometriosis specialist in private practice.  “There’s a high prevalence of endometriosis in Asia, and there’s a significant delay of diagnosis – an average of seven to 10 years’ time,” Dr Ma added. The consensus will help women avoid further damage to fertility and surrounding organ functions.  “We cannot emphasise further on the importance of clinical examination in diagnosing endometriosis,” she said, adding that the availability of a consensus guide means the gynaecological condition no longer needs to be diagnosed through a surgical procedure, shortening the delay in diagnosis.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/home-isolation-recovery-covid-19-2525331,COVID-19 home recovery: A checklist of everything you'll need while self-isolating,"You’ve been coughing and sniffling. So you break out the ART kit to test yourself and just as you’d suspected, you’re COVID-19-positive.  After determining that you’re eligible for home isolation and deciding which room you’ll be holing up in, the next question is: What items should you have with you for the next 72 hours?  Here is a checklist of the things to take with you for home isolation for the next seven days – in case you still test positive after 72 hours. If you’re isolating with your child, remember to gather separate sets of supplies. It’s important that you don’t share.  As for how to prep the room, Dr Edwin Chng, the medical director of Parkway Shenton, advised that “non-essential items and those that cannot be cleaned with soap, detergent or alcohol should be removed from the bedroom”.  “In general, COVID-19 tends to stay longer on non-porous surfaces (days to weeks) compared to porous surfaces (minutes to hours). However, the relative risk of fomite transmission is considered low compared to direct contact, droplet transmission or airborne transmission,” he said. In the meantime, gather the following items before you head into your Fortress of Solitude: MEDICINES AND SUPPLIES: Cold/cough/fever medicines, throat spray/mouth gargle, ART kits, thermometer, oximeter, tissues and alcohol wipes If you haven't been having much luck getting throat sprays because they are largely sold out, you can use a mouth gargle that contains povidone-iodine, said Associate Professor Raymond Seet, a senior consultant with National University Hospital's Division of Neurology.  Make sure you gargle (ensure the solution reaches the back of the throat) and not just rinse your mouth, he added. ""Some studies suggest that the antiviral actions can occur within minutes of the SARS-CoV-2 virus' exposure to povidone-iodine,"" said Assoc Prof Seet.  Such mouth gargles are available over the counter in many pharmacies. However, he cautioned that those with thyroid disorders, allergies to iodine or who are pregnant should consult their doctors first before using povidone-iodine. When it comes to the ART kits, make sure you have enough supply to last you a week and a bit more. For instance, bring in seven ART kits and add a few extra ones just in case.   As for your daily medication from the GP, make sure there is enough stock as well as over-the-counter medicines for fever and cough, said Associate Professor Sophia Archuleta, a senior consultant and the head of NUH’s Division of Infectious Diseases.  ""A thermometer and pulse oximeter are also useful for the monitoring of symptoms and especially warning signs such as hypoxia or low oxygen saturation,"" she said. PERSONAL HYGIENE: Toiletries (eg, shampoo, body wash, facial wash), toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, shaver and towels  Using a room with an attached bathroom is ideal as it minimises your contact with healthy family members. For that purpose, don’t even share toiletries, said Dr Chng, to avoid cross-contamination. If you want to minimise the contact with your family members further, bring in enough towels to last you for seven days. “Ideally, towels should be changed daily but for practical purposes, it can be changed every two to three days,” said Dr Chng. But if you have to share the bathroom, everyone should wear a mask when using it, advised Assoc Prof Archuleta. “The shared area should be well ventilated, such as keeping the bathroom windows open,” she said. More reasons to isolate in a room with an ensuite bathroom: Less cleaning and disinfecting to do. It’s not enough to just clean the toilet bowl and flush with the lid down after each use. You should also clean and disinfect all accessible surfaces such as the sink, tap, soap dispenser, toilet roll dispenser, door handle and flush button, said Dr Chng. “Disinfect the sink’s U-trap and toilet floor trap with a cleaning solution. Clean the bathroom floor with the cleaning solution from the exit inwards,” he said.  LAUNDRY: Clothes, underwear and a separate laundry basket Bring in enough clothes and underwear for daily changes. Place your worn laundry in a basket, separate from the rest of the family’s clothes, outside the room at the door, advised Dr Chng. “Avoid tossing or throwing the fabrics”, which can stir up and disperse the virus.  You can use regular laundry detergent for the sick family member’s clothes, said Assoc Prof Archuleta. Just use the warmest setting on the washing machine.  “Wash your hands after handling the laundry. If the laundry was visibly soiled, wearing disposable gloves would be a good idea,” she said. UTENSILS: Spoon, fork, knife, chopsticks, cup, sponge and dishwashing detergent  If you can, wash your own utensils to minimise your loved ones from touching your saliva.  But if you don’t have an attached bathroom, place your used utensils outside your room, so that an assigned family member can wash them. Ensure that he or she wears gloves when washing your used utensils with soap and hot water, said Dr Chng.  “It is also ideal to use a separate sponge and dishwashing detergent from the rest of the family to avoid contamination,” he said.  When done washing your used utensils and dishes, remind your family members to wash their hands after taking off their gloves, said Dr Chng. TRASH: Trash bags and bin Use a bin with a lid, so that your used tissue, ART kits and other trash are covered and not exposed to the air. Double-bag the bin to prevent leakage and seal or tie the bags when you’re ready to empty the bin, said Dr Chng. Then, leave the sealed bag outside your door. The family member who collects it for disposal should wear gloves before touching it.  ENTERTAINMENT: Toys for kids (plastic, wood and fabric) and gadgets (laptop, handphone and tablet) for grownups There’s no need to disinfect them before taking them into the room, unless they’re dirty, said Dr Chng.  It isn't necessary to clean and disinfect the room daily during your isolation period. But cleaning and disinfecting should be carried out at the end of the self-isolation, said Dr Edwin Chng, the medical director of Parkway Shenton.  First, protect yourself by donning gloves and mask before starting. “Avoid touching your face and eyes during the process of cleaning. And keep the room well ventilated during cleaning,” he said.  Anything that can be wiped should be wiped with a cloth soaked with a cleaning and disinfecting solution, said Dr Chng. Before wiping another object, rinse and soak the cloth in the prepared solution first. Or use another cloth, he said.  “Items that cannot be washed or disinfected should be set aside and not be used for at least three days after recovery.” Wash the bed linens separately from the family's clothes with regular laundry detergent and use the warmest setting.  Mop the room’s floor with a cleaning and disinfecting solution, starting from one end of the room to another. “Avoid moving from an area that has not been cleaned to an area that has been cleaned, to avoid dirtying the cleaned area,” said Dr Chng.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/tcm-treatments-pregnancy-2508356,TCM treatments and pregnancy: Here's what you need to know,"With the stresses of modern living and a pandemic to boot, getting pregnant isn't easy for some.  Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) doctors believe getting a womb primed for conception might help. And this is after you consult your gynaecologist to make sure there aren't more serious medical issues such as fibroids or fertility problems. “Chinese medicine pays close attention to the regulation of internal body temperature,” said Julie Low, a senior physician with TCM healthcare provider Oriental Remedies Group. “A body that is too ‘cold’ will struggle to provide adequate energy for proper organ functioning, which will affect the body constitution and overall well-being. “Hence, in TCM, a healthy womb is one that is considered ‘warm’ enough, with good blood flow to supply the foetus with nutrient-rich blood and maintain a highly nurturing home for it,” she added.  Low explained that a lack of warm energy, then, would cause the womb to be less conducive for conception, a condition which TCM practitioners term Cold Womb Syndrome or gong han.  She said: “The coldness – a result of lifestyle habits – impedes blood circulation to the womb. From a biomedical standpoint, it means the uterine lining is not receptive to progesterone, a hormone that helps the uterus lining develop during pregnancy.” Telltale signs of Cold Womb Syndrome include dark red menstruation, blood clots, painful menstrual cramps, cold limbs, lower back pain, low sex drive and frequent urination at night. Dr Goh Chye Tee, Director of NTU Chinese Medicine Clinic, describes a healthy womb simply as one that can perform its main physiological functions. “It needs to store and discharge menstrual blood regularly, and be able to cultivate a foetus from conception till birth. To do so, there needs to be a smooth flow of qi (energy) along two main meridians – Chong and Ren, and the kidney, stomach and spleen have to function well to provide the necessary prenatal and postnatal essence for procreation,” explained Dr Goh.   Irregular menstruation, bad menstrual cramps and difficulty in conceiving are all symptoms of a less than healthy womb, he said, and these may lead to a higher risk of miscarriage due to the womb’s inability to nurture the foetus.  HOW TCM MAY HELP These are some ways to “strengthen” and condition your womb, using TCM techniques.     1. NOURISH WITH HERBAL FOOD After menstruation, you may want to take tonifying herbs such as angelica root (dang gui) and Chinese yam to replenish qi and blood, which are essential to a healthy womb, said Dr Goh. He also recommended nurturing the womb with Eight Treasure Soup, which consists of four herbs that boost qi and four for blood.  2. AVOID COLD AND RAW FOOD, ESPECIALLY A FEW DAYS BEFORE MENSTRUATION “This is to reduce unnecessary stress to the visceral system, in particular the stomach and spleen, which in TCM perform the functions of producing and supplying nutrients to the uterus and foetus,” said Dr Goh.  He added that fried and spicy food should also be avoided, if not given a total miss.   3. REDUCE TOXIN EXPOSURE Cook more meals at home instead of buying takeouts. “This will reduce exposure to BPA in plastic containers, which has an oestrogen-like impact on the body and may affect fertility,"" said Low. She added that you may also want to avoid eating the types of fish which are known to have high mercury levels. These include swordfish and certain species of tuna. 4.  GOOD SLEEPING HABITS Try to hit the sack by 11pm and clock in at least six to eight hours of good quality sleep. “This is to enable the body to carry out maintenance and recuperative work including liver detoxification, cleansing of body tissue and enhancing brain functions, all of which are actively performed between 11pm and 3am,” said Dr Goh.  5. TRY ACUPUNCTURE It can help improve overall health, and may even promote qi and blood flow to the womb to boost fertility, said TCM experts. 6. MASSAGE ACUPRESSURE POINTS Low recommends pressing down on the following acupressure points for one minute each time. But pregnant women or women who have just completed embryo transfer in IVF treatment should avoid acupressure massage, she cautioned: 7. STAY WARM Keep the body warm and avoid cold environments as much as possible. “Try not to spend long hours in air-conditioned places and keep the soles of your feet warm by wearing socks,” Low advised.  8. GET REGULAR EXERCISE This will help to improve muscular and skeletal functions, relieve stress and promote the flow of oxygen and blood within the body. GET YOUR MAN INVOLVED, TOO   “The Oriental Remedies Group’s white paper on fertility notes that nearly half of all fertility issues are attributed to men. Like women, some simple changes to men’s lifestyles and diets can improve the chances of conception,” said Low. Besides boosting their libido by adding zinc-rich foods like oysters and red meat to their diet, minimise alcohol and smoking as these can affect sperm quality.  Do note that these TCM practices are no guarantee that you will get pregnant. You should still consult your gynaecologist for medical advice if you're trying to conceive.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/hsa-issues-advisory-against-herbal-slimming-capsules-after-consumers-report-adverse-effects-2528086,"HSA issues advisory against herbal, slimming capsules after consumers report adverse effects","SINGAPORE: The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) alerted members of the public against buying or consuming two types of herbal and slimming capsules, following consumer reports of adverse effects. The products – Traditional Herbs Preparation XPE and FS++ Slimming Supplements by JPJ Slim – were found to have contained potent medical ingredients and a banned substance. “These adulterants can cause serious adverse effects in individuals,” HSA said in a news release on Tuesday (Mar 1). In the first case, a woman in her 60s took Traditional Herbs Preparation XPE for more than nine months to relieve joint pain. She received the pills from a friend, who obtained it in Malaysia, HSA said. “The product label listed a variety of natural herbs as its ingredients and was marketed for general health,” the authority added. “Although the consumer experienced a quick relief of her joint pain, it worsened when she stopped taking it or reduced the dose. “This raised her doctor’s suspicion that the product may contain undeclared potent ingredients such as steroids or painkillers.” HSA tested the product and found six medicinal ingredients: Dexamethasone (a steroid), chlorpheniramine (an antihistamine), ibuprofen (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug), lovastatin (a cholesterol-lowering medicine), chloramphenicol and tetracycline (both antibiotics). Long-term unsupervised use of steroids such as dexamethasone can cause increased blood glucose levels, which may lead to diabetes, as well as Cushing’s syndrome, a disorder characterised by a round face appearance and upper body central obesity with thin limbs. The second case involved a customer who reported experiencing insomnia, headache and confusion after taking FS++ Slimming Supplements By JPJ Slim. “The product was purchased via a local social media platform that carried consumer testimonials on its quick slimming results,” HSA said. It was packaged in a bottle with minimal information, labelled “60 capsules” and “Made in Thailand”, as well as a website link. Upon testing, HSA found that it contained sibutramine, a weight loss medicine that has been banned in Singapore since 2010 due to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. “The continued intake of this product could have led to serious health consequences such as heart problems and central nervous system disorders,” HSA said, adding that such disorders include psychosis and hallucinations. “The product was also found to be sold by the same seller on other social media platforms,” it said. “HSA has worked with the platform administrators to promptly remove the affected listings. Investigation against the seller is ongoing.” The authority advised consumers to see a doctor if they have taken Traditional Herbs Preparation XPE as it contains a “potent steroid”. “Discontinuation of steroids without proper medical supervision can cause serious withdrawal symptoms such as fatigue, confusion and low blood pressure, especially when the product has been taken for more than a few weeks,” it said. Those who are taking FS++ Slimming Supplements By JPJ Slim should stop immediately and consult a doctor if they feel unwell or are concerned about their health. Sellers who carry such products must stop selling them immediately. HSA has urged consumers to be wary of “products that deliver quick effects or carry exaggerated claims”, which can “contain potent ingredients that can seriously harm your health”. Customer should also exercise caution when buying such products online or from well-meaning friends. “HSA will not hesitate to take stern enforcement actions against anyone who sells and/or supplies products found to be adulterated with potent medicinal ingredients,” it said. If convicted, sellers and suppliers may be liable to prosecution. If convicted, they could be imprisoned for up to two years, fined up to S$10,000, or both."

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/covid-19-home-self-isolation-children-below-12-2517176,COVID-19 and young children: 5 mums share what it’s like to take care of kids in self-isolation,"If you ask parents what their biggest worries are when it comes to raising kids, having a child fall sick would rank high on the list. Having a child get COVID-19 is likely to rank even higher.  Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said earlier this month that the Omicron variant is more likely to infect children than the Delta variant, and that children in Singapore are contracting COVID-19 at the highest rate.  According to the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Feb 16, infection rates for children aged 0 to 4 years and those aged 5 to 11 years are currently high, at about 243 and 258 per 100,000 respectively. Meanwhile, those aged 12 to 19 years have the highest infection rate of about 269 per 100,000. Picture this: Your child tests positive for COVID-19. Aside from seeking medical care for him or her, parents will also have to isolate the sick child. Try explaining this to a young child who’s already frightened that they have COVID-19. Then comes the task of keeping the rest of the household safe, from cleaning up after the sick child, be it in his or her room, or the bathroom. All while trying not to get infected yourself.  And if someone else in your family gets COVID-19, the cycle starts again, coupled with an extended cycle of Antigen Rapid Tests (ART) and the like. While the guidelines for what to do if you have COVID-19 are fairly simple to follow if you're an adult, it’s a different story when it comes to young children, where it becomes much more challenging. The five mothers CNA Women spoke to shared their experience of taking care of a child under 12 years who got sick with COVID-19, their learning points and what was most stressful about the entire process.  The latest guidelines from the Ministry of Health (MOH) say you should: IDENTIFYING THE SYMPTOMS AND TESTING POSITIVE  The mums CNA Women spoke to said their kids’ first symptoms included fever, headache and fatigue. In some instances, it took several days for the child’s ART to come up positive, from the time symptoms were displayed. Ruth Chew, a mother of two, said her seven-year-old daughter EJ’s symptoms started with a high fever on Feb 5 – but an immediate ART was negative. It was only on the evening of the next day that EJ tested positive for COVID-19, and by then, other symptoms like fever, sore throat and cough had started. Chew herself fell sick with COVID-19 six days later, losing her voice and sense of smell.   Similarly, Goh Yee Huay’s nine-year-old daughter Rae Lynn told her mum she had a headache just before she was due to leave for school on a Friday morning. “I checked her temperature and found she was having a mild fever too, so I decided to keep her home from school,” said Goh.  Rae Lynn’s ART continued to be negative until Sunday, three days after her symptoms, a persistent fever and slight cough, started.  Both mothers said that when their daughters found out they had COVID-19, they were so scared they cried. It’s “intimidating” and “soul-crushing” to a seven-year-old, Chew said, especially after watching the news daily, from hospitalisations to deaths.   It was hard to see her daughter “looking listless and helpless” as she struggled with her cough and sore throat, she added. Other COVID-19 symptoms can include sudden and constant fatigue. Eliza Koo, a mum of two, said her two-year-old son Elliot had “sudden tiredness with a raised body temperature but no fever.” “He slept throughout the day and only woke up to eat. I thought he was teething, or going to fall sick,” said Koo. Later that afternoon, an ART showed that he had COVID-19.  The rest of Koo’s family – her four-year-old daughter, husband and herself – tested positive one after another within the week. And as the entire family had become COVID-positive, “there was no point in isolating in a room anymore”, Koo said. HARD FOR CHILDREN TO UNDERSTAND SELF-ISOLATION After Eileen Khoo’s 10-year-old daughter Juliette tested positive through the ART, the mum of four took her to the doctor. At the clinic (find the list of clinics and swab centres that cater to kids 12 and below here), both an ART and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was done as Juliette’s age put her in the high-risk group. Khoo was then told to isolate her daughter for 72 hours, and that MOH would do a follow up the next day, if the PCR came back positive. But it’s difficult to keep children isolated alone in a room, the mothers said. Kids find social distancing very isolating, said Chew, and it’s hard for them “to be far apart from family, let alone friends”.   S Chaudhary, who, along with her two young kids, tested positive for COVID-19, describes isolation as something that “made the most emotional impact” on her. Her toddlers, three-and-a-half-year-old Joy and 13-month-old Zen, tested positive one after the other. She recounted that keeping her kids apart was one the most difficult parts of self-isolation. “When they know that one (of them) is behind a wall, but still can’t meet, they sulk.”  Like Chaudhary, Koo understands the pain that close-knit siblings feel when they’re separated from one another. “Toddlers do not know the concept of isolation and separation,” she said. “Elliott, who is two, did not know why he had to be trapped in the room. It was difficult to keep him inside even with the door closed.”  She added that her elder daughter Charlotte, who is four, would look for opportunities to be around her brother, making self-isolation all the more challenging. “They stood quite near to each other at the door. It is impossible for young kids to not transmit the COVID-19 virus at home.” Said Chaudhary, who took care of her daughter in one room while her husband looked after the younger child in another: “When Joy was in isolation with me, we both missed the younger one. The first day was (still) okay – we did colouring and played some games. But from the second day, the lack of freedom, especially, got to Joy, and it had a severe impact on her – she stopped eating completely and cried the entire day.” And it isn’t just the siblings who have it tough – not being able to comfort, touch and hug a sick child is mentally exhausting for the parents too. “In the first three days of separating from my older child, I also missed her and she also missed being with Mummy and her brother. That affected her mood as well,” said Koo.  TRYING NOT TO FALL SICK YOURSELF  Keeping the rest of the household safe is another worry. Masking up, disinfecting and sanitising common areas and surfaces becomes the norm, for at least a week or so.  “I felt most stressed about keeping the others healthy as one of the adults needed to get the healthy one to or from school,” said Chew. Khoo, who has three other children, told CNA Women that it was challenging for her to “keep up a high level of sanitisation”. She was more worried for her six-year-old daughter Rebekkah, who has renal illness, and the extent it would compromise her health if she caught COVID-19.  Here’s what the mums did when it came to protecting the household, while keeping with guidelines from MOH and the National Environment Agency:  LEARNING FROM EXPERIENCE  Based on the women’s experiences, you should be aware that an ART may not pick up one’s viral load so early. So if you’re in possible contact with someone who has tested positive (even if your own ART is negative), it's better to be preemptive and do the socially responsible thing by restricting meetups or even isolating yourself, Khoo advised.  Chew also took extra precautions to protect her daughter’s classmates, by keeping her child home a few more days until Day 10, so that she was not as infectious.  Meanwhile, Goh, whose elder daughter tested positive two days after her nine-year-old, said it’s important to not let your other kids become complacent and let their guard down. “Make them mask up when they're around their infected sibling and keep a distance,” she said. Also, expect your kids to keep testing positive for a few weeks, said Koo – both of hers tested positive for 21 days although they had no symptoms after the second day.  Guidelines from the Ministry of Education say students should continue to self-isolate and repeat the ART daily until they test negative. As a result, her kids were not able to return to school, which took a toll on her as a working parent.  At the same time, one mum said it’s also important to look at the positive side of the situation. “I used my time (isolating) and sleeping with my elder child for overnight toilet training. She was already diaper-free in the day but not at night – the seven to 10 days of sleeping together worked,” said Chaudhary.  CNA Women is a section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/breastfeeding-older-babies-social-pressure-motherhood-2435986,Commentary: Why some mothers feel pressure to stop breastfeeding older children despite benefits,"STOKE-ON-TRENT, England: Breastfeeding beyond infancy is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), which advises that children should be breastfed until two years old. For children, breastfeeding for longer is associated with reduced infections, a lower chance of misaligned teeth, a lower likelihood of obesity and higher intelligence. And for mothers breastfeeding for more than a year, it has also been linked to reduced rates of breast and ovarian cancer.  In Rwanda, Sri Lanka and India, over 75 per cent of children continue to receive breast milk at two years old. By comparison, the United Kingdom has one of the lowest global breastfeeding rates. In 2016, the Lancet journal stated that less than 1 per cent of babies in the UK still received breast milk at 12 months old. However, some continue to breastfeed well into infancy.  To better understand this experience, my colleagues and I spoke to 24 women who were breastfeeding their children for longer than a year. Participants were aged between 27 and 42, and all were living in the UK with a partner. Most were currently breastfeeding one child, and three were breastfeeding two children. The majority had either one or two children, and the age of the breastfed children ranged from 13 months to four years. We found that those breastfeeding past a year in the UK felt intense pressures regarding the accepted length of time to breastfeed that could leave them conflicted about their breastfeeding choices. The breastfeeding of older children is often sensationalised by the media, and messages about the unacceptability of breastfeeding older children are pervasive. One woman told us that “even my pro-breastfeeding family started asking when I was going to stop [when my baby was] around 15 to 16 months”. While few directly experienced it, mothers frequently alluded to the risk of negativity and judgement for breastfeeding an older child, and many described restricting breastfeeding to private locations to avoid this. One mother said: ""I feel as your child gets older, breastfeeding out and about is a little bit more kind of frowned upon. … I do feel a little bit more conscious now that she is older of what people might be thinking … I think people expect you to have stopped by the time your child is that age"". In comparison, some participants explained confidence breastfeeding in a range of locations including park benches, playgrounds and cafes. “I’m just not self-conscious about it, I’ve never had any bad experiences but I think I don’t always notice when people are maybe making side-eyes or comments under their breath, I tend to just be head down in my own little world, but in a way that’s a good thing because it’s meant I’ve kept my confidence up”, said another participant. Her disclosure of never having received any overt negativity suggests an awareness of censure surrounding public breastfeeding. Several participants chose public breastfeeding images to share with us as an attempt to challenge this negative perception and support other women wishing to breastfeed. Many told us that they were helped through challenges by support from partners and breastfeeding peers, and also mentioned the value of observing others breastfeeding older children for normalising this behaviour. ""It’s really nice to know different mums at different stages, because it shows how it can fit into your life, because at the very beginning you think you’re going to be attached to this baby for the next like another two years and you are never going to be able to leave the house or wash your hair without, you know, but when you actually speak to mums at different stages you realise that that is not the case"", said one mother. Despite this support, social pressures caused many mothers to feel conflicted about their choices, particularly when attempting to wean their child. Another mother said: ""I am trying to restrict [breastfeeding] her out of the house. … I’m telling her “no, we will do it when we get home”, and she doesn’t really like it. … She normally cries, pulls at my top, screams milk. I feel really conflicted at that point because I sort of think, if that’s what she wants, why aren’t I doing it? Am I not doing it because of other people’s perceptions?"" Normalising breastfeeding an older child could help to validate these mothers’ choices, provide role models, help them to feel supported and free them from parental guilt. Increasing public breastfeeding imagery is a potential step in the right direction. Amy Burton is a Senior Lecturer and Health Psychologist at Staffordshire University.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/style-beauty/sephora-vibrators-sexual-wellness-dame-maude-sex-toys-beauty-2516526,Vibrators hit Sephora's shelves as beauty emporiums embrace 'sexual wellness',"A recent email from Sephora United States promoted the usual: Mascaras, face masks and blush compacts. But tucked among those products was a promotion for “intimate care"", encouraging shoppers to try two brands that were new to the retailer – Maude and Dame Products. A click on a link revealed dozens of artistically styled vibrators, lubricants, oils for sensitive body parts and candles that burn down into massage oil. Sephora is the latest major retailer to embrace a category known as “sexual wellness"", following Bloomingdale’s and Nordstrom, which started carrying such products last year. (This development had not been rolled out in Singapore at the time of publication.) With careful rebranding, word choice and packaging, products like vibrators and lubricants have become newly palatable to higher-end retailers that cater to women. It’s a significant evolution in the public acceptance of such products, helped in part by celebrity endorsements, and it comes amid a broader focus on wellness and self-care spurred by the pandemic. “People are spending more time, energy and disposable income on their own wellness, so it was natural that this expanded to sexual wellness,” said Elizabeth Miller, a vice-president who oversees cosmetics at Bloomingdale’s. “It’s evolved so much from what it used to be maybe 10 or 15 years ago to be much more approachable.” Bloomingdale’s – which recently promoted “the ultimate sexual wellness picks” alongside bathrobes and David Yurman jewellery in a Valentine’s Day marketing email – introduced sexual wellness products in May 2021, after an employee in its executive development programme pitched the idea. Miller said that some of the retailer’s comfort with the strategy could be traced to actor Gwyneth Paltrow, whose Goop brand introduced a vibrator last year. “Seeing Gwyneth Paltrow and Goop take the lead in this category made it feel brand right for us, so I give her a lot of credit,” Miller said, noting that the products are seen as a draw for Generation Z and millennial shoppers. “Obviously, we reviewed it internally with management to make sure everyone felt comfortable, but the performance has been very strong.” For the startups selling adult-oriented products, which often have difficulty navigating advertising guidelines, being promoted and bought alongside other beauty and luxury wares lends credibility. “Sephora and these other big beauty retailers are saying, it’s just like everything else, you can buy it together,” said Éva Goicochea, founder and CEO of Maude, which is carried at Bloomingdale’s and Sephora. “It’s impactful in this subtle way.” Or as Alexandra Fine, co-founder and CEO of Dame, put it: “Each time somebody puts us in their store, especially a major player like Sephora, it makes it easier for other people to put in their store, easier for investors to invest in us and easier for customers to buy us.” Maude and Dame have several things in common. Both startups have their headquarters in New York and both are founded and led by women; Maude, which began selling products in 2018, has raised more than US$10 million in funding, while Dame, founded in 2014, has raised more than $5 million. For many years, products like vibrators have been associated with adult stores, often portrayed as seedy or male-oriented, or otherwise found in the fluorescent aisles of drugstores or chains like Walmart. Maude and Dame have sought to elevate the retail experience, incorporating more approachable language and design. Celebrities have also gotten involved: Actor Dakota Johnson works with Maude as an investor and co-creative director, while singers Demi Lovato and Lily Allen have released sex toys with other big brands. Lisa Finn, a brand manager and sex educator for Babeland, a decades-old feminist adult products emporium with stores in Seattle and New York, said that conversations about sex toys became more “normalized” during the pandemic as people were suddenly isolated either alone or with their partners. She has increasingly seen them referred to as “pleasure products” or “sexual wellness tools.” “This takes some of this idea that sex toys are dirty or kinky,” she said. “And though they absolutely can be, for a lot of folks, these are tools.” That shift “does allow for them to exist in the mainstream,” she said. Tyler Aldridge, director of product at Maude, said that the brand was “trying to blend this idea of beauty, wellness and sexual wellness"". Retailers have liked those terms, along with phrases like “sexual health” or “intimate care,” Goicochea said, adding that Maude was more about “intimacy and romance than explicit sex"". These terms have the benefit of sounding healthy but stopping short of making any kind of medical claim. So while Maude sells US$49 vibrators in muted colors, it also sells amber-hued bottles of US$25 aloe- and water-based lubricant, US$35 unscented massage oil and US$18 mineral bath salts. The products’ minimalist design and limited colour palette are perhaps no surprise given that Goicochea previously worked at Everlane, a clothing brand that prioritizes a similar design aesthetic. Maude’s office in New York similarly boasts plenty of natural light, soaring ceilings, light wooden shelves and desks, as well as lots of clean white text on dark backgrounds. Clean lines abound. While Dame is more focused on devices, it also carries a US$30 “arousal serum"", an $18 aloe-based lubricant and a US$95 adult-oriented pillow called, much in keeping with startup parlance, “Pillo.” The companies tend to emphasise their products’ clean and natural ingredients. Descriptions like “aloe-infused” and “contains jojoba oil” are common. The styling of the products has caught some retailers by surprise. For example, Aldridge said that Madewell, a clothing retailer, initially balked at the idea of carrying Maude products on its website. But then a buyer actually saw the items on a colleague’s desk, marveled that they “looked like a beauty brand” and decided it was worth adding them to the company’s online marketplace. Cristina Nuñez, co-founder of True Beauty Ventures, a venture firm that invested in Maude, said that the products were crafted with an eye to the “shelfie"", meaning that people can feel proud and comfortable displaying the items in a photograph on social media. “We would joke around that the vibe was something that you could leave out on your nightstand and not be embarrassed that you had a vibrator on your nightstand,” she said. “There wouldn’t be that stigma around it because it wasn’t crass.” It’s difficult to estimate the size of the sexual wellness industry, particularly because increasingly it can cross over into beauty products. Many of the key players are private companies, and Maude and Dame were unwilling to share their sales figures. But Nuñez, who studied seven or eight similar brands before investing in Maude, said that many of the companies her firm looked at made in the “low single-digit millions” of dollars in revenue. She said that she was optimistic about the path to tens of millions of dollars in revenue and beyond. “The opening of retail to these brands will help them get there,” Nuñez said, “because historically, they really were only able to get to that point through direct-to-consumer, and now they’ve got multiple outlets, from mass, to prestige to luxury department store channels.” Showing up in a major retailer’s emails also helps the brands with their advertising issues, which do still come up. Dame, for instance, recently settled a lawsuit with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York, which had rejected an ad campaign because it was a “sexually oriented business"". The MTA’s move had raised an outcry, given other subway ads for things like erectile dysfunction medications and the Museum of Sex. On social media, Facebook and Instagram prohibit ads that promote the sale or use of adult products or services, particularly those focused on sexual pleasure. That means brands have to get creative – and the notion of “sexual wellness” helps. While Maude may not be able to advertise its devices on these platforms, it can promote its “massage candle"", which melts into massage oil, and its condoms. “The reality is we’ll still see flags, we’ll still get our warnings,” Finn of Babeland said, but Babeland’s products are less likely “to be targeted as such if we’re not talking about them as vibrators but rather as ‘tools’ or ‘massagers'"". Fine of Dame said that it was an uphill battle. When she tried posting about Dame’s launch with Sephora on LinkedIn this month (“Somebody pinch me — after five years of pitching, we are in SEPHORA!”) her post was automatically removed multiple times for violating the professional site’s guidelines against “sexually explicit material or language"". That persisted even when she included a link to an article about the deal. Fine said that she had a similar experience last year when she posted about Dame’s being at Bloomingdale’s. “It does feel personal in some way – it’s my voice and me as an entrepreneur, making me feel like I’m inherently unprofessional because of what I do,” she said. But she said that she hoped the partnership with Sephora and Bloomingdale’s would dull that perception. Retailers are largely offering sexual wellness products online – Miller of Bloomingdale’s pointed out that many customers probably prefer the privacy – although Goicochea and her team are hoping that Maude will make it to Sephora stores in 2023. One of her colleagues noted that logistics can be tricky at traditional specialty and department stores – after all, does a vibrator go next to the hair stylers or by the beauty supplements? Nordstrom sold the products in some stores last year, putting vibrators and other items in 10 self-love-themed pop-up shops. While a company spokesperson said that “the customer response was very strong"", the products have not become permanent fixtures. “Not all our customers are comfortable approaching the category openly, and we want to be thoughtful and sensitive in our approach,” the spokesperson said in an email. Still, Fine, who noted that she had been in talks with Sephora for five years, said even the online presence is a major change from the reception she received when she was starting out. She had applied for an accelerator programme that promised to help startups grow, where two judges offered feedback on each pitch. “One judge wrote, ‘Is this a joke?’ and that was his whole piece of feedback,” she said. “That is telling of what 2014 was like versus now.” By Sapna Maheshwari © The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/long-covid-19-symptoms-exercise-tired-struggle-2517336,‘I had never felt worse’: Long COVID sufferers are struggling with exercise,"When Natalie Hollabaugh tested positive for COVID-19 in March 2020, her recovery felt extremely slow. Eighteen months later, she was still suffering from a litany of symptoms, including fatigue, shortness of breath, headaches and joint pain. She saw a cardiologist and a pulmonologist, who both ruled out other health problems, she said. And they advised her to start exercising, suggesting that some of her symptoms may have been a result of being out of shape. So Hollabaugh dutifully began using an exercise bike, speed walking on a treadmill and walking her dogs several miles a day. But instead of helping, her new exercise regimen only exacerbated her symptoms. “I had never felt worse,” said Hollabaugh, 31, a lawyer who lives in Portland, Oregon. She found she had to start taking daily naps, that her heart rate would skyrocket even when she was at rest and that she was so tired she couldn’t concentrate. As one of the many Americans suffering from long COVID, a condition characterised by new or lingering symptoms that can be felt for months after a coronavirus infection, Hollabaugh is not alone in experiencing setbacks with exercise. Natalie Lambert, a biostatistician and health data scientist at the Indiana University School of Medicine, has collected self-reported data from more than a million long COVID patients through a collaboration with Survivor Corps, a Facebook support group for COVID-19 survivors. Patients frequently report that their doctors have advised them to exercise, she said – but many say that when they do, they feel worse afterward. “The research that I’ve done has shown that inability to exercise is one of the most common long-term symptoms,” Dr Lambert said. Some people are simply too tired to exercise, she said, while others experience debilitating symptom relapses like increases in fatigue, brain fog or muscle pain. This worsening of symptoms after engaging in even just a little bit of physical activity – what is sometimes called “post-exertional malaise” – seems to be common among long COVID patients. When researchers performed an online survey of 3,762 people with long COVID, as part of a study published in August, they found that 89 per cent reported post-exertional malaise. These exercise-induced problems are not, however, merely the byproduct of becoming out of shape. The effects “are very, very different from normal and simple detraining"", said Dr David Systrom, a pulmonary and critical care physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. They also don’t seem to be the result of lung or heart injury. In one small study published in January, for example, Dr Systrom and his colleagues compared 10 long COVID patients who had trouble exercising with 10 people who had never tested positive for COVID-19, but who had unexplained shortness of breath after exercise. The researchers found that nobody in the study had abnormal chest CT scans, anemia or problems with lung or heart function, suggesting that organ injury wasn’t to blame for their symptoms. Yet when the long Covid patients exercised on a stationary bicycle, Dr. Systrom found that some veins and arteries were not working properly, preventing oxygen from being delivered efficiently to their muscles. Nobody knows why these blood vessel problems occur, Dr Systrom said, but another one of his recent studies suggested that long COVID patients experience damage to a certain kind of nerve fiber involved in how organs and blood vessel function. Other research on exercise intolerance implicates problems with how the heart rate responds to exercise. In one study published in November, researchers from Indiana studied 29 women who had tested positive for COVID-19 about three months earlier. When these women underwent a six-minute-long walking test, their heart rates didn’t accelerate as much – or recover as quickly – as the heart rates of 16 similar women who had not been infected with COVID-19. “Clearly, there’s something going on that’s interfering with that normal response,” said Stephen J Carter, an author of the study and an exercise physiologist at the Indiana University Bloomington School of Public Health. Dr. Lambert pointed out that some patients with long COVID are also diagnosed with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (or POTS), a disorder that affects blood flow. In people who have POTS, “the nervous system can’t regulate the things that it’s supposed to automatically control, like heart rate, blood pressure, sweating and body temperature,” she said. Yet “those are all things that when you’re exercising need to be regulated properly"". Some doctors also point to parallels between patients with long COVID and those with chronic fatigue syndrome (also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis, or ME/CFS) who have severe fatigue, memory and cognitive problems, and often muscle or joint pain. For decades, physicians advised chronic fatigue syndrome patients that exercise would improve their symptoms, but for many patients, exercise actually made their symptoms worse and now is no longer recommended. In 2021, Dr Systrom and his team studied 160 chronic fatigue syndrome patients, and found that when they exercised, they experienced many of the same blood vessel problems observed in long COVID patients, while control subjects did not. “We’re essentially finding the exact same thing” when it comes to potential mechanisms, he said. This all leads to one question: Should COVID-19 patients who are having trouble with exercise continue to ramp up their physical activity? Nobody knows – and opinions differ. “There are both patients and doctors who are vehemently against any exercise” because of these issues, Dr Systrom said. But he also said that exercise can be possible, and even beneficial, after long COVID patients receive proper treatment. “If you can get the patient in a better place with medications, then you can embark on a graded exercise programme without precipitating crashes,” he said. Dr Lambert agreed. “You can’t just jump into exercise, or you’re going to be set back,” she said, but you should “slowly try to reincorporate it if you are feeling better"". She added that long COVID can manifest in different ways, so doctors and patients may need to tailor their recommendations to patients’ needs. “That’s really the story of COVID-19 – that for every patient, long COVID is different,” she said. “There’s probably never going to be a one-size-fits-all recommendation for exercise.” By Melinda Wenner Moyer © The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/adhd-relationship-problems-treatment-couples-therapy-2507946,ADHD can strain relationships. Here's how couples cope,"When Chris Lawson began dating Alexandra Salamis, the woman who would eventually become his partner, he was “Mr Super Attentive Dude,” he said, the type of guy who enjoyed buying cards and flowers for no reason other than to show how much he loved her. But after they moved in together in 2015, things changed. He became more distracted and forgetful. Whether it was chores, planning social events or anything deadline-driven – like renewing a driver’s license – Salamis, 60, had to continually prod Lawson to get things done. Invariably, she just ended up doing them herself. “I was responsible for nothing,” Lawson, 55, admitted. Salamis, who is not one to mince words, described that period of their relationship as “like living with a child"", later adding, “I hated him, frankly.” But when she brought up her frustrations, Lawson would become defensive. And as she continued to nag, she started to feel more like a parent than a partner, something they both resented. Then in 2019, at a friend’s suggestion, the pair read an article about how attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, can affect romantic relationships. “We both kind of looked at each other and our jaws dropped,” Salamis said. The couple, who live in Ottawa, had discovered something millions of others have realised, often after years of conflict: One of them – in this case, Lawson – most likely had ADHD, a neurodevelopmental disorder often characterised by inattention, disorganisation, hyperactivity and impulsivity. When one or both members of a couple have ADHD, the relationship typically has unique challenges, which are usually exacerbated when the disorder goes undiagnosed, experts say. Studies suggest that people with ADHD have higher levels of interpersonal problems than their peers do, and marriages that include adults with ADHD are more likely to be unsatisfying. Forums like the one found on the popular website ADHD and Marriage are often filled with stories of frazzled, emotionally spent spouses stuck in unhealthy, years-long patterns. But if a couple makes a strong effort to learn more about the disorder, manage its symptoms and find more effective ways to communicate, they can revitalise their relationship. UNDERSTAND THE SYMPTOMS People with ADHD may lack self-awareness, which can make it difficult to recognise how they are coming across to other people or how their behaviour contributes to the problems they’re experiencing in their relationships, according to Russell A Barkley, a psychologist and the author of Taking Charge of Adult ADHD. Those who struggle with impulsivity might take unnecessary risks, or they might opt for immediate rewards, such as the pleasure of playing a video game, instead of focusing on mundane tasks that need to get done. People with ADHD are also often forgetful about what they’re supposed to be doing and tend to have big, emotional reactions that are stronger than what a situation might warrant – which can lead to explosive conflict. Contrary to the assumption that people with ADHD. are always unfocused, many can focus intently on the things that interest them. But if they are especially attentive to a loved one during a relationship’s honeymoon phase and that intense interest eventually fades, a pattern can emerge where the non-ADHD partner feels unloved. “If your partner is chronically distracted, that means they are also distracted from you,” said Melissa Orlov, a marriage consultant who leads seminars for couples who are struggling with relationship difficulties, in part because of ADHD. “That becomes very confusing and then it angers the partner because they feel like they’re not really being paid attention to. You’re like, ‘What, don’t you love me anymore? This isn’t the way it used to be.’” While this can be incredibly frustrating to the partner who does not have ADHD, understanding these symptoms is a step toward embracing feelings of compassion and empathy over continual resentment. “Our loved ones with ADHD cannot help behaving the way they do,” Dr Barkley said. It is a biological disorder, he added, “not a lifestyle choice"". It is not simply something they could change in their mind over time if they wanted to,"" he said. FIND COPING STRATEGIES Dr Alicia Hart, 34, a primary care doctor, met her husband when she was 18. They both said “I love you” within three days and “were in a committed serious relationship from then on"", she said. “People thought we were nuts. I mean, we met at a frat party.” The couple, who live in Portland, Oregon, with their three kids, both have ADHD. Most of their conflict has revolved around scheduling mishaps, “threatening to record conversations to prove that they happened or me starting another overambitious project without thinking it through or thinking of the impact on him"", Dr Hart said in an email. “I also hate being late and have developed one million strategies to avoid this, where he has literally no concept of time and cannot be on time to save his life.” By playing to their individual strengths, they’re able to keep the household running. He pays the bills and manages all the finances. She keeps track of the daily routine, setting alarms on their smart speaker to help him remember things like lunchtime. They use a shared online calendar and a wall calendar, too. Robyn Aaron, a 36-year-old mother of two who was diagnosed with ADHD last year, said she and her husband now have a weekly meeting to stay organised, but they try to make it as fun as possible. “We treat it like a date night – pour a glass of wine, maybe even light a candle,” said Aaron, who lives in Lisbon, Iowa. “He gives the check-in on finances; I give the skinny on the calendar.” They also discuss their ongoing do-it-yourself projects, upcoming trips and any needs or wants. “It’s become even more important to us since the pandemic began to connect in this way, and it’s super helpful for my coping strategies with ADHD, too,” she added. SHOW YOUR PARTNER YOU’RE TRYING In the book ADGD After Dark: Better Sex Life, Better Relationship, Ari Tuckman, the author, psychologist and sex therapist, surveyed more than 3,000 adults in couples where one partner had ADHD. He found that the people who felt that their partners put in the most effort at either managing their own ADHD or supporting a partner with ADHD had almost twice as much sex as those who said their partners put in the least effort. For some partners with ADHD, it can be hard to accept the need for change and can also be difficult to be optimistic that new strategies will make a difference, especially if medications or past strategies haven’t worked. But it’s worth continuing to educate yourself about the different options available to people with ADHD, or perhaps even seeking out a different clinician from the one you’ve been seeing, he added. Dr Tuckman also advised both partners to choose their battles. “ADHD doesn’t invent new problems, it just exacerbates the universal ones,” he said. “It’s the stuff that every other couple argues about, just more often.” It is within your right to insist that your partner get the kids to school on time, for example, and ideally you will find a way to make that happen. But, Dr Tuckman cautioned, “you only get a small number of deal breakers"". CONSIDER A BLEND OF TREATMENTS Experts agree that medication alone is not the best way to manage ADHD, but it can complement other strategies like cognitive behavioral therapy, coaching, mindfulness and exercise. It wasn’t until he had been married for 16 years that Taylor Weeks, 36, finally realised that ADHD had been at the root of so much of the discord between him and his wife. As far back as he can remember, he struggled with time blindness and forgetfulness, continually dropping the ball and then chastising himself for it. “It has always been kind of a huge stressor for my wife,” said Weeks, who lives in Rio Rancho, New Mexico. “She’s constantly been frustrated with me.” He is now seeing a psychologist, taking medication for the ADHD symptoms and practicing mindfulness to help ease his anxiety. He still struggles with forgetfulness, but his mind feels more clear. “Before, I felt like I always had a bunch of thoughts going through my mind all the time,” he said. “But when it came down to try to articulate what I’m thinking, it was really difficult for me to get that out of my head and get my point across.” His wife is noticing, he added, and told him he’s easier to communicate with and seems more engaged with their four children. Lawson’s relationship also improved after he was eventually diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed a medication that improved his memory and ability to focus. “It’s literally like a blanket has been removed from my head,” he said. Just as important, they also attended couples therapy and learned how to better relate to each other and develop strategies to get things done at home. Salamis, for her part, worked to break old patterns of behaviour where she would continually check up on her partner or try to manage every aspect of their household. There was no need to do so anymore, because he was actually doing the things that needed to get done. It has been a long road to get to this point, Lawson continued, but now, he said, “I can be the guy she fell in love with.” By Christie Aschwanden © The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/lose-filter-ageing-elderly-dementia-brain-function-2506451,Commentary: Do we really 'lose our filter' as we age?,"Many of us will have experienced some unexpected honesty from the older people in our lives.  Whether it’s grandma telling you your outfit is unflattering or grandpa saying he doesn’t like the meal you’ve prepared, we often explain it away by saying “Oh, don’t mind grandpa, he’s just lost his filter”. But do we really have a “filter”, and do we lose it as we get older? When someone has no “filter”, it means they say things without thinking about their audience. They may blurt out something rude, inappropriate, or unkind, without considering the likely consequences. “Filters” are an important part of our everyday social interactions. A brief Monday morning chat with your boss is more complex than it may seem. For example, you might stop yourself from telling them they smell awful after their morning bike ride into the office and should’ve showered before your meeting. You might consider telling them about the fungal infection you discovered on your toenail over the weekend but decide against it. Of course, what you do or do not say also depends on how well you know them and what’s considered socially acceptable in your workplace. Your “filter” relies on cognitive processes such as inhibitory control, which stops you from saying the first thing that pops into your mind. It also relies on social cognition, which refers to the ability to understand and predict other people’s behaviours, thoughts, and intentions. This helps us to recognise what behaviour is appropriate in a particular social setting and to adapt our behaviour based on this. The prefrontal cortex, which is located within the frontal lobes of our brains, acts as our “filter”, helping us say and do things in a socially appropriate way. When this part of the brain isn’t functioning properly, we might act as though we’ve lost our “filter”. As we get older, our brains start to shrink. This is a normal part of the ageing process known as brain atrophy. It affects how well our brain cells can communicate with one another. Importantly, brain atrophy doesn’t happen to all areas of the brain at once. It is particularly noticeable in the frontal lobes. Researchers have linked age-related shrinking in the frontal lobes with declines in inhibitory control and social cognition. Studies have also found older adults respond differently to socially awkward situations than younger adults. For example, older adults have more difficulty recognising when someone’s said something embarrassing or tactless, and show poorer understanding of sarcasm. So as we get older, normal ageing processes in our brains may make it much easier for things to slip out through our “filters”. In some rare cases, losing your “filter” can be a sign of something more serious, such as damage to the frontal lobes due to a brain injury or stroke, or a neurodegenerative condition such as frontotemporal dementia. People with frontotemporal dementia present with striking changes in their personality and social behaviour. This could involve losing their normal inhibitions, disregarding social conventions and other socially inappropriate or embarrassing behaviour. However, these changes are completely out of character and are typically accompanied by other symptoms such as rigidity, loss of empathy, apathy, difficulties with reasoning and judgement, overeating or unusual food preferences and declines in self-care and personal hygiene. Aside from changes in the brain that impact inhibitory control and social cognition, it could simply be that as we get older, we care less about what others think. Compared to younger adults, older adults are less self-conscious, reporting fewer experiences of emotions such as shame, guilt, and embarrassment. They also have higher overall levels of happiness and life satisfaction. Perhaps we learn to let go of our “filters” and embrace the social awkwardness as we get older. Perhaps grandpa really didn’t like your cooking, and feels secure enough to tell you. So, what does this mean for those of us who seem to be losing our “filter”? Based on what we know about the brain and ageing, blurting out a remark without thinking isn’t necessarily something to be alarmed about.  And if you’re on the receiving end, try not to take it too personally. If these remarks seem out of character or extreme, however, consider raising this with other family members or a doctor.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/vaginal-dryness-menopause-oestrogen-hormone-therapy-2505986,What causes vaginal dryness during menopause and how can it be treated?,"Add this to the list of health conditions that aren’t simply a normal consequence of ageing and for which you certainly do not have to suffer in silence. A recent study conducted by the National University Health System (NUHS) showed that vaginal dryness is the biggest risk factor of sexual dysfunction among midlife women. Women who suffer from this uncomfortable condition experienced a whopping 1,300 per cent increase in their risk of developing more serious symptoms like genital pain and an inability to orgasm, the study showed.  WHEN AND WHY DOES VAGINAL DRYNESS HAPPEN? Vaginal dryness is caused by a lack of oestrogen, said Dr Susan Logan, senior consultant at the National University Hospital’s Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. “The vagina and vulva are covered with oestrogen receptors, and the changes in hormone production and low levels of oestrogen would lead to vaginal dryness,” she said.  The symptoms of vaginal dryness typically begin during perimenopause, which comprises two transition periods: Early menopause transition and late menopause transition.  If you’re going through perimenopause, you can identify the transition you’re in by looking at your menstrual cycle length and frequency.  In early menopause transition, the length of your menstrual cycle would be more than seven days longer than usual, said Dr Logan. You could have shorter menstruation (menses) and even get your period twice a month. In late menopause transition, there would be two or more skipped cycles, with women not experiencing menses for 60 days or more.  Dr Logan said women going through the two transitions may suffer vaginal dryness, with symptoms including irritation, a burning sensation, itchiness, painful sex, reduced arousal and decreased orgasm, and even bleeding during intercourse. They may also find themselves needing to urinate more often or may suffer urinary tract infections more frequently.  These are “unpleasant symptoms”, said Dr Logan, adding that bleeding would, of course, “cause worry” and affected women may need to undergo examination, ultrasound or other tests to rule out cancer. Perimenopause is followed by menopause, which is marked by a year of having no menses. If not treated, symptoms of vaginal dryness that begin at perimenopause can worsen, Dr Logan said.  PRODUCTS CAN HELP Dr Logan suggests that women who experience vaginal dryness can first try products that are available over the counter.  Vaginal moisturisers, for example, can be found in pharmacies and can be used long-term, twice or thrice per week. For use during sex, Dr Logan recommends water- and silicone-based lubricants, which are also readily available.  Those who prefer natural alternatives can try olive oil and coconut oil, although she warned that oil-based products may affect the integrity of condoms. Finally, there are vitamin E options you can try that may be inserted vaginally or used topically in oil form, to combat the dryness. Vitamin D may also be consumed, said Dr Logan.  Studies have stated that vitamin D helps regulate the growth of skin tissue in the vagina, while vitamin E can influence tissue recovery, boosting vaginal elasticity and thus reducing dryness.  Women who have vaginal dryness may also go to their general practitioner for prescriptive medication.  The doctor may recommend vaginal oestrogen, said Dr Logan, which comes in the form of cream, oral tablet or a soft, removable ring inserted into the vagina. The tablets and cream are used daily for two weeks, then thrice weekly, to help maintain healthy oestrogen levels that in turn ensure moisture.  Dr Logan assured that vaginal oestrogen is safe, although it should not be routinely used by breast cancer survivors or women with unexplained vaginal bleeding. Additionally, the NUHS study found that vaginal oestrogen was extremely effective in helping avoid sexual dysfunction.  Another option is topical lidocaine, an anaesthetic that comes as a gel or ointment and can help with painful sex if applied before penetration. While it has a slight numbing effect, it is said not to have adverse effects on overall sexual enjoyment.  LASER TREATMENTS AND PHYSIOTHERAPY Vaginal lasers are also available, although more research studies – particularly on long-term follow-up and safety, are needed, said Dr Logan.  Laser treatment is typically used to promote collagen growth and skin renewal, both of which can restore moisture to a part of the body. Collagen is a protein that boosts skin elasticity. At women’s clinic InSync Medical, for example, there is a procedure called FemiLift – a laser skin resurfacing treatment that uses carbon dioxide. Patients of InSync Medical typically attend three sessions, one month apart. The treatment is painless, although patients should abstain from sex for at least three days, the clinic said.  Another clinic Fusion Medical offers the Fotona Smooth laser, which is said to work by stimulating the production of collagen. It is fast and painless, the clinic said.  Exercise, specifically pelvic floor training, can also help with vaginal dryness and related sexual dysfunction.  A 2016 study showed that 12 weeks of pelvic floor training, which not only improves muscle tone but also boosts skin elasticity, can reduce vaginal dryness and other symptoms of painful sex. The study concluded that exercise makes a good complement to oestrogen therapy.  Aside from medication and other forms of treatment, women who suffer from vaginal dryness may also benefit from opting for loose bottoms as tight trousers may rub against the skin and increase discomfort, said Dr Logan. They may also want to avoid using fabric conditioner on underwear as this may irritate the skin. If symptoms fail to improve upon trying the usual treatments, seek the help of a women’s health specialist, she said, and if concerns are not being addressed by an existing doctor, get a second opinion.  “There is plenty of help out there. Just ask!” said Dr Logan.  CNA Women is a section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/when-do-doctors-prescribe-weight-loss-medicine-2488511,What you need to know about weight-loss medicine: Who can take them? Are they safe and effective?,"When it comes to the pursuit of a trimmer, healthier figure, the options are as wide as a pair of XXL-sized jeans. Fad diets, trendy workouts, meal prepping, “fat-burning” treatments, and of course, slimming pills, are par for the course.  And more people may just be on that weight-loss quest, according to the 2022 survey by market research company Ipsos on 500 Singaporeans aged 18 and above. It showed that 39 per cent of Singaporeans have gained weight since the pandemic. Compared to last year’s survey, this is an increase of 9 per cent.  The average amount of weight gain has also gone up, from 4.8kg in 2020 to 5.7kg in 2022. But lest you think it’s the middle-agers who form the bulk of those who have grown heavier, it’s not.  The survey showed that the most significant weight gain was among the 18- to 24-year-olds. In fact, more than half of this age group (59 per cent) said they have put on weight.  The good thing is, Singaporeans are trying to lighten up weight-wise. Sixty-two per cent said they were trying to lose weight anyway, regardless of the pandemic.  But if you think most people are taking the easy way out by popping slimming pills, think again. The survey found that six in 10 Singaporeans intended to lose weight by exercising more.  Even among those with obesity, the use of weight-loss medicine is very low, according to Dr Lee Phong Ching, a senior consultant with Singapore General Hospital’s Endocrinology Department. “In the past, there have been several, mostly unlicensed weight-loss products and ‘slimming pills’ that have had dangerous side effects, and this has led to the perception that weight loss is not safe,” said Dr Lee. Another reason, which he believed to be the most crucial for the low uptake of anti-obesity medicines, is the stigma.  “There is often an unrealistic expectation that patients with obesity are solely responsible for their own weight, and that diet and exercise are sufficient. We do not see this with other chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension,” he said. But here’s the thing: If you’re thinking of going to the general practitioner’s office or polyclinic for some legitimate weight-loss medicines, you might go home empty handed. Here’s why: WHO CAN BE PRESCRIBED THESE WEIGHT-LOSS MEDICINES? A potential patient is not someone looking at losing a few kilos to fit into his or her old jeans. ""Weight-loss medicines can be prescribed for those with obesity and should be used in conjunction with lifestyle modification via diet and exercise,"" said Dr Lee. Obesity is defined as having a Body Mass Index or BMI that is higher than 30. But if the patient has obesity-related complications such as Type 2 diabetes and hypertension, a BMI greater than 27 would already qualify him or her for the medicines, he said. This could be a 1.7m-tall man weighing 80kg, or a 1.6m-tall woman with 70kg on the scale. (You can calculate your BMI here.) ""I would encourage people living with obesity to seek help from their doctor if they are unable to lose weight on their own, especially if the excess body weight is causing them health problems,"" said Dr Lee. WHAT WOULD THE DOCTOR DO DURING THE FIRST CONSULTATION?  You can expect the doctor to ask you questions about your health, such as if you have any long-term medical conditions and if you're on any medications, said Dr Shariff Rizwan, a resident doctor of DTAP Clinic. You'll also be asked about past attempts at weight management, the methods used and your daily activities, he said. As for health checks, you can expect measurements of your blood pressure, weight and height to be taken.  ""Blood tests may be suggested to ensure the patient does not have any medical conditions that may be related to the high BMI to begin with. However, this may not always be necessary for all patients,"" said Dr Shariff. ""Where relevant, goals may also be set if deemed appropriate at this stage."" If you do qualify, you may be given the medicine at the end of the first consultation, said Dr Shariff. ""This would, of course, have to be discussed extensively between the patient and the doctor."" WHAT ARE THE WEIGHT-LOSS MEDICINES PRESCRIBED IN SINGAPORE? There are three weight-loss medicines that are predominantly prescribed at GP clinics and hospitals: Phentermine, orlistat and liraglutide, said Dr Lee. “Some of these medicines are available at polyclinics, too.” You may also have heard of other medicines usually used to treat Type 2 diabetes such as sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. These are used to help lower the blood sugar levels of diabetics but because they can also elicit some degree of weight loss, they may be prescribed by the doctor as well. However, Dr Lee said that ""SGLT-2 inhibitors typically lead to a modest average weight loss of 2kg, which is below the threshold to be classified as a weight-loss drug"". Added Dr Shariff: ""We regularly prescribe GLP-1 receptor agonists to our patients who may need some assistance in weight management, especially those with a BMI above 30 or above 27.5, and have a significant medical condition such as diabetes or hypertension"". HOW DO THESE MEDICINES WORK? Phentermine is one of those medicines that suffered from bad press in the past. This appetite suppressor in tablet form used to be a component in the wildly popular weight-loss drug combo known as fen-phen (“fen” from fenfluramine and “phen” from phentermine) in the 1990s.  However, fenfluramine was found to contribute to heart valve problems and has been banned by the US Food And Drug Administration since 1997. Phentermine, on the other hand, is not banned.  Orlistat, another oral tablet, works by inhibiting the function of lipase, a digestive enzyme that breaks down dietary fat for use or storage. When taken with a meal, about 25 per cent of the fat you consume doesn’t get broken down and is eliminated through bowel movements.  Orlistat is recommended for patients who may have high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol or heart disease. It is also used after weight loss to help keep the weight off.  Unlike the other two, liraglutide has to be injected daily. It works by helping the pancreas release the right amount of insulin and move sugar to tissues for use as energy. The injection also slows the emptying of the stomach and may decrease appetite and cause weight loss. However, liraglutide is only prescribed to those with Type 2 diabetes.  As for the diabetes medicines, GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors, it's not exactly clear how they help with weight loss, according to the Mayo Clinic website. GLP-1 agonists could help to suppress appetite, and both drugs ""slow the movement of food from the stomach into the small intestine"", which leads the patient to feel full faster and longer, and as a result, eat less. WHY ARE SOME PATIENTS REJECTED? Because these patients usually have a high body weight, there is typically an assortment of health issues that come with it: Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and certain cancers. “Different medicines have specific contraindications, which may not be suitable with certain patients with different medical histories,” said Dr Shariff. For instance, phentermine may not be suitable for those with cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, glaucoma or an overactive thyroid gland. Conversely, those with cardiovascular issues might benefit from liraglutide.  HOW EFFECTIVE ARE THESE MEDICINES AND WHAT ARE THEIR SIDE EFFECTS? In studies that looked at weight loss over six to 12 months, 70 per cent of patients who were medicated had effective weight loss, compared to the 5 per cent in the placebo groups, said Dr Shariff. “As per most conditions, the weight management cannot rely solely on medicines, and oftentimes, requires diet and exercise as well.” Dr Lee summed it up with the table below: HOW DO DOCTORS DETERMINE THE DURATION OF THE MEDICINE? It depends on the medicine used. Phentermine, for instance, is usually prescribed for three to six months, said Dr Shariff, while the other medicines may be used for a longer time.  “We would usually give a trial of three months,” said Dr Lee. “If we are unable to achieve weight loss of more than 5 per cent of the patient’s initial body weight, I would suggest stopping the medicine.” Said Dr Shariff: “In certain instances, bariatric surgery may be a consideration. In such cases, a referral to a surgeon will be required to assess the condition and also to suggest the appropriate form of surgery required”. WHAT ABOUT THE COST? The prices of the weight-loss medicines can vary, said Dr Shariff, depending on the dosage and duration of treatment. “It can start from about S$60 to a few hundred dollars a month.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/segmented-sleep-insomnia-cure-2501886,Why do some people wake up at 3am for a cup of coffee? The pros and cons of 'segmented sleep',"About a year into the pandemic, Marcela Rafea began waking up consistently at 3 am, her mind racing. She would creep out of bed and tiptoe into the living room, where she would meditate, try a few yoga poses and open the window to hear the leaves rustle, the cars rush by and the dogs bark. Then, at 6 am, she crawled back into bed and would sleep again until her youngest child woke her for the day at 7 am. “I needed that night wakefulness to make up for the time that I didn’t have for myself,” said Rafea, a 50-year-old photographer and mother of three who lives in Oak Park, Illinois. Unbeknown to Rafea, she had naturally reverted back to a sleep cycle that was believed to be standard in multiple cultures in the late Middle Ages through the early 19th century. During that time, many people went to sleep around sundown and woke three to four hours later. They socialised, read books, had small meals and tried to conceive children for the next hour or two before going back for a second sleep for another three to four hours. It was only when artificial light was introduced that people began forcing themselves to sleep through the night, said A Roger Ekirch, a professor of history at Virginia Tech and the author of “The Great Sleep Transformation.” Now that many people are making their own schedules, working from home and focusing more on self-care, there has been a return for some to the idea of a segmented sleep cycle – voluntary and, given the stress levels of the past two years, not. So are we simply reverting to our long forgotten, natural sleep cycle? And could this be the cure for those deemed middle-of-the-night insomniacs? WHAT IS SEGMENTED SLEEP? Ekirch, who has studied segmented sleep for the past 35 years, said there are more than 2,000 references to it from literary sources: everything from letters to diaries to court records to newspapers, plays, novels and poetry, from Homer to Chaucer to Dickens. “The phenomenon went by different names in different places: first and second sleep, first nap and dead sleep, evening sleep and morning sleep,” said Benjamin Reiss, a professor of English at Emory University and the author of “Wild Nights: How Taming Sleep Created Our Restless World.” He added that rather than being a choice at the time, this was simply something that people did, as it fit agricultural and artisanal patterns of labour. Back then, in addition to being a useful time for conceiving, the wakeful period was also believed to be a prime time for taking potions and pills and for aiding digestion (one would sleep on one side of the body during the first sleep, and then on the other side during the second sleep), Ekirch said. There was no pressure to get to the factory floor on time, to catch a train or to send children off to school, as most work was done in or near the home, Reiss said. Sleep wasn’t governed by the clock, but by the rhythms of night and day as well as by changes in the season. THE DOWNSIDE OF SEGMENTED SLEEP  There were negative reasons for segmented sleep as well. “Sleeping surfaces – often a sack stuffed with grass, or if you were lucky, wool or horsehair – made it harder than it is today to sleep for a long stretch without interruption,” Reiss said. And there were, of course, health issues. For example, “without modern dentistry, a toothache might start throbbing in the middle of the night.” Everything changed with the Industrial Revolution, emphasising profit and productivity; the belief was that people who confined their sleep to a single interval gained an advantage. The growing prevalence of artificial lights permitted later bedtimes, leading to sleep compression. Fast forward a few hundred years, and we’ve grown accustomed to compressed sleep. Well, some of us have. 30 per cent of people report waking up at least three nights per week, according to one study published in 2010 in the Journal of Psychosomatic Research, and 25 per cent of adults suffer from insomnia each year, according to a recent study by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania. For some people, the pandemic has spurred more flexible schedules, which has led to experiments with the old-fashioned sleep method. AN EFFECT OF THE PANDEMIC That’s the case for Mark Hadley, a 52-year-old finance manager in North Bend, Oregon. In the past 20 years, Hadley said he doesn’t remember a time when he slept completely through the night. “I always woke up halfway through the night and just lay there,” he said. “Physically, I wanted to get up, but I needed more sleep.” Hadley didn’t have a choice. He had heard of segmented sleep, but didn’t have time to stretch his own ... until his job went mainly remote during the pandemic. So in August 2021, Hadley started segmented sleeping, going to bed at 10 pm and waking up naturally at 2 am. He gets up for one and a half to two hours to read and to pray. Then he goes back to bed around 3.30 or 4 am and sleeps until his wife wakes him at 6.30 or 7 am. “This is what my body was trying to do, even when I had never heard of it,” Hadley said. “I finally got to a place where I have a healthy sleep pattern.” Doctors are conflicted about how healthy segmented sleep is, however. “We don’t really know the long-term impacts of segmented sleep because we don’t really have much data on it,” said Matthew Ebben, an associate professor of psychology in clinical neurology at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian. It may make some people feel more fatigued and drowsy throughout the day, said Nicole Avena, a health psychologist and assistant professor of neuroscience at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Also, Avena said, segmented sleep requires individuals to go to bed earlier, which may not work with many schedules. That’s why Kristopher Weaver, a 43-year-old songwriter in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, said he manages to stick to a segmented sleep schedule only a few nights a week. The days he does have time to sleep between 7 and 11 pm and then again between 3 and 7 am, he wakes up refreshed. During his break between first and second sleeps, when his mind is quiet and recharged, Weaver has more energy to write his songs. The nights that he forces himself to sleep in one go? He needs caffeine and marijuana to get through the next day. A CURE FOR INSOMNIA For Danielle Hughes, 33, segmented sleep was a remedy to her insomnia. Hughes, who lives in Dublin, Ireland, spent an entire year visiting with doctors to try to find a solution for her middle-of-the-night awakenings. She finally Googled her issue and stumbled upon segmented sleep. “It was like a light bulb moment for me,” Hughes said. “The whole anxiety I had about not being able to sleep started to ease, and I started to feel like what little sleep I was getting at night was OK as long as I used my wake time more productively.” Since she found out about segmented sleep, Hughes has been more open to this concept, sleeping from 2 am to 6 am and again from 2 pm to 6 pm. In cases of anxiety around insomnia like Hughes', segmented sleep is often an ideal solution, said Alex Savy, a sleep science coach and founder of SleepingOcean, a sleep product review site in Toronto. “When practicing segmented sleep, insomniacs don’t have to worry about waking up in the middle of the night, as that’s the way segmented sleep works,” Savy said. “Therefore, they can adjust the schedule to their insomnia and reduce the stress associated with it.” But returning to sleep patterns from the Middle Ages isn’t for everyone, Avena said, suggesting that segmented sleep should be tried only by those who are already having sleep issues. “I think that while it may promote better sleep for these individuals, it probably has more consequences than benefits for those who do not have a hard time sleeping,” she said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/burnout-symptoms-work-stress-red-flags-2500916,Your body knows you’re burned out: How to recognise the symptoms,"Dr Jessi Gold, a psychiatrist at Washington University in St Louis, knows she’s edging toward burnout when she wakes up, feels instantly angry at her email inbox and doesn’t want to get out of bed. It’s perhaps not surprising that a mental health professional who is trying to stem the rising tide of burnout could burn out sometimes, too. After all, the phenomenon has practically become ubiquitous in our culture. In a 2021 survey of 1,500 US workers, more than half said they were feeling burned out as a result of their job demands, and a whopping 4.3 million Americans quit their jobs in December in what has come to be known as the “great resignation.” When people think of burnout, mental and emotional symptoms such as feelings of helplessness and cynicism often come to mind. But burnout can lead to physical symptoms as well, and experts say it can be wise to look out for the signs and take steps when you notice them. Burnout, as it is defined, is not a medical condition – it’s “a manifestation of chronic unmitigated stress,” explained Dr Lotte Dyrbye, a physician scientist who studies burnout at the Mayo Clinic. The World Health Organisation describes burnout as a workplace phenomenon characterised by feelings of exhaustion, cynicism and reduced efficacy. “You start not functioning as well, you’re missing deadlines, you’re frustrated, you’re maybe irritable with your colleagues,” said Jeanette M Bennett, a researcher who studies the effects of stress on health at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte. But stress can have wear and tear effects on the body, especially when it doesn’t ease up after a while – so it makes sense that it can incite physical symptoms, too, Dr Bennett said. When people are under stress, their bodies undergo changes that include making higher than normal levels of stress hormones such as cortisol, adrenaline, epinephrine and norepinephrine. These changes are helpful in the short term – they give us the energy to power through difficult situations – but over time, they start harming the body. Our bodies were “not designed for the kinds of stressors that we face today,” said Christina Maslach, a social psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who has spent her career studying burnout. Here’s how to recognise burnout in your body and what to do about it. WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR One common burnout symptom is insomnia, Dr Dyrbye said. When researchers in Italy surveyed frontline health care workers with burnout during the first peak of the pandemic, they found that 55 percent reported having difficulty falling asleep, while nearly 40 percent had nightmares. Research suggests that chronic stress interferes with the complicated neurological and hormonal system that regulates sleep. It’s a vicious cycle, because not sleeping throws this system even more out of whack. If you’ve noticed you’re unable to sleep at night, that could be a sign that you’re experiencing burnout, Dr Dyrbye said – and your sleeplessness could exacerbate the problem. Physical exhaustion is another common sign. Dr Gold said that one of her key symptoms of burnout was fatigue. “I realised I was sleeping every day after work – and I was like, ‘What is wrong with me?’ but it was actually burnout,” she said. Changes in eating habits – either eating more or less than usual – can also be a sign of burnout: In the study of Italian health care workers, 56 percent reported changes in food habits. People might eat less because they’re too busy or distracted, or they might find themselves craving “those comfort foods that we all like to go to when we need something to make us feel better,” Dr Bennett said. Research suggests, too, that stress hormones can affect appetite, making people feel less hungry than usual when they’re under a lot of stress, and more hungry than usual when that stress alleviates. Headaches and stomachaches can also be incited by burnout, Dr Gold said. One study of people in Sweden suffering from exhaustion disorder – a medical condition similar to burnout – found that 67 per cent reported experiencing nausea, gas or indigestion, and that 65 per cent had headaches. It’s also important to note that burnout can develop alongside depression or anxiety, both of which can cause physical symptoms. Depression can cause muscle aches, stomachaches, sleep issues and appetite changes. Anxiety is linked to headaches, nausea and shortness of breath. WHAT TO DO If you’re experiencing physical symptoms that could be indicative of burnout, consider seeing your primary care doctor or a mental health professional to determine whether they are driven by stress or rooted in other physical conditions, Dr Dyrbye said. Don’t just ignore the symptoms and assume they don’t matter. “It’s really easy to blow off your own symptoms, especially in our culture, where we’re taught to work hard,” Dr Gold said. If it is burnout, then the best solution is to address the root of the problem. Burnout is typically recognised when it is job-driven, but chronic stress can have a variety of causes – financial problems, relationship woes, and caregiving burdens, among other things. Think about “the pebbles in your shoe all the time that you have to deal with,” Dr Maslach said, and brainstorm ways to remove some of them, at least some of the time. Perhaps you can ask your partner to help more with your toddler’s bedtime routine, or get takeout when you’re especially busy so you don’t have to plan dinner, too. Despite popular culture coverage of the issue, burnout can’t be “fixed” with better self care, Dr Maslach said – in fact, this implication only worsens the problem, because it lays the blame and responsibility on those with burnout and implies that they should do more to feel better, which is not the case, she said. However, some lifestyle choices can make burnout less likely. Social support, for instance, can help, Dr Gold said. This could include talking to a therapist or meeting with friends (even if over Zoom). It may also help to take advantage of mental health or exercise benefits offered by your employer. Sleeping more can help too so if you’re suffering from insomnia, talk to a doctor about possible treatments, Dr Bennett suggested. When burnout stems from job-related woes, it may help to request better working conditions. Dr Maslach suggested brainstorming with co-workers and presenting your employer with ideas that would help – like providing quiet areas for breaks and personal phone calls, creating “no meeting” days so that employees can have more time to focus, or ensuring that there’s always coffee in the break room. Even small changes like these can make a dent in the risk for burnout if they fix a problem people face at work every day. “It’s the chronic job stressors that drive people really nuts after a while – they don’t have the right equipment, they don’t have the things they need, they don’t have enough people to do the work,” Dr Maslach said. Taking time off work could also help, but it’s likely only a temporary Band-Aid, Dr Gold said. She compares it to using a bucket to empty water out of a sinking ship. “It’s still sinking, right? You have to do more than just occasionally take the water out,” she said. Still, it is important to take time off regularly Dr Dyrbye said. Ultimately, you want to ensure you have some freedom and autonomy in your job, Dr Gold said. “Anything you can do to regain an element of control can be really helpful,” she said. That could mean doing your least favourite work activity right before your break, so you have something to look forward to during the task and time to recover from it afterward. Or it could be trading a dreaded task with a co-worker and, in return, picking up their most hated task, which might not be so difficult for you. Finally, while you may not want to add more to your plate, try to make a bit of time each day for something you love, Dr Dyrbye said. Her work has found that surgeons who make time for hobbies and recreation – even just 15 to 20 minutes a day – are less likely to experience burnout than surgeons who don’t. “You have to have something outside of work that helps you de-stress, that helps you focus and helps you relax,” she said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/what-body-neutrality-and-how-can-it-change-way-you-exercise-2478631,What is body neutrality and how can it change the way you exercise?,"When I had a baby last summer — my first, a healthy boy — I knew that my body would be in rough shape afterward. Or, as my mother put it when I gingerly tried on a new pair of sweatpants one week post-birth: “Nothing is going to look good for a while. Try not to worry about it.” I didn’t expect how easy it was to take her advice. Maybe it was hormones, or the immersion of parenting a newborn, or a new appreciation for what my body could do, but I felt surprisingly sanguine about my wobbly physical state. At six weeks postpartum, I was cleared to start exercising, and a well-meaning nurse assured me that my “extra weight” would “fall off” once I resumed cardio. Instead of testing out her theory, I took slow, sunny walks with my baby napping in his stroller. I wasn’t exactly reveling in my loose skin, but I wasn’t bothered by it either. To my surprise, I didn’t care much about it at all. UNDERSTANDING BODY NEUTRALITY There’s a name for this concept: Body neutrality, or the ability to accept and respect your body even if it isn’t the way you’d prefer it to be. The term was popularised by Anne Poirier, a body-image coach and the author of The Body Joyful, who began using it in 2015 to help her clients build a healthier, more in-tune relationship to food and exercise. “Body neutrality prioritises the body’s function, and what the body can do, rather than its appearance,” she explained. “You don’t have to love or hate it. You can feel neutral towards it.” Poirier said that body neutrality resonates particularly with people who see the much-touted idea of body positivity — or the notion that we should love our bodies regardless of what they look like — as too big a leap. “For me, neutrality was a more accessible stepping stone away from body hatred,” she said. “I didn’t necessarily have to love my body, but I could see it with a different perspective.” Body neutrality might also appeal to those who find the warts-and-all approach of body positivity to be a bit, well, contrived. Do we really need to embrace our cellulite and tendinitis? Why not just aim for a more peaceful coexistence? CHANGING THE WAY YOU WORK OUT Over the past several years, the philosophy of body neutrality has gained traction among people living with chronic pain or disability, as well as those who feel marginalised by a fitness culture dominated by thin, lithe instructors who exhort the benefits of punitive workouts and restrictive eating plans. More recently, it has taken centrestage in popular fitness apps like Joyn, which boasts “movement classes for every body,” and the be.come project, a “body-neutral, I-can-do-it” programme created by Bethany C. Meyers, a fitness instructor who begins each online class by asking students to type in how they are feeling. The premises behind body neutrality aren’t new, of course, and plenty of people adhere to them without specifically trying. But for others, they can provide a radical break from chasing the bandwagon of unattainable physical standards. Lauren Leavell, a personal trainer and founder of the Leavell Up Fitness platform, characterises body neutrality as “a perspective shift that can bring about more realistic goal setting”. Rather than capitalising on the “New Year, new me” mindset that tends to crash and burn by February, Leavell encourages her clients to do what feels good and avoid what doesn’t. “Body neutrality is about reframing movement as a lifelong practice that will change with you,” she said. “Bodies change, abilities change, and it’s important to listen to your current body, not what you think you should be able to do.” She also places emphasis on movement as an intrinsic source of pleasure, not a means for delayed gratifications like a cookie, better-fitting clothes or approval from your doctor. “I operate from a space where exercise is fun and engaging, just because it is,” she said. ENGAGING WITH YOUR BODY, NOT CHANGING IT If you’re worried that you’d never work out if not for long-term motives like toned arms, know that research says the opposite: A 2017 study found that participants were more likely to be physically active on a regular basis if it aligned with short-term objectives like relieving stress in the moment. In another study, conducted in 2018, participants who were told to focus on the function of their bodies during an exercise class reported higher satisfaction afterward, compared to those who were encouraged to think about how it would improve their looks. This distinction is central to what Kelly McGonigal, a health psychologist, lecturer at Stanford University, and the author of The Joy of Movement, teaches her students. “One of the biggest principles of body neutrality is experiencing exercise or movement as a way of engaging with life for your body, not to change your body,” she said. This doesn’t mean that long-term goals are off the table, though. “Ultimately, enjoyment of an activity is about what it means to you,” Dr McGonigal explained. “You can enjoy strength training, even though parts of it are uncomfortable and hard and embarrassing, because you like the idea that you’re getting stronger.” PUTTING LESS EMPHASIS ON APPEARANCE For Justice Roe Williams, a certified personal trainer, body neutrality represents an explicit rejection of the “no pain, no gain” mentality of the mainstream fitness industry. It’s also a key tenet of his organisation, Fitness4AllBodies, which teaches fitness professionals how to take a more thoughtful approach to clients across ability and gender spectrums. His aim is to help clients “let go of the framework and assumptions that they have been taught about bodies needing to be fixed, or bodies needing to look a certain way,” he said. Those struggling to escape that self-scrutiny might benefit from an environment where they cannot see their body at all. Leanne Pedante, the head of fitness at Supernatural, a virtual-reality workout app, began her career as a personal trainer working with people in recovery from eating disorders. “One of the biggest requests I heard from those clients was, ‘Where can I work out without mirrors?’” she said. Even if body neutrality doesn’t come easily, she added, “it can be learned, when support is provided and triggers are removed”. Critics of body neutrality argue that pursuing a Zen-like sense of detachment doesn’t do enough to bolster self-image. That may be true, said Pedante, but it can still be a valuable tool in that process. “Most of us have very black-and-white, moralised ideas around what is wrong with our bodies,” she said. “Body neutrality is the unlearning of those harmful myths, so that we can move toward new ways of thinking.” From a medical standpoint, putting less emphasis on appearance also presents an opportunity to exercise more safely and sustainably. “If body neutrality teaches people to listen to how they actually feel, rather than how they look, then they’d be less likely to suffer from overuse injuries,” said Dr Lilli Link, a clinician with Parsley Health, a medical practice with offices in New York and Los Angeles that also provides telemedicine services nationwide. Plus, they’d be more likely to keep up fitness habits overall. “If something causes suffering, it’s not in human nature to continue it,” she added. It might seem paradoxical that letting go of external goals — losing weight, buttoning our pants — could also be the best way to reach them. In my own case, shrugging off pressure to whip myself back into pre-pregnancy shape allowed me to spend my free time doing what I actually wanted: Stroll around the park with my baby. Ironically, five months later, my old jeans fit again. It didn’t feel like a hard-won accomplishment; there was no “yes” moment in the mirror. It was just a body, one that I was grateful for.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/preeclampsia-pregnancy-symptoms-swollen-feet-2503676,A first-time mum didn't know she had this risky pregnancy condition until after she gave birth,"I started having swollen feet early in my second trimester. It was only week 15 of my pregnancy, when it became apparent that my feet were swelling, although it was on the mild side.  I understood that swollen feet, also known as edema (swelling caused by fluid retention), is commonly experienced in the third trimester. A friend who was pregnant at the same time told me that it was a bit early in my pregnancy for my feet to swell. My sister, too, was worried. She said my hands were also swollen, although I couldn’t tell. BEING UNSURE OF PREECLAMPSIA  My sister and I started googling the cause. She found the term “preeclampsia” and asked me if that could be it. I started reading up, too, and a lot of articles did, indeed, link feet swelling to a condition called preeclampsia – a serious complication related to high blood pressure during pregnancy.  But although swelling of the ankles and feet were obvious signs, the most telling one was protein in the urine (which is why every pregnancy visit to the gynaecologist includes a urine test). The thing is, I’d always passed my urine protein dipstick tests. At my pregnancy follow-ups, although several of my blood pressure readings were on the higher side of the spectrum, a second reading (after resting) always produced an acceptable result.  My doctor didn’t think it was preeclampsia as I’d only experienced swelling, and those with the condition would need to have two out of these three symptoms to be diagnosed: What it is: Preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication characterised by high blood pressure and signs of damage to another organ system, most often the liver and kidneys, said US non-profit academic medical centre Mayo Clinic. Mothers should be aware of preeclampsia, which can appear very late in the pregnancy, warned Dr Koh Gim Hwee, a specialist and consultant in the Obstetrics & Gynaecology Department at Raffles Women’s Centre.  How it’s diagnosed: “A major sign includes blood pressure that remains above 140/90 and does not come down,” said Dr Koh.   Preeclampsia can be prevented, if mothers take care of the pregnancy well from the early second trimester – when the placenta (the organ which transports oxygen and food to the baby) is still developing. If the early formation of placenta is not adequate, as it expands, some areas will not receive adequate oxygenation, he added.  Incidence rates in Singapore: It’s about 4 per cent of pregnancies seen at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital, said Professor Tan Kok Hian, Head and Senior Consultant, Perinatal Audit and Epidemiology Unit, Division of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at KKH.  Global preeclampsia rates range from 3 to 8 per cent of pregnancies – although Prof Tan added that with better management of the condition over the years, the rate of complications from preeclampsia, such as eclampsia (convulsions from severe preeclampsia), has dropped significantly. When it can be life-threatening: It can be deadly if the mother develops eclampsia – in Nov last year, 27-year-old local singer Nadya Dean fell into a coma after giving birth to her second baby, and died 16 days later.   “Preeclampsia is related to the placental small vessels. For certain reasons, if the placental blood vessels are not good, the blood flow that goes through it would have a tendency to form clots which, in turn, could damage the placenta,” explained Dr Koh. Poor blood circulation in the placenta leads to poor foetal growth, he added, and the clotting in small vessels can also happen in the kidneys, leading to excess protein in the urine.  Treatment and management: To treat preeclampsia, your obstetrician will have to decide whether you should be delivered earlier, said Dr Koh. A woman would recover once she delivers the baby (and the placenta). It is important to have her blood pressure back to normal before she's discharged.  To reduce the occurrence of preeclampsia, a patient who is at high risk may often be prescribed aspirin and, from early in the second trimester, an increase in calcium tablets, Dr Koh told CNA Women.  ENTERING HER THIRD TRIMESTER: ‘NOTHING HELPED’  Going into my third trimester, in late Oct 2020, the swelling was so bad that I had to buy new shoes. It was also the month I had to return to the office – I work in the events industry, and physical events had resumed.  While I was thankful that I got to move about more, it was also painful to walk around with swollen feet. My doctor also advised me to buy compression stockings (meant to reduce discomfort and swelling). But my feet, ankles, calves and legs were so swollen that it was almost impossible for me to put them on. I also wasn’t able to stand, walk and sit as the compression stockings were very tight.   The doctor also told me to try elevating my feet to reduce the swelling; my husband even got me to watch my diet. I even tried soaking my feet into both cold and hot water.  But nothing helped. There was perhaps only a 20 per cent reduction in the level of discomfort, but not the swelling. Everyone was saying I had “elephant feet”. I enjoy cooking, and would cook for myself when I was pregnant. But I couldn’t stand for more than 30 minutes in the kitchen, and it was uncomfortable. It felt like your skin was being stretched.  At the back of my mind, I still didn’t think it might be preeclampsia. I just thought I was a unique case and tried to live with it. There were support groups where fellow mums shared that they had swollen feet but did not have preeclampsia. GIVING BIRTH: ‘A SUDDEN SPIKE IN MY BLOOD PRESSURE’ My final appointment with my gynaecologist was on Dec 11, four days before my estimated delivery date of Dec 15.  But during the visit, because of a sudden spike in my blood pressure – it was 160/114 (a normal reading is 120/80) – my doctor said she couldn’t let me go home for my safety.  I was asked to remain in the clinic, where the staff would monitor my blood pressure. They brought me to a room to rest and strapped me to a blood pressure monitor. Within the first hour, they had checked my blood pressure three times. They must have taken readings at least six times over approximately three hours.  My doctor told me that should the readings still be high, I would have to be admitted to hospital that day and induced for delivery. She also explained that due to the consistently high blood pressure, I might faint or experience seizures.  My blood pressure remained consistently high, with the highest being 182/120. The readings were off the charts.  The nurses even took out a traditional blood pressure machine (in case the digital machine was not working), and I still “failed”. They were very concerned too. I was admitted to hospital that day, and had a vaginal tablet inserted to induce labour. At 6.30pm, I felt waves of pain, and a nurse told me that they were contractions.  By 10.30pm however, there was still no sign that my cervix was dilated. The doctor told me that I’d move to the labour ward at midnight, where I would have a second tablet inserted.   I experienced mild contractions through the night but when my doctor arrived at 9am the next day, she said the contractions were reducing. Did I want to take a third pill or go ahead with a Caesarean delivery, she asked. I decided to take the third tablet, as I wanted my husband to witness the birth of our first child. By 5pm, I was in a lot of pain but my cervix was still not dilated. It was time for an emergency Caesarean section – I wasn’t only trembling from the pain, the baby’s head was not engaged at all.  Half an hour later, my baby girl was born, safely and healthily.   FINDING OUT IT WAS PREECLAMPSIA: ‘IT WAS SHOCKING’ At the time that I was admitted to the hospital, my gynae asked for further tests to be done as she, too, was concerned about my suddenly high blood pressure. So my blood was tested and my urine was collected over the course of 24 hours. When she visited me the morning after my delivery, she said that protein had been detected in my urine, confirming that I had preeclampsia.  When I found out, I had many questions: Why wasn’t it discovered earlier? Technically, I could have died, and other complications could have happened.  I was shocked that the urine stick that every pregnant woman relies on – which shows if you have protein in your urine – could be inaccurate. It was only after they’d collected my urine over 24 hours that the results showed protein was present. I learnt that preeclampsia doesn’t only affect women during pregnancy, but also after giving birth. Following my delivery, I had to check my blood pressure two to three times a day. Thankfully, after about three weeks, the readings came down and everything went back to normal. At my postpartum review, my doctor told me I would have to take aspirin during future pregnancies, to thin the blood and manage preeclampsia. I reckon that I’d need to take my blood pressure regularly on my own as well, just to be safe, as I am at a higher risk for preeclampsia.  MORE AWARENESS NEEDED ABOUT PREECLAMPSIA Looking back, I realise that many women hadn’t heard of preeclampsia, and no one talks about it until it happens to them.  Very recently, a girlfriend who gave birth reached out to ask about my experience with preeclampsia. She hadn't been officially diagnosed with it but her blood pressure was quite high and there was protein in her urine. I remember her saying she had swollen feet, too. Perhaps her case was undetected too. I also didn’t expect that preeclampsia could be discovered that late in pregnancy. I thought that if you have it, you would know it early. I also thought it was a pre-existing condition. So when I discovered only after I gave birth that I had preeclampsia during pregnancy, I was shell-shocked. I remember that at the time that my feet started to swell, I came across YouTube videos of women who had died from preeclampsia. But I brushed off the fear, not wanting to scare myself.   Pregnant mothers should be equipped with knowledge about preeclampsia. It’s something that should be brought up early and talked about more. Family members should be educated as well. My husband hadn't heard of the condition either, and it didn’t occur to him that it was serious. If the couple is concerned about it, they should not dismiss it but bring it up to their doctor – even if the woman is only experiencing one symptom.  CNA Women is a section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/10-common-health-ailments-2021-singapore-family-doctor-2499081,"Gastritis, back pain, other WFH ailments: What family doctors in Singapore are seeing more of lately","Without a doubt, COVID-19 is the health issue of the past couple of years. But even though the global pandemic has taken up pretty much all of our bandwidth, there are other health matters that have not escaped our attention – or that of the general practitioners or GPs. The early isolation phase and continuing social distancing mean that our collective mental health has taken a beating. Fear of the uncertainty (How will you cope if you get COVID-19? Will your income be affected?) has led to stressed out people. Information overload from what to do if your child does get infected with the Omicron variant, for instance, can create anxiety as well.  But other than mental wellness topics and vaccination-related issues, which have all received top billing in Singapore since COVID-19 gripped the world, what else have we been queuing at the clinic for in the past year? Three GPs tell CNA Lifestyle about the trends they've observed so far. MORE SEE THE DOCTOR FOR COMMON COLD AND FLU While we tended to stay away from the doctor when COVID-19 first hit, we are venturing out into the clinics more now, according to family physician Dr Tseng Hsien Cho from Raffles Medical.  “The number of upper respiratory tract infection cases (including common cold, flu, sore throat, runny nose and/or cough) is slowly increasing, close to that of pre-pandemic times,” he said.  Dr Lin Diyang, a GP with Lin & Sons Clinic & Surgery, agreed: “Upper respiratory tract infections have, by far, surged ahead to be the most common complaint.” He attributed the increase to the “lower threshold” people have for COVID-19 after ascertaining with home ART test kits.  Still, there are cautious individuals who would rather see the doctor online. “There is an increase in demand for teleconsultation,” said Dr Tseng.  But even though more people are visiting the clinics now, Dr Tseng noted that the demand for MCs is still low. “It significantly decreased since the beginning of the pandemic in 2019 and has stayed the same.”  MORE WORK-FROM-HOME AILMENTS Dr Lin noted that other common ailments such as headaches as well as neck and back aches are seeing “a sharp increase” due to the continuing work from home (WFH) policy. “Long hours, on top of poor ergonomics in their home set-ups, contribute to this rise,” he said. “The lack of a fixed mealtime during WFH may also have caused an increase in visits for gastritis, which is largely triggered by irregular or skipping meals,” said Dr Lin. On the sexual health front, the rates of sexually transmitted diseases have reduced in the past two years, “but sexual dysfunction presentations (such as erectile dysfunction and vaginismus) have increased”, said Dr Jonathan Ti, the chief medical officer and a GP at DTAP Clinic.  GREATER FOCUS ON PREVENTION “Everyone is affected differently by the pandemic,” said Dr Ti, noting that some are now more aware of the importance of good health and disease prevention, which explains “a greater focus on wellness screening and weight management”. Dr Tseng agreed. “There is an increase in the awareness of flu vaccination,” he said. So in no particular order, here are the top 10 common ailments these doctors have seen since 2021:"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/malaysia-law-ban-smoking-generation-born-after-2005-khairy-2504306,Malaysia to introduce law to ban smoking for people born after 2005: Khairy,"PUTRAJAYA: Malaysia will introduce a new law to ban smoking and the possession of tobacco products, including electronic vaporisers, for people born after 2005 as a ""Generational End Game"" for smoking in the country, Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said on Thursday (Feb 17). He said that the introduction of the law would help to reduce exposure to cigarettes and tobacco products for future generations as tobacco use is the leading cause of cancer, contributing to 22 per cent of cancer deaths. “If you are 17 years old and Parliament (passes) the Act, you will never (be) able to buy cigarettes in this country ever again,” he said during the virtual launch of the ministry’s Cancer Day. Khairy had previously spoken of the law in an address to Health Ministry staff in Putrajaya on Jan 13. ""One of the top causes, or top root causes of death, is smoking ... but for too long we have not looked at this from the legal aspect,"" he said. He also raised the prospect of introducing the law during an address at a World Health Organization meeting in Geneva last month. ""Malaysia would like to highlight the negative impact of tobacco on (non-communicable diseases), which is well known,"" he said. ""We ... hope to pass a legislation this year which, if successful, will bring about a 'Generation End Game' to smoking by making it illegal for the sale of tobacco and other smoking products to anyone born after 2005. ""Malaysia feels this will have a significant impact in preventing and controlling (non-communicable diseases)."" On Thursday, Khairy said that cancer cases in Malaysia had increased by 11 per cent to 115,238 for the period from 2012 to 2016, compared to 103,507 cases recorded from 2007 to 2011. It is estimated that one in 10 men and one in nine women are at risk of getting cancer, he said. The three most common types of cancer among men in Malaysia are colorectal cancer (16.9 per cent), lung cancer (14.8 per cent) and prostate cancer (8.1 per cent), and among women, breast cancer (33.9 per cent), colorectal cancer (10.7 per cent) and cervical cancer (6.2 per cent). Khairy said that cancer is also the leading cause of death recorded at private hospitals (34.95 per cent) and the fourth leading cause of death in government hospitals (11.56 per cent). This year alone, he said that the government had allocated RM137 million (US$32.7 million) for radiotherapy and oncology services, and the amount did not include other costs in areas such as imaging and laboratories for diagnosis confirmation, surgery and anaesthesiology, rehabilitation and palliative care services. At the event, Khairy also launched the National Strategic Plan for Cancer Control Programme (NSPCCP) 2021-2025 book, and the National Strategic Plan for Colorectal Cancer (NSPCRC) 2021-2025 book. The NSPCCP 2021-2025 book contains the objectives and strategies for all areas of focus, encompassing prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, palliative care, traditional and complementary treatment, surveillance and monitoring, research and human resources. The NSPCRC 2021-2025 book, on the other hand, is a subset of the NSPCCP 2021-2025 book, and is a colorectal cancer action plan for the ministry to control the disease, which is the second-most common type of cancer in Malaysia."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/kosk-mask-nose-covering-covid-19-2501581,It’s called Kosk: Have you seen this nose-only mask online and wondered what's the point?,"You might be scrolling through the Internet to stock up on disposable masks when a picture of a strange-looking mask pops up on your device. And no, it’s not the duck bill-like or fish-shaped mask. Instead, this version only covers the nose.   What’s the point in that? This KF80-rated nose covering (it sells for 9,800 won or S$11 for a box of 10) by South Korean company Atman is meant for use when eating. It supposedly reduces anxiety in those who are worried about breathing in the SARS-COV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, via the nose while dining out.  Some media outlets have described the Kosk (made up of the Korean word for nose “ko” and “mask”) mask as consisting of two pieces: The nose covering (seen in the picture above) as well as a mouth portion that lets you remove it when eating. Other reports noted that the Kosk mask lets you fold and tuck away the bottom portion covering the mouth. But from what we can discern from online images, the Kosk mask is simply a strip that only covers the middle of your face. It appears you could wear it over your regular mask, which could have contributed to the above observations. The product hasn't received much love online but could there be some science backing it up? We found out from an expert. DOES COVID-19 INFECT US EASIER THROUGH THE NOSE? The Kosk mask­ might have ridden on the results of early studies that found that the original Wuhan virus targeted nasal cells – which explains why the loss of smell is one of the early symptoms of COVID-19.  As for the later Delta and Omicron variants, the viral levels appear to be lower in animal studies, said Dr Somani Jyoti, a senior consultant with National University Hospital’s Division of Infectious Diseases, and an assistant professor of medicine at NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine. Between the Delta and Omicron variants, the “levels of virus are lower for Omicron from nasal swabs compared to Delta”, she said.  WHICH ORIFICE IS THE VIRUS MORE LIKELY TO ENTER OUR BODIES: NOSE OR MOUTH? Both, actually. When it comes to the amount of virus that can enter the nose versus the mouth, it depends on whether you’re a mouth breather or primarily a nose breather, said Dr Somani. And of course, the amount of SARS-COV-2 particles in the air near you, which can be higher in a closed, air-conditioned environment than outdoors, she added.  What about the 80 per cent filtration capability that the Kosk mask supposedly provides? Does that help in any way?  “In order to answer the question, we would need to have studies comparing persons who wear Kosk masks regularly when eating indoors versus those who do not at the time of a COVID-19 surge. I suspect that in the time of Omicron, at least, it may not make much difference,” said Dr Somani.  IS IT WORTH GETTING THE NOSE COVERING? “No, I do not think it would be worth it,” said Dr Somani. “If the community rates are high, eating indoors would not be considered very safe, even with a Kosk mask.” A more effective way to keep COVID-19 at bay is to eat outdoors, where there is good ventilation, she said, or simply order takeaway. “I think if you are very anxious and the community rates are not at a surge level, you could get the Kosk and wear it if it makes you feel better,” said Dr Somani.  However, she highlighted that if the person you are eating with or someone nearby happens to be a super spreader, you may still get infected. “Most of the time, this is not the case, and most infected individuals only spread to one to three close contacts.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/hfpef-women-heart-failure-preserved-ejection-fraction-treatment-empagliflozin-2489926,HFpEF: The deadly heart condition affecting mostly women that had no proven treatment – until now,"Grace Tan, a 74-year-old retiree, enjoys an active life. She likes to “keep busy”, she told CNA Women, going shopping, taking walks and meeting friends. She is also a full-time caregiver to her husband, who suffers from Parkinson’s disease. Despite her age, she walks the distance between two bus stops quite easily, without feeling breathless. This wasn’t always the case. In 2014, Tan sought medical help after experiencing persistent bouts of breathlessness.  “I was unable to sleep well and couldn’t carry heavy items. I like to go shopping but I couldn’t do that either because I couldn’t walk for long. I would become breathless and just feel very heavy … I felt something was wrong,” she said.  Tan was eventually diagnosed with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF, in 2015. A DISEASE WITH NO PROVEN TREATMENT HFpEF, also referred to as diastolic failure, is a lesser known heart condition that up until last year, had no known treatment.  Diagnosing HFpEF is challenging because its symptoms are non-specific, according to a 2016 paper published by the US National Center for Biotechnology Information. However, individuals suffering from HFpEF “almost always” have difficulty breathing on exertion and impaired tolerance for exercise, the paper said. Most people are familiar with HFpEF’s counterpart, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), said Associate Professor David Sim, deputy head and senior consultant at the National Heart Centre Singapore’s Department of Cardiology.  “HFrEF is what the general public will know – this is essentially when your heart is weak. You think of the heart as a mechanical pump – it’s pumping blood to the rest of the body. In typical situations where a younger patient suffers a heart attack … (it is because) of weakness of the heart muscle, due to drugs or genetic components. “In this situation, it’s easy to understand because when there is reduced pumping, the heart cannot function and as a result, they get heart failure. But with HFpEF, the heart is pumping really well,” Assoc Prof Sim explained. “What happens in patients like Grace is, as we age, the heart starts to become stiff. Every time the heart pumps, it needs to relax – this is when the heart will fill up (with blood) again, that it then pumps to the rest of the body.  “In HFpEF, the issue is the heart’s inability to relax and fill up with blood effectively. If it cannot fill it up properly, how can we expect it to empty properly, to distribute the blood to the rest of the body?” added Assoc Prof Sim, who is also director of the National Heart Centre’s Heart Failure Programme. Unlike HFrEF, which is also known as systolic failure and can be treated with drugs, diastolic failure has no established treatment. This lack of proven therapy is considered the “single largest unmet need in cardiovascular medicine”, the centre said. HFpEF affects 50 per cent of heart failure patients globally. In Singapore alone, more than 100,000 patients suffer from this condition, most of them older women. “You don’t see HFpEF patients who are in their 20s or 30s – they’re usually 60 or older. The other interesting thing is that heart failure in general is more common in men but HFpEF is predominantly a disease that affects women,” said Assoc Prof Sim, although he added that it is as yet unclear why this is so.  A typical HFpEF patient, he said, would then be an elderly woman, usually one who also suffers from obesity and hypertension.  And with Singapore reporting a prevalence of risk factors such as insufficient physical activity, smoking, obesity, diabetes and hypertension, the likelihood of locals suffering and dying from heart failure is significant.  EMPAGLIFLOZIN, THE BREAKTHROUGH DRUG The underlying trigger for HFpEF is muscle stiffness, which is the reason why other drugs for heart failure don’t work. “It’s a totally different mechanism,” said Assoc Prof Sim. The doctor also told CNA Women that this stiffness is mainly caused by fibrosis (thickening or scarring) of the heart muscle and hence a strong anti-fibrotic drug may have a high chance of working.  And after two decades of research by experts across the world, a drug finally came to mind: Empagliflozin, which has been used for years to help diabetics control their sugar level. It is taken orally, once a day, and is the first Type 2 diabetes medicine to include cardiovascular death risk-reduction data in its label in several countries.   “We saw a strong trend in this drug benefiting patients who also had heart failure. It was very lucky that we saw this trend because we then tested it (with HFpEF patients) and it works,” said Assoc Prof Sim.  The effects of empagliflozin on HFpEF were released just last year following a landmark trial conducted by researchers in North America, Europe and Asia, including Singapore, led by the National Heart Centre.  The EMPEROR-Preserved trial, which began in 2018, saw the recruitment of nearly 6,000 patients in these regions with heart failure. Half were given a placebo, while the other half consumed 10mg of empagliflozin daily for more than two years. At the end of the study in 2020, those who took the trial medication had their risk of cardiovascular death or admission to hospital for a heart failure episode reduced by 21 per cent, results showed.  Assoc Prof Sim said researchers were “very happy” with the results. “Heart failure hospitalisation is one of the biggest costs of healthcare expenditure and the rate of hospital admission has been shown to be one of the biggest determinants of quality of life. “A lot of patients say that being re-hospitalised is one of the reasons for a poor quality of life. I personally agree … if somebody is already in their late 70s or early 80s, quality of life is more important than extension of life,” he said.  SALT A KEY CULPRIT Tan told CNA Women she was ecstatic about the discovery.  “I need to look after my husband. If my heart gets (worse), that will be very difficult. So I must be strong and healthy every day,” added Tan, who also suffers from diabetes and hypertension.  Assoc Prof Sim explained that the key thing for treatment is not merely to “keep the patient alive” but also to help them maintain a good quality of life – and empagliflozin makes that possible.  He also said there are no symptoms that differentiate HFpEF from other forms of heart failure, citing factors like breathlessness, decreased walking distance and fatigue, and thus early detection and prevention methods are the same.  He recommended a low salt diet because the main symptoms of heart failure are due to fluid retention in the body.  “A high dietary sodium intake predisposes somebody to fluid overload because it makes them retain water in the body,” he said.  A simple way to prevent this is to be mindful while cooking. Substitute table salt with natural herbs wherever possible. Another way is to buy fresh foods as much as possible and to read the labels when buying canned or preserved food.  Obesity is also a risk factor so you should aim to stay lean by exercising regularly and being careful not to overeat.  Those who are in the initial stages of comorbidities such as high blood pressure and diabetes are encouraged to seek medical help, said Assoc Prof Sim, as getting these under control will help reduce their risk of heart failure.  Most importantly, if you’re experiencing shortness of breath, seek therapy. “Some patients suffer for months or years before they seek therapy. Being elderly … doesn’t mean you automatically have shortness of breath. In fact, healthy ageing should not be associated with shortness of breath.  “Anyone at the geriatric age of 65 and above, if they suffer from breathlessness or are suddenly unable to walk their usual distance … should seek medical help early.  “Don’t assume it’s part of ageing. That is a myth – we need to correct that,” he added.  Assoc Prof Sim said he foresees the current medical guidelines for heart failure to experience “major revisions” following the EMPEROR-Preserved trial, with empagliflozin expected to be fast-tracked for approval.  The therapy is ""currently being evaluated for approval – there is quite a big group of patients globally and in Singapore, and yet there is no proven therapy. “Finally we have something we can use to not only reduce re-admission and solve … our bed situation in Singapore but also importantly bring on a much better quality of life for a lot of patients like Grace,” he said.  CNA Women is a section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-covid-19-measures-safe-distancing-masks-workplace-events-sports-2502216,"Safe distancing, visitors at home: 5 things to know about Singapore's updated COVID-19 measures","SINGAPORE: Singapore has adjusted its COVID-19 measures as the country continues its transition to living with the coronavirus. “We will simplify our safe management measures so that they are easier for businesses and people, individuals to understand and comply with,"" said co-chair of the multi-ministry task force Gan Kim Yong on Wednesday (Feb 16). ""This will also encourage a greater sense of personal responsibility, which will play an increasingly important part in our journey towards COVID resilience."" While Singapore is in the midst of an Omicron wave, its high vaccination and booster jab rates, along with safe management measures, have kept the number of severe cases low, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). Singapore can further ease measures when the number of cases starts to come down, Mr Gan added. But for now, here's what you need to know about the key changes to safe management measures.  1. Safe distancing will no longer be a requirement if masks are worn From Feb 25, safe distancing is encouraged but will not be required between individuals or groups of people while wearing masks.  It will still be mandatory in settings where masks are not worn, such as when dining in at F&B outlets. The required distance will be fixed at 1m for all settings.  With the new rules, practices that “actually do not make a material difference” to the pandemic are no longer forbidden, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung.   “For example, so long as people are wearing masks, there is no need to cross out alternate seats in park benches, or the urinals in a men’s toilet. Or when people wear their masks and they stand together and take a photo, they don’t have to be a metre apart,” he added.   “I think all these little things don’t matter, really don’t matter anymore, we can do away with them. Our people know that we are in a crisis and we can start to remove these little daily reminders that are not really material anymore.”  2. Group size for social gatherings remains at five, but households can have five visitors at any one time   The group size for social gatherings remains capped at five people. But from Feb 25, the maximum number of unique visitors per household will be adjusted from five people per day to five people at any one time.  When the Omicron wave is over, Singapore can consider “bolder moves” like adjusting the permitted group size to eight, 10 or even more people, said Mr Gan. From Feb 25, unvaccinated children aged 12 and below do not need to be from the same household to be included in a group entering a place or taking part in activities with vaccination-differentiated measures.  3. 50% of work-from-home employees allowed back in the office, with no restrictions on cross-deployment  MOH also announced some updates to workplace safe management requirements, aligning them with those in the community.  Fifty per cent of employees who can work from home will continue to be allowed back at the office.  Similar to in-community settings, employees who have their masks on will not have to maintain 1m safe distancing in the workplace. Social gatherings at the workplaces will also be allowed to resume with up to five people in a group.  There will be no restrictions on cross-deployment of employees across workplaces, although employers may continue to do so for business continuity reasons.  4. Size limits for events like weddings, religious services and funerals will be lifted  From Mar 4, specific size limits for events like wedding receptions, religious services, funerals, business events, media conferences and mask-on classes will be lifted.  Instead of fixed size limits for different types of events, MOH will set event sizes based on the capacity of the venue. Zoning requirements will also be removed because the “main protection” is through masks and vaccinations, the ministry said.  However, for large events and settings that pose more infection risks, capacity limits will still be imposed. These include attractions, cruises, MICE and large work-related events, as well as large performing arts venues or sports stadiums.  For other settings like shopping malls and large standalone stores, the current density limit is at about 50 per cent capacity. The threshold will be set at 1,000 people for now, said MOH in a press release.  This means that smaller events or settings with 1,000 people or fewer can proceed without any capacity limits, while larger settings or events with more than 1,000 people will be subject to a capacity limit of 50 per cent.  All mask-off events will also have to comply with the 1m safe distancing requirement. 5. Resuming sports activities From Feb 25, all sports will be allowed to carry on with up to 30 fully vaccinated people at supervised or operated sports facilities, such as those run by ActiveSG and approved private venues. Prevailing safe management measures will apply before and after the activity and during rest breaks, the ministry said. No additional testing requirements will be imposed as long as all participants are fully vaccinated, but participants are encouraged to test themselves in advance.  “The main driver of COVID-19 transmission is prolonged and close contact by eating together in an enclosed space. Sports on the other hand, while you’re playing, involves transient contact between players on the field or on the court,” said Mr Ong.  “Hence, there’s been no compelling international evidence showing that sports participation causes more infections. You are more likely to catch the virus dining with friends than playing sports with them.”  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-rules-simplified-social-gatherings-safe-distancing-household-visitors-2501976,Singapore to simplify COVID-19 rules; safe distancing no longer required when wearing masks,"SINGAPORE: Singapore will simplify its COVID-19 rules and do away with the requirement for safe distancing in mask-on settings, the multi-ministry task force announced on Wednesday (Feb 16). The streamlined rules, which will apply from Feb 25, will focus on the five “most important and effective measures” – group sizes, mask-wearing, workplace requirements, safe distancing and capacity limits.  Speaking at a task force press conference, co-chair Gan Kim Yong said safe-management measures are being simplified so that they are easier for businesses and people to understand and comply with. ""This will also encourage a greater sense of personal responsibility, which will play an increasingly important part in our journey towards COVID resilience,” he said. Singapore's new COVID-19 cases are likely to remain at between 15,000 and 20,000 or even higher a day, said Mr Gan. But cases are expected to peak in a few weeks.  When the number of cases begins to fall, Singapore can then further ease its COVID-19 measures, he added.  “In the meantime, we will streamline and rationalise our border measures, healthcare protocols and safe-management measures, to prepare ourselves for reopening after the Omicron wave subsides.” “These five parameters crystalise what we learnt to be the most important aspects of SMMs (safe-management measures) for pandemic control,” said Health Minister and task force co-chair Ong Ye Kung.  Although they do not represent a relaxation of the rules, there are “quite profound implications” on the way Singapore manages the COVID-19 pandemic.  If a new variant of concern emerges, authorities will try to adjust these five measures ""instead of coming up with micro rules for different settings"" which add on to a ""confusing web of regulations"", said Mr Ong. From Feb 25, safe distancing is encouraged but will not be required between people or groups while wearing masks, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a separate press release.  Safe distancing will still be mandatory when not wearing masks, and the required distance will be fixed at 1m for all settings.  The group size limit for social gatherings remains at five people. But the maximum number of unique visitors per household will be adjusted from five people per day to five people at any one time.  Wearing a mask will continue to be the default, the ministry said, adding that “there are no new exceptions”.  For workplaces, 50 per cent of employees who can work from home will continue to be allowed back at the office.  But with safe-management measures streamlined, workplace requirements will now be “aligned” with those in the community, the Health Ministry said.  For example, employees who have their masks on will not have to maintain 1m safe distancing in the workplace. Social gatherings at the workplaces will also be allowed to resume with up to five people in a group.  “There will be no restrictions on cross-deployment of employees across workplaces, although employers may continue to do so for business continuity reasons,” MOH added.  From Mar 4, specific size limits for events like religious services, wedding receptions, business events, media conferences, funerary memorial events and mask-on classes will be lifted.  Instead of fixed size limits for different types of events, MOH will set event sizes based on the capacity of the venue. Zoning requirements will also be removed, because the “main protection” is through masks and vaccinations, the ministry said.  However, for large events and settings that pose more infection risks, capacity limits will still be imposed. These include attractions, cruises, MICE and large work-related events, as well as large performing arts venues or sports stadiums.  For other settings like shopping malls and large standalone stores, the current density limit is at about 50 per cent capacity. The threshold will be set at 1,000 people for now, said MOH in the press release.  This means that smaller events or settings with 1,000 people or fewer can proceed without any capacity limits, while larger settings or events with more than 1,000 people will be subject to a capacity limit of 50 per cent.  All mask-off events will have to comply with the 1m safe-distancing distance.  With the new rules, practices that “actually do not make a material difference” to the pandemic are no longer forbidden, said Mr Ong.  “For example, so long as people are wearing masks, there is no need to cross out alternate seats in park benches, or the urinals in a men’s toilet. Or when people wear their masks and they stand together and take a photo they don’t have to be a metre apart,” he added.   “I think all these little things don’t matter, really don’t matter anymore, we can do away with them. Our people know that we are in a crisis and we can start to remove these little daily reminders that are not really material anymore.”  Two years of safe-management measures have “taken a toll” on the physical and mental well-being of people, especially on those who are young, he said.  The Health Ministry also announced some adjustments to vaccination-differentiated safe-management measures.  From Feb 25, unvaccinated children aged 12 and below do not need to be from the same household to be included in a group entering a place or participating in activities with vaccination-differentiated measures.  All sports will be allowed to proceed with up to 30 fully vaccinated people at supervised or operated sports facilities.  Prevailing safe-management measures will apply before and after the activity and during rest breaks, the ministry said. No additional testing requirements will be imposed as long as all participants are fully vaccinated, but participants are encouraged to test themselves in advance.  “The main driver of COVID-19 transmission is prolonged and close contact by eating together in an enclosed space. Sports on the other hand, while you’re playing, involves transient contact between players on the field or on the court,” said Mr Ong.  “Hence, there’s been no compelling international evidence showing that sports participation causes more infections. You are more likely to catch the virus dining with friends than playing sports with them.”  Beyond the five key measures, there are a few other specific rules that were designed to address higher-risk activities, including those around singing, alcohol consumption at F&B outlets and nightlife activities, said co-chair Lawrence Wong.  “For now, we will not make changes to these rules, but over time as we adjust our overall posture around the five key parameters, we will also be reviewing and updating these specific rules for the settings which I have just described,” he added.  If things remain “well under control”, Singapore can take further significant steps to ease measures after the peak of the Omicron wave passes, which may happen in the coming weeks, said Mr Wong.  “And at that time, we will be able to make a decisive move to ease across these five key parameters, which means group size, we can potentially go up to eight or 10. Capacity limits could go up from 50 per cent to 75 per cent. Work from home requirements, we may have more people being allowed to go back to the office from 50 per cent to 75 per cent, and so on.”  Stressing that the streamlining of the rules is not an easing of measures, Mr Wong added that “it’s not the time for easing” because Singapore is still seeing rising COVID-19 case numbers.  “But we are quietly confident in facing this Omicron wave, because everyone in Singapore is well-protected with vaccination and boosters, and … the vast majority of people who get infected are not so ill, so the numbers needing oxygen or ICU care remain manageable and things are generally well under control.” "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/pcos-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-singapore-play-2498796,Watch Singapore’s first theatre production about polycystic ovary syndrome,"You might have heard of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), a condition that affects one in 10 Singapore women, in which sufferers experience symptoms such as irregular menstrual cycles, infertility and weight gain. There’s now a play about it – and it’s the first Singapore theatre production that discusses PCOS, said the organisers in a press statement. The 80-minute performance, titled Lotus Root Support Group, is an independent production and showcases actresses Shannen Tan and Miriam Cheong, both of whom suffer from PCOS. Tan is also the show’s producer.  It will be staged in-person at the T:>Works Gallery, from Mar 3 to 6 this year, in conjunction with International Women’s Day on Mar 8. A video-on-demand recording of the play will also be released in the second half of March. Tan and Cheong play two women trying to understand PCOS and its symptoms while learning how to manage it.    While both actresses suffer from PCOS, Cheong only found out that Tan had the same condition months after they met.  There was this “sudden feeling of solidarity of someone who could understand what the struggles are like having such a specific condition”, Cheong said in the press release.  “Our symptoms were so different but we felt like we had so much in common at that moment. It felt like both of us became our own support group.”  That solidarity is what the play is aiming to achieve among fellow sufferers.  Said Tan: “When I’ve shared with women that I’m working on such a show, the most common response I’ve received was, ‘Oh! I have PCOS too, I thought I was the only one’.” “We hope that this production will be able to do that for women who are going through the same thing,” said Cheong.  Tickets to Lotus Root Support Group cost S$35 (before ticketing fees) per person.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/sleep-tips-how-calm-mind-thoughts-sleeping-2485111,Is your mind racing just before bedtime? Here’s how to calm it down for a good night’s sleep,"It’s time to sleep but there you are in bed, with eyes wide open and a brain filled with a myriad thoughts. You might have had a particularly busy day earlier on and your head is still buzzing. Perhaps you had a disagreement with someone at home and the unsettled feeling is keeping you up.  Or you could have spent the whole day (and night) Netflixing on the couch – and now, you’re as mentally edgy as the zombies in your latest K-drama fix. Sometimes, your brain might, on a whim, pull out an embarrassing memory from way back in school.  Whatever your thoughts are, there’s one commonality: We tend to ruminate just when it’s time for bed. But why is that?  According to experts, your brain is constantly collecting new information all day long. The lull period before you drift off to sleep is when your brain has the opportunity to process the information, said Prof Michael Breus, a clinical psychologist in Manhattan Beach, California, on the Everyday Health website. “And all of that information, including your worries, comes flying through the door.” The result is, unsurprisingly, sleep deprivation. “We clock, on average, 6.8 hours of sleep each night in 2021 compared with the seven hours found in 2020,” said Lynn Ng, a clinical psychologist with Annabelle Psychology, citing a study done in Singapore. “And only 21 per cent of the respondents felt well rested in the day.”   If you find yourself staring at your bedroom ceiling instead of sleeping, try these tips from the experts on some common scenarios you might encounter from time to time.  YOU’VE HAD A HECTIC DAY AND YOUR MIND IS STILL BUZZING BY BEDTIME Prep yourself mentally before bed, advised Martin Williams, a counsellor in private practice at A Space Between. For starters, switch off all your devices, including the TV, an hour before bedtime, he said. “If possible, go for a short, gentle walk for about 20 to 30 minutes, followed by a shower to relax yourself.” And don’t rush through the shower, said Chua Wan Zhen, an associate psychologist with Annabelle Psychology. This is a good opportunity to practise mindfulness and take some self-care.  “Note how the soap smells and the sensations you feel as you lather your body. After your shower, make a cup of warm chamomile tea and/or play some soothing music as you wind down for bedtime,” she said. If this fails, pick up a creative hobby, read a book or do some gentle physical stretching, suggested Williams. They are great ways to “activate different parts of the brain, which will help slow down the work-active buzzing part”. For those who are familiar with meditation (try guided visualisation videos on YouTube), this is the time to put it to good use, suggested Yvonne Yeow, a coach and counsellor, who also has a private practice at A Space Between. “You can fix your heightened attention onto the guided visualisation exercises, which will gradually calm and relax your mind, and help you drift off to sleep.""  YOU HAD CAFFEINE A LITTLE TOO LATE IN THE DAY AND NOW, YOU CAN’T FALL ASLEEP How long does it usually take our bodies to break down caffeine? “It takes at least five hours for the effects of caffeine to wear off by half, and it could take 10 hours for it to be eliminated,” said Jaclyn Reutens, a clinical dietitian and founder of Aptima Nutrition & Sports Consultants. And each time you drink a standard cup of espresso-based coffee (latte, cappuccino, macchiato and espresso itself), you’re introducing about 60mg to 65mg of caffeine into your body, she said. Here’s a look at how each type of coffee and tea, based on a standard drink, stack up in terms of caffeine content, according to Reutens and the BBC Good Food website.   As for drinking more water to flush caffeine out of your system, it doesn’t really work. “Limited research has been done on that,” said Reutens.  “However, staying hydrated can reduce the caffeine-induced jitters caused by dehydration and help to keep the blood flowing smoothly. More water also helps the urinary tract to increase urine output, but it won’t hasten caffeine elimination.” Your best bet to neutralise the stimulating effects of a late-afternoon cuppa? “You’ll just have to wait it out,” said Reutens. Or try these methods: Get moving by briskwalking or jogging; stop caffeine intake six to eight hours before bedtime; or eat high-fibre foods to help slow down the release of caffeine in the bloodstream.  YOU’RE EXPECTING A BIG DAY TOMORROW Get up from bed and move out of the bedroom, advised Ng. Write down your thoughts on a piece of paper and read them aloud. You’ll notice how unhelpful these thoughts are and how they might have made you worry for nothing, she said.  “Put the paper aside and redirect your thoughts to your breath to release your feelings of anxiety,” she continued. “Consider doing some simple stretching to release tension from your body.”  If you are still thinking about the next day, repeat the process of taking deep breaths and/or stretching until you feel relaxed, she said.  Williams’ strategy, on the other hand, is to be well prepared for the event. “When we’ve done proper planning, we can relax more, knowing we’ve done the best we can. If you can do a practice run-through with someone at home (if you are preparing for an interview, get someone to ask you some likely questions), that will help build confidence and reduce the anxiety.” YOU HAVE SOME CASH FLOW PROBLEMS Find a time in the day to organise the bills to pay in a systematic manner (that is, how much money is needed, when is payment due, etc), suggested Chua. “List down the possible steps you can take, people you can speak to, services you can apply for.”  Williams added: “If possible, talk to a trusted friend or family member as they might be able to see opportunities for managing this short-term issue that you may not have considered”. If you find yourself worrying about it again while you are in bed, reflect upon the possible steps you’ve already listed down and that you have a plan to tackle these problems, said Chua. “This process will help you to mentally transition from worrying to a more problem-solving approach.” YOU HAD A FIGHT WITH YOUR SPOUSE OR FAMILY MEMBER You’re lying in bed and fuming over what your loved one said to you at dinner. “Wherever possible, try to make up with your spouse or family member before bed,” said Ng, “as going to sleep feeling angry will worsen your sleep quality.”  But if you’re still boiling mad, what can you do? Make some warm, calming drinks (chamomile tea and milk are good options), invite the other party to join you, sit down and have a chat, suggested Ng.  Advised Yeow on how to mend the fence: “You can meet each other halfway or agree to disagree. If similar issues keep recurring, you may want to seek couple or family counselling. Working with a neutral third party can help to bring resolution to difficult matters”. Williams recommended using the chat to reach an agreement about what you have been fighting about. “Even if you don’t (reach an agreement), reinforce your love for the other party and acknowledge that your relationship is more important than the issue at hand.” If you can’t bring yourself to have a calm discussion with the affected party, take some time to cool down first, said Yeow. “But it is important not to sweep the matter under the carpet. The issues should be brought up and discussed, so that some resolution is reached.” SOMETHING UNPLEASANT OR EMBARRASSING HAPPENED AND YOU KEEP RUMINATING OVER THE INCIDENT Just stop thinking about it? Easier said than done. “It is difficult to turn off emotions like regret and embarrassment, if you handled a matter poorly,” said Yeow.  But instead of playing the scenario on loop in your head, take yourself out of the bedroom to practise some compassionate self-reflection, recommended Chua. “Talk to someone or write down how you might have handled it differently. Notice how you are feeling after sharing or writing down your thoughts.” Chua suggested listing one or more steps that you might have otherwise taken to better handle the incident. “Show yourself some compassion and encouragement. Tell yourself: I have done well today. It is not helpful for me to think about it now. I have already noted down some areas for improvement and will try again.” Use it as a learning point to improve yourself, added Yeow. “You can visualise how you would better handle things in future when a similar situation arises.” And sometimes, the situation might not have been as significant as you thought. “If possible, talk it through with someone you trust to get a different perspective on it,” said Williams.  “The issue may actually be very minor and they can help you see that. If it was a significant incident, they may be able to help you plan an appropriate response or formulate a good apology, if necessary.” YOU’VE JUST FINISHED BINGEING ON YOUR FAVOURITE SERIES AND NOW, YOU CAN’T SLEEP Save yourself the trouble of tossing and turning in bed, and “accept that you won’t be falling asleep immediately”, said Williams.  Instead, do something more productive and get back in bed after 30 to 60 minutes of the activity. You could read a book, perform some breathing exercises or meditate in bed. “Your body will recognise that it is time to sleep and you will soon become tired,” he said. It may be difficult to switch off the TV or laptop when you’re in the middle of a gripping episode of your favourite K-drama, but you should try to avoid screen time 90 minutes before bedtime, said Ng. “If you have to use your laptop for work or study at night, consider using night mode on your device.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/pancreatic-cancer-early-warning-signs-2484751,How do you look for early warning signs of pancreatic cancer? We explain.,"Pancreatic cancer is a nasty, stubborn killer that has thus far defied medicine’s best efforts at early diagnosis and curative treatment. In November, it claimed the life of my friend Peter L. Zimroth, a 78-year-old New York City attorney who was devoted to public service and who most recently oversaw the decline in the police department’s stop-and-frisk strategy. Mr. Zimroth had been on my “most admired” list even before he married the esteemed actress Estelle Parsons, who was 16 years his senior. Even during his yearlong, albeit losing, fight against cancer during the pandemic, Mr. Zimroth remained devoted to the public good, designing a brightly coloured T-shirt and cap bearing an urgent plea, “Smash the Virus! Get the Shot,” and raising more than US$73,000 (S$98,098) to support research at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre, where doctors tried valiantly to buy him more time. Mr. Zimroth was fit and active and in otherwise good health before symptoms developed –  in his case, stomach pains and constipation. By that time, the cancer had spread and it was too late to operate. His death follows that of several other well-known people who have succumbed to the same disease: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Representative John Lewis, the Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek and the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Although pancreatic cancer is a relatively rare cancer, it is so deadly it is now on track to become the country’s second leading cause of cancer-related deaths by 2040. Currently it accounts for about three per cent of all cancers and seven per cent of cancer deaths. Overall, only one person in 10 diagnosed with pancreatic cancer survives five years. A cure is almost always a lucky accident, when the cancer is detected at an early, symptom-free stage during an unrelated abdominal scan or surgery and the tumour can be surgically removed. Dr. Brian M. Wolpin, director of the gastrointestinal cancer centre at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, told me that this is such a hard cancer to find early because “it’s relatively uncommon in the population and the symptoms it causes, like weight loss, fatigue and abdominal discomfort, are nonspecific and more likely due to other conditions.” As a result, he said, “when 80 per cent of patients walk through my door for the first time, I know that we are highly unlikely to cure their cancer.” RISK FACTORS FOR PANCREATIC CANCER Still, there are several major risk factors for developing pancreatic cancer. Smoking doubles the risk and accounts for about a quarter of all cases. Being obese, gaining excess weight as an adult and carrying extra weight around the waist, even if not otherwise very overweight, also increase one’s risk. That may be why Type 2 diabetes, which is most often related to being overweight, is an important risk factor as well. Other risks include chronic pancreatitis, a persistent inflammation of the pancreas often linked to heavy alcohol consumption and smoking, and workplace exposure to certain chemicals, like those used in dry cleaning and metal work industries. Older age is also a risk factor – some two-thirds of cases occur in those 65 and older. And family history may also play a role, including inherited genetic conditions like mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes that are most often associated with breast and ovarian cancers. DIABETES AS AN EARLY WARNING SIGN It’s long been known that the best chance of surviving most cancers results from early detection, when the malignancy is totally confined to the organ or tissue in which it originates. (Blood cancers present different issues.) The pancreas is a rather small, carrot-shaped organ, about six inches long and less than two inches wide, that lies well-hidden between the ribs and the stomach. An early cancer in the pancreas doesn’t produce a lesion that can be felt, and it rarely causes symptoms that might prompt a definitive medical work-up until it has escaped the confines of the pancreas and spread elsewhere. But scientists are studying one possible early warning sign: a link between pancreatic cancer and newly developed Type 2 diabetes. Diabetes, too, arises in the pancreas, which contains specialized cells that produce the hormone insulin that regulates blood sugar levels. And while it’s not yet known which comes first, diabetes or cancer, some research suggests that the recent development of Type 2 diabetes may herald the existence of cancer hidden in this organ. An early study from 2005 of 2,122 residents of Rochester, Minn., by Dr. Suresh T. Chari, now a gastroenterologist at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Centre, found that within three years of receiving a diagnosis of diabetes, people were six to eight times more likely than the general population to have pancreatic cancer. He, along with colleagues at the Mayo Clinic, also identified a gene called UCP-1 that may predict the development of this cancer in people with diabetes. More recently, Dr. Maxim S. Petrov, a professor of pancreatology at the University of Auckland School of Medicine, led a September 2020 study in New Zealand of nearly 140,000 people with Type 2 diabetes or pancreatitis, or both, who were followed for up to 18 years. The findings revealed that those who developed diabetes after an attack of pancreatitis were seven times more likely to get pancreatic cancer than others with Type 2 diabetes. In 2018, the National Cancer Institute launched a study that is in the process of enrolling 10,000 people aged 50 to 85 with newly diagnosed diabetes or elevated blood sugar levels. Participants will donate blood and tissue samples, and researchers will follow them in the hopes of identifying clues to early detection among those who develop pancreatic cancer. Another effort begun last summer by the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, called the Early Detection Initiative for Pancreatic Cancer, will enrol more than 12,000 participants with elevated blood sugar levels and new-onset diabetes. Half will have periodic blood tests and undergo abdominal imaging based on their age, body weight and blood glucose levels to look for evidence of early pancreatic cancer, while the others will serve as controls. The goal of such studies is to identify biological markers, like certain genes or proteins excreted by the tumour, that could be used in screening tests to indicate the presence of cancer when it could still potentially benefit from surgery. Alas, the results are not likely to be known before 2030, if then. Meanwhile, Dr. Wolpin said that doctors should consider “a checklist” of warning signs that might alert them to the presence of an early, curable cancer. Among things to consider, he said, are whether a patient’s glucose level is rising rapidly and is difficult to control with diabetes medication; whether patients with diabetes are losing weight with no explanation like a change in diet or exercise; or if patients have been fine for years and then suddenly in their early 70s get diabetes and it’s not clear why.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-lifestyle/phone-addiction-screen-time-tips-2487011,Are you addicted to your phone? Here's how you can cut back,"You have your phone on you at all times and check it hundreds of times a day. Is this screen addiction? And are there any proven ways to treat it?  The fact remains that our work, social lives and entertainment have become inextricably tied to our devices, and the pandemic has made matters worse. One Pew Research Centre survey conducted in April, for instance, found that among the 81 per cent of adults in the United States who used video calls to connect with others since the beginning of the pandemic, 40 per cent said they felt “worn out or fatigued” from those calls, and 33 per cent said they’ve tried to scale back the amount of time they spent on the internet or on their smartphones. Not all smartphone use is bad, of course. Sometimes, smartphones “make us happier, enriched and connect us to other people,” said Adam Alter, a marketing and psychology professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. But many people want to cut back, and experts say there are effective ways to do it. IS IT REALLY POSSIBLE TO BE ADDICTED TO A SMARTPHONE? Smartphone overuse can manifest in many ways. Maybe you regularly stay up late scrolling through Instagram or TikTok. Or the allure of your smartphone makes it difficult to be fully present for yourself, your work or those around you. Phone or screen overuse isn’t officially recognized as an addiction (or a substance use disorder, as experts call it) in the American Psychiatric Association’s official manual of mental disorders. But “there is a growing number of mental health specialists who recognize that people can get addicted to their smartphones,” said Dr. Anna Lembke, an addiction expert and a professor of psychiatry and behavioural sciences at Stanford University. Dr. Lembke noted that an addiction is partially defined by the three C’s: CONTROL: Using a substance or performing a behaviour (like gambling) in ways that would be considered out of control, or more so than intended. COMPULSION: Being intensely mentally preoccupied with and using a substance (or performing a behaviour) automatically, without actively deciding to do so. CONSEQUENCES: Continued use in spite of negative social, physical and mental consequences. Many of us can recognize some of these behaviours in our own phone use. Dr. Alter, on the other hand, doesn’t consider smartphone or screen overuse as a true addiction, and both he and Dr. Lembke noted that there is disagreement within the health community about this. “I don’t think it rises to the level of a medical addiction,” Dr. Alter said. “To me it’s more of a cultural malady than anything.” Regardless of how you define it, both experts say there are ways to reduce your phone use. TAKE A ‘SCREEN FAST.’ One approach Dr. Lembke has found to be highly effective in her clinical practice is to completely avoid using all screens, not just phones, for anywhere from a day to a month. This strategy hasn’t been formally studied in screen overuse patients in particular, she said, but the evidence for its use with other types of addictions, like alcoholism, suggests it can be effective. How long you decide to fast will depend on your level of use, Dr. Lembke said. The average person might start with a 24-hour fast, for example, while someone with a more severe case of screen overuse may want to avoid screens for longer. Of course, a true fast may not be practical for many people, whether because of work or personal reasons, but the goal is to get as close to full avoidance as possible. Dr. Lembke warned that many people – even those with milder screen overuse – may notice withdrawal symptoms initially, like irritability or insomnia, but that over time they’ll start feeling better. In her 25 years of seeing patients, Dr. Lembke has noticed that by the end of a one-month fast, the majority of her patients usually “report less anxiety, less depression, sleeping better, more energy, getting more done, as well as being able to look back and see in a more cleareyed way exactly how their screen use was affecting their lives,” she said. Those who fast for less than a month will still see benefits, she said, though they likely won’t be as dramatic. After abstaining from screens for a period, she recommended reflecting on how you want your relationship with your devices to look like going forward. SET RULES AROUND YOUR DAILY SMARTPHONE USE. Besides a screen fast, Dr. Lembke and Dr. Alter recommended finding other, less stringent, ways to distance yourself from your phone each day. That might mean allotting times of the day or days of the week when you don’t use your phone at all, such as before and after work. It may also mean leaving your phone in the other room, keeping it out of your bedroom or putting everyone’s phone in a box outside of the kitchen during dinnertime. “It sounds trivial, like an old-fashioned analogue solution. But we know from decades of psychology that things closest to us in physical space have the biggest effect on us psychologically,” Dr. Alter said. “If you allow your phone to join you in every experience, you’re going to be drawn to it and you’re going to use it. Whereas if you can’t physically reach it, you’re going to use it less.” MAKE YOUR SMARTPHONE LESS APPEALING. You can also make your phone less visually engaging, by changing the screen to grayscale or turning off notifications, for example. Dr. Alter suggested periodically rearranging the apps on your phone so that they become harder to find and less likely to lure you into a mindless loop of checking and rechecking simply out of habit. Both experts advised deleting certain types of apps – especially the ones you know that you have a hard time avoiding (or if you don’t want to delete those apps, you can move them to the last screen on your phone to make them less accessible). “Use apps that enrich your life, that add value and meaning or that you need for work, not ones that take you down a rabbit hole,” Dr. Lembke said. And if the apps that add value to your life are the same ones that you feel addicted to, Dr. Lembke recommended creating some space using the tips above. “The big question to ask yourself with screens is: ‘What else could I be doing right now? Is there something I could be doing that would be better for me?’” Dr. Alter said. “That’s important now more than ever because of how much time we’ve been forced to spend on screens during the pandemic.” By Annie Sneed © The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/covid-19-immunity-vaccine-booster-shot-virus-infection-2480626,I just recovered from COVID-19. Do I need a booster?,"Millions of people who have recently developed Covid-19 may have some new questions about their immunity. If they have not yet received a booster shot, do they still need to get one? And when is the optimal time to get it? Federal health officials continue to recommend that everyone get vaccinated and boosted, regardless of whether they’ve had Covid-19 in the past. But the guidance on when to schedule a booster appointment after recovering from Covid-19 is less than clear. Here’s what we know. WHAT’S THE POINT OF GETTING A BOOSTER AFTER YOU’VE HAD COVID? Most experts agree that vaccines can offer a more reliable and effective immune boost than a natural infection can. When you get infected with COVID-19, your immune system mounts a series of responses that bulk up the body’s defences against future infections. One of the best ways scientists know how to measure that response is to look at how many antibodies you’ve produced. In general, people who’ve been infected with the coronavirus tend to have lower levels of antibodies than those who’ve been vaccinated, said Aubree Gordon, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan. One of the reasons for this difference is that infections trigger many different parts of the immune system, and the size of the antibody response will depend on factors like how much virus you inhaled, whether you have underlying medical conditions and the severity of your symptoms. “You may have a high level if you were sicker or sick for longer,” Dr. Gordon said. “But it’s still going to be lower than what we see with the vaccine.” Vaccines provide a tailored set of instructions for the immune system to use in the absence of any distractions, such as an active infection, said Paul Thomas, an immunologist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis. And most people who get vaccinated develop a strong and predictable antibody response. A booster shot reminds the body to bump up its defences — even faster than the first or second shot — in a matter of days. Studies also suggest that the antibodies produced after vaccination tend to remain at protective levels for longer. “I think that’s the biggest argument to get boosted, frankly, even if you’ve had a recent infection,” said Dr. Amy Sherman, an infectious disease physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. “It’s a sure-fire way to give further protection and make sure your immune system produces peak responses.” WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO GET A BOOSTER? There is no hard and fast rule for when to schedule a booster shot after having Covid-19. The optimal timing will depend on your individual circumstances, including how severe your illness was, how long it’s been since your symptoms resolved and what your risk for re-exposure is. But if you’re currently dealing with an active infection, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention recommends waiting at least until you no longer have symptoms and have met their criteria for ending isolation. (Meaning, if you had a mild infection, it’s been at least five days since your symptoms started, your symptoms are improving and you’ve been fever-free for at least 24 hours without the help of medications.) That being said, some scientists recommend deferring your booster for even longer. Ali Ellebedy, an immunologist at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said that it might make sense to wait until you’ve fully recovered or can get a negative P.C.R. test, though this isn’t a C.D.C. requirement to end isolation and may not occur until a few weeks (or even months) later. “You just don’t want to overwhelm your system,” Dr. Ellebedy said. Let your immune system rest after fighting off the coronavirus and before asking it to ramp up again with the vaccine. This will also allow for a more refined and durable response, he said. And for some, Dr. Ellebedy added, there can be a benefit to waiting even longer. If your risk of reinfection is low — for example if you work remotely, are generally healthy and can adhere to public health guidelines for masking and social distancing — it might make sense to wait until your natural immunity is waning, which could occur up to three months after an infection, before getting boosted, he said. Not only will this help to produce a more robust antibody response, but by the time you’re ready to be boosted, there might be a newer version of the vaccine available that will specifically work against Omicron. “The vaccine is derived from the original strain of the coronavirus, and that doesn’t really exist anymore,” Dr. Ellebedy said. “A few months from now, if an Omicron-based vaccine is available, why not take that to prepare for whatever comes next?” Drug companies have begun testing new versions of the Covid booster, which may be available by the summer. Of course, deferring a booster isn’t the right option for everyone. If you have a high risk of reinfection or serious illness — whether because of your age, medical conditions, a weakened immune system or because you live or work in a setting that increases your likelihood of exposure — then you may want to boost your immunity with an extra vaccine dose sooner rather than later, Dr. Ellebedy added. Getting your booster sooner may also extend protection to vulnerable family members and children who are too young to receive the vaccine. And of course, most experts agree that if it’s been more than five or six months since you got Covid-19 and you haven’t been boosted yet, you should do so as soon as you’re eligible. “The booster provides real material help against preventing you from getting Omicron,” Dr. Thomas said. “And there’s so much Omicron around right now that if you haven’t gotten it already, then this is a chance to avoid getting it.”   By Knvul Sheikh © The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/healthcare-workers-describe-struggles-patients-flood-emergency-rooms-amid-omicron-wave-2492571,Healthcare workers describe struggles as patients flood emergency rooms amid Omicron wave,"SINGAPORE: Stretchers filled with patients. Doctors and nurses testing positive for COVID-19. Long shifts with no toilet breaks. Fatigue. Healthcare workers at several hospitals across Singapore are feeling the strain amid a flood of patients seeking treatment at emergency departments, leading to long queues and waiting time for a ward placement. “It’s like Tetris blocks except it’s stretchers filled with patients,” said Jessica (not her real name), who works as a doctor at a public hospital. “When you bring a patient in, you just have to find an empty spot to just push them there. It can be very confusing and hard to find them sometimes because it’s just so crowded, so we end up having to shout their names to try and find them,” she added. Healthcare workers interviewed for this story were not identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media. Over the past week, hospitals across the island said they have seen a higher number of patients seeking medical attention at their emergency rooms.  Khoo Teck Puat Hospital told CNA that the average daily attendance at its emergency department rose by 20 per cent in the first week of February compared with January. Of the patients who walked into its emergency room that week, 66 per cent were discharged without being hospitalised, said its spokesperson.  At Singapore General Hospital (SGH), the emergency department is seeing a “higher than usual” daily patient average than in the past two years, said Associate Professor Kenneth Tan, head and senior consultant at SGH’s emergency medicine department.  Patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infections doubled during and after the first two days of Chinese New Year, of which more than 60 per cent were either eligible for the home recovery programme, sent to isolation facilities in the community, or discharged after their visit. The Ministry of Health (MOH) over the weekend urged the public to seek emergency treatment at hospitals only for serious or life-threatening emergencies, amid a rise in the number of such patients. Most of the patients who visited hospital emergency departments in recent weeks did not require emergency care, it added. Hospitals that CNA spoke to urged patients with mild symptoms to visit their nearest clinics instead of jamming up emergency departments.  “Only people with serious or life-threatening emergencies, such as chest pain, breathlessness and uncontrollable bleeding, should visit the hospital’s emergency department as this allows those in need of emergency care to be attended to quickly and helps to preserve the hospital’s capacity for those who truly need acute hospital care,” said Associate Professor Thomas Loh, group chairman of the medical board for the National University Health System (NUHS).  NUHS manages National University Hospital (NUH), Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and Alexandra Hospital.  Emergency department staff that CNA spoke to said waiting times have increased by at least 20 minutes to a few hours for mild cases. In some instances, patients have had to wait as long as 20 hours to get a placement in a ward. Among hospitals tracked by the Ministry of Health (MOH), latest figures show that daily bed occupancy rates ranged from 61.5 per cent to 100 per cent between Jan 23 and 29. “It’s just chaos, with all the patients just waiting there and hospital staff members having to run around to check on everybody, while trying to keep up with the incoming patients,” said Ada (not her real name), a doctor who works at an accident and emergency (A&E) department in a public hospital. With space filled up inside the A&E department, it is also common to see a large pool of people waiting outside to get updates on their family members. “It’s very overwhelming,” said Jessica. “Whenever I go out ... everyone is looking at me and asking if their family member is my patient and whether I have updates for them,” she added. The growing strain on hospital emergency rooms comes as community infection rates continue to rise amid the Omicron wave. Singapore reported 10,686 new community COVID-19 cases on Thursday, the third day in a row that daily cases came in above the 10,000 mark. The weekly infection growth rate jumped to 2.26, up from 2.0 on Wednesday. A total of 1,212 COVID-19 patients are currently in hospital. A&E doctors CNA spoke to said they have seen the number of COVID-19 walk-ins at their hospitals more than double, some of whom have mild or no symptoms. “They are only coming in because they tested positive on their antigen rapid test (ART) self-test, or they might have something very minor like a runny nose or slight fever,” said Ada (not her real name), a doctor working at a public hospital.  Under current health protocols, those who are well but test positive for COVID-19 are required to isolate at home for at least 72 hours, and can exit isolation once they test negative on their self-administered test and are feeling well. As for those who are not feeling well and require COVID-19 testing, they can visit Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPC) for further assessment. However, with many general practitioner (GP) clinics closed during the Chinese New Year period, hospitals said this might have resulted in more people turning to emergency departments. ""Generally, after long public holidays such as Chinese New Year, our hospital tends to experience a higher number of admissions,"" said a spokesperson for Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).  With reduced GP operations and people seeking medical attention only after the festivities, coupled with the surge in COVID-19 transmission, the hospital is seeing more patients at its emergency department.  ""This is a trend seen annually,"" the spokesperson added.  To cope with the surge in cases, some hospitals have set up additional waiting areas at their emergency departments or hired extra manpower. At SGH, locums have been hired to augment the manpower at its emergency department. This is to ensure that there is no compromise to patient care, said SGH’s Assoc Prof Tan.  Meanwhile, NUH’s children’s emergency department and the NUHS hospitals have redeployed staff and increased manpower to support their emergency departments.  The hospitals are also referring stable patients to home recovery or community sites like COVID-19 treatment facilities where appropriate.  NUHS has set aside existing beds that can potentially be converted to isolation beds for COVID-19 cases, as well as more holding facilities for suspected cases waiting for their results, said Assoc Prof Loh.  “There are also dedicated facilities and manpower to support the care of COVID-19 patients. We are also offering alternative arrangements where clinically appropriate, including teleconsultation, tele-rehabilitation, tele-monitoring, remote prescribing, and delivery of medication,” he added.  At NUH's children emergency department, the team is also taking on extra shifts to augment shortfalls where needed, said Professor Lee Yung Seng, head of the Khoo Teck Puat - National University Children's Medical Institute.  John (not his real name), a doctor in the children’s emergency department in a public hospital, said most emergency departments in Singapore have set up a temporary tentage area because there is no capacity for the additional patients within the building.  “Everything inside there looks very rudimentary. The laptops are temporary, the fax machine is temporary. And then now we’re seeing a huge number of patients in this area, it just looks very… not something you’d expect in a country like this,” he said. “This surge should’ve been seen coming. The resource allocation has been dismal."" Rachel (not her real name), a nurse at a public hospital, said all the rooms in the emergency department where she works at are always occupied and manpower is stretched. To cope with the inflow, the hospital set up an open area for mild and suspected COVID-19 cases. She said that when it was first set up, there was just one nurse manning the area with about 30 patients. Now there are about three healthcare workers manning the area, which can hold up to 50 patients. “It’s not an ideal ratio, it’s very stretched. My other colleagues from other areas will come and help but ultimately if they have their own patients in their area they still have to go back,” she said. She also said that she has seen more doctors and nurses test positive for COVID-19 themselves, leading to a further shortage in staff. “Quite a few of my colleagues tested ART positive. If they’re ART positive, they also have to be quarantined at home or in the isolation facilities. Because of that, we have quite a number of staff down,” she said.  Hospital protocols have also been in a constant state of flux, leading to confusion among healthcare workers themselves, said John.  “I lose track also. We just wait for our department’s bulletins on the official workflow and just follow that on a day-to-day basis,” he said.  Despite climbing infections, Jessica noted that the proportion of COVID-19 patients developing severe illness at her hospital appears to be lower than what was observed during the height of the Delta wave in October last year. When CNA interviewed her last year, Jessica - who works in the COVID-19 ward at her hospital - had described being pushed to her limits, with the situation so bad that she had to work for three weeks straight with no breaks. “If you compare the Delta wave to the Omicron wave, it’s slightly better because the proportion of patients who become so ill that they need ICU care is (lower),” she said. “It's an important distinction because you can have some severe symptoms, but you're well enough to be the general ward.” “The concern is always ICU capacity. It’s a problem (if it gets too full) because that requires very specialised care, and not every doctor or nurse can do ICU,” she said. “When it becomes too full, you have to get other doctors and nurses to come in, and that's when the standard of healthcare really starts to drop and people may die.” More than two years into the pandemic, the current wave of infections is adding to the strains on healthcare workers, who are already exhausted and burnt out, they said.  “We've seen huge loss in nursing manpower and I can see my colleagues are struggling because (nurses) now have to take care of 12 patients each, which is double of what they used to handle,” said Jessica. “They have to wear full personal protective equipment while doing a lot of physical tasks like walking patients to the bathroom or feeding them, so you can imagine how hard it is to do that for so many patients, ” she said. “Sometimes the nurses may not have time to change a patient’s diaper or help them go to the toilet because they are busy with another person, and that’s when they are accused of providing poor care and get harassed or shouted at by the patient.” The constant stream of COVID-19 patients also means fewer opportunities for doctors like John to see other kinds of patients who come to the emergency department, compromising on their training. “This adds to the whole feeling that we’re burnt out. There’s also a lot of talk about everyone just saying they want to quit, because the opportunities outside are so much better,” he said, adding that many of his colleagues have already left the hospital.  His sentiments were echoed by other doctors CNA spoke to, who shared experiences such as working up to 13 hours with no toilet breaks or having only a few minutes to grab something to eat. “I’ve been on the frontline for nearly two years, so I’ve gained a lot of experience and feel more confident in managing the medical aspect of it now,” said Jessica. “But that doesn't take away the physical nature of a job and how fatigued you can get.” "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/braces-adults-invisalign-clear-aligners-metal-braces-2469791,"Why I’m wearing metal braces for the second time, even though invisible braces are a trend","I was 15 years old when I first wore metal braces. I was in secondary school and thought it looked “cool” as the braces came with coloured bands you could match to your uniform (don’t judge).  But the cool factor was secondary. I had an overbite, where the upper front teeth overlap or cover part of the lower front teeth, and it was taking a toll on my confidence and self-esteem.  My mum brought me to the dental clinic whereupon my dentist extracted four teeth before starting the orthodontic treatment. I spent the next three years of my teenage life making monthly visits to the dentist, correcting my teeth positions, and hoping that one day, I would have a straight set of teeth and a confident smile.  I enjoyed more than a decade of this – until I stopped wearing my retainers (you’re supposed to wear them nightly for the rest of your life) for a good five years. The retainers broke, and I was too lazy to have them remade. As a result of my laziness, both my upper and lower teeth had shifted. My problems were overcrowding and deep bite, where my top front teeth had overlapped the bottom teeth – giving me a slight buck teeth effect that was quite obvious in pictures.  Then came the painful part: Deciding whether to correct my (again) misaligned teeth (for the second time). I wanted my teeth to return to the way they were – and feel confident about myself again. NOT WEARING RETAINERS AND A CHANGE IN FACE STRUCTURE  While not wearing one’s retainers post-teeth alignment is a common reason why teeth shift, the dentists CNA Women spoke to pointed out that our face shape, including facial structure, soft tissues and teeth position, might change as we grow older.  They also said that dental crowding, where your teeth move towards the middle, can happen with age, whether you’ve had orthodontic treatment previously or not. The facial skeleton continues to grow throughout your adult life at a small and almost imperceptible rate, said Dr Tan Kok Liang, the founder and orthodontist at emBRACE Dental Surgery. Your lower front teeth too, tend to crowd with age due to continued jaw growth.  “Such changes may negatively impact the result obtained during earlier orthodontic treatment,” he added.  Dr Lianny Tjoa, a general dental practitioner at Luminous Dental Group, also said that whether you’ve done orthodontic treatment or not, the position of your teeth changes throughout your life.  DECIDING TO WEAR BRACES FOR THE SECOND TIME  It turns out that I wasn't alone in deciding whether it was worth the time, effort and money to get fitted with braces again.  In a 2019 BBC article, one dentist said he had noticed an increase in adults seeking braces over the past decade. “We are getting a lot of adults who are coming through the door for the second time round,” he said. “Maybe social media is playing a big factor in it nowadays and they want to straighten their teeth and have a more perfect smile.” The trend is similar in Singapore. Singapore dental startup Zenyum, which offers invisible braces, told CNA Women that 70 per cent of its patients are women. A wedding engagement is often a trigger, it said, because the bride wants to look her best for the wedding. “Women patients who return for a second course of treatment dislike the appearance of their teeth and/or smile. It would be a conscious effort to give herself a boost in self-esteem and confidence,” said Dr Tan of emBRACE Dental Surgery. “Some relapses, mainly crowding and gaps, can be so severe that it should get a re-treatment,” said Dr Tjoa of Luminous Dental Group. “If the teeth are moderately to severely crowded, braces will help to straighten the teeth which can be easier for cleaning in the long run.”  It tends to be working adults who opt for braces the second time, she added. “I think the people from this age group are more conscious about their teeth as they need to meet more people because of their profession.” Dr Tjoa’s colleague, Dr Reuben How, a dentist at Luminous Dental Group with 15 years of orthodontics experience in Australia and Malaysia, said that some patients may also have different treatment goals the second time. For example, a patient who wants to fix their protruding teeth might even take longer as compared to the original treatment. “More people are also doing it because orthodontic treatments are more accessible now, and the methods of doing so are a little 'gentler' than in the past,” said Dr How, referring to the availability of more aesthetic forms of treatment, such as clear aligners and ceramic braces, which are less visible on your teeth, compared to traditional metal braces. WIDER RANGE OF TEETH ALIGNMENT OPTIONS  Take your time in considering your options to determine the motivating factors behind seeking teeth-alignment treatments, advised Dr How.  “Is it solely to improve aesthetics? Is a compromise possible? Or do I want comprehensive bite correction that might involve more complex procedures to improve both aesthetics and function?” he said.  To help, you can refer to this breakdown of what’s available:  Non-aesthetic options  Aesthetic options  Beyond aesthetics, choosing the most suitable form of orthodontic treatment also depends on your lifestyle and profession, the current complexities of your teeth condition, and your re-treatment objectives. A flight attendant, for example, may choose to wear clear aligners instead of metal braces. Whatever you’re leaning towards, you should speak to a dentist about your options – including projected timeline, estimated cost and treatment plan before reaching a decision. MY DECISION TO WEAR METAL BRACES AGAIN So here I was, a 29-year-old working adult needing a boost of confidence with her teeth and smile again.  After visits to five different orthodontists, including a return visit to the one I went to as a teen, coupled with repeated X-rays and 3D scans, I decided to go back to traditional metal braces. The treatment plan and cost were the best options to correct my teeth condition. I appreciated that my treatment would involve an 18-month programme that came at a fixed cost of S$3,800.  That is not to say I wasn’t tempted to go with invisible braces for their aesthetics and convenience – two of the five dentists I had earlier consulted had told me the Invisalign option would cost me $4,500 and S$5,500 respectively, and possibly up to S$7,000.  I know some may see it as “unprofessional” to be wearing metal braces at work, especially if you are in a sales job or often need to do presentations. Although I was slightly worried about wearing metal braces again, I was surprised that I could look past its minor inconveniences, and eventually, started enjoying the process.  Eight months into my metal braces treatment, I can see some improvement in my crooked lower front teeth, which are gradually straightening out. This means I’m almost ready to move forward to the next stage of treatment, where my dentist might have to shave off one or two teeth to make space for the upper front teeth to shift inwards. Dr Tan’s advice to maintain the results is, of course, to wear your retainers (nightly, forever). “I would recommend re-treatment if the patient wants it and is agreeable to wearing retainers long-term to maintain the result. In the event that the patient does not wear her retainers, then the teeth may become crooked again.” Needless to say, I hope to not have to embark on a third wearing of braces in my life.   CNA Women is a section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-omicron-variant-ong-ye-kung-severe-cases-low-possible-live-2485906,'Possible' to live with Omicron as severe cases remain low despite surge: Ong Ye Kung,"SINGAPORE: It is “possible” to live with the Omicron variant of COVID-19, as the number of cases with severe outcomes remain low despite the surge in cases, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung on Tuesday (Feb 8). Speaking at the Singapore Health Quality Service Awards 2022, Mr Ong thanked healthcare workers for their efforts amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  Adding that the Ministry of Health (MOH) will monitor the trajectory of the transmission wave closely, he noted that “every country will experience and even shape the curve of their transmission wave”.  The wave could rise sharply and come crashing down in a few weeks such as in South Africa and Australia, or it could remain moderately high for slightly longer like in the Netherlands or Denmark, he added.  “We are trying to co-exist with a force of nature, with measures that we have put in place such as restrained social behaviours and vaccinations. No one knows exactly what the impact of these measures will be, what the final trend line will look like, and what is on the other side of Omicron,” said the Health Minister.  “But it is however comforting and encouraging is that among patients infected, the number of cases with severe clinical outcomes remains low despite the sharp surge in cases. This means it is possible to live with Omicron.”  The current Omicron wave is registering daily cases a few times more than that of the Delta wave “as expected”, and the numbers may go up even more, said Mr Ong.  “Fortunately, as we have envisaged as well, it is also a less clinically severe variant compared to the Delta variant.”  At the peak of the Delta wave, Singapore had about 3,200 daily cases with about 170 beds in the intensive care units occupied by COVID-19 patients.  Now, with more than three times the number of daily cases, there are about 20 COVID-19 patients in the ICU, said Mr Ong.  “While our healthcare workers are very busy, stretched, stressed, I think it is a different level of intensity as compared to during the Delta wave.”  However, a large number of daily infection cases is “still a significant threat”, and there are still severe cases that need care, he added.  While hospitals may not be stressed “in the same way” as during the Delta wave, Singapore needs to ensure that there are sufficient paediatric beds because the Omicron variant is more likely to infect children than the Delta variant, said Mr Ong.  Children aged five to 11 currently have the highest infection rate at about 67 per 100,000, followed by those aged 12 to 19, with an infection rate of about 55 per 100,000.  “This is quite different compared to during the Delta variant wave, which mostly infected older and working adults. With more children and young people getting infected, severe cases are inevitable, and we need to ensure that there are sufficient beds for them,” said Mr Ong.  Public and private hospitals are setting up more beds for children, and COVID-19 treatment facilities are also converting more beds for children and their caregivers, he added.  “Fortunately, children admission to hospitals and CTFs due to COVID-19 are often precautionary in nature, with short stays of about two to three days. Notwithstanding, it is important to get them vaccinated to protect them against the risk of severe illness should they get infected.”  Vaccination against COVID-19 and boosters continue to make a “significant difference” to the outcomes of those infected, said Mr Ong.  Of Omicron patients, 0.3 per cent need oxygen supplementation or ICU care, he noted. This figure is 1.8 per cent among seniors aged 60 and above.   However, there was “a big variance” depending on vaccination status. For example, among the elderly, the severity rates for those who were boosted, fully vaccinated, and not fully vaccinated are about 1 per cent, 4 per cent and 10 per cent respectively.  “Hence, a senior above 60 and not fully vaccinated is more than 10 times likely to fall severely sick when infected with Omicron, compared to someone who has received the booster shot.  “That is why vaccination and boosters, especially amongst seniors, continue to be our key priority,” said Mr Ong, noting that more than 60 per cent of Singapore’s population have received their booster shots.  The Government had to increase “front-end” public-facing operational capacities, like call centres and general practitioners because of the larger number of daily cases, said Mr Ong.  “We are expanding our call operating team with manpower from outside of MOH, namely the wider civil service and also the SAF,” he added.  “We have also noticed that a fair number of patients who have mild or no symptoms are still seeing GPs, the GPs have been quite stretched and quite busy. And many of them it's just to get some form of documentation to be excused from work or from school,” said Mr Ong, stressing that this is not necessary.  MOH said earlier this week that employers and schools should accept a positive self-test antigen rapid test result to excuse an individual, and a negative result to allow them to return.  “Ultimately, the most critical success factor in our response to COVID-19 is the trust in our society. Patients’ trust in us is critical, and that is built up over a long time when we consistently give our best to serve them,” said the Health Minister.  ""Our colleagues’ trust in us is critical when we go through a pandemic like that, because everyone goes through it together and persevere together. And that grows only if you continue through the years, work as a cohesive team. “The pandemic has reminded us of the importance of this ethos to serve and work together as a team. We function as one body, even as separate parts, undertaking different roles.” "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/plant-based-diets-meat-dairy-farming-climate-2430121,Commentary: We should eat more plants but countries subsidise meat and dairy farming,"OXFORD: The global food system is in disarray. Animal agriculture is a major driver of global heating, and as many as 12 million deaths from heart disease, stroke, cancers and diabetes are each year connected to eating the wrong things, like too much red and processed meat and too few fruits and vegetables. Unless the world can slash the amount of animal products in its food system and embrace more plant-based diets, there is little chance of avoiding dangerous levels of climate change and mounting public health problems. Agricultural subsidies help prop up a food system that is neither healthy nor sustainable. Worldwide, more than US$200 billion of public money (that is, money collected through taxes) is given to farmers every year in direct transfers, usually with the intention of supporting national food production and supply. This might not be a problem in itself – after all, we all need to eat.  But the way governments provide subsidies at the moment exacerbates the health and environmental issues of food production. That’s one of the findings of a new study published in Nature Communications by my colleague Florian Freund and me. According to our analysis, about two-thirds of all agricultural transfer payments worldwide come without any strings attached. Farmers can use them to grow what they like. In practice, this means every fifth dollar is used to raise meat, and every tenth dollar to make dairy products – the kinds of foods farmers have grown used to producing but which emit disproportionate amounts of greenhouse gas emissions, and which are also linked to dietary risks such as heart disease and certain cancers. Farmers use another third of these payments to grow staple crops such as wheat and maize, and crops used for producing sugar and oil. These are foods that are already produced and consumed in large quantities and that, if anything, should be limited in a healthy and sustainable diet. Less than a quarter of transfer payments are used to grow the kinds of foods that are good for human health and the environment, and which a healthy and sustainable food system would need much more of: Fruits, vegetables, legumes and nuts. Based on this breakdown, it’s clear there is plenty of room for improving how governments and farmers issue and spend agricultural subsidies. We decided to look at alternatives, and compare how they might work in the real world. We combined an economic model which tracked the knock-on effects of altering subsidies on food production and the food people eat with an environmental one which compared changes in resource use and greenhouse gas emissions – plus a health model which measured the consequences for diet-related illnesses. In one scenario, we made all subsidy payments to farms conditional on them producing healthy and sustainable foods. Farmers would still be free to grow other crops and foods, just not with the support of subsidies. We found that fruit and vegetable production would go up substantially – by about 20 per cent in developed countries. This would translate into people eating half a portion of fruit and vegetables more per day. At the same time, meat and dairy production would go down by 2 per cent – shaving off 2 per cent from agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. However, we also found that the economy could suffer if all subsidies were used in this way, drawing in workers to farming from more productive parts of the economy. Fortunately, there are ways to avoid this. Either make half of all subsidies conditional on growing healthy and sustainable foods, or combine these conditional subsidies with a reduction in the overall amount of payments – tying them, for example, to an amount informed by a country’s gross domestic product or population. Each of those options would result in a healthier food supply and less greenhouse gas emissions without reducing economic output. Policymakers in the European Union are currently aiming to reduce the environmental impacts of subsidy payments while those in the United Kingdom are considering a public money for public goods approach, which pays farmers to provide things like clean water, wildlife habitat and a nutritious food supply. Sadly, proposals of this kind are often watered down when they’re implemented. Our analysis proposes something which is largely missing from current plans: Changing the mix of food production. What food farms choose to grow has a greater effect on the environment and health than how it is grown. Directing subsidies towards the production of healthy and sustainable food should be an essential part of reforming agriculture worldwide.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/how-exercise-mindfully-breathing-mental-health-2473906,How to exercise mindfully: Simple meditation tips to enhance your workout routine,"It was a windy summer day in southeastern Tasmania, and Heather Larsen, a professional slackliner, was standing on an inch-wide stretch of nylon suspended between two of the tallest sea cliffs in the Southern Hemisphere. Nearly 1,000 feet below, seals barked and waves pounded the rocks. Ms Larsen was secured to the line with a harness and a leash, but the wind gusts and sheer height terrified her as she walked across. So she concentrated on her breath. Arms above her head, knees bent slightly to absorb the line’s vibration, she breathed in as she took one step, and out as she took the next. “Be here,” she thought to herself as she placed her foot down. “Now be here.” Ms Larsen, who is 35, uses this kind of breathing and mantra as a form of meditation to keep herself focused while balancing on a bouncy strip of webbing. “It helps me stay only in that moment,” she said, and prevents distractions, like from previous shaky steps or changes in the tension of the line ahead. While meditation has been shown to have many benefits, including increased focus, reduced stress and a mind cleared of distractions, it can be a struggle to find time for it in a busy day. But some coaches, doctors and athletes say it can be incorporated into your exercise routine, enriching your workout in the process. With a clear, focused mind, you’re better able to make quick decisions in a pick-up basketball game or react to a set in beach volleyball. And experts say that meditation’s emphasis on the breath and the body shifts the focus from the outcome — whether it’s winning a race, increasing your mile time or weight loss — to movement for movement’s sake, which makes it more enjoyable. Most often, this meditation takes the form of mindfulness, which Sara Lazar, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, called “paying attention to the present moment in an open, curious and nonjudgmental way.” Her research has shown that as little as eight weeks of mindfulness meditation, including movement-based forms like yoga, produced beneficial structural changes in the brain, especially in brain regions associated with mind wandering and stress. She said incorporating mindfulness into your movements is straightforward and can bring about some unexpected rewards. FIRST, BREATHE Before a sports game or an activity that requires focus, a few minutes of intentional breathing can prepare you mentally, said George Mumford, a performance expert and author of The Mindful Athlete: Secrets To Pure Performance, who led regular meditation sessions with the Chicago Bulls and the Los Angeles Lakers. And during the activity, deep breathing can get you out of your head and quiet what he calls “the monkey brain"", a mind filled with emotions and thoughts. “You’re frenetic, you’re scattered. You’re all over the place, so you’re no place,” he said. Dr Chiti Parikh, who runs the Integrative Health and Wellbeing Program at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, teaches her patients how to breathe deeply in a way that engages the diaphragm, the body’s largest breathing muscle, which separates the chest cavity from the abdomen. Studies show that deep breathing can activate bodily functions associated with calm and relaxation, and quiet stress responses. Also, she said, people have a tendency to take shallow breaths during exercise rather than lung-filling breaths from the diaphragm. To train yourself to breathe this way, Dr Parikh said, lie on your back, relax your muscles and place one hand on the chest and the other on the belly. Take long, slow breaths in and out through your nose, and watch your hands as they move. Breathe in for four seconds, then out for six. Over time, lengthen your exhales. Notice how, with shallow breaths, the chest moves, but with deep breathing, the belly moves too. Once you are able to breathe deeply, you can incorporate it into any activity: Swimming, scuba diving, or shoveling snow off the driveway. FOCUS ON THE BODY Focusing on the sensations in your body while it moves — for example, mentally scanning body parts and thinking about muscle groups that are engaged — can also bring peace to a wandering mind, said Kalpanatit Broderick, who runs a fitness studio in Seattle that combines strength and cardiovascular training with mindfulness meditation. “If I pay attention to my body while doing a push-up, I can feel my shoulders, my chest, my triceps, my quads,” said Mr Broderick, who was once a nationally ranked distance runner. Or during a run, he said, think about how the arms are swinging, if the shoulders are relaxed, if you’re striking the ground with your heels or toes. This forces you to be engaged in the movement rather than fixated on the outcome, he said. “The current fitness paradigm is so result-based,” he said. Working out with meditation, he added, slows down the mind, connects you to the body “and then we get to enjoy what’s around us.” Dr Lazar suggested using a meditation app, some of which have meditations specifically designed for walking or other kinds of movement. Many are free; others require monthly payments. SET AN INTENTION Two years ago, Imani Cheers began a daily ritual of meditative running, walking, yoga and cycling to combat the stress of working a busy job as a single mom during the pandemic. A fundamental part of her meditation is setting an intention for each day that she says aloud to herself while exercising. “Don’t repeat poor habits and expect a different result,” for example, or “finish this half-marathon without getting injured.” Her routine has affected more than just her workout, said Dr. Cheers, who is a provost for undergraduate education at the George Washington University. “At 41, I’m healthier, happier and stronger than I’ve ever been. And who says that after a pandemic?” THE GOAL: FINDING FLOW Bringing meditation into movement may have another benefit: Achieving the state of “flow"". The psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, who first coined the term flow, defined it in his book, Flow:The Psychology of Optimal Experience as “a state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter"". Anyone who exercises or plays sports, whether professional or amateur, has likely experienced some version of a flow state. On the basketball court, Mr Mumford said, the basket gets bigger and time slows down. Dr Csikszentmihalyi’s definition of flow looks a lot like the benefits gained from meditative movement:inner clarity, intense focus and a sense of serenity. And while meditating before or during exercise can’t guarantee flow, it can establish the conditions for attaining it. “You’re not trying to make things happen, you’re allowing them to happen,” Mr Mumford said. Ms Larsen, the slackliner, agrees. She is best known for her stomach-dropping tricks, such as splits, handstands and hanging upside down from her ankles, all executed impossibly high in the air. One of her favorite slacklines near her home in southern Utah stretches across a slot canyon overlooking swirling sandstone and cottonwood trees. There, Ms Larsen can easily access the flow state because she’s become better, through meditation, at shoving aside the distractions, the ego and the focus on outcome. And that’s the goal with meditative movement, she said: “The effort goes away and it just is. It feels good, and it feels easy.” By Jenny Marder © 2022 The New York Times.   This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/what-resilience-how-build-expert-tips-pandemic-new-normal-2471811,What is resilience and how do you build it? 7 tips for a post-pandemic world,"Many people I know are waiting, patiently or otherwise, for life to return to normal. We are eager for the day when we can again live without fear of a deadly virus that lurks like a stalker, disrupting social and cultural events, travel, education and life’s milestones that once missed, can never be retrieved. And many people remain crippled by despair over the death of loved ones, as well as lost jobs, businesses, housing, income and even sleep. How, so many of us wonder, are we supposed to cope with so many obstacles blocking our way forward? One way is to call upon an age-old characteristic that enables us to weather adversity: Resilience. Resilience is the ability to roll with the punches, “because if you’re brittle, you’ll break"", said Pauline Boss, professor emeritus at the University of Minnesota and author of the recently published book, The Myth Of Closure. Dr Boss, a family therapist, educator and researcher, is best known for her pioneering work on “ambiguous loss"", which is also the title of her 1999 book depicting unresolved, and often unresolvable, physical or emotional losses. “When the pandemic subsides, things will not go back to ‘normal’,” said Dr Boss, who at 87 has lived through multiple upheavals, starting with World War II. With all that has happened during the pandemic, she wrote: “We can’t expect to go back to the normal we had.” In an interview, she told me: “Normal implies status quo, but things are always changing, and if you don’t change, you don’t grow. We will never be the same again. The pandemic is epic, a power greater than us, and we have to be flexible, resilient enough to bend in order to survive. And we will survive, but our lives will be forever changed.” Resilience allows us to adapt to stress and maintain one’s equilibrium when faced with adversity. “When resilient people are confronted with a crisis that takes away their ability to control their lives, they find something they can control,” Dr Boss said. “At the start of the pandemic, many people turned to baking bread, home cooking and cleaning out drawers as something they could control. These were functional coping mechanisms.” However, she added, if people are unable to adapt when faced with a problem they can’t solve, “they often turn to absolute solutions that are dysfunctional, and make statements like ‘The pandemic is a hoax’ and ‘There’s no such thing as this virus'"". Although resilience is often viewed as an inherent personality trait that people either have or lack, studies have shown it is a characteristic that can be acquired. People can adopt behaviours, thoughts and actions that help to build resilience, at any age. Dr Boss reassured parents that their children will be all right, despite pandemic-related academic and social disruptions. “Children are naturally resilient, and they will be stronger for having survived this bad thing that happened to them. They’ll bounce back and grow from it.” More than children, “we need to focus on adults"", she said. “This generation of parents has faced no world war, no global threat” of this scale. Many parents are struggling, though she worries that some may be over-shielding their children, which can erode their natural ability to solve problems and cope with adversity. Dr Boss’ sentiments brought to mind the concerns my husband and I had in 1980, when our 10-year-old twin sons were facing enrollment in a public middle school where rampant misbehavior and physical threats were common. The boys declined our offer to send them to private school for those tumultuous three years, saying: “What would we learn about life in private school?” MOVING FORWARD In her new book, Dr Boss offers guidelines for increasing one’s resilience to overcome adversity and live well despite painful losses. She quotes Dr Viktor E Frankl, an Austrian neurologist, psychiatrist, author and Holocaust survivor, who wrote: “When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.” She recommends that people use each guideline as needed, in no particular order, depending on the circumstances. FIND MEANING The most challenging guideline for many people is to find meaning, to make sense of a loss, and when this is not possible to take some kind of action. Perhaps seek justice, work for a cause or demonstrate to try to right a wrong. When Dr Boss’s little brother died from polio, her heartbroken family went door to door for the March of Dimes, raising money to fund research for a vaccine. ADJUST YOUR SENSE OF MASTERY Instead of trying to control the pain of loss, let the sorrow flow, carry on as best as you can and eventually the ups and downs will come less and less often. “We do not have power to destroy the virus, but we do have the power to lessen its impact on us,” she wrote. REBUILD IDENTITY Also helpful is to adopt a new identity in sync with your current circumstances. When Dr. Boss’s husband became terminally ill, for example, her identity shifted over time from being a wife to being a caregiver, and after his death in 2020, gradually trying to think of herself as a widow. NORMALISE AMBIVALENCE  When you lack clarity about a loss, it’s normal to feel ambivalent about how to act. But Dr Boss says it’s best not to wait for clarity; hesitation can lead to inaction and puts life on hold. Better to make less-than-perfect decisions than to do nothing. REVISE ATTACHMENT Dr Boss emphasises that rather than trying to sever your attachment to a lost loved one, the goal should be to keep them present in your heart and mind and gradually rebuild your life in a new way, with a new sense of purpose, new friends or a new project. Accept the reality of the loss and slowly revise your attachment to the person who died. But, she says, “there is no need to seek closure, even if other relationships develop"". DISCOVER NEW HOPE Begin to hope for something new that enables you to move ahead with your life in a new way. Stop waiting, take action and seek new connections that can minimise isolation and foster support that in turn nurtures your resilience. Perhaps Dr Boss’s most valuable advice when faced with pandemic losses: “What we need to hope for is not to go back to what we had, but to see what we can create now and in the future.” She suggests brainstorming with others and being willing to try new things. “Hope for something new and purposeful that will sustain you and give you joy for the rest of your life.” By Jane E Brody © 2022 The New York Times.   This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/walking-10-minutes-day-longer-life-study-2464711,"Walking just 10 minutes a day may lead to a longer life, new study finds","If almost all of us started walking for an extra 10 minutes a day, we could, collectively, prevent more than 111,000 deaths every year, according to an enlightening new study of movement and mortality. Published this week in JAMA Internal Medicine, the study used data about physical activity and death rates for thousands of American adults to estimate how many deaths every year might be averted if everyone exercised more. The results indicate that even a little extra physical activity by each of us could potentially stave off hundreds of thousands of premature deaths over the coming years. Already, science offers plenty of evidence that how much we exercise influences how long we live. In a telling 2019 study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 8 per cent of all deaths in the United States were attributed to “inadequate levels of activity"". A British study from 2015 likewise found that men and women who exercised for at least 150 minutes per week — the standard recommendation in Britain, Europe and the United States — reduced their risk of premature death by at least 25 per cent compared to people who exercised less. More dramatically, a 2020 examination of the lifestyles and death risks of about 44,000 adults in the United States and Europe concluded that the most sedentary men and women in the study, who sat almost all day, were as much as 260 percent more likely to die prematurely as the most highly active people studied, who exercised for at least 30 minutes most days. But much of this past research relied on people’s often unreliable memories of their exercise and sitting habits. In addition, many of the studies that delved into the broader, population-level impacts of exercise on longevity tended to use formal exercise guidelines as their goal. In those studies, researchers modeled what would happen if everyone started working out for at least 150 minutes a week, an ambitious and perhaps unachievable goal for the many people who previously have exercised rarely, if at all. Using those results, they began creating a series of statistical what-ifs. Suppose, the researchers asked, everyone who was capable of exercising began exercising moderately, such as by walking briskly, for an extra 10 minutes per day, on top of how much or little they currently worked out? How many deaths might not happen? The researchers made adjustments to account statistically for those people who were too frail or otherwise unable to walk or easily move around. They also considered age, education, smoking status, diet, body mass index and other health factors in their calculations. In the new study, researchers at the National Cancer Institute and the CDC decided instead to explore what might happen to death rates if people started moving around more, even if they did not necessarily meet the formal exercise guidelines. But, first, the researchers needed to establish a baseline of how many deaths might be related to too-little movement. So, they began gathering data from the ongoing National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, or NHANES, which periodically asks a representative sample of the population about their lives and health. It also provides some of them with activity trackers, to objectively measure how much they move. The researchers now pulled information from 4,840 participants of different ethnicities, male and female, who ranged in age from 40 to 85. All had joined the survey between 2003 and 2006 and worn an activity monitor for a week. Based on that data, the researchers grouped people according to how many minutes they walked or otherwise moved most days. They also checked people’s names against a national death registry to establish mortality risks for the various activity levels. Then, the researchers ran the same statistical scenario with everyone working out for an extra 20 minutes a day and, finally, for an extra 30 minutes a day and checked the mortality outcomes. Quite a few people would live longer in any of those scenarios, they found. According to the modeling, if every capable adult walked briskly or otherwise exercised for an additional 10 minutes a day, 111,174 deaths annually across the country — or about 7 per cent of all deaths in a typical year — might be avoided. When they doubled the imagined exercise time to an extra 20 minutes a day, the number of potentially averted deaths rose to 209,459. Tripling the exercise to 30 extra minutes a day averted 272,297 deaths, or almost 17 per cent of typical annual totals. (The data was gathered before the pandemic, which has skewed mortality numbers.) Those figures might seem abstract, but, in practice, those hundreds of thousands of deaths forestalled could turn out to be deeply personal. They could mean avoiding the early death of a spouse, parent, friend, grown child, co-worker or, of course, us, said Pedro Saint-Maurice, an epidemiologist at the National Cancer Institute, who led the new study. “There is a message in this data for public health entities” about the importance of promoting physical activity to reduce premature deaths, he said. And the message applies equally to each of us. So get up and walk or engage in some kind of moderate physical activity for an extra 10 minutes today. Invite your friends, colleagues and aging parents to do the same. “In this context, a little additional physical activity can have a huge impact,” Dr Saint-Maurice said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/menopause-disruptive-women-symptoms-hot-flashes-workplace-2467316,'An economic problem': How menopause disrupts women's lives – and their livelihoods,"Menopause — and the years leading up to it — can disrupt women’s lives in so many ways, including, new findings suggest, by upending their livelihoods. A British survey of 2,000 women between the ages of 45 and 67 reported last week that one in four women experiencing symptoms of menopause were unhappy in their jobs because of a lack of support, and that nearly one in five were considering quitting because of it. These concerns are probably shared by women around the globe. Each year, an estimated 1.3 million US women, typically those in their early 50s, enter menopause — meaning that they have not had a menstrual period for at least 12 months. Millions more each year begin perimenopause, the period before menopause when a woman’s body begins producing less estrogen. It is during perimenopause — which can last for four to eight years — that many women experience potentially debilitating symptoms, such as changes to their menstrual cycle, hot flashes, sleep problems, migraines and mood swings, which are driven by hormonal changes and can make women’s lives in the workplace more challenging. “It’s definitely very hard to work with symptoms,” said Dr Wen Shen, a gynaecologist and the co-director of the Women’s Wellness and Healthy Aging Program at Johns Hopkins Medicine. The implications are dire, she added, considering that there are over 60 million women over the age of 50 in the United States, according to the US Census Bureau. Other research backs up the new survey findings. In a study that has not yet been published, Dr Stephanie Faubion, director of the Women’s Health Clinic at the Mayo Clinic, surveyed more than 5,000 women between the ages of 45 and 60 who receive primary care from the Mayo Clinic. “We were shocked by the number of women that said they reduced their hours because of menopause symptoms or were missing workdays because of menopause symptoms,” she said. “Think about the women’s lost wages. Think about the companies’ lost profits. This is an economic problem.” Experts and women who have had menopause or perimenopause symptoms clash with their work duties shared workarounds and potential job accommodations that may help women stay in the work force while experiencing these common changes. WHAT MENOPAUSE LOOKS AND FEELS LIKE As the coronavirus pandemic has endured, many women have said that they prefer to maintain some of the workplace flexibility that came with it, such as remote work, for reasons related to parenting, health and productivity. It makes sense that women who are having menopausal symptoms in particular would consider leaving their jobs if they’re now required to resume working in-person, Dr. Shen said. “When you’re home, nobody sees that you’ve got three fans pointing at you while you’re on Zoom or that you have shorts on under the desk,” she said. In the workplace, on the other hand, women have to come up with creative solutions: Laura Lindberg, a scientist who works for a nonprofit institute, said she used to stick her head in the company freezer when she had hot flashes. “How sad was I when they switched to a fridge with a bottom freezer — didn’t work the same,” she said. At home, women also have more time and space to compose themselves after experiencing something emotionally triggering. Mood-related issues — which affect about 40 per cent of women in perimenopause — can pose problems at work. “I’ll have patients tell me, ‘It’s really impacting not only my personal relationships, but my professional career, too, because I am responding in a way that I would not have before, and it’s not appropriate,’” said Dr Monica Christmas, the director of the Center for Women’s Integrated Health at UChicago Medicine. Menopause can also affect women’s sleep, and the ensuing exhaustion can lead to mood swings, too. Symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats can drastically reduce how much sleep women get at night, with sleep loss affecting an estimated 40 to 60 per cent of menopausal women. “Patients are just totally fatigued,” Dr Shen said, “by not having gotten a full night of sleep for months, if not years.” Jeannine Ouellette, 53, a writer from Minneapolis who is in perimenopause, is grateful that she gets to work from home most of the time because she often sleeps poorly at night and benefits from short cat naps during the day. “If I just close my eyes for 10 minutes, I can come back to that task and get it done three times faster than trying to struggle through it on a sleepless brain,” she said. Another major problem is that menstrual cycles change in perimenopause, so women don’t always know when they will start bleeding, Ms. Ouellette said. “To have that, combined with potentially very heavy bleeding, is very stressful in a professional environment,” she said. “That feeling that every woman knows — that gush — you’re like, oh my God, how am I even going to get out of this room?” HOW EMPLOYERS CAN HELP Nicola Green, a consultant in Britain who advises employers on how to support workers going through menopause, recommends that workplaces provide free menstrual products in their bathrooms and access to cold drinking water. If workers are required to wear uniforms, employers should have extra uniforms available so that people can change if necessary. She also advises workplaces to allow employees to work from home, or have flexible hours, when they are experiencing menopause symptoms. People who “are completely sleep deprived, or may be suffering from the most horrendous periods that make them really struggle to leave the house, they can manage that so much better by working at home"", she said. When workers aren’t given these accommodations, she added, they may instead call in sick. Fran Poodry, 51, who works in customer service at an educational technology company in Portland, Oregon, recalled a time several years ago when she woke up and couldn’t stop crying. “I explained to my supervisor that it was perimenopause since I was not sad or upset,” she said. “I just was helpless to turn off the tears and snot due to hormones,.” She told her supervisor that she might need to come into work late or work from home when symptoms were bad, and he told her that was fine. “I really am very lucky that my workplace is so accommodating,” she said. “Nowadays, with Zoom, I can attend a meeting from home if I needed. Or I can work from home entirely.” Ultimately, employers should educate themselves about menopause and communicate that they want to be supportive to staff going through life transitions or other health issues, experts said. “A more flexible schedule allows room for the employee to work when they’re most attentive and productive, which benefits both the employee and employer,” said Emily Klover, an organizational psychologist in Sacramento. “It really does work well for all.” HOW WOMEN CAN FIND RELIEF Dr Faubion, from the Mayo Clinic, said that one of the biggest tragedies of menopause was that many women — and even many doctors — didn’t realise that there are lifestyle changes and treatments that can ease their symptoms. During perimenopause, for instance, a low-dose birth control pill can control bleeding issues and ease hot flashes and night sweats, she said. Simple dietary changes — like avoiding alcohol and caffeine — can also reduce hot flashes in some women, Dr Faubion noted, while cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness meditation have been shown to make hot flashes more tolerable and improve sleep quality. Women who don’t get relief through lifestyle changes might want to consult a qualified menopause practitioner, Dr Shen said. Prescription medications also could help, such as antidepressants for mood issues and antiseizure medications, such as gabapentin, for hot flashes. After menopause, low-dose hormone replacement therapy helps many women, too, Dr Faubion said. Although the therapy can increase cancer risk, the risks are minimal among women under 60, she added. “For the majority of women who are under the age of 60 and within 10 years of their last menstrual cycle, the benefits outweigh the risks,” she said. Thankfully, women today may be more comfortable than women in past generations talking to their doctors about symptoms and asking their employers for accommodations, Dr Faubion said. Women who are menopausal now “want to talk about it"", she said. “They’re not going to shove it in the closet.” By Melinda Wenner Moyer © 2022 The New York Times.   This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/german-researchers-breed-pigs-human-heart-transplants-2477156,German researchers to breed pigs for human heart transplants,"MUNICH: German scientists plan to clone and then breed this year genetically modified pigs to serve as heart donors for humans, based on a simpler version of a US-engineered animal used last month in the world's first pig-to-human transplant. Eckhard Wolf, a scientist at Ludwig-Maximilians University (LMU) in Munich, said his team aimed to have the new species, modified from the Auckland island breed, ready for transplant trials by 2025. In the first surgery of its kind, a team at the University of Maryland Medicine last month transplanted a heart from a pig with ten modifications into a terminally ill man. His doctors say he is responding well though risks of infection, organ rejection or high blood pressure remain. ""Our concept is to proceed with a simpler model, namely with five genetic modifications,"" said Wolf, whose work has triggered a heated debate in a country with one of Europe's lowest organ donation rates and a strong animal rights movement. Wolf, who has been researching animal-to human-transplants - known as xenotransplants - for 20 years, said his team would use still inefficient cloning technology to generate only ""the founder animals"", from which future genetically identical generations would be bred. The first such generation should be born this year, and their hearts would be tested in baboons before the team sought approval for a human clinical trial in two or three years' time, Wolf said. Transplants are used for people diagnosed with organ failure who have no other treatment options, a waiting list that numbered around 8,500 people in Germany at the end of 2021, according to data from the country's Organ Transplantation Foundation. Wolf's supporters say animal donors could help shorten that list, but opponents say the technology rides roughshod over the rights of animals, effectively degrading pigs to the status of organ factories while the monkeys used in transplant experiments die in agony. In February 2019, a petition by German pressure group Doctors Against Animal Experiments demanding a ban on xenotransplantation research collected over 57,000 signatures. Kristina Berchtold, a spokesperson for the Munich branch of Germany's Animal Welfare Association, called the practice ""ethically very questionable"". ""Animals should not serve as spare parts for humans,"" she said. ""... A pet, a so-called farm animal, a clone or a naturally born animal all have the same needs, fears and also rights."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/nose-cancer-symptoms-singapore-stage-1-2456026,Have a persistently blocked nose or trouble hearing? These could be signs of nose cancer,"If you have been following the news, you’d have read about Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Transport Baey Yam Keng’s nose cancer diagnosis in early January. Back in 2018, Malaysian badminton player Lee Chong Wei also had to deal with early-stage nose cancer.  What exactly is it and what are the symptoms? Nose cancer – or nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) – affects the nasopharynx, which is the upper part of the pharynx (throat) behind the nose.  “The cancer typically arises from a groove known as the fossa of Rosenmuller, situated at the side of the nasopharynx,” said Dr Lim Keng Hua, an otorhinolaryngologist and ENT specialist at Ear Nose Throat, Head & Neck Surgery at Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre.  While Baey and Lee did not reveal what symptoms they experienced, NPC could start off as a persistently blocked nose. Blowing into a tissue doesn’t help to unblock it and if the patient has been living with it for a few months (and gotten used to breathing through the mouth), he’d have dismissed it as just a “sinus” problem.  But there may be more accompanying signs. The patient might also detect a painless lump on the side of the neck as well as other symptoms such as a blocked ear, blood-stained saliva or phlegm, nose bleeds, frequent headaches or earaches, change in hearing (such as a sudden loss of hearing or ringing in the ear), and/or even double vision.  YOUR GENES AND GENDER MATTER Baey, a Member of Parliament, is 52 years old, while the three-time Olympic silver medallist was 36 when he was diagnosed. Although we aren’t privy to the details of their lifestyle, both men appear to be healthy and in good shape. So, why did they get it? And are men more prone to NPC? Certain genetic risk factors are strongly associated with nose cancer, said Associate Professor Melvin Chua Lee Kiang, who is the head and senior consultant at the National Cancer Centre Singapore’s (NCCS) Department of Head & Neck and Thoracic, Division of Radiation Oncology. However, these mutations do not explain why men are more at risk, he added.  Women may be protected from NPC due to their higher oestrogen levels, said Dr Lim, echoing a hypothesis held by some experts. “Others suggest that it could be due to smoking since the habit is more prevalent among men. However, there is no conclusive evidence.” In general, males are two to three times more likely to develop NPC than females, according to Assoc Prof Chua. Other than having a family history of NPC, another genetic factor is ancestry. “The majority of NPC patients have ancestries that are traced to the Southern Chinese provinces,” said Assoc Prof Chua. “More than 70 per cent of cases occur in East and Southeast Asia. Hence, for Singaporeans, dialect groups that emigrated from the Cantonese, Teochew, Hokkien and Hainanese regions have a higher incidence of NPC.” NOT JUST OLD UNCLES Baey and Lee aren’t unusual in their age profiles either. Citing the latest Singapore Cancer Registry Annual Report 2018, Assoc Prof Chua highlighted that most of the cases diagnosed between 2014 and 2018 were Chinese males in their 30s to 50s.  “NPC ranks as the third-most common cancer among the 30-to-39-year-old age group, and the second-most common cancer among the 40-to-49-year-old age group. This observation has remained constant over the years,” said Assoc Prof Chua.  According to the five-year report, about 240 patients were diagnosed with NPC in Singapore each year. As comparison, the top cancer among men during the same period was colorectal cancer. It recorded an incidence rate of 6,129, which averages out to about 1,532 cases per year. NPC's annual average number of cases may still seem significant but it is actually a downtrend from previous data, said Dr Donovan Eu, a consultant with National University Cancer Institute, Singapore’s Division of Surgical Oncology (Head and Neck Surgery). “In this most updated report, the incidence of NPC has actually been excluded from the top 10 cancers in men,” he said. Commented Assoc Prof Chua on the same report: “Such an epidemiological trend is interesting as it would suggest that different risk factors are at play in causing NPC in the young versus that in the elderly. The causes underlying the overall declining trend in NPC is unknown, but it could be healthier eating habits, decline in smoking numbers and economic development”. CUT DOWN THE SALT Back to the abovementioned Chinese dialect groups that are more prone to NPC. These communities are also more likely to include salted fish and vegetables in their diet – which could explain their high risk of developing the cancer.  Said Dr Lim, citing a 2017 study in the Chinese Journal Of Cancer: “Those who consumed salted meat or vegetables at least once a week was found to have a four-time increased risk of developing NPC compared to those who never or rarely consumed salted food”. “Salted and preserved foods are high in nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic compounds linked to NPC,” explained Assoc Prof Chua. This link between a high intake of salted food and NPC is also observed anecdotally, he added.  Historically, mothers would flavour porridge with salted fish before feeding it to their babies and children. Since this is now an uncommon practice, he said that it might, in some ways, account for the declining NPC rates.  VIRAL CONNECTIONS Being exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a factor. In fact, Dr Lim noted that “two new variants of EBV were discovered by Singaporean scientists to have a high risk of developing NPC. Individuals infected by this unique EBV strain have 11 times higher risk for developing NPC than non-carriers”.  “An EBV infection is probably the strongest risk factor associated with NPC that occurs in this part of the world,” concurred Assoc Prof Chua, who added that the human papilloma virus (the virus responsible for cervical cancer) is also linked to a less common subtype of NPC.  WHAT ABOUT SMOKING? The most immediate connect that most people would draw is smoking and NPC. But is tobacco use a factor in the first place? Dr Lim said that it has been proposed that tobacco may contain substances that further activate the action of EBV if you become infected.  “Tobacco smoking is significantly associated with the risk of NPC. Compared to never smokers, current smokers had four times the risk of developing NPC, and those who had ever smoked had double the risk,” he said. Dr Eu begged to differ. There are many types of NPC, he said. “Smoking, in general, is not a well-established risk factor for the cancer subtypes seen in our population. But it has been shown to be a risk factor for other subtypes of NPC.” DIAGNOSIS  NPC has an insidious way of creeping up on its victims. In its early stage, it is almost undiscernible. Most patients are diagnosed at a later stage and the vast majority of them present with neck lumps, according to Dr Eu.  “Early-stage NPC tends to be relatively asymptomatic and is often discovered by chance,” added Assoc Prof Chua. In fact, around 70 per cent of NCCS’s patients present with advanced stages 3 to 4 NPC. The symptoms range from the abovementioned signs and may also include facial numbness and jaw tightness when the cancer has invaded the skull bones and further into the brain, he said. The diagnosis is usually made after a nose scope known as a nasoendoscope, explained Dr Lim. It allows the doctor to search for tumour growths in the nasopharynx. If detected, a biopsy is done to confirm the diagnosis. TREATMENT Fortunately, most NPC cases in Singapore are “radiosensitive”, meaning they respond well to radiotherapy treatment, said Dr Lim.  Dr Eu agreed that radiotherapy methods such as Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) and Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy (IMPT) in the last 10 years have undergone vast progress to deliver greater precision in the treatment of NPC.  At the NCCS, for instance, pioneering technology has been developed to focus more on minimising the side effects of radiotherapy such as persistent dry mouth, chronic fatigue, chronic dental infections, and the loss of taste and smell (which can start to improve three weeks to two months after radiotherapy ends, according to cancer.net). This is done by delivering the high radiation dose to the tumour while minimising dosing the surrounding organs such as the salivary glands and swallowing muscles, explained Assoc Prof Chua.  The intensity of the treatment can even be customised using (surprise, surprise) the EBV load detected in the patient’s blood. “This test can be used at different points of treatment: At diagnosis, during treatment, and end of treatment to adapt the treatment accordingly,” said Assoc Prof Chua.  For later-stage NPC, chemotherapy may be added, said Dr Lim, while surgery may be included to treat recurring cases. “The use of minimally invasive surgical approaches such as endoscopic and robotic treatment has further improved patient outcomes,” said Dr Eu.  Also assuring are the statistics on recurring NPC. “Early-stage nose cancer has a very low recurrence rate. This is, however, not so much the case for patients with advanced NPC, who have a reported relapse rate of between 10 per cent to 20 per cent,” said Dr Eu. As for prevention measures, try these, said Dr Lim: Don't smoke, minimise your intake of salted food and get screened regularly if you have a family history of NPC.   "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/cataracts-dementia-alzheimers-disease-2457116,New study reveals cataract surgery may reduce dementia risk in older patients,"Surgery to remove cataracts, which cause the eye’s normally clear lens to become cloudy, can restore vision almost instantaneously. New research suggests cataract surgery may have another benefit as well: A reduced risk for Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia. For the study, scientists looked at 3,038 men and women with cataracts who were 65 or older and free of dementia at the time of their diagnosis. Of these, 1,382 had cataract surgery, and the rest did not. All of the subjects were part of a decades-long memory study that followed them over decades. The researchers found that the overall risk for dementia was 29 per cent lower in those who had cataract surgery compared with those who did not. The researchers also looked at glaucoma surgery, another type of eye operation that does not restore vision but can help prevent vision loss. It had no effect on dementia risk. The study, in JAMA Internal Medicine, adjusted for age at first diagnosis of cataracts as well as various risk factors for dementia, including few years of education, smoking, a high body mass index and hypertension. The only trait that had a bigger impact on dementia risk than cataract surgery was not carrying a gene called APOE-e4 that is linked to increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease. “The authors were incredibly thoughtful in how they approached the data and considered other variables,” said Dr Nathaniel Chin, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Wisconsin, who was not involved in the study. “They compared cataract surgery to non-vision-improving surgery – glaucoma surgery – and controlled for many important confounding variables.” Dr Chin is the medical director of the Wisconsin Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. “We were astounded by the magnitude of the effect,” said the lead author, Dr Cecilia Lee, an associate professor of ophthalmology at the University of Washington. The authors note that this is an observational study that does not prove cause and effect. But they suggest that this may be the best kind of evidence attainable, since a randomised trial in which only some people are allowed to get cataract surgery would be both practically and ethically impossible. “People might say that those who are healthy enough to have surgery are healthier in general and therefore, less likely to develop dementia in any case,” Dr Lee said. “But when we see no association in glaucoma surgery, that supports the idea that it isn’t just eye surgery or being healthy enough to undergo surgery, but rather, that the effect is specific to cataract surgery.” The findings bolster earlier research showing that vision loss – as well as hearing loss – are important risk factors for cognitive decline. People who have trouble seeing or hearing, for example, may withdraw from activities like exercise, social interactions, reading or intellectual pursuits, all of which are tied to a lower risk of dementia. But the researchers also suggested a possible physiological mechanism. The visual cortex undergoes changes with vision loss, they wrote in the paper, and impaired vision may lessen input to the brain, leading to brain shrinkage, also a risk factor for dementia. At least one previous study found an increase in the brain’s grey matter volume after cataract surgery. While the exact mechanism for the benefits of cataract surgery remains unknown, Dr Lee said it’s not surprising that some of the changes we see in the eye might reflect processes in the brain. “The eye is very strongly connected to the brain,” he said. “The eye develops in utero from the brain and shares the same neural tissue. The eye in development comes out of the forebrain.” Dr Chin said that the most important question for him going forward is what this means for doctors and patients. Doctors in primary care clinics or those who treat memory need to screen more for visual decline, he said, adding that, “We can talk to people about potential brain health improvements with cataract surgery as well as the need to address vision throughout one’s life as a means of protecting cognition.” By Nicholas Bakalar © 2022 The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/alcohol-sleep-snoring-vivid-dreams-2459621,Going out for drinks tonight? Here’s how alcohol messes with your sleep,"A couple of glasses of wine or a few drinks in the evening will probably make you fall asleep faster than normal. Who among us hasn’t left the dishes for the next morning or neglected a skin-care routine after a dinner party or festive night out? But even if you thud into Dreamland, there’s a good chance that too much alcohol will mean a fitful night of sleep. That’s because alcohol disrupts what’s known as your sleep architecture, the normal phases of deeper and lighter sleep we go through every night. A night of drinking can “fragment” or interrupt these patterns, experts say, and you may wake up several times as you ricochet through the usual stages of sleep. “You pay for it in the second half of the night,” said Dr Jennifer Martin, a psychologist and professor of medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. Alcohol is “initially sedating but as it’s metabolised, it’s very activating”. Here’s how it breaks down. In the first half of the night, when fairly high levels of alcohol are still coursing through your bloodstream, you’ll probably sleep deeply and dreamlessly. One reason: In the brain, alcohol acts on gamma-aminobutyric acid or GABA, a neurotransmitter that inhibits impulses between nerve cells and has a calming effect. Alcohol can also suppress rapid eye movement or REM sleep, which is when most dreaming occurs. Later in the night, as alcohol levels drop, your brain kicks into overdrive. You may toss and turn as your body undergoes a rebound arousal. “As the levels decline, you’re going to get more issues with the fragmentation,” said Dr R Nisha Aurora, a member of the board of directors of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. You’ll also probably have more vivid or stressful dreams and – because fitful sleep means that you’re waking up more regularly – you are more likely to remember them. Alcohol is also a diuretic, a substance that increases urine output, which means you may find yourself waking up to go to the bathroom. “You are going to have to pee more often,” said Dr Bhanu Prakash Kolla, an associate professor of psychiatry and a consultant at the Center for Sleep Medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. “Moderate amounts of alcohol, especially wine and spirits, have an early diuretic effect, especially in the elderly,” he added. It’s unclear whether the urge to urinate wakes you up, or if you’re just more attuned to your body in the second half of the night because you’re sleeping more fitfully. People may also snore more after they drink. Alcohol is a muscle relaxant and relaxes the muscles in your upper airways, disrupting normal breathing. Drinking can be especially dangerous for people with obstructive sleep apnoea, who wake up many times during the night as their airways momentarily collapse. Most experts agree that drinking will mess with your sleep, no matter your age or gender. And because alcohol depresses the central nervous system, experts caution against using it with sleep aids such as Ambien, Tylenol PM, Benadryl or even supplements like melatonin. “Alcohol is a sedative,” said Dr Ilene Rosen, a sleep medicine doctor and associate professor of medicine at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. “I would not use any sedative hypnotic, whether over-the-counter or not, when you’re drinking alcohol.” Some people drink closer to bedtime to help them get to sleep. But that can start a dangerous cycle of more fragmented sleep, followed by heavier drinking. “I do see a lot of people who self-medicate for insomnia with alcohol, which is definitely not a good practice,” said Dr Sabra Abbott, an assistant professor of neurology in sleep medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Sustained nightly drinking can establish worrying patterns that can persist even after people have stopped drinking, she and other experts say. To help assess how alcohol may be affecting your sleep, experts recommend an alcohol-free reset period, or what Dr Martin called “an alcohol holiday” lasting at least two weeks. “It can be very eye-opening to appreciate how much alcohol affects your sleep,” she said. A lot of people who think they have insomnia, she said, may just be drinking too much or too close to bedtime. “It turns out that if they don’t drink, they sleep much better,” said Dr Martin, who is also a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. After the “holiday” she said, “they can just make a more informed decision about how much – and how often – they consume alcohol.” Experts also suggest building in a buffer zone of at least a few hours between drinking and bedtime. A nightcap is not your friend. “It’s probably okay to have a glass of wine with dinner four hours before bed,” Dr Abbott said. Or maybe limit your drinking to happy hour or the appetiser course. Alcohol can mess with your morning routine, too. “People may turn to stimulants” like caffeine, drinking coffee well into the afternoon, said Dr Armeen Poor, a pulmonary and critical care physician at Metropolitan Hospital Center in New York and clinical assistant professor of medicine at New York Medical College. “That makes it harder to fall asleep at night,” he said. “And then you need more of that sedative, and then it just goes around and around and around.” By Amelia Nierenberg © 2022 The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/breast-cancer-preventive-mastectomy-previvor-2462236,Life after preventive mastectomy: A woman’s journey to accepting her new body,"I lay on my back and opened my robe, just as I’d done for every other appointment. But when the doctor prodded my new breasts with her fingertips, I felt naked for the first time. Thin, sloping scars were exposed on my chest, where a surgeon had removed my nipples, but left a smaller version of my areolas. “If you ever want tattoos, I know a guy named Vinnie in Baltimore. He’s good,” my gynaecologic oncologist said as she helped me sit up on the exam table. “Thanks, but I think I’m good,” I said. My answer was a reflex. I’d had a preventive double mastectomy with reconstruction – two surgeries five months apart – during a pandemic, with three kids at home. I couldn’t fathom driving to Baltimore for 3D nipple tattoos. My middle child, Tophs, had helped us discover the BRCA mutation. His puzzling medical symptoms, including dangerously low blood sugar and growth failure, led doctors to order a genetic test of more than 20,000 of his genes. I never expected that my four-year-old son carried a BRCA2 mutation, and, as it turned out, so did I. I was 32, and the diagnosis – an increased lifetime risk of developing breast cancer (up to 85 per cent) and ovarian cancer (up to 27 per cent) – was devastating. Because the cancers associated with BRCA mutations develop in adulthood, my son’s care didn’t change, but my medical team expanded overnight. I immediately entered a high-risk programme at the University of Virginia’s Emily Couric Clinical Cancer Center, and met my gynaecologic oncologist, breast surgeon and plastic surgeon. They showed me photographs of women’s torsos before and after surgery. We discussed my family tree, which was marked by a variety of cancers on one side. Having a BRCA mutation doesn’t mean you’ll get cancer. It just means you have to weigh whether you want to spend the rest of your life under surveillance (alternating breast MRIs and mammograms every six months) or take things into your own hands with a major preventive surgery. Myself, I waited four years to decide. First, I had one last baby and nursed her until the fat filled her thighs and made delightful pockets around her elbows. I took time to write essays and landed a book deal. I prayed and waited for guidance on timing. Then, before the baby turned four, I read a piece by the late writer Elizabeth Wurtzel on breast cancer and her words nudged me over the edge: “I could have avoided all this if I had been tested for the BRCA mutation,” she wrote. I had that chance; I could still get ahead of the cancer. I called to schedule the surgery and reminded myself that along with decreasing my risk of breast cancer, I’d also get a “free” breast reduction and lift. It was a vain silver lining, but I clung to it. I’m a year out from my two breast surgeries. They call me a “previvor” meaning I have a genetic predisposition to cancer, but haven’t developed it. My lifetime risk of getting breast cancer has been reduced by at least 90 per cent. I’m confident I made the right decision for me, though most days, I don’t feel especially brave or empowered. Grateful? Yes. But when I quiet all “shoulds” and expectations in my head for a moment, I hear a call from within to survey the changes to my body. To allow myself room for wonder and even disappointment when I look down at my chest. I ask myself for permission to grieve. During my breast reconstruction, the plastic surgeon suctioned fat from my thighs and flanks, and inserted it around the implants to make them appear more natural. It left my thighs dark purple with bruises, the pain far worse than I’d imagined. Over time, the bruises disappeared, but so did the fat placed around the implants; my body reabsorbed it. Now, when I take off my bra, I see ridges and dimples that can’t be smoothed without a third surgery. My breasts have more lift and are smaller than they were after nursing three kids, and without nipples I’ll never again have to buy breast petals to wear with a strapless dress. But it’s also true that the holes where drains were inserted during my mastectomy left behind pock marks that remind me of cigarette burns when I glimpse them in the mirror. “You’ll do great,” people said. “You’ll feel so relieved.” I needed their voices, echoing as doctors rolled me into the operating room. All things considered, I did do pretty great, I have little to complain about. Yet, can my body hold two truths? Do I have room, between the asymmetry of my new breasts and my clean bill of breast health, to lament? To say: I’ve lost something, too. After having kids, my breasts sagged, looked worn out, but they never appeared unnatural. They were mine. Now when I undress in my closet with my back turned, it’s not just that I’m prone to shame. I’m also taking space to relearn my body, how it feels to live in a place that’s been rearranged. Doesn’t each of us, at some point in our lives, have to confess: I thought this body was one thing, it turns out it’s another. Previvor. It’s a privilege, no doubt, a deep bow to science and, for me, to God. I cannot help but look around at friends who already have cancer and never got a chance to preempt anything. We call that perspective, right? But if I told you I knew how to navigate the psychological terrain between honouring others’ harrowing stories and my own, I’d be lying. It can’t be healthy to hide behind gratitude without acknowledging that sometimes, I feel like the subject of a Cubist portrait – a woman made of fragments pieced together, almost recognisable as her own. I’m looking for space, as a previvor, to mourn. A space where I can stop and consider that my scars are signs of relief but also collateral damage from a choice I made. I am fortunate and disappointed, indebted and sad. I may never have breasts fit for Playboy, but recently I’ve reconsidered my “Thanks, I’m good” approach to nipple tattoos. Now that my skin has healed and I’ve had some distance from the trauma of surgery, I’m more open to the idea of making my breasts beautiful to me. Maybe it’s vain, but maybe it’s not ungrateful to want my breasts to look more polished or complete. The other day I ordered a temporary tattoo print – a mix of cool blues and greens, a dab of lavender, coral and pink – called Confetti Floral. Back when I first visited the plastic surgeon, he’d shown me photos of women who chose to have intricate designs, rather than nipples, inked on their chests. I couldn’t appreciate their artistic decisions then; I was drowning in new information. Now, I’m standing somewhere between perspective and grief, and perhaps, this area is just to reimagine my body and its beauty. I keep the fake tattoo in its plastic film on a bookshelf in my office, as a reminder that I have options. In time, as I parse what matters to me from what can be discarded, maybe I’ll give Vinnie a call and ask if he takes special orders.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-children-vaccination-appointment-walk-long-wait-queue-2466046,"Parents encouraged to make COVID-19 vaccination appointments instead of walking in, to minimise waiting time","SINGAPORE: Planning to take your child for their first COVID-19 jab? Parents are encouraged to make appointments instead of walking in, said vaccination centres on Friday (Jan 28), adding that it would help to minimise waiting time Both Raffles Medical and Fullerton Health, which run vaccination centres that serve children across Singapore, confirmed that they have seen increased interest in walk-ins for the COVID-19 jab.  From Jan 25, parents and guardians of children aged five to 11 have been able to walk into any paediatric vaccination centre for their child's first COVID-19 shot. No prior appointment is needed provided the walk-in is done from Mondays to Thursdays.  In a Facebook post on Friday, Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing said more than 5,600 children walked in with their parents from Monday to Thursday this week to get jabbed.  “Many parents have also welcomed the move to allow them to bring their children for vaccination without needing to piggy-back on their siblings’ appointments,” he wrote.  Walk-ins have been accepted for all accompanying siblings of a child with a prior COVID-19 vaccination appointment from Mondays to Thursdays since Jan 10.  Fullerton Health’s paediatric vaccination centres have seen “initial interest” in walk-ins now that they are allowed, and this is within the centres operating capacities, said its spokesperson.  “Although walk-ins are allowed, we strongly encourage members of public to make an appointment before coming down,” the spokesperson said, noting that the average waiting time for those with appointments is below an hour, including the 30-minute observation period after the jab.  Raffles Medical also confirmed that it has seen an increased number of walk-ins by parents of children aged five to 11.  “While we do not turn away walk-in requests, appointments are encouraged to minimise waiting time. We have made the necessary manpower adjustments to meet the demand and address waiting time for everyone,” said its spokesperson.  While waiting time varies across centres and timings, parents should avoid peak periods like early morning and mealtimes to minimise waiting, the spokesperson said.  “To better manage expectations, our team would always advise members of the public the expected waiting time and suggest alternatives such as return during non-peak hours or book an appointment for another date.”  Mr Ho Ken Weng, who walked in with his eight-year-old daughter at Queenstown Community Centre on Thursday evening, ended up leaving only two hours later.  He arrived at around 6.15pm after picking his daughter up from school. They had already booked an appointment for her vaccination at Nanyang Community Centre, but chose to walk in at the Raffles Medical vaccination centre at Queenstown because it was the closest one to their home, he told CNA.  “We tried our luck, by the time we reach there, (there were) long queues,” said Mr Ho, adding that there were at least 20 to 30 people ahead of him.  After standing in the queue for about 45 minutes, he and his wife realised that they were queueing to enter the waiting area, where they could go through the necessary health checks for their daughter and sit while waiting for their turn.  “You have to queue, then you have to take your weight, then after that you have to sit at the waiting area and wait for them to call you for the jab,” he said.  “There is a signboard telling us you need to wait 90 minutes, and after that they changed it to 120 minutes.”  Meanwhile, parents who had made appointments did not need to queue at all. All of them were ushered into the waiting area after arriving.  Mr Ho and his wife decided to stick with their decision after running into their daughter’s classmate at the centre, as they could wait together. They waited for another 45 minutes before their daughter’s name was called.  They finally left Queenstown Community Centre at about 8.15pm, including the 30-minute observation period.  Adding that he did not expect to see such long queues, Mr Ho recalled that his own vaccination experience was very fast and smooth, with little to no crowds.  “Maybe because of the booking of the appointments, it was really well-planned. For this time, so many kids running here and there, it was the first time, a bit shocked,” he added, stressing that there were staff members present to maintain safe management measures.  Some parents have asked if the walk-in arrangement can be extended to Fridays and weekends, said Mr Chan in his post on Friday.  “Unfortunately, this is still not quite possible as appointment bookings are full to the brim on those days. But we will continue to monitor the booking patterns. When we are able to clear more of our children in the coming weeks, we will work with (the) Ministry of Health to make things even more convenient for families,” he wrote.  Those who plan to walk in at the centres with their children on Jan 31 should do so by 1pm, as the centres will close earlier on the eve of Chinese New Year. They will also be closed on Feb 1 and 2 for the public holidays, he noted.  So far, 175,000 children have received their first dose, and more than 25,000 have received both doses, said the Education Minister.  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/feminine-health-vulva-care-prevent-vaginal-infection-2444766,Vulva health 101: Why women should take care of this most intimate feminine area,"A friend sent a video from late-night television show, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, to our WhatsApp group chat the other day.  It was titled “What Do You Know About The Female Body?” and had the production team hitting the streets to find out how much men knew about the female anatomy, in particular, the female reproductive system.  Naturally, my girlfriends and I laughed when we saw the video because the men interviewed had no clue where or what things were. But at the back of my mind, I wondered how much we, as women, even know about our own anatomy, especially the goings-on down south.  How many of us know the difference between the vagina and the vulva, for instance? Or if it’s an area of the body we should give extra care to (or none at all)? And really, what should we be doing?    VULVA VS VAGINA: DO YOU KNOW WHAT’S WHAT?  Contrary to what many think, the vagina is not the vulva – the vagina is part of the vulva.   “The vulva is the outer part of the female genitals that includes the opening of the vagina, labia majora (outer lips), the labia minora (inner lips) and the clitoris,” said Dr Coni Liu, a consultant dermatologist at Dermatology and Surgery Clinic.  Think of the vulva as the “visible part of your genitals”, said Dr Pamela Tan, an obstetrician and gynaecologist with Thomson Medical Center (TLC Gynaecology Practice) in her web blog. This area includes the mons pubis (the fatty pad covered by hair), the groin and the perineum. YOUR VULVA: THE NEXT FRONTIER OF INTIMATE CARE  Dr Liu believes it is time to give the vulva, also known as the Y-zone, some long overdue attention. “Skin from any part of the body, like our face, needs care and attention – but most people often only notice the skin on other parts of the body when it starts to give them problems,” she said.  Just like the face, the vulva is an area of skin that contains a high concentration of mucous glands, nerves and blood vessels, said Dr Liew Hui Min, a consultant dermatologist at HM Liew Skin & Laser Clinic. That makes a sensitive area, and why you should give it the same care as you would the skin on your face. HOW TO KEEP THE VULVA CLEAN   “There is no need to keep the vulva excessively clean,” said Dr Liu. “If it is not particularly dirty from activities, you only need to wash the area when you shower.”  Interestingly, Dr Liew observed that in Asia, there tends to be a habit of keeping the vulva “way too clean”, which can irritate the area and lead to itching.  Experiencing these symptoms may then lead a woman to think she has caught an infection, which leads to more frequent washing. “She may even use antiseptics to clean it,” she added.  Should you use a dedicated feminine wash? Dr Liu cautioned that some may be too harsh and may cause more dryness and irritation to the area. Choose a wash that “does not strip off the natural oils on the skin and is ideally free from fragrances or essential oils to reduce the risk of contact allergy”, she said.  And don’t forget to always wipe or wash “from front to back”, said Dr Liew.  If you are experiencing discomfort or sensitivity in the area, Dr Tan said in her blog that the best remedy is to wash with “plain, lukewarm (not hot) water”.  WHY YOU SHOULD KEEP THE VULVA’S MICROBIOME IN BALANCE The skin microbiome is an ecosystem made up of trillions of micro-organisms that keep the skin healthy. When the microbiome is thrown off balance, dermatologists say it can lead to skin conditions like eczema and acne. Studies have shown that the skin’s microbiome differs at different locations from head to toe When it comes to the microbiome of the vulva, however, Dr Liew said that studies are limited, with some looking at different body mass index values in relation to vulva microbiome, and how these can alter its state.   This imbalance was found in the concentration of lactobacillus, known to provide protection, which may predispose one to vulva infections, Dr Liew added.  At the same time, Dr Liu said that “as the vulva area is close to the vagina, disturbances in the vaginal microbiome, such as vaginal thrush (also known as candidiasis), can affect the vulva directly”. To keep the vulva’s microbiome in balance, Dr Liew recommends keeping a healthy lifestyle, and adopting these habits:  1. Take oral antibiotics only when needed. Oral antibiotics may give rise to vaginal thrust, a yeast infection that can cause irritation and even intense itchiness. 2. Add oral probiotics to your daily diet. This can be “helpful in those with recurrent vulva-vaginal infection and those who need to consume regular long-term oral antibiotics or even short courses of oral antibiotics for medical reasons”, said Dr Liew.  3. Eat yoghurt for better vulva and vaginal health. Yoghurt is not just good for gut health. To keep it even healthier, opt for sugar-free yoghurt as “diabetes predisposes one to recurrent thrush infection”, Dr Liew explained. WHAT AGEING AND MENOPAUSE MEAN FOR THE Y-ZONE How the skin on your face ages is exactly what you can expect at the vulva, said Dr Liu. This includes the loss of skin elasticity, hydration and the fat layer, as well as reduced muscle tone. Other age-related issues include increased pigmentation, sagging of the labia and a deflated appearance of the vulva.   Aesthetics aside, the dryness of the vulva skin can also lead to the development of eczema, which can in turn cause significant discomfort and distress. “It is not uncommon for some menopausal women to experience symptoms of atrophic vaginitis,” Dr Liew said.  Atrophic vaginitis is the thinning, dryness and inflammation of the vaginal walls. It is caused by to the thinning of the mucosal lining of the vaginal opening from the lack of oestrogen as women go through menopause.  That’s why, Dr Liu said, it is just as important to keep the vulva moisturised. And it should be done regardless of age because “regular moisturising of the vulva can reduce the risk of developing age-related dryness and eczema”. The question then, is whether there is a need to use vulva-specific skincare. Beauty brands have introduced such products in recent years, from washes to lotions, oils, masks and even sunscreen for the area. Actress Emma Watson divulged that she uses Fur Oil, a hair oil which she applies to her pubic hair to keep it soft and prevent in-growns, while reality star Khloe Kardashian uses Medicine Mama’s Vmagic to soothe and hydrate her womanly bits.   According to Dr Liu, the skin on the vulva behaves more like the skin on our lips, and thus “prefers a more petroleum-based balm as a moisturiser”. She added that the moisturiser you use doesn’t have to be Y-zone specific, and that something like Vaseline would work just as well.  YOUR CLOTHES AND UNDERWEAR MAKE A DIFFERENCE    With the recent trend of athleisure wear, many women are living in form-fitting and tight outfits, especially pants. “Tight fitting pants can produce constant friction on the vulva area and lead to increased pigmentation, dermatitis and boils in the friction areas,” said Dr Liu.  Another problem that women might face is folliculitis, which is the inflammation of hair follicles that can lead to infections on the skin.  Dr Liew suggested that athleisure wear made from Dri-fit material and is comfortable to wear, might be a better option.  Besides your outfit, what you wear underneath can make a difference as well. While it might not be the sexiest, Dr Liu advised wearing underwear made of “soft materials like cotton or bamboo” as they are “most gentle on the skin, likewise, for the vulva”. In addition, Dr Liew also recommended that you get new underwear every few months – underwear that is not cleaned or dried well can cause problems at the sensitive vulva area. THE TYPE OF FEMININE HYGIENE PRODUCTS MATTERS  “The material on the sanitary pad is not as soft, so it can increase irritation, and if scented, can increase the risk of contact allergy, causing chronic dermatitis of the vulva,” said Dr Liu. If your vulva is easily irritated, you might want to use tampons or menstrual cups when you’re on your period instead, said Dr Liew. Or try period underwear. And if you’re the type to use panty liners daily, it’s time to stop, Dr Liew cautioned. These should be used during the end of your monthly cycle. “The dryness of a new panty liner will rub against the vulva skin, leading to itching,” she explained.  At the same time, vaginal discharge that gets trapped when you wear a panty liner daily, can create a moist environment for the vulva. This can lead to conditions from a rash to a vaginal yeast infection. WHEN IN DOUBT, SEEK MEDICAL HELP Ultimately, when it comes to vulval conditions, Dr Tan advised women not to treat their symptoms on their own.  “The reason why some DIY treatments fail is because you are not targeting the real cause. What you might think is a yeast infection could simply be dry skin, an allergic reaction, or it could already be a sexually transmitted infection.  “This is why you need medical care to ensure that you can treat the problem based on what’s causing it,” she said.  And until a vulva problem is diagnosed, it is wise to follow a gentle vulva care routine, which applies even when you are not dealing with a potential skin condition.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-vaccine-jab-heart-disease-christina-rodrigues-seah-2463261,Heart disease the cause of death of woman who died months after COVID-19 jab: Heart centres,"SINGAPORE: A woman who died nine months after her second COVID-19 vaccine shot did not report feeling unwell or had any allergic reaction after receiving both doses in April last year, said two heart centres in Singapore.  The case was referred to the coroner and investigations showed that the cause of death was dilated cardiomyopathy, a heart condition, said the National University Heart Centre, Singapore (NUHCS) and National Heart Centre Singapore (NHCS) in a joint statement on Wednesday (Jan 26). They were addressing social media posts questioning if the woman's death was linked to COVID-19 vaccination. She was identified in the posts as local football fan Christina Rodrigues Seah, who is in her 30s. Giving a timeline of what happened, the heart centres said the woman was admitted to NUHCS for a cardiac condition in July 2021. ""At the time, COVID-19 vaccination was not assessed to be a direct cause of her heart failure,"" said the heart centres in a statement on Facebook.  ""Other causal factors such as genetic causes were considered, taking into account her family history."" In September, she had an MRI heart scan, with the results ""suggestive of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (ie disease of the heart muscle) as the underlying cause of her condition"". In December, she sought a second opinion and treatment for her cardiac condition at NHCS.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/preschools-sengkang-punggol-pcf-developmental-needs-screening-children-2459816,Some pre-schools to screen kids for developmental needs from 2 months old as part of pilot programme,"SINGAPORE: Sixteen pre-schools in Punggol and Sengkang, run by PAP Community Foundation (PCF), will be involved in a pilot programme to screen children for developmental issues from as young as two months old. The programme, called Mission I’mPossible 2, will be trialled over four years. It builds on an earlier pilot that screens children aged five to six. That pilot, now known as the Development Support and Learning Support Programme (DS-LS), has since been adopted by the Government and is available at more than 600 pre-schools, covering about 40 per cent of students aged five to six. There are plans for DS-LS to be expanded to cover 60 per cent of pre-schoolers by 2025, and for this to be increased to 80 per cent at ""steady-state"", according to a press release. The new pilot seeks to provide support for children with developmental needs at an earlier stage. A school-based Child Development Unit will be established at PCF, comprising an interdisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, early interventionists, social workers, nutritionists and curriculum specialists who will rove around the pre-schools. A support network run by the pre-school’s social workers will also be set up, and new processes for the systematic screening of growth and development in children will be introduced. PCF, KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) and the Lien Foundation are jointly organising the pilot, with the Lien Foundation sponsoring S$9.27 million of the S$12.1 million costs. The balance will be funded by PCF and KKH. The programme seeks to demonstrate ""how education, healthcare and social services can be integrated and delivered within the community"", said PCF, KKH and Lien Foundation in their press release. For children with developmental needs, support can be provided as part of the programme or they can be referred to an existing government-funded programme. “By going upstream, MIP2 aims to reduce costs,"" said programme director of Lien Foundation Ng Tze Yong. ""Not just financial costs through lowering downstream demand for early intervention and disability services but more importantly, the emotional costs to families and societal costs of lost human potential incurred when intervention comes too late for children to catch up.” Studies have shown that a high-quality pre-school programme and attention to a child’s development in early childhood are linked with ""better metabolic and mental health, as well as academic and socioeconomic outcomes later in life"", said the programme director of MIP2, Associate Professor Chan Yoke Hwee. “Early childhood is a period of vulnerability and also opportunity ... It is therefore imperative that children with developmental needs are identified early and be provided early intervention and support,"" said Assoc Prof Chan, who chairs the Division of Medicine at KKH. ""To enable this, KKH will leverage our expertise to support the delivery of integrated education, health and social services through the preschools under Mission I’mPossible 2.” An evaluation study will be conducted at the end of the four-year pilot. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/unvaccinated-man-no-heart-transplant-us-hospital-covid19-2459806,Unvaccinated US hospital patient denied heart transplant: Reports,"SINGAPORE: A hospital patient in Boston has been denied the chance to receive a heart transplant partly because he is not vaccinated against COVID-19, US media reported on Monday (Jan 24). DJ Ferguson, 31, has been in hospital since November over a ""hereditary heart issue"" that fills his lungs with blood and fluid, according to a GoFundMe page set up for him. According to CBS Boston, Ferguson's family said he was at the front of the line to receive a transplant but is no longer eligible under hospital policy, as he is not vaccinated against COVID-19. ""The COVID-19 vaccine is one of several vaccines and lifestyle behaviours required for transplant candidates in the Mass General Brigham system in order to create both the best chance for a successful operation and also the patient's survival after transplantation,"" Brigham and Women's Hospital reportedly told CBS Boston. The hospital requires several vaccines recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – including the COVID-19, flu and hepatitis B vaccines – for transplant patients, according to its website. ""Patients are not active on the waitlist without this,"" the hospital said. The requirements are to optimise survival as the immune system is ""drastically suppressed"" after transplantation, it said. ""Given the shortage of available organs, we do everything we can to ensure that a patient who receives a transplanted organ has the greatest chance of survival,"" the hospital separately told the BBC. Ferguson's father told CBS Boston that the COVID-19 vaccine is ""kind of against his basic principles; he doesn't believe in it"". Brigham and Women's Hospital is a teaching hospital affiliated with Harvard Medical School. The hospital said on its website that research has shown transplant recipients are at a ""much higher risk"" of dying from COVID-19 compared to non-transplant patients. There are more than 100,000 candidates on waitlists for organ transplantation in the US, according to Brigham and Women's Hospital. Around half of them will not receive an organ within five years due to a shortage of available organs. The hospital added that there is no transplant candidate who is ""first on the list"" since there are varying levels of priority for allocation of organs. According to the GoFundMe page, Ferguson is married with two children. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-insider/rf-emf-radiation-protection-mobile-phones-wireless-devices-routers-danger-2457756,"In a world going wireless, is radiation from mobile and other devices a growing danger?","SINGAPORE: Bluetooth headphones, laptops, smart televisions and watches, tablets and Wi-Fi routers — many of us have these at home and also carry a mobile phone all the time. How many people, though, wonder how exposed they and their families could be to radiation emitted by these devices? Many more than before, according to several retailers in Singapore that say sales of anti-radiation products have quadrupled over the past five years. There are a variety of these products, from stickers selling for S$2 to products that are claimed to protect the vulnerable — children and pregnant women — like beanies for babies and maternity belly wraps. But how protective are they? And is there a need to be worried about the radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) emitted by wireless devices? The programme Talking Point investigates. Mobile phones and electronic devices use radiofrequency to function, for example to transmit data. Their signals operate in the lower end of the electromagnetic spectrum. At the higher end are energy fields such as x-rays and gamma rays. “(Radio frequencies) have the ability to, let’s say, heat up the body, for example if that particular device is held close to the body, which in this case is a cell phone,” noted Neelakantam Venkatarayalu, an associate professor from the Singapore Institute of Technology’s (SIT’s) engineering cluster. In 2011, the World Health Organisation’s (WHO’s) International Agency for Research on Cancer classified RF as “possibly carcinogenic to humans”, based on a few studies that found an association with a type of brain cancer. This means “there could be some risk” of cancer, with continued evaluations needed even now. When it comes to mobile phones, before they can be put on the market, they must be designed and tested to operate below international reference levels for a measurement called the specific absorption rate. This measures the amount of RF energy absorbed by the body per mass of tissue. Or as Venkatarayalu put it, “that translates directly into the amount of heat that builds up over time” when using the phone. Typically, the regulatory exposure limit for the head and torso is two watts per kilogramme (W/kg). In some countries, like the United States and Canada, it is 1.6 W/kg. Users might not realise it, but mobile phones contain a section on safety: Go to Settings > About phone > Legal information. It includes information on the phone model’s specific absorption rate, either on the page or via a link. Talking Point sent five popular phone models for laboratory tests to find out how much radiation they emit when receiving a call. The results showed that the phones’ power densities were below the exposure limit guideline by at least 200 times. “All of them are within the … safety limit, so it shouldn’t be a concern,” said Pei Yiyang, an associate professor from the SIT’s infocomm technology cluster who took the measurements. As it is not just mobile devices that emit an electromagnetic field, RF expert Venkatarayalu used an instrument called a spectrum analyser to also take readings of different frequencies around programme host Steven Chia’s house. The readings were below the safety guideline by at least 100 times. Even the Wi-Fi signals from Chia’s router were lower by a factor of about 1,400. And that was a “conservative estimate”. “We’re (measuring) a maximum value,” said Venkatarayalu. “It needn’t be emitting that all the time — it could be just a pulse that appears and vanishes.” One professor who thinks the current exposure limits are not conservative enough, however, is Devra Lee Davis, the founder of advocacy group Environmental Health Trust based in Wyoming, US. “The limits that we have now … aren’t protective of human health,” she said. “The latest evidence indicates that cell phone and wireless radiation is a human carcinogen.” One of the studies she specified was published last year in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health. It found that being on the phone for 17 minutes or more a day for 10 years — or about 1,000 hours of lifetime use — increases the risk of developing a brain tumour. Davis wants the exposure limits to be reviewed. For example, the guideline for whole-body exposure level adopted by the WHO and many countries is 10 watts per square metre. She did not, however, go into the specifics of what would be more accurate limits. What she thinks is “essential” as the first step is that the radiation information should come “right on the phone”, as some countries have legislated. In France, for instance, mobile phones come with radiation labelling on the package and a recommendation that the device should be kept away from the stomachs of pregnant women, among other precautions. The country also bans mobile phone advertising aimed at children under 14 years old, as does Belgium for younger children. Some people may also want to play it safe, which is why they buy products such as S$68 anti-radiation bracelets. Talking Point contacted retailers to find out the best-selling items, and with Pei’s help, tested their effectiveness in blocking the signals sent by a transmitter to a receiver. The sticker, the bracelet, the maternity belly wrap and a stone said to absorb radiation all did not affect the signal quality, which showed that they were “not effective”, she said. But the anti-radiation beanie, which cost $20, had some effect because the signal power dropped. “As we can see from the label of this baby cap … there’s some metallic material that reflected the signal,” noted Pei, likening it to the way a metal plate acts as a shield against radiation. “This is the extra precaution that you can have to further reduce the RF radiation.” Davis said her group has been working to get parents, schools and teachers to understand that “tablets belong on tables” and should, ideally, be wired. “You can wire your connections to most of these things. And (the routers) don’t need to be on 24/7,” she said. She thinks mobile phones also “shouldn’t be used much by children”, whom she cited as a vulnerable group along with the elderly, those with pre-existing morbidities and immunocompromised individuals. “A child’s head has a thinner skull (than an adult’s). A child’s skull can absorb 10 times more radiation,” she added. The key factor in radiation protection is distance, noted Venkatarayalu. “As we move away from a signal source, the signal strength is going to get … much weaker,” he said, demonstrating this with a transmitter he set up. At 50 centimetres away, its power density hovered around 100 microwatts per square metre. At a metre away — double the initial distance — the reading decreased by a factor of four. When a phone is in idle mode in one’s pocket, that is a “very low” power mode; and when it is transmitting a call, the power level, though higher, remains below the safety guidelines, Venkatarayalu said. Even if a phone gets warm during a call, that is “not necessarily due to RF radiation” as the battery also emits heat, and there can be other factors too. RF, by its nature, also does not have “so much energy to cause any damage to the cells”, he added. WATCH: Is radiation from our devices dangerous? (22:11) But for people who are still concerned about radiation, he and his university colleague Pei suggest using a hands-free kit or speaker mode to keep the phone further away. “They can reduce the amount of time they (spend) using their phone. Maybe shut it off at night,” Pei added. “All these are simple measures that can reduce RF exposure.” Watch this episode of Talking Point here.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/thailand-green-light-grow-cannabis-home-2458841,Thailand gives green light to growing cannabis at home,"BANGKOK: Thailand's narcotics board on Tuesday (Jan 25) said it would remove cannabis from its drugs list, paving the way for households to grow the plant. Thailand became the first Southeast Asian country to legalise marijuana in 2018 for medical use and research. Under the new rule, people can grow cannabis plants at home after notifying their local government, but the cannabis cannot be used for commercial purposes without further licenses, Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul told reporters. The rule must be published in the official Royal Gazette and 120 days must pass before home cannabis plants will become legal. Meanwhile, the health ministry will this week present to parliament a separate draft Bill which provides details on the legal use of cannabis, including its production and commercial use, including guidelines on recreational use. Homegrown cannabis should be used for medical purposes like traditional medicine, food and drug regulator chief, Paisal Dankhum has said previously and that there would be random inspections. The draft Bill punishes growth of cannabis without notifying the government with a fine of up to 20,000 baht (US$605) and prescribes a fine of up to 300,000 baht or three years in jail, or both, for selling it without a license. The move is the latest step in Thailand's plan to promote cannabis as a cash crop. About a third of its labour force works in agriculture, according to the World Bank. Thai drinks and cosmetics companies last year rushed to launch products with hemp and CBD, a compound that does not give users a high, after their use was approved for consumer goods."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/us-fda-limit-use-regeneron-lilly-covid19-treatment-omicron-2457016,"US FDA limits use of Regeneron, Lilly COVID-19 antibody treatments","The US health regulator on Monday (Jan 24) revised the emergency use authorisations for COVID-19 antibody treatments from Regeneron and Eli Lilly to limit their use, as the drugs are unlikely to work against the Omicron variant. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said the treatments are currently not cleared for use in any US states or territories, but may be authorised in certain regions if they work against potential new variants. The agency highlighted other therapies that are expected to be effective against Omicron, including a rival antibody drug from GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology as well as recently authorised antiviral pills from Pfizer and Merck. The US government in December had paused distribution of Regeneron and Lilly's treatments and said the halt would continue until new data emerges on their efficacy against Omicron. The highly contagious new variant was estimated to account for more than 99 per cent of cases in the United States as of Jan 15. GSK and Vir Biotech are boosting production of their drug, sotrovimab to help meet soaring demand in the United States. The FDA has also expanded its approval for the use of Gilead Sciences' antiviral COVID-19 drug remdesivir to treat non-hospitalised patients aged 12 years and above. The Washington Post earlier in the day reported that the FDA was expected to revise authorisations for Regeneron and Lilly's treatments. A Regeneron spokesperson had said the regulator would provide any potential communication on the topic. Lilly had no immediate comment but pointed to its statement from December saying its antibody candidate, bebtelovimab, maintains neutralisation activity against all known variants of concern, including Omicron.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/cervical-cancer-young-patient-singapore-summer-ng-2455196,‘My dream is to be a mother’: A 29-year-old shares her five-year battle with cervical cancer,"It was in early 2016 that I noticed unusual bleeding after intercourse. I thought it was due to my irregular menstruation, so I didn’t think much about it. Over the next few months, the bleeding came on and off, and in August that year, I decided to see a doctor for a check-up. I was diagnosed with stage one cervical cancer. I was 24 then – and the youngest cervical cancer patient in the hospital.  At first, I wasn’t very affected. What I wanted to know at that point was the treatment and plans moving forward.  ADVISED TO REMOVE HER WOMB  However, when the doctor recommended surgery to remove my womb, that’s when I really felt the impact of the diagnosis.  My dream is to be a mother and I’ve always wanted to have my own kids. I was devastated, and I asked myself: “Why did this happen to me?” As my doctor didn’t offer any other treatments, I did more research on cervical cancer – and found that an alternative was to remove the cervix. I asked my doctor if I could do that instead.  He said it could be done, but while that would save my womb and give me a chance at having children of my own in future, it would also increase my risk of relapse. It would also mean I had a higher chance of miscarriage in pregnancy. I went ahead with my decision to remove my cervix. After the surgery, my doctor then recommended radiotherapy to eradicate the remaining cancer cells. But because the treatment might also affect my fertility, I decided against it.   THE FIRST RELAPSE: ‘I TOOK MY RECOVERY FOR GRANTED’  Almost immediately after the surgery, I went back to being the workaholic that I am. I took my recovery for granted and I didn’t take care of myself.  I was supposed to be resting and not subjecting myself to too much stress, but the company I was working for had just opened its Singapore branch, so I worked overtime a lot and spent many late nights in the office.  During one of my check-ups in 2017, about 10 months post-op, the doctor saw something unusual in my abdomen via a body scan. It seemed that I had had a relapse, although they couldn’t confirm if the tumour was cancerous – the doctors would have remove it first, then send a sample to the lab for testing. I asked a lot of questions about whether I could get pregnant in future, so my doctors offered me the option of ovarian tissue freezing.  As the tumour was located near one of my ovaries, this procedure would preserve the other (unaffected) ovary, which would be essential for future pregnancies. I would then have the option to return the ovarian issue to my body in the future.  I had to undergo three cycles of chemotherapy to decrease the size of tumour, followed by a Caesarean section to remove it and the ovarian tissue for freezing. And after that, another three cycles of chemotherapy. This was in November 2017. The biopsy came back negative – the tumour was not cancerous. Despite this, my doctors decided it would be prudent to go ahead with chemotherapy because of my earlier cervical cancer diagnosis. The treatment took about five months. During the 18 weeks of chemotherapy, I started losing my hair and felt more tired than usual.  THE SECOND RELAPSE: ‘MY LIFE WOULD BE IN DANGER’ About 10 months later, a subsequent check-up found another tumour in my abdomen.  I psyched myself to go through another two rounds of chemotherapy, for the second time. But midway, my doctor told me that the treatment were creating a hole in my intestine. If it grew any bigger, he said, faeces would come out of it into my body, and my life would be in danger. He recommended that we stop chemotherapy. He also wanted to do stoma surgery (an opening in the abdomen that allows waste to exit the body into an external bag) to protect my colon from the effects of chemotherapy. But I refused as I couldn’t accept the idea. I consulted another doctor for a second opinion, who said I could continue with chemo. At that point, I just felt tired and lost. Should I take a risk and continue with chemo?   I decided to embark on a self-healing journey to give myself space to get away from it all – and rest. In April 2019, I left Singapore for the UK.  My plan was to spend six months there, living with friends and strangers, as part of a platform called Workaway that allows you to work for them in exchange for free accommodation. I lived with a mother and her daughters, helping to clean the house and take care of the children. However, four months into my stay, I realised the environment was not conducive for my healing. I was also in pain as I could feel the tumour growing bigger by the day.  In my fifth month, I couldn't take the pain anymore and flew back to Singapore in September 2019 for treatment. “I WAS IN CRITICAL CONDITION”  When I returned to Singapore, I was in critical condition. The tumour had not only doubled to the size of an orange, the doctor said it was already corroding into my colon – leaving me with no choice but to go ahead with stoma surgery to “save” it.  After the stoma surgery in October, I had to live with a stoma bag (a pouch to collect stools) for six months. It was very uncomfortable: I developed rashes from the stickiness of the bag, and I needed to clear and clean it regularly. It was horrible at the start, but I got used to it after a month.  The tumour itself was close to the nerves, and surrounded by blood vessels, making it impossible for surgery to remove it, unless it first decreased in size. So I started on chemotherapy to reduce the tumour. During this time, my friend recommended a wellness centre in Cebu, Philippines, whose approach was to boost the immune system to help the body defend itself. As further chemo was unlikely to reduce the tumour even more, I decided to try it.  To raise some funds for the treatment in January 2020, I made chia seeds jam to sell. Within 13 days, I sold about 300 jars and raised approximately S$2,000. I was appreciative that many people supported it. During the two weeks I was in Cebu, I’d go for one to two-hour treatments every day, which focused on boosting my immune system, including ozone therapy, which is said to be an alternative method to treating diseases.  I then returned to Singapore for surgery to remove the tumour.  All in all, this second relapse took much longer to recover from, having to go through three surgeries – the colostomy to open the stoma, another surgery to remove the tumour and another stoma surgery after that to put back the stoma and stitch it up. FORGIVENESS AND SELF-ACCEPTANCE  There are many misconceptions about cervical cancer, especially in Asian countries, where everyone thinks that it’s a “woman’s problem”. Some people just focus on the word “intercourse” and think that it’s related to promiscuity or those who’ve had a few sexual partners.  But when I found out more, I realised that’s not the case. And it made me want to address these misconceptions.  Throughout the ordeal, the hardest part for me was finding out the cause. I never knew there was a preventative vaccine for cervical cancer. We didn’t talk about it much in school or at home. So when I finally found out about it, it was a bit too late for me.  I also did a lot of self-discovery work along the way, such as how to understand, love and respect myself. I tend to please the people around me – I’ve been living for others almost half of my life. There’s a lack of self-love and a lot of suppressed anger. As years passed by, I believe this anger was “eating” into my body, and this was my body telling me to: “I’ve had enough.” The surgical scars affected me for awhile – including a thick, vertical one just below my belly button, but now I’ve become used to it. I like to go to an onsen, and wear a bikini sometimes, so sometimes people will stare, but I don’t care – it’s become a scar of victory for me. A RENEWED MINDSET AND SENSE OF PURPOSE  It’s been slightly more than a year since I started my own health and wellness business called Summer Origin. My products, such as soups and tea, aim to keep your body “warm”, a traditional Chinese medicine concept; I understand that cancer cells live in an environment that is very “cold”.  Meanwhile, the service side of my business is about mental wellness and helping others to overcome their challenges and find their purpose in life.  When I meet new people and friends, whether it’s about my life or business, it’s become natural for me to share my story and knowledge about cervical cancer. And I think that’s my purpose.  I am one of the ambassadors for the Alliance for Active Action Against HPV (A4HPV) in Singapore. I speak at events and seminars, including insurance companies and health forums, to help break the stigma of human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cancer.  Personally, I’m also more open to the idea of adoption now. I can be a mother to any child and I don’t have to insist on having my own children. I also think it’s important that my future partner gets the cervical cancer HPV vaccine as a preventative measure for both himself and me. It’s a form of self-love and mutual respect for both parties. I am turning 30 in March, and it’s been two years since the last cervical cancer diagnosis. In the past, I used to be really worried about having a relapse, so much so that when people ask me “Have you recovered?”, my answer would be that I’ve recovered for now – but I’m not sure when it’ll come back again.   But today, my mindset has shifted, and I can say confidently now, that yes, I am okay. With this change of mindset, I think I am no longer scared of my quarterly check-ups anymore.  CNA Women is a section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/foreign-nurses-covid19-omicron-rich-poor-countries-2454951,Rich countries' access to foreign nurses during Omicron raises ethical concerns: International nurses council,"GENEVA : The Omicron-fuelled wave of COVID-19 infections has led wealthy countries to intensify their recruitment of nurses from poorer parts of the world, worsening dire staffing shortages in overstretched workforces there, the International Council of Nurses (ICN) said. Sickness, burnout and staff departures amid surging Omicron cases have driven absentee rates to levels not yet seen during the two-year pandemic, said Howard Catton, CEO of the Geneva-based group that represents 27 million nurses and 130 national organisations. To plug the gap, Western countries have responded by hiring army personnel as well as volunteers and retirees but many have also stepped up international recruitment as part of a trend that is worsening health inequity, he continued. ""We have absolutely seen an increase in international recruitment to places like the UK, Germany, Canada and the United States,"" Catton said in a Reuters interview based on a report he co-authored on COVID-19 and the global nursing force. ""I really fear this 'quick fix solution' – it's a bit similar to what we've been seeing with PPE (personal protective equipment) and vaccines where rich countries have used their economic might to buy and to hoard. If they do that with the nursing workforce it will just make the inequity even worse."" Even before the pandemic there was a global shortage of 6 million nurses, with nearly 90 per cent of those shortages in low and lower-middle-income countries, according to ICN data. Some of the recent recruits to rich countries have come from sub-Saharan Africa, including Nigeria, and parts of the Caribbean, Catton said, saying that nurses were often motivated by higher salaries and better terms than at home. The ICN report said this process was also being facilitated by giving nurses preferred immigration status. ""The bottom line is that some people would look at this and say this is rich countries offloading the costs of educating new nurses and health workers,"" he said. Even wealthy countries will struggle to cope with the ""mountains of backlog of unmet care"" when the pandemic winds down, Catton warned, calling for more investment and a 10-year plan to strengthen the workforce. ""We need a coordinated, collaborative, concerted global effort which is underpinned by serious investment, not just warm words and platitudes and applause,"" he said. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/dementia-can-strike-early-age-and-it-may-be-hard-recognise-symptoms-2441621,"Dementia can strike at an early age, and it may be hard to recognise the symptoms","Many people aren’t overly concerned when an octogenarian occasionally forgets the best route to a favourite store, can’t remember a friend’s name or dents the car while trying to parallel park on a crowded city street. Even healthy brains work less efficiently with age, and memory, sensory perceptions and physical abilities become less reliable. But what if the person is not in their 80s but in their 30s, 40s or 50s and forgets the way home from their own street corner? That’s far more concerning. While most of the 5.3 million Americans who are living with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia are over 65, some 200,000 are younger than 65 and develop serious memory and thinking problems far earlier in life than expected. “Young-onset dementia is a particularly disheartening diagnosis because it affects individuals in the prime years,” Dr David S Knopman, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, wrote in a July 2021 editorial in JAMA Neurology. Many of the afflicted are in their 40s and 50s, midcareer, hardly ready to retire and perhaps still raising a family. Dementia in a younger adult is especially traumatic and challenging for families to acknowledge, and many practicing physicians fail to recognise it or even suspect it may be an underlying cause of symptoms. “Complaints about brain fog in young patients are very common and are mostly benign,” Dr Knopman told me. “It’s hard to know when they’re not attributable to stress, depression or anxiety or the result of normal ageing. Even neurologists infrequently see patients with young-onset dementia.” Yet recent studies indicate that the problem is far more common than most doctors realise. Worldwide, as many as 3.9 million people younger than 65 may be affected, a Dutch analysis of 74 studies indicated. The study, published in JAMA Neurology in September, found that for every 100,000 people aged 30 to 64, 119 had early dementia. The accompanying editorial by Dr Knopman called young-onset dementia “an underappreciated problem.” Its diagnosis, Dr Knopman wrote, is often delayed, and knowledge about its management is “in short supply as well.”
  THE VARIOUS CAUSES OF EARLY-ONSET DEMENTIA The Dutch study found that overall, Alzheimer’s disease was the most common cause of young-onset dementia. But when symptoms developed before age 50, early-onset Alzheimer’s was a less likely explanation than two other causes: Vascular dementia and frontotemporal dementia. Vascular dementia results from a blockage or injury to blood vessels in the brain that interfere with circulation and deprive the brain of oxygen and nutrients. Its most common symptoms, in addition to memory problems, are confusion, difficulty concentrating, trouble organising thoughts or tasks, and slowed thinking. In frontotemporal dementia, portions of the brain that lie behind the forehead and ears shrink, resulting in dramatic personality changes, socially inappropriate or impulsive behavior and emotional indifference. Movement and memory problems typically develop later in the course of the disease. According to the Mayo Clinic, frontotemporal dementia often begins between the ages of 40 and 65 and may be misdiagnosed as a psychiatric problem. Lewy body disease is another cause of dementia in younger adults. It is associated with abnormal deposits of a protein called alpha-synuclein in the brain that affects brain chemistry and leads to behavioural, thought and movement problems. Most of the symptoms are similar to those seen in other dementias, and additional symptoms like hallucinations may resemble schizophrenia, but the decline in brain function occurs significantly faster. A distinguishing symptom of Lewy body dementia is having violent dreams and attempting to act them out, Dr Knopman said. Alzheimer’s disease remains the most common cause of dementia in younger as well as older adults. There is an inherited form of Alzheimer’s that typically arises at younger ages, but those cases account for fewer than 10 per cent of young-onset disease. Most cases of Alzheimer’s occur sporadically, for unknown reasons, though genetic factors may increase risk. People with Alzheimer’s typically have a buildup of abnormal substances – tau and beta-amyloid proteins – in the brain. Early symptoms include impaired memory, language problems, difficulty concentrating and finishing tasks, poor judgment and visual or spatial deficits that result in problems like driving errors and getting lost. Brain scans may show a loss of brain cells and an impaired ability to metabolise glucose that is indicative of degenerative brain disease. Probably the most publicised factor known to increase the risk of early dementia is repeated head injuries like those experienced by professional boxers, football and soccer players, and sometimes by military veterans. Once brain cells are injured or lost, there’s no going back. So preventing head injuries is the best possible protection at the moment. Many parents these days try to discourage youngsters from playing sports like football, in which repeated head injuries are common. However, proper and consistent use of helmets and not heading the ball in soccer can limit their risk of head injuries. Dr Knopman said he’s less concerned with elementary school children playing such sports; the risk of developing dementia at a young age from repeated head trauma is much greater among those who played Division 1 football or became professional boxers. Among older adults in general, the same inflammatory factors associated with atherosclerosis, the clogging and hardening of the arteries that nourish the heart, can also afflict blood vessels that feed the brain. Body-wide inflammation linked to diabetes and heart disease can cause brain changes that promote dementia. DIAGNOSIS OF EARLY-ONSET DEMENTIA Accurately diagnosing young-onset dementia can be difficult and time-consuming and should start with a detailed medical history, Dr Knopman said. “If doctors don’t ask the right questions, families may fail to mention a telltale symptom like violent dreams.” A thorough cognitive assessment of the person’s memory and language difficulties is critical, he said. Does the person stumble over words or say “white” when he means “black”? Neuropsychological tests can detect subtle difficulties with memory, visual, cognitive and executive functions. A brain scan is needed to rule out the possibility that a tumour is causing the person’s cognitive symptoms. A spinal tap and analysis of the spinal fluid can reveal elevated levels of tau and beta-amyloid proteins in the brain. An MRI can depict shrinkage in specific parts of the brain. And a glucose PET scan can uncover abnormal patterns of sugar uptake in various parts of the brain that can help distinguish between Alzheimer’s disease, Lewy body dementia and frontotemporal dementia. “Different degenerative brain diseases have specific patterns of glucose uptake,” Dr Knopman said. As with older dementia patients, it’s essential to keep young people with dementia safe. They should no longer drive, operate dangerous equipment, including the stove, or be left alone. All should wear an identifying tag day and night that alerts others to their condition. By Jane E Brody © 2022 The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/why-do-women-gain-belly-fat-midlife-and-can-diet-or-exercise-help-2443996,Why do women gain belly fat in midlife? And can diet or exercise help?,"If you’re a middle-aged woman and you’re noticing that your midsection is expanding, the first thing to know is that you’re not alone. “This is a physiological change that, unfortunately, really happens to virtually all women as we age,” said Victoria Vieira-Potter, an associate professor of nutrition and exercise physiology at the University of Missouri. “It’s not something you did,” she added, or an indication that you’re letting yourself go, so to speak. In the years leading up to menopause, Dr Vieira-Potter said, levels of hormones like estrogen shift. And research suggests that these shifts likely lead to changes in body shape, she said – along with hot flashes, mood changes, irregular periods, trouble sleeping and more. This perimenopausal transition, which typically begins between 45 and 55 and lasts for about seven years, officially ends one year after the last period. At that point, women are said to be in menopause. Before the menopausal transition, women tend to store more of their body fat in the thighs and hips, resulting in a “pear-shaped” body, Dr Vieira-Potter explained, while men tend to store more fat in the abdominal area, making them more “apple-shaped.” But around menopause, there’s a striking change in where women store fat on their bodies, said Dr Gail Greendale, a professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. In one 2021 study, for instance, Dr Greendale and her colleagues tracked how the bodies of 380 middle-aged women in Boston and Los Angeles changed over 12 years, including the time before, during and after their transitions to menopause. While the results varied according to race and ethnicity, the overall outcome was that around menopause, the women started storing fat more like men – less around the thighs and hips and more around their midsections. For example, among the white and Black women in the study, there was no net change in their hip and thigh fat over the 12 years, but their midsection fat increased, on average, by 24 and 17 per cent, respectively. They gained midsection fat most quickly during the few years before and one year after their final period. In other words, Dr Vieira-Potter said, women “start to adopt that apple shape instead of the pear shape.” It’s also common for men to gain more fat in their midsections as they age, but it is a slower and steadier change. “There’s no analogous thing in men where an organ just goes ‘Later!’ and shuts down,” Dr Greendale said, referring to women’s ovaries during menopause. According to Dr Greendale, researchers don’t know exactly why these shifts in fat storage occur. But while normal, they are something to keep an eye on, she added. Increases in belly fat – and in particular, the type of visceral fat that sits deep inside the abdomen and surrounds the organs – have been linked to certain increased health risks, like of heart disease, diabetes and cancer. This fat, which can expand not only with menopause, but with stress, lack of exercise, poor diet and more, is the “troublemaker fat,” Dr Greendale said. On the other hand, fat stored in the thighs and hips, creating the so-called pear shape, seems to protect against diabetes and heart disease. Despite the ubiquitous internet ads claiming to hold the secret to shrinking belly fat, experts really don’t know how to address the waistline expansion associated with menopause, Dr Greendale said. Researchers are only just beginning to understand how and why the body changes in this life stage, and she’s careful not to promote a solution without evidence that it works. “What worries me is that women who are trying to do right by themselves and keep up their exercise habits and eat a good diet may feel defeated” if their belly fat doesn’t budge, she said. “They may be doing everything they can, and their central fat may just have a mind of its own.” Excessive dieting and exercising too much can also be harmful, she pointed out. That said, getting at least 2.5 to 5 hours of moderate physical activity per week has been shown to help prevent heart disease and diabetes, both conditions associated with increased abdominal fat. Following a healthy diet – including one that incorporates plenty of fruits, vegetables and whole grains, and that prioritises fish, legumes, nuts, low-fat dairy and lean meats as sources of protein – can help protect against these conditions, too. Physical activity also helps to maintain healthy muscle and bone mass and improves insulin functioning, Dr Vieira-Potter said. “Even if you’re exercising and not losing weight, you’re doing lots of good metabolically.” Exercise feels good, too, and might help counter some of the mood changes that can come with menopause. It doesn’t need to be intense or strenuous to be beneficial, Dr Vieira-Potter said. “Just find something you love.” And, if you’re still feeling discouraged by your changing body, despite a good diet and exercise programme, Dr Greendale recommended a dose of self compassion. “If my middle is resistant, I’m going to understand that may be part of the life stage I’m in.” By Alice Callahan  © 2022 The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/children-parents-screen-time-health-physical-activity-sleep-2450156,"'Time-poor parents': Most young children in Singapore get excessive screen time, KKH survey shows","  SINGAPORE: Most children aged three to seven in Singapore spend more than the recommended amount of time looking at screens for recreation – exceeding a research group's guideline of not more than one hour, with many even getting two hours a day on weekends. The findings from a survey by KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) were released on Friday (Jan 21) together with a new set of activity guidelines for young children aged seven years and under. The survey of 340 parents from September to October last year found that time allocation for physical activity, sleep and recreational screen viewing were ""suboptimal"" among young children. There was a general lack of awareness, with more than half of the parents wrongly estimating the recommendation durations of time for physical activity and recreational screen use, said KKH. The survey results helped to inform new early childhood guidelines developed by the KKH-led Integrated Platform for Research in Advancing Metabolic Health Outcomes of Women and Children (IPRAMHO). The guidelines include strategies to reduce Singapore's childhood myopia rate, which is among the highest in the world. They also include ways to ""promote family unit practices as most Asian parents are time-poor"", said the hospital. Under the new guidelines, children of pre-schooling age – between three and seven years – are recommended to have no more than one hour of recreational screen time a day. However, KKH's survey found that 75 per cent of pre-schoolers had an average one hour of recreational screen viewing time on weekdays, while 95 per cent had an average two hours a day on weekends. Excessive screen time was also seen in the younger age groups. The guidelines recommend no screen time for infants under 12 months and toddlers up to 18 months. Toddlers aged 18 months to three years should get less than one hour. Instead, the survey found that 30 per cent of infants were given one hour of screen time a day. As for toddlers under 18 months, 70 per cent of them viewed screens for half an hour on weekdays. This figure rose to 80 per cent on weekends. Researchers said that parents who role-model healthy recreational screen time encourage healthy habits in children. However, half of the parents surveyed said they only occasionally limited their recreational screen use when spending time with their children, while 1 per cent said that they never do. The findings reflect the ""lifestyle patterns of typical urbanites including Singaporeans"", said KKH consultant Dr Benny Loo, who also chaired the work group for the guidelines. ""Time-poor parents are not putting sufficient emphasis on activities for children and relying heavily on electronic devices for the children's activities and even child minding. COVID-19 has worsened the situation. ""Our young children are kept at home more, have fewer social interactions and physical activities, using electronic devices for longer periods of time, and sleeping less."" The guidelines also cover recommended durations of physical activity: At least 180 minutes for toddlers and pre-schoolers, with daily outdoor play encouraged, and 30 minutes of ""tummy time"" for infants, during which the baby is laid on his or her tummy as a form of exercise. However, the survey found that 40 per cent of toddlers and pre-schoolers averaged only 90 minutes of physical activity, while 40 per cent of infants were given only 15 minutes of tummy time or floor-based play. The guidelines also advise avoiding screen time 30 minutes before bed, and stipulate recommended sleeping durations for the various age groups. The survey showed infants aged zero to three months had the largest proportion who were not getting enough sleep, with 35 per cent sleeping for eight to 11 hours daily instead of at least 14 hours as recommended. Eating habits and diet are also covered in the guidelines, which were developed based on locally and globally established studies and best practices as well as the survey. KKH said this is the first set of integrated activity guidelines for early childhood in Singapore. It is part of a series by IPRAMHO that also includes guidelines for children and teens aged seven to 18 years, which were released in 2021. IPRAMHO is one of the main programmes by the research institute on maternal and child health at KKH that launched last year, said the hospital. Emerging evidence over the past five years show that physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep for young children are closely related, said senior consultant Professor Tan Kok Hian, lead investigator of the research group. Eating behaviours and calorie intake are also linked, and ""together, these have a significant impact on a child's health outcome"". ""We are laying the foundation for transformation of our nation's health for generations to come,"" said Prof Tan. Editor’s note: An earlier version of this story said guidelines for children and teens aged seven to 18 years were released in 2020. This has been amended to 2021 following a clarification from KKH."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/prior-covid19-infection-natural-immunity-more-protection-vaccine-2446426,Prior COVID-19 infection more protective than vaccination during Delta surge: US study,"People who had previously been infected with COVID-19 were better protected against the Delta variant than those who were vaccinated only, suggesting that natural immunity was a more potent shield than vaccines against that variant, California and New York health officials reported on Wednesday (Jan 19). Protection against Delta was highest, however, among people who were both vaccinated and had survived a previous COVID-19 infection, and lowest among those who had never been infected or vaccinated, the study found. Nevertheless, vaccination remains the safest strategy against COVID-19, according to the report published in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. The results do not apply to the Omicron variant of the virus, which now accounts for 99.5 per cent of COVID-19 cases in the United States. ""The evidence in this report does not change our vaccination recommendations,"" Dr Ben Silk of the CDC and one of the study's authors told a media briefing. ""We know that vaccination is still the safest way to protect yourself against COVID-19,"" he said. For the study, health officials in California and New York gathered data from May through November last year, which included the period when the Delta variant was dominant. It showed that people who survived a previous infection had lower rates of COVID-19 than people who were vaccinated only. That represented a change from the period when the Alpha variant was dominant, Silk told the briefing. ""Before the Delta variant, COVID-19 vaccination resulted in better protection against a subsequent infection than surviving a previous infection,"" he said. In the summer and fall of 2021, however, when Delta became the predominant circulating iteration of the virus in the United States, ""surviving a previous infection now provided greater protection against the subsequent infection than vaccination"", he said. But acquiring immunity through natural infection carries significant risks. According to the study, by Nov 30, 2021, roughly 130,781 residents of California and New York had died from COVID-19. The analysis did not include information on the severity of initial infection, nor does it account for the full range of illness caused by prior infection. One important limitation to the study was that it ended before administration of vaccine booster doses was widespread. Dr Erica Pan, state epidemiologist for the California Department of Public Health, said in an email that the study ""clearly shows"" that vaccines provide the safest protection against COVID-19 and they offer added protection for those with prior infections. ""Outside of this study, recent data on the highly contagious Omicron variant shows that getting a booster provides significant additional protection against infection, hospitalisation and death,” Pan said. Silk said the CDC is studying the impact of vaccination, boosters and prior infection during the Omicron surge and expects to issue further reports when that data becomes available. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/antibiotics-drug-resistance-infection-death-2446811,More than 1.2 million people died from drug-resistant infections in 2019: Study,"More than 1.2 million people died in 2019 from infections caused by bacteria resistant to multiple antibiotics, higher than HIV/AIDS or malaria, according to a new report published on Thursday (Jan 20). Global health officials have repeatedly warned about the rise of drug-resistant bacteria and other microbes due to the misuse and overuse of antibiotics, which encourages microorganisms to evolve into ""superbugs"". The new Global Research on Antimicrobial Resistance report, published in The Lancet, revealed that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was directly responsible for an estimated 1.27 million deaths and associated with about 4.95 million deaths. The study analysed data from 204 countries and territories. ""These new data reveal the true scale of antimicrobial resistance worldwide ... Previous estimates had predicted 10 million annual deaths from AMR by 2050, but we now know for certain that we are already far closer to that figure than we thought,"" said Chris Murray, co-author of the study and a professor at the University of Washington. Last year, the World Health Organization warned that none of the 43 antibiotics in development or recently approved medicines were enough to combat antimicrobial resistance. Cornelius Clancy, professor of Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, said one of the ways to tackle antimicrobial resistance is to look at a new treatment model. ""The traditional antibiotic model that we've had for (the) past number of decades since penicillin. I think it is tapped out."" Most of 2019's deaths were caused by drug resistance in lower respiratory infections such as pneumonia, followed by bloodstream infections and intra-abdominal infections. Antimicrobial resistance's impact is now most severe in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, while around one in five deaths is in children aged under five years. There was limited availability of data for some regions, particularly many low- and middle-income countries, which may restrict the accuracy of the study's estimates. Clancy said the focus has been on COVID-19 for the past two years, but antimicrobial resistance is a ""long-term kind of challenge""."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/tips-lower-cholesterol-levels-diet-exercise-food-2432771,How to lower cholesterol levels: Experts explain why your diet or exercise routine isn’t working,"Cholesterol. You know it as the waxy fat or lipid that exists in your blood. High cholesterol levels are a cause for concern as they are an established risk factor for atherosclerosis (the thickening or hardening of the arteries) and coronary artery disease (the build-up of plaque in the arteries). Depending on where the cholesterol pools, it can also lead to stroke.  The gameplan is to keep your cholesterol levels as low as possible. But what if the opposite seems to be happening to you over the years?  You aren’t alone because the likelihood of dyslipidemia does increase with age. It is a condition referring to the unhealthy levels of one or more kinds of lipids in your blood (including high-density lipoprotein or HDL; low-density lipoprotein or LDL; and triglycerides).  “Human beings are born with low cholesterol levels, which increase with age and eating habits,” said Professor Tan Huay Cheem, a senior consultant with the Department of Cardiology at National University Heart Centre, Singapore.  Take, for instance, the LDL or “bad” cholesterol level of newborns. It starts at between 30mg/dL and 70mg/dL but typically rises above 100mg/dL by age 20, added Prof Tan.  As a basis, the LDL level should be kept below 130mg/dL. However, the average LDL level among those newly diagnosed with high blood cholesterol in Singapore was 186mg/dL for 2019 to 2020, according to the recent National Population Health Survey 2019/2020.  THE CHOLESTEROL NUMBERS TO KEEP TO It is recommended that you start screening for high cholesterol from the age of 40, said Dr Ian Phoon, a family physician and the clinical lead for the Cardiovascular Health Workgroup at SingHealth Polyclinics.  “However, start screening from age 30 if you have other risk factors such as a family history, obesity, associated diabetes and/or hypertension, sedentary lifestyle and a diet rich in saturated or trans fat,” he said. Prof Tan goes even further and suggested screening from as young as 18 years of age if you have the above risk factors. “Patients who are born with genetically high cholesterol conditions (more on familial hypercholesterolemia later) can even develop coronary artery disease in their teenage years,” he explained.  On the whole, the Health Promotion Board recommends keeping your cholesterol numbers to the following: You should consult a doctor if your LDL cholesterol level is higher than 160mg/dL, said Prof Tan. WAYS YOU COULD BE SABOTAGING YOUR EFFORTS Your body does need some cholesterol to be healthy. “It is an essential component of every cell in your body, giving cell membranes strength and flexibility,” said Prof Tan. “It plays important roles in the production of hormones, vitamin D and bile necessary for digesting fats.” Even so, you’ll only need less than 300mg a day as recommended by the Ministry of Health. So when it comes to lowering your cholesterol levels, keeping your weight under control is likely your MO. You might follow a certain diet, eat less of certain foods and exercise more. You may even be put on statins (cholesterol-lowering medicines) by your doctor to help you manage.  But despite the efforts, the numbers aren’t quite coming down as you’d expect. What could be going wrong and how do you rectify it? Here’s a look: The keto diet is a high fat, moderate protein and low carbohydrate diet, which can result in significant weight loss, especially among people with obesity, said Prof Tan.  He added: “However, the long-term health consequences of this diet are uncertain and there is no evidence to suggest that it improves cardiovascular health. Some people with genetically high triglyceride levels can even develop serious complications such as pancreatitis from high fat consumption”. Furthermore, saturated fats are not restricted in the keto diet, which will likely increase the LDL level, said Dr Phoon. Saturated fats – found in foods including red meat, ghee and butter – are bad news as they increase LDL levels. But because carbs are omitted in the keto diet, you’ll need a substantial amount of fat to meet your daily energy needs, he said. Not only that, being on such a restrictive diet may also mean a lack of fruit and vegetable intake, and along with it, a lack of vitamins, minerals and fibre, added Dr Phoon. “This may cause constipation and even piles. It is also difficult to maintain such a diet for the long term.” Yes, animal products such as fatty meat, organ meat, skin, seafood and full-fat dairy products are known sources of saturated fat. But here’s the thing: The bad fat is also present in trans fat (it is manufactured by adding hydrogen to vegetable oil to solidify it at room temperature) as well as coconut and palm oils, said Prof Tan.  And trans fat is pervasive; it can be found in myriad commercial foods ranging from bread to margarine, instant noodles, ice cream and frozen pizza.   “Singapore has banned the use of trans fat since June 2021,” said Prof Tan. But you might still come across some foods that contain it. Look out for “partially hydrogenated vegetable oil” in the ingredient list.  Restricting saturated fat and cholesterol intake may sound perfectly logical to lower your cholesterol levels (you are what you eat, right?). But there’s a catch: Such measures can lower blood cholesterol levels by up to 20 per cent at best, said Prof Tan.  “The rest of your blood cholesterol comes from your liver’s own production. Therefore, it is not surprising that one will have to rely on a combination of lifestyle change and medications,” he said. There are good and bad news when it comes to the effects of exercise on cholesterol levels. First, the bad: The impact of regular exercise on LDL level is actually very limited, said Prof Tan. “Exercise can improve the lipid profile (such as reduce the triglyceride level and increase HDL level) by causing weight loss, but the magnitude of the effect is also small.” He added: “However, in obese persons, this may still be useful in that a decrease in LDL concentration of 8mg/dL can be observed for every 10kg of weight loss”. Now, the good: Exercise may increase the HDL or “good” cholesterol level modestly. “An increase of the HDL level by 6mg/dL may be achieved with 25km to 30km of brisk walking per week,” he said. When it comes to lowering your cholesterol levels, those muscle-building reps at the gym or any other strength-building workouts may not be as effective as aerobic exercise such as jogging, brisk walking, cycling and swimming, according to Dr Phoon.  “Aerobic exercise tends to move big muscle groups, and raises the heart and breathing rates for about 20 to 30 minutes. It is considered a ‘total body exercise’ as compared to other exercises that focus only on some muscle groups,” he said. The recommendation is to aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise (you should be able to talk but not sing) a week, he advised. “The exercise can be split into several days, such as 30 minutes per day, over five days a week.” Your genes account for 80 per cent of your blood cholesterol; diet makes up the rest, said Prof Tan. So when you’re diagnosed with a genetic disposition such as familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), which causes the liver to be ineffective at removing excess “bad” or LDL cholesterol, it can be a double whammy. In Singapore, there are about 20,000 such patients, which means one in 300 people has the defective gene, said Prof Tan. “However, more than 90 per cent are unaware of this condition and remain undiagnosed,” he said.  According to Prof Tan, if left untreated, men with FH have a 50 per cent risk of having heart disease by age 50; women run a 30 per cent risk by age of 60.  Patients with FH have extremely high levels of cholesterol from adolescence, said Dr Phoon. “They may even show skin deposits of cholesterol under their eyes or back of their hands.” Other signs of FH, said Prof Tan, include: “Such patients will always need medications to control their cholesterol levels and survey their health conditions closely,” said Prof Tan.  It has been a couple of weeks since you’ve given up kway chap and taken up cycling. But at your last medical check-up, the numbers still aren’t budging. What gives?  It can take between three and six months to see lower LDL numbers through just diet and exercise, according to Prof Tan. “LDL levels can be lowered by 10 per cent to 20 per cent through lifestyle modifications. With medications, the reduction may be observed earlier at two months.” The doctor’s decision to put you on statin (cholesterol-controlling medicine) is not made lightly, said Dr Phoon. What is your risk of getting a heart attack in the next 10 years? Would diet and lifestyle changes already work if your risk is low or moderate?  “If nothing improves after 12 weeks of these changes, statin should be started to lower one’s risk of a heart attack or stroke,” he said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/gates-wellcome-pledge-us150-million-each-pandemic-preparedness-group-2444126,"Gates, Wellcome pledge US$150 million each to pandemic preparedness group","CHICAGO: Global health charities the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust each pledged US$150 million to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to fund its COVID-19 pandemic response and help put it on better footing for future major health crises. The pledges, announced on Tuesday (Jan 18), come ahead of a Mar 8 fundraising event sponsored by the UK government that aims to raise US$3.5 billion on behalf of CEPI, an international coalition set up five years ago to prepare for future disease threats. CEPI's five-year strategy aims in part to compress vaccine development timelines to 100 days, around a third of the time it took the world to develop the first COVID-19 vaccines. ""The unprecedented spread of the highly infectious Omicron variant around the world over the past two months exemplifies the ways in which we must be ready both in terms of speed and the scale of our response to future threats,"" CEPI chief executive Richard Hatchett told reporters in a briefing on Tuesday. ""We must endeavor to take pandemic threats off the table if we can,"" he said. Hatchett said that delivering COVID-19 vaccines within 11 months was unprecedented, but not good enough. Had they been developed within 100 days, CEPI's pandemic goal, a COVID-19 vaccine could have been available as early as April 2020. Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of Wellcome, said an important lesson from the pandemic has been the need to have systems in place that allow for a rapid response when a crisis arrives. ""None of us believe Omicron will be the last variant or that COVID-19 will be the last pandemic,"" he said. Bill Gates, co-chair of the Gates Foundation, said research and development investment should be commensurate with the future risk of pandemics. The latest Gates pledge brings the charity's investment in CEPI to US$270 million over the last five years, and its total pandemic investment to US$2 billion. ""We want the world not to forget about how bad this pandemic was,"" he said. CEPI made early investments in 14 COVID-19 vaccine candidates, including those from Oxford-AstraZeneca and Novavax, which recently received a World Health Organization emergency listing. The group is also working on next-generation COVID-19 vaccines effective across variants and future coronaviruses in the same family. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/gilead-says-counterfeiting-network-sold-us250-million-worth-its-hiv-drugs-2443826,Gilead says counterfeiting network sold US$250 million worth of its HIV drugs,"NEW YORK: Gilead Sciences said an unauthorised network of drug distributors and suppliers sold pharmacies more than US$250 million of counterfeit versions of its HIV treatments over the last two years, endangering patients. The drugmaker said it found 85,247 bottles that had been tampered with or faked, including versions of its Biktarvy and Descovy treatments. Gilead said counterfeiters used authentic, but often empty or near-empty, bottles that once contained its HIV medication. It said the counterfeiters then substituted fake tablets and documentation, and resealed the bottles so they would ""resemble"" unopened, authentic bottles. The alleged scheme was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal. Gilead disclosed its anti-counterfeiting efforts on the same day a federal judge in Brooklyn unsealed a related civil lawsuit that the Foster City, California-based company filed last July. The company accused 22 defendants of violating federal trademark and New York consumer protection laws for their roles in the distribution of ""dangerous"" counterfeits to ""unsuspecting patients, placing the patients' health and lives at risk"". Gilead said a common counterfeit was an anti-psychotic drug that often causes drowsiness, where tablets were six times more potent than the US Food and Drug Administration recommended for some patients. It said one patient who unknowingly took that drug after receiving a fake bottle of Biktarvy reported being unable to speak or walk afterward. The lawsuit seeks, among other remedies, seizures of counterfeit drugs, in addition to court-ordered seizures that have already occurred. Gilead had warned the public about HIV counterfeits last Aug 5, two weeks after filing the lawsuit under seal. Global sales of the company's HIV treatments totaled US$4.19 billion in the quarter ending Sep 30, 2021, including US$2.71 billion of Biktarvy and Descovy. Lori Mayall, Gilead's top anti-counterfeiting executive, said the presiding judge in its lawsuit ordered the defendant distributors to stop selling Gilead-branded medications, and the company was unaware of any defendant violating that order. ""We therefore believe that we have successfully stopped any additional counterfeits from these defendants reaching patients,"" Mayall said in a statement."

(7:35) While mala contains many ingredients (one chef’s sauce had more than 30 spices and ingredients, including star anise, cinnamon, aromatic ginger, cloves and fennel), the ones that give it its signature taste are Sichuan peppercorns and dried chilli. Both are purported to have health benefits. Sichuan peppercorns — which give the numbing effect — are dried berries, which are said to boost the immune system, help reduce body pains and increase one’s metabolism, among other benefits. Dried chilli contains minerals like folate, potassium and thiamine, and is a good source of vitamins A, B and C. Capsaicin, the compound that makes chillies hot, is even said to help lead to weight loss. But cardiologist Calvin Chin from the National Heart Centre Singapore sounded a cautionary note. While chilli may help to boost metabolism, the weight lost would be “very modest”: About 1 kilogramme over three or four months of eating chilli every day, he reckoned. “Once your tolerance of chilli builds up over time, the effects of losing weight from chilli … reduce over time as well,” he added. As for Sichuan peppercorns, he said the health benefits are also “very modest” and require eating a “large amount” of an ingredient that “isn’t very palatable for a lot of people”. More important, he noted, the oil and salt content in mala is “really unhealthy” and can increase the risk of heart disease. To find out just how unhealthy mala is, and whether the spice level makes a difference to the sodium and fat levels, Talking Point tested three top hotpot and stir-fried brands as recommended by food bloggers. The results showed that 100 grammes of mala broth had, on average, 418 milligrammes of sodium, while stir-fried mala had 470mg — compared with 163mg of sodium per 100g of mutton biryani, 294mg in laksa and 337mg in roasted chicken rice. Drinking more than that amount of broth — as one is wont to do for a hotpot meal — or adding ingredients like meat and processed food means adding to the sodium levels. “You can easily hit about 1,000mg and sometimes more than 1,500mg of sodium,” said Wong Weng Wai, a lecturer from Temasek Polytechnic’s Centre for Applied Nutrition Services. By comparison, the World Health Organisation’s recommended maximum daily sodium intake is 2,000mg. The tests also found 3.8g of saturated fat in 100g of stir-fried mala on average and 4.9g in the oil layer of the hotpot, compared with saturated fat in mutton biryani (2.9g), laksa (3.3g) and roasted chicken rice (2.3g). Wong noted that an adult should not exceed about 22g of saturated fats per day. “With all the ingredients (in the hotpot), easily you’ll get more than 20g,” he said. The tests showed that prolonged heating of the soup can make it unhealthier, as the high-heat process can convert healthier unsaturated fats like polyunsaturated fat into trans-fatty acids and saturated fatty acids. “They’ll produce other toxic chemicals as well as free radicals that’ll attack your body,” said Wong. The spicier it is, the worse it gets too. Stir-fried mala with less spice contained 380mg of sodium and 3.4g of saturated fats per 100g, while the one with extra spice had 519mg of sodium and 6.3g of saturated fats. “If you want (it) extra spicy, they’ll add more oil,” said Wong. “More oil means more fats.” According to dietitian Jacqueline Loh from Mount Alvernia Hospital, there are healthier ways to eat mala. She, for one, usually sees to it that the oil at the top of the broth is removed after her ingredients are cooked. Sometimes the oil can fill three to four rice bowls, said Loh. In terms of choosing ingredients, she said those that have been deep-fried beforehand, such as fried tofu skin and fried yam, would “absorb double the amount of oil”. She also suggested blanching leafy vegetables like lettuce or spinach, instead of leaving them in the hotpot to cook fully and absorb the oil. The same principles apply to stir-fried mala. And one way of reducing the sodium level is to ask for less paste and less oil to be used. Our eyes tear when capsaicin, that substance in chillies, binds to the receptors in our nose and tongue, said gastroenterologist and liver specialist Wang Yu Tien at Gleneagles Hospital. Similarly, it binds to receptors in the stomach and intestine. And for those with sensitive stomachs, it triggers symptoms like nausea and diarrhoea. But there is good news: Tolerance for spice can be increased, said Wang. In the case of children, there is no ideal age when this training to take the spice should start. “It really depends on the individual tongue,” he said when interviewed for a Talking Point web extra. “Some (children) are more game — then it’s okay to try it. But if they’re not ready, starting them too early may cause them to be quite averse to it.” WATCH: The full episode — Spicy mala: What's really in your mala dish? (22.56)  Some people may feel that drinking water might help, while others point to orange juice or milk. But drinking water is not helpful, said Wang, as capsaicin is not soluble in water. “It’ll just make the person feel bloated and uncomfortable.” Orange juice is not a likely remedy either. There is a clear distinction between drinks without milk and milk-based drinks, he noted. That is because milk contains a protein called casein, which can bind to capsaicin and wash it away.  He added that alcohol — the hard kind — is another option, as it can dissolve capsaicin. Watch this episode of Talking Point here. The programme airs on Channel 5 every Thursday at 9.30pm."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/chinatown-enforcement-officers-covid-19-measures-chinese-new-year-2437791,More enforcement officers in Chinatown in run-up to Chinese New Year; additional measures to be implemented if needed,"SINGAPORE: More safe distancing ambassadors and enforcement officers will be deployed to Chinatown in the weekends leading up to Chinese New Year, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) said on Saturday (Jan 15). The three weekends are Jan 14 to Jan 16, Jan 21 to Jan 23, and Jan 28 to Jan 31.  STB said it will work closely with other authorities to monitor the crowd situation in Chinatown. Additional measures during peak hours will be implemented if necessary.  These possible measures include: Closing the pedestrian entry to Pagoda Street from New Bridge Road, limiting entry from Exit A of Chinatown MRT station at Pagoda Street, and closing Temple Street to vehicles. ""STB is working with the Chinatown Business Association and relevant government agencies to ensure shops and eateries do not extend their operations onto pedestrian paths, which could make it difficult for visitors to keep a safe distance,"" said the tourism board.  ""This includes hotspots along New Bridge Road, Pagoda Street and Trengganu Street."" It encouraged people to plan their visits to Chinatown and to visit during off-peak hours. They should also adhere to prevailing safe management measures, such as wearing masks, maintaining a distance of 1m from each other and remaining in groups of five people or fewer. ""We urge all to be socially responsible, to allow everyone to enjoy the festivities safely,"" said STB. To avoid crowds, people can shop for Chinese New Year products at a bazaar online, organised by the Kreta Ayer Community Club and Shopee. The online bazaar starts on Monday. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/it-possible-exercise-too-much-and-what-are-signs-youre-overdoing-it-2426921,Is it possible to exercise too much? And what are the signs you're overdoing it?,"You’ve probably been told countless times that exercise is good for your health and fitness, and it’s tempting to assume that more is automatically better. But as with so many other good things in life, there comes a point of diminishing returns, and it’s possible to overdo it. Exactly what constitutes too much physical activity, however, will depend on your individual situation. The first thing to ask yourself if you’re wondering whether you’ve exercised too much is: “Why are you exercising?” said Dr Benjamin Levine, a professor of internal medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and director of the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine at Texas Health Dallas. If your goal is to improve your health and reduce your risk of a range of conditions from diabetes to heart disease to cancer, then two and a half to three hours of moderate to vigorous exercise per week gets you the vast majority of benefits, Dr Levine said. “Once you get past five hours per week or so, you’re not exercising for health, you’re exercising for performance.” And when you’re exercising for performance – whether it’s to get stronger in the gym, run a marathon or improve your tennis game – it’s possible to stress your body beyond what it can bounce back from, said Kristen Dieffenbach, an exercise scientist and director of the Center for Applied Coaching and Sport Sciences at West Virginia University.  For athletes, the purpose of training is to induce a so-called training response, she said. You work out, and your body responds by getting fitter, stronger and faster. These improvements don’t happen during the workout itself, but occur during the recovery period. That’s when your body repairs the damage brought on by hard exercise, like micro tears in your muscle fibers, and makes adaptations, like increasing the energy-producing mitochondria in your cells. As long as your body is able to keep up with this repair work, your workouts will continue to aid your performance, Dr Dieffenbach said. But when the stress from your workouts builds up beyond your capacity to recover, you have entered the zone of too much, known in the sporting community as overtraining. What makes things tricky is that the line between training hard and overtraining is fuzzy. There’s no formula or number that can tell you what’s too much, Dr Dieffenbach said. Instead, what matters is how your body responds to the exercise you’re doing. Dr Dieffenbach suggested thinking of exercise and the physical and emotional resources it requires as calling upon money in a bank. You have only so much in your budget, and if you try to overspend, you’re going to end up worn down or injured, and probably cranky. Over time, your exercise budget can change. As you age, your body requires more time for recovery, so you may need to factor in more rest between hard workouts. It’s also constrained by the other things going on in your life. Spending long hours at work or traveling, or dealing with stressful situations at home, can gobble up some of your energetic budget and diminish your capacity for recovering from exercise, Dr Dieffenbach said. One 2016 study of 101 college football players, for instance, found that their risk of injury nearly doubled during times of academic stress (like during midterms and finals weeks). The most reliable signs that you’re exercising too much come from your subjective feelings of well-being, Dr Dieffenbach said. If you’re suddenly tired all the time, or workouts that used to seem easy feel hard, or your performance has dropped unexpectedly (like your running times get slower without explanation, or your daily walk is taking longer than usual), it might be time to ramp down and rest, Dr Dieffenbach said.  Other classic signs of overtraining include trouble sleeping, feeling run down and not being able to shake minor colds and other respiratory infections. “Sometimes you have to back off to move forward,” Dr Dieffenbach said. If you find that you’re having to force yourself to do workouts you used to enjoy, or are feeling guilty about not exercising enough, those are other signs that you’ve overdone it. This is especially true if the feelings linger for more than a few days, Dr Dieffenbach said. (Of course, these may also be signs of other health issues, like depression, so it’s important to keep that in mind, too.) On the other hand, if you’re finding that your love of exercise is becoming more of an unhealthy obsession, that’s something to pay attention to as well, said Szabo Attila, a health psychologist who studies exercise addiction at Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest. An exercise addiction can occur when someone feels compelled to do physical activity, even if they are in pain or injured.  There isn’t one specific number of hours of exercise per week that would correlate with an exercise addiction, one of Dr Attila’s studies from 2019 found, but “it becomes problematic when it harms other aspects of life,” he said. If you’ve put exercise before your relationships, work and everything else, Dr Attila added, that’s a sign that it’s become too much. One of Dr Attila’s colleagues, Mark Griffiths, a psychologist at Nottingham Trent University in Britain, has developed six criteria for health providers to use when screening patients for exercise addiction: 1. Exercise is the most important thing in my life.  2. Conflicts have arisen between me and my family and/or my partner about the amount of exercise I do.  3. I use exercise as a way of changing my mood (e.g. to get a buzz, to escape, etc.). 4. Over time I have increased the amount of exercise I do in a day. 5. If I have to miss an exercise session I feel moody and irritable. 6. If I cut down the amount of exercise I do, and then start again, I always end up exercising as often as I did before. To classify as an addiction, a person would need to meet all six criteria, and that’s rare, Dr Griffiths said. But a lot of people exhibit problematic exercise that doesn’t quite reach the level of an addiction, he added. For instance, somebody who goes to work and functions normally, but then comes home and neglects their family so that they can go to the gym and work out – that’s still a problem. Which brings us to the ultimate answer to our question: Yes, it’s possible to exercise too much. And you’ll know you’re doing it when it’s breaking down your body, making you sick or injured or adversely affecting the rest of your life. When it stops making you feel good and enriching your life, it’s time to cut back. By Christie Aschwanden © The New York Times.  The article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/melatonin-sleep-chronic-insomnia-2432086,Melatonin for sleep: Is it really effective? Are there alternatives for chronic insomnia?,"Many people think of melatonin as a natural nod-off aid, kind of like chamomile tea in pill form. Even the name of the popular dietary supplement sounds sleepy – that long “o” sound almost makes you yawn mid-word. But melatonin is also a hormone that our brains naturally produce, and hormones, even in minuscule amounts, can have potent effects throughout the body. “There are some clinical uses for it, but not the way that it’s marketed and used by the vast majority of the general public,” said Jennifer Martin, a psychologist and professor of medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. Experts strongly urge people to consult their doctor or a sleep specialist before taking melatonin, in part because the supplement does not address many underlying health problems that may be disrupting sleep. Anxiety can cause insomnia, as can a host of other potentially serious ailments, such as sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome or mood disorders like depression, that may require medical treatment. Melatonin, however, is relatively inexpensive and readily available at local pharmacies in the United States (in other countries it typically requires a prescription), and many people will go out and buy it on their own. So what’s the best approach to taking melatonin? Here’s what experts had to say. HOW DOES MELATONIN WORK? During the day, the brain’s pea-sized pineal gland remains inactive. A few hours before our natural sleep time, as it starts to get dark outside and the light entering our retina fades, the gland switches on to flood the brain with melatonin. “Melatonin is sometimes called the ‘hormone of darkness’ or ‘vampire hormone,’” because it comes out at night, said Matthew Walker, a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of the book Why We Sleep. As levels of melatonin rise, levels of cortisol, the stress hormone, fall. Respiration slows. Soon, our eyelids begin to droop. Instead of a lights-out trigger, melatonin acts more like a dimmer switch, turning the day functions off and switching night functions on. So taking a melatonin supplement is sort of like taking a dose of sunset, tricking your body into feeling like it’s nighttime. It doesn’t put you to sleep as much as it tells the body that it’s time to sleep. “It may take several hours,” said Dr Ilene M Rosen, a sleep medicine doctor and associate professor of medicine at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, “which is what I think is the misconception about how melatonin is used.” Melatonin may make you feel a little drowsier when you take it, but it has a bigger impact on regulating the timing of your overall sleep-wake cycle and helping to set the circadian clock, the roughly 24-hour internal timekeeper that tells your body what time of day it is and syncs it with the outside world. “The impact it has on our sleep depends on the time of day that you take it,” said Dr Martin, who is also a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. “If you took a sleeping pill in the middle of the day, it would make you feel sleepy. If you took melatonin in the middle of the day, it doesn’t really have that effect.” Hypnotic drugs like Ambien or Benadryl generally cause people to feel sleepy right away, and the sedation effect of those medications “far exceeds that which they obtain from melatonin,” said Dr Alon Y Avidan, a professor of neurology and director of the Sleep Disorders Center at UCLA. HOW EFFECTIVE IS MELATONIN? In one analysis published in 2013 in PLOS One, which combined results from 19 studies involving 1,683 men and women, people who took melatonin supplements fell asleep seven minutes faster and increased overall sleep time by eight minutes. That may not sound like much, but there was a lot of individual variation, and researchers found that melatonin also improved overall sleep quality, including people’s ability to wake up feeling refreshed. But there’s no guarantee that melatonin will work for you. Dr Sabra Abbott, an assistant professor of neurology in sleep medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, said the most common complaint she hears from patients is “I tried melatonin and it didn’t work.” Many also feel hung over or groggy the next morning. Dr Martin said that in many studies, melatonin does not work any better than a placebo but added, “One caveat I always like to mention, though, is that placebos work pretty well for insomnia.” WHAT ABOUT DOSAGE? We naturally make melatonin in our brains, but only in picogram amounts, or one trillionth of a gram, which Dr Rosen described as “a whiff of it coming out at dusk.” Over-the-counter melatonin supplements come in much higher milligram doses, or a thousandth of a gram. That’s a big difference, although the amount that ultimately reaches the brain more closely approximates natural levels. Many experts recommend starting with the smallest available dosage – 0.5 milligrams to 1 milligram, 30 minutes to an hour before bedtime – and seeing how you do from there. If that has no effect, the dose can be gradually increased. “If you try a dose, stick to it for a few days before you make an adjustment,” Dr Martin said. “It’s one of those things that may not happen overnight.” “Keep a close eye on how you feel the next day,” Dr Abbott said. “Feeling groggy or hung over is a sign that the dose is probably too high.” ARE THERE SIDE EFFECTS? The good news: In the short term, at least, melatonin is unlikely to do any harm. “Compared to most other sleeping pills, the side-effect profile is much better,” and it’s not going to be addictive, said Dr Bhanu Prakash Kolla, an associate professor of psychiatry and a consultant at the Center for Sleep Medicine at the Mayo Clinic. But because melatonin can cause drowsiness, the Mayo Clinic warns that you shouldn’t drive or operate machinery within five hours of taking it. DOES MELATONIN AFFECT OUR DREAMS? “Far and away, the most common side effect that I have patients report to me is that their dreams just become much more vivid,” Dr Abbott said. Scientists aren’t sure why that happens. Dr Kolla has also seen patients who have nightmares or disruptive dreams, which are also common with sleeping pills. “In that case, you want to try to lower the dose,” he said. “Or, if it’s too problematic, stop.” HOW DO DOCTORS USE MELATONIN? Sleep doctors may use melatonin to help patients with circadian rhythm disorders regulate their sleep-wake cycles. For example, during the pandemic, Dr Avidan said, “we’ve seen those people who become super night owls” unable to fall asleep until 2 or 3am. Experts also suggest people use a bright light in the mornings to help them wake up, which has “alerting properties and can suppress any remaining melatonin production,” said Dr Abbott. SHOULD YOU TAKE MELATONIN FOR JET LAG? Jet lag is a circadian rhythm disorder, albeit a temporary one, so melatonin may help. To alleviate the worst effects, doctors recommend consulting one of several online calculators available, which ask you for your destination and arrival points, your flight time and your normal sleep patterns. Two sites that Dr Avidan recommends are Jet Lag Rooster or the calculator from Fleet Street Clinic. “They’re trying to tell you when to take the melatonin so your body knows: ‘Oh, it’s dusk where I’m going,’” Dr Rosen said, explaining how you can use the supplement before your trip to readjust your body clock. HOW DO YOU PICK A RELIABLE BRAND OF MELATONIN? Like other dietary supplements, melatonin is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, which means there may be wide variation among products. A study published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine found that the content of more than 70 percent of melatonin supplements varied widely from their label claims. The concentration ranged from 83 per cent less than the amount listed to 478 per cent more. Dr Kolla advised looking for a GLP (good laboratory practice) or GMP (good manufacturing practice) label, which refers to federal regulations designed to affirm a product has the advertised quality and purity. “You really don’t know what you’re getting, so you’re trusting the manufacturer,” he said. Melatonin comes in pills, gummies or liquid; the choice comes down to personal preference, he added. WHAT ARE ALTERNATIVES FOR CHRONIC INSOMNIA? Sleep doctors strongly urge people with chronic insomnia to seek out cognitive behavioural therapy, a short-term psychological treatment that can help get to the root of the problem. “If you give melatonin to a patient and you don’t complement it with behavioral therapy for insomnia, you may not necessarily see the effects that you’re looking for,” Dr Avidan said. Many common behaviors can also make it harder for us to fall – and stay – asleep, including using our phones near bedtime, which can hamper natural melatonin production. Meditation may help, as can warm showers and cool bedrooms, or giving up caffeine and alcohol. “There are a lot of other things people could do to help themselves sleep better,” Dr Martin said. “They’re just harder.”  By Amelia Nierenberg © The New York Times.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/exercise-backache-musculoskeletal-conditions-health-2427671,Commentary: More people are in pain – from sitting at their desks all day,"SINGAPORE: I was shocked when Mr Wong* limped into the consultation room.  Just three months ago, he seemed like a different man – despite pain in his knee he was able to climb the stairs and go on regular morning walks. Mr Wong, 67, was diagnosed with osteoarthritis of his knee and was referred to us as he was not keen for surgery. He had completed three sessions of physiotherapy.  But after those sessions, he cancelled his previous physiotherapy appointments because the number of COVID-19 cases were rising and he was afraid of contracting the virus. So he stopped his daily walks, stayed home to keep safe and subsequently put on weight because of increased snacking.  On the same day, Ms Loh*, a working adult, came in to see us for pain in her neck. This pain developed when working from home became the norm in her company. Her persistent pain was down to prolonged poor ergonomics and sitting posture. Ms Loh worked long hours on her laptop, without frequent breaks and her daily step count fell by more than 70 per cent since she started working from home. Mr Wong and Ms Loh are not isolated cases. At the Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) Outpatient Physiotherapy clinic, we are seeing a trend of patients developing sedentary-related musculoskeletal conditions.  On average, I see about 10 cases a week, up from three to four cases before the pandemic. These new cases would not otherwise require physiotherapy if not for the pandemic. Such preventable musculoskeletal conditions may be avoided if  they had adequate physical activities.  Added to this is a worrying trend of Singapore’s obesity rate, which has risen to the highest level since 2010, according to the Ministry of Health’s survey published in November 2021. What we see in our clinic shows how the pandemic has increased sedentary lifestyles. An example of a direct impact is the lack of movement when people work from home – if they go into the office, they are likely to take public transport or walk to lunch.  These opportunities to move are completely taken away and it is common for patients to sit at their desks from 9am and not move until 6pm. And after work, they sit even more – if they watch TV or scroll through social media to wind down.  The trouble is, human bodies are not designed to sit for long hours behind a desk nor be cooped up in an apartment for days. All our joints and muscles require regular movements and good musculoskeletal health helps reduce pain. Studies show that physical activity is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, Type 2 diabetes, cancer, obesity, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, hypertension, and depression. This means that the risk factors may be improved or prevented with physical activity. I have patients who changed their lifestyles and then had medication for hypertension and diabetes reduced. There is also ample research proof that exercise also eases anxiety – the release of endorphins plays a critical role in regulating our thoughts and feelings. Physical activity and exercise are such a critical part of pain and disease management in TTSH that we have an Early Mobilisation Programme to get patients to exercise, even if they are in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).  Those in ICU are also encouraged to get out of bed and walk the moment they are medically stable. Getting them to move even when they are critically ill have proven to help these patients maintain close to their pre-hospitalisation physical strength after discharge.   You may have read in news reports that patients who died from COVID-19 had multiple co-morbidities. These include obesity, hypertension, diabetes and heart disease.  While some of these conditions are genetic and unmodifiable, there are many which can be modified through lifestyle changes – chiefly, with regular exercise.  Recently published in the Journal of Infectious Disease, 511 people in the military who contracted COVID-19 were studied. The findings showed that obesity had a strong correlation to COVID-19 severity. In another large study of over 387,100 adults in the United Kingdom, the findings concluded that those who were physically less active, smoke and are obese had a four-fold risk of getting COVID-19 compared to those who had healthier lifestyles, suggesting that exercise and nutrition could lower the risk of severe infection and hospitalisation. Similarly, a Swedish study of 279,455 adults found that cardiorespiratory fitness and lifestyle played a large role in preventing severe COVID-19. The Health Promotion Board recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercises or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity exercises along with strengthening exercises at least twice a week. They also recommend incorporating balance training exercises for the elderly to prevent falls. The greatest difficulty, based on the patients we see, is getting started and keeping a routine going.  Which is why, we often start with getting patients to decide what bothers them the most – it could be constant pain for instance. Then we identify why they want to change – again, it can be to be free of pain, medication, to travel, play with their grandchildren and so on. A common reason people give about not exercising is that they cannot find the time. But one doesn’t need to carve out time especially for exercise to incorporate them in your day.  Think of it this way: 15 to 20 minutes of exercise at the start and end of your day is like a good vitamin pill you take. If you have no physical activity in a day, then snacking and processed foods should be cut. Make time to walk when you can, instead of driving or taking the bus. Climbing the stairs is good option too. While you are watching a show, use a sack of rice as weights or just spend 20 minutes at a fitness corner in your neighbourhood on your way to get groceries. The reason most of us have trouble keeping to our exercise commitments is because our goals are not specific enough. Using the SMART goal system, be specific (walk 5,000 steps daily), make it measurable (30 minutes of walking, 10 squats, five push-ups) and make it achievable (if your current average daily steps are 3,000, 10,000 steps may be too high. Start by setting 5,000 and then 8,000). Goals also need to be realistic. In the case of Ms Loh, her target was to perform one minute of stretches every hour of work. Finally, set a time frame (I will do 50 squats daily for one month). Having said all that, it is important that missing targets are part of the journey. Many patients I see feel discouraged when they don’t comply with the prescribed plans or they don’t see any progress.  It is okay to miss a day or two, what’s important is to get back to it. And if you hit milestones, don’t be shy about celebrating your success. We also live in a time where there are a wide array of resources. TTSH for instance has a Get Active e-booklet people can use to get them started. If you are struggling, you can always make an appointment with your doctor to help you. *Pseudonyms were used in this commentary. Justin Wee is principal physiotherapist at Tan Tock Seng Hospital."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/how-boost-immune-system-covid-19-sleep-diet-vitamin-supplement-2419966,"What’s best for boosting your immune system? Sleep, superfoods, exercise or supplements?","If there’s one thing that probably won’t change in the new year during these pandemic times, it’s our desire for healthier practices such as getting more sleep or devoting more time to self-care. Topping many people’s lists is something we’ve been trying to do a lot these past couple of years: Strengthening our immune system against COVID-19. And most recently, against a globally growing phenomenon: Flurona, when you get infected with both the influenza virus and COVID-19 coronavirus, either simultaneously or back to back. But first, what is the immune system about? The body’s natural defence doesn’t just consist of one organ that does all the work, according to Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases physician at Rophi Clinic, Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. It is, in fact, a complex network consisting of white blood cells, antibodies, spleen, bone marrow and thymus, he said.  Then, there are the complement system (which consists of proteins that enhance the attacking action of antibodies) and the lymphatic system (it traps microbes, reacts to bacteria and deals with cells that would otherwise result in disease), said Melanie Anthonysamy, the nutrition team lead at HealthifyMe.  She added that there are other lines of defence as well. These include the lungs (they produce mucus to trap foreign particles), digestive tract (the mucus lining contains antibodies, while the stomach acid can kill most microbes), skin (it’s a waterproof barrier that also secretes oil with bacteria-killing properties) and other bodily fluids (saliva, tears and urine).  All in all, the abovementioned makes up what is known as your innate immunity or “what you are born with and is written in your genes”, said Dr Leong.  There is another layer of protection, one that many Singaporeans are familiar with by now: Adaptive immunity that comes from a previous illness or through immunisation.  “This is where the system learns and develops a ‘memory’,” said Dr Leong. “Our immune system remembers every germ or microbe it has ever defeated in case it faces it again”.  But there is a caveat to this “memory”. “Our immune system is presented with a challenge when it encounters a different strain of the flu and can’t ‘remember’ how to fight it,” said Dr Leong. This is why there is a need for yearly flu jabs and COVID-19 booster shots to keep this “memory” up to date with the viruses’ evolution. Vaccination aside, what else is important? When it comes to our immune system, the general idea is: The stronger it is, the better it can protect us against diseases such as the headlining Omicron variant, right? But what exactly makes up the immune system? Can certain “superfoods” strengthen it? What about supplements – do they work at all? CNA Lifestyle puts all those questions and more to the experts. Here’s what they say. DOES GETTING ENOUGH SLEEP REALLY HELP TO BOOST OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM?   This is a keeper for sure. “One of the reasons for this is that quality sleep can bolster the number of T cells in your body, which are important for fighting infection,” said Dr Leong. Another reason is that the brain has a way of clearing waste and it is only activated during REM sleep, said Dr Leong. “The purpose of the glymphatic system is to flush the brain of the toxins accumulated throughout the day, while transporting antigens and other types of immune cells around the brain for optimum cognitive function.”  And like how vaccination creates “memory” for the body to fight off infections, sleep strengthens this memory or ability to recognise foreign invaders and pathogens, he said. And that means proper sleep, which translates into seven to nine hours every night.  In fact, it might be a good idea to turn in early after getting your flu or vaccination shot as studies have shown that a good night’s sleep strengthens the immune response, advised Dr Leong. DOES EATING MORE SUPERFOODS HELP? Google “superfood” and you’ll see lists that cover the entire alphabet, from avocado to zucchini.  So what makes a food super? “Some foods contain high amounts of certain nutrients or have unique health benefits,” explained Anthonysamy. Oily fish such as salmon, for instance, have been said to be some of the best sources of omega-3 fatty acids for bolstering the immune system. But here’s where it gets tricky. There is no scientifically based or regulated definition for superfoods, according to the Harvard School of Public Health website. In fact, the term “superfood” was coined by the United Fruit Company in the US around World War I to market the benefits of bananas to consumers.  Said Anthonysamy: “In my opinion, while these foods do contribute in some ways to strengthening our immune system, we should not just focus on consuming them alone in our diet. Remember that everything has to be taken in moderation as overeating any food can lead to side effects or toxicity”. And please, no food is a panacea if your diet is full of unhealthy, processed stuff. “If you’re eating junk food every day and supplementing with a punnet of blueberries, you won’t be reaping any of the benefits,” said Dr Leong.  Anthonysamy’s take? “Eat as diverse a diet as possible to reap the benefits of various nutrients for our body to function properly.”  DO WE NEED TO TAKE VITAMIN C DAILY TO KEEP OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM STRONG? The short answer: No. Popping vitamin C tablets daily has not been proven to “make more than a marginal difference”, said Dr Leong. The notion that vitamin C boosts immune function was made popular decades ago when it was found that interferon, the viral-blocking mechanism used by the body, needs vitamin C for manufacture. However, randomised controlled trials failed to prove this hypothesis. Anthonysamy agreed that vitamin C supplementation is not compulsory – especially if you’re already eating your fruits and vegetables. “It is also worth highlighting that we should not view vitamin C as the sole cure or nutrient for recovery. Instead, we have to make sure we consume other nutrients as well, as all of them play a role for our body to function well,” she said. A better bet against colds and the flu? Go for your annual jab, said Dr Leong. It is something to consider as the flu is expected to make a comeback when Singapore fully reopens, he added.  WHAT ABOUT OTHER SUPPLEMENTS? CAN WE OVER-BOOST OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM? More is not better if you’re trying to boost your immune system with supplements, said Dr Leong. First, you may not make much of a difference, he said. Secondly, your liver will take a beating as many of these “immunity boosters” contain mixes of zinc, and vitamins C and B26, which, when taken in large doses, can cause serious side effects.  Too much vitamin C, for instance, can lead to side effects such as nausea, vomiting, heartburn, diarrhoea, headache, stomach cramps and bloating, said Anthonysamy. “For more serious cases, it could lead to iron overload and kidney stones.” The overconsumption of zinc and vitamin B6 is another cause for concern. “Over the long term, zinc can lead to a copper deficiency, while vitamin B6 can lead to nerve damage, resulting in a tingling sensation in the hands and feet,” said Anthonysamy.  IS IT TRUE THAT DRINKING ENOUGH WATER CAN BOOST OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM? Anthonysamy explained that our immune system is “highly dependent” on the nutrients in our blood stream. And since the blood stream consists mostly of water, we cannot properly transport nutrients to each organ system if we do not drink enough water, she said.  “Staying well hydrated is also very important for removing toxins, such as increasing lymphatic drainage to clear out foreign invaders and waste materials,” she added. And finally, water is needed to produce mucus and saliva – your body’s other lines of defence.  In fact, if you’re recovering from a cold or flu, restoring the fluids and electrolytes lost is critical to recovery, said Dr Leong. “It can take almost 36 hours to orally rehydrate after being sick. A quick assessment of adequate fluid is the colour of the urine. Colourless urine indicates adequate fluids.” WHAT ABOUT EXERCISE? There are several good reasons for breaking into a sweat. For one, you get a better blood flow, which enables your immune cells to perform more effectively, said Dr Leong. Exercise can also decrease your stress hormone level. And not to mention, moderate-intensity exercise has been linked to lower rates of upper respiratory tract infections like cold and flu, cited Dr Leong.  Cardiovascular exercise appears to confer more benefits to the immune function, he continued, although “any form of exercise is better than no exercises at all”. Of course, this doesn’t give you the licence to head out for a 5km jog after getting your flu or booster shot. Better to adhere to your doctor’s guidelines when it comes to exercise. As for the niggling notion that exercise might weaken your immune system, it is unlikely so, said Dr Leong. “A person would likely need to be exercising for several hours a day at very high intensity over a prolonged period of time, and even then, it may not have much of an impact. A punishing exercise together with insufficient or unbalanced meals may instead be detrimental to health.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/pig-heart-transplant-us-man-recovering-2426801,US man recovering after 'breakthrough' pig heart transplant,"CHICAGO: A United States man with terminal heart disease was implanted with a genetically modified pig heart in a first-of-its-kind surgery, and three days later, the patient is doing well, his doctors reported on Monday (Jan 10). The surgery, performed by a team at the University of Maryland Medicine, is among the first to demonstrate the feasibility of a pig-to-human heart transplant, a field made possible by new gene editing tools. If proven successful, scientists hope that pig organs could help alleviate shortages of donor organs. “This was a breakthrough surgery and brings us one step closer to solving the organ shortage crisis,” Dr Bartley Griffith, who surgically transplanted the pig heart into the patient, said in a statement. “There are simply not enough donor human hearts available to meet the long list of potential recipients.” “We are proceeding cautiously, but we are also optimistic that this first-in-the-world surgery will provide an important new option for patients in the future,” Griffith added. For 57-year-old David Bennett of Maryland, the heart transplant was his last option. ""It was either die or do this transplant. I want to live. I know it’s a shot in the dark, but it’s my last choice,” Bennett said a day before his surgery, according to a statement released by the university. To move ahead with the experimental surgery, the university obtained an emergency authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on New Year's Eve through its compassionate use program. ""The FDA used our data and data on the experimental pig to authorise the transplant in an end-stage heart disease patient who had no other treatment options,” said Dr Muhammad Mohiuddin, who heads the University's program on xenotransplantation - transplanting animal organs into humans. About 110,000 Americans are currently waiting for an organ transplant, and more than 6,000 patients die each year before getting one, according to organdonor.gov. Bennett's genetically modified pig heart was provided by Revivicor, a regenerative medicine company based in Blacksburg, Virginia. On the morning of the surgery, the transplant team removed the pig's heart and placed it into a special device to preserve its function until the surgery. Pigs have long been a tantalising source of potential transplants because their organs are so similar to human organs. A hog heart at the time of slaughter, for example, is about the size of an adult human heart. Other organs from pigs being researched for transplantation into humans include the kidneys, liver and lungs. Prior efforts at pig-to-human transplants have failed because of genetic differences that caused organ rejection or viruses that posed an infection risk. Scientists have tackled that problem by editing away potentially harmful genes. In the heart implanted in Bennett, three genes previously linked with organ rejection were ""knocked out"" of the donor pig, and six human genes linked with immune acceptance were inserted into the pig genome. Researchers also deleted a pig gene to prevent excessive growth of the pig heart tissue. The work was funded in part with a US$15.7 million research grant to evaluate Revivicor's genetically modified pig hearts in baboon studies. In addition to the genetic changes to the pig heart, Bennett received an experimental anti-rejection drug made by Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals based in Lexington, Massachusetts."

""We're very confident that it will affect Omicron ... This mechanism in the molecule (will) work for Omicron, and I would imagine against any variant that comes up,"" Dean Li, president of Merck Research Laboratories, said at JP Morgan's annual healthcare conference. Data on molnupiravir's impact against Omicron is not yet available, but the pill was shown to be 30 per cent effective at reducing hospitalisations and deaths, based on data from 1,433 patients, as per the latest data released in November last year. However, this data showed significantly less effectiveness compared to the previous figure of 50 per cent. The pill received authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration last month, as well as in several other countries like the UK, Japan and India, with various countries signing agreements to buy the drug.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-medical-bills-children-covered-government-vaccination-status-ong-ye-kung-2424876,COVID-19 medical bills for kids aged 12 and below will be paid for regardless of vaccination status: Ong Ye Kung,"SINGAPORE: Children aged 12 and below who did not travel recently will continue to have their COVID-19 medical bills fully covered by the Government regardless of their vaccination status, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung on Monday (Jan 10).  This will apply to children who are Singapore citizens, permanent residents or long-term pass holders.  ""There are presently no plans to introduce VDS (vaccination-differentiated safe management measures) for children aged 12 and below in the community, and public, pre-school and school settings,"" said Mr Ong in Parliament.  “This is due to a combination of reasons, namely, children are less likely to develop severe illnesses when infected, and we want to preserve as much as possible universal access to holistic education for children,” he added.  While Singapore has a “strict” system for vaccination-differentiated measures, the rules are “much less strict” for children, the Health Minister noted.  Since the start of Singapore's national vaccination programme for children aged five to 11, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has not received any reports of serious adverse events or myocarditis in this group of people as of Jan 7. Giving this update in Parliament, Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary said: “We assure parents and everyone that all our designated paediatric VCs (vaccination centres) are equipped with paediatric monitoring and resuscitation equipment, and the medical personnel are trained to manage any on-site emergencies arising from allergic reactions. “Most of the side effects experienced by children after the vaccination have been very mild - injection site pain, fatigue and fever, and they typically resolve in a few days.” The Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccination has been assessed by the Health Sciences Authority and the expert committee on COVID-19 vaccination to be safe, said Dr Puthucheary.  This is corroborated with international data - in the US, where about 8.7 million doses had been administered to children as of December, most of the adverse events reported were not serious and no safety concerns have been raised, said Dr Puthucheary. Among the adverse events reported in children, 2.4 per cent experienced serious adverse events like fever, vomiting, myocarditis and seizures, he added. The incidence of myocarditis is about one in a million doses, he said.  However, among individuals aged 12 to 17 infected with COVID-19, the incidence of myocarditis is about 450 per million infections, said Mr Ong.  As of Jan 7, about 123,000 children aged five to 11 in Singapore have received at least one dose of the vaccine or booked their vaccination appointments, said Dr Puthucheary.  Children who are Singapore citizens, permanent residents, or long-term pass holders are also covered by the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme for COVID-19 vaccination (VIFAP), he noted.  Since only the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine is authorised for use in children below 18, special exemptions are made for those 12-17 years old who are not medically eligible for it to receive the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine instead, he added.  The Health Ministry will work with the expert committee on COVID-19 vaccination to review if this should be extended to children aged five to 11 who are also medically ineligible to complete the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine, he said.  There are currently no recommendations for children to receive booster shots, said Dr Puthucheary.  “If introduced, MOH will continue to ensure that families with children are able to access vaccination services in a convenient manner,” he told the House. Dr Puthucheary also responded to questions about vaccination rates among children and the young.  Among those aged 12 to 19, less than 4 per cent, or 14,097 individuals, are unvaccinated as of Jan 6, he said. Fourteen of them are medically ineligible for the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine.  “Vaccination for children aged five to 11 will help to protect more members of our society from the risk of developing severe illness from COVID-19 infections, and further minimise the risk of community spread,” said Dr Puthucheary.  “We strongly encourage all parents all guardians to allow their children who are medically eligible to please take up the vaccine when offered to them.” Editor's note: An earlier version of this article quoted Dr Janil Puthucheary as saying that US data showed that 2.4 per cent of vaccinated children experienced serious adverse events. This is incorrect. The 2.4 per cent refers to the percentage of adverse events reported in vaccinated children that were serious. We apologise for the error. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/exercising-muscle-memory-weight-training-2418706,How your ‘muscle memory’ may help you get in shape faster after a hiatus,"After two years of COVID-19 and its disruptions to our exercise routines, many of us may feel like we have forgotten how to be fit. But an encouraging new study suggests that our muscles remember. The study involved mice, but it builds on similar experiments with weight training and people. It found that muscles developed a pervasive and lasting molecular “memory” of past resistance exercises that helped them bounce back quickly from long layoffs. In the study, animals that completed a rodent form of resistance training developed changes in their muscles’ DNA that lingered long after they stopped exercising. The mice then packed on muscle mass much faster than other animals when they began training again. And as an encouraging side note to those who are taking up weight training for the first time, the findings also suggest that we should be able to build new muscle memories, regardless of our age. Until recently, the term “muscle memory” usually described our ability to bike, ski, throw to first base or repeat other common physical tasks, even if we had not pedaled, schussed or beelined a baseball in years. Our bodies remember how. But this type of memory, while real, is not really a muscle memory. These memories exist within motor neurons in our brains. But scientists knew that something happened within muscles themselves when they were worked hard, especially during weight training, and that these changes affected how muscles later responded to exercise. “Anecdotally, people say things like, ‘I used to be an athlete, then took time off, but my muscles came back as soon as I started’” lifting weights again, said Kevin Murach, a professor of health and human performance at the University of Arkansas, who oversaw the new study. Those stories piqued his and other researchers’ interest. How, they wondered, do muscles “remember” past workouts? And in what ways do those memories help muscles rebound after time away from the gym? HOW YOUR MUSCLES ""REMEMBER""  Some preliminary studies with animals suggested that genes inside the nuclei of muscle cells worked differently after resistance exercises. Then, in 2018 and 2019, several much-discussed studies of people looked into the epigenetics of resistance training. Epigenetics refers to changes in the ways that genes operate, even though the gene itself does not change. It mostly involves a process called methylation, in which clusters of atoms, called methyl groups, attach themselves to the outside of genes like minuscule barnacles, making the genes more or less likely to turn on and produce particular proteins. In the recent human experiments, resistance exercise changed methylation patterns on a number of genes in people’s muscles, and those changes remained evident weeks or months later, even after the volunteers stopped exercising and lost some of their muscle mass. When they began lifting again, they packed muscle back on much faster than when the studies started, the researchers found. In essence, their muscles remembered how to grow. But those studies, while intriguing, lasted a few months at most. It was still unclear if exercise from much longer ago would linger as a genetic memory in our muscles, or just how many different cells and genes in muscles would be affected epigenetically by resistance training. So for the new study, which was published recently in Function, a flagship journal of the American Physiological Society, Murach and his colleagues, including the lead author Yuan Wen, decided to recreate the human weight-training experiments as closely as possible in adult mice. WEIGHT-TRAINING EXPERIMENTS IN HUMANS VS ADULT MICE Rodents’ life spans are far more condensed compared with ours, meaning that changes seen in the animals after several months might appear in people after several years. But since mice cannot use barbells, the scientists had them run on weighted running wheels, which were designed to provide leg-muscle resistance training. The animals trained for eight weeks and then sat in their cages for 12 weeks – about 10 per cent of their life spans, which would be years for us. The animals then trained again for a month, joined by mice of the same age that were new to the exercise and that served as controls. Throughout, the researchers biopsied and microscopically studied their muscles. They noted plenty of differences in gene methylation in muscle cells after the mice trained; most of the changes remained months after they stopped exercising. In general, these epigenetic changes dialed up the operation of genes involved in muscle growth while quieting gene activity elsewhere, making the genetic process of building muscle “more refined,” Murach said. Even after months of inactivity, these changes helped the trained mice add more muscle more quickly during retraining, compared with the mice that had not previously trained. Of course, this study involved mice, not people. It also looked only at resistance exercises and not at aerobic workouts. But since many of the genes the researchers tracked are the same ones that researchers studied in the human experiments, the findings most likely have relevance for any of us who hope to build up our muscles in 2022.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/mental-emotional-physical-stress-heart-2413046,How mental and emotional stress can do more damage to your heart than physical stress,"You’re probably familiar with these major risk factors for heart disease:high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, obesity and physical inactivity. And chances are your doctor has checked you more than once for these risks and, I would hope, offered advice or treatment to help ward off a heart attack or stroke. But has your doctor also asked about the level of stress in your life? Chronic psychological stress, recent studies indicate, may be as important – and possibly more important – to the health of your heart than the traditional cardiac risk factors. In fact, in people with less-than-healthy hearts, mental stress trumps physical stress as a potential precipitant of fatal and nonfatal heart attacks and other cardiovascular events, according to the latest report. The new study, published in November in JAMA, assessed the fates of 918 patients known to have underlying, but stable, heart disease to see how their bodies reacted to physical and mental stress. The participants underwent standardised physical and mental stress tests to see if their hearts developed myocardial ischemia – a significantly reduced blood flow to the muscles of the heart, which can be a trigger for cardiovascular events – during either or both forms of stress. Then the researchers followed them for four to nine years. Among the study participants who experienced ischemia during one or both tests, this adverse reaction to mental stress took a significantly greater toll on the hearts and lives of the patients than did physical stress. They were more likely to suffer a nonfatal heart attack or die of cardiovascular disease in the years that followed. I wish I had known that in 1982, when my father had a heart attack that nearly killed him. Upon leaving the hospital, he was warned about overdoing physical stresses, like not lifting anything heavier than 30 pounds. But he was never cautioned about undue emotional stress or the risks of overreacting to frustrating circumstances, like when the driver ahead of him drove too slowly in a no-passing zone. The new findings underscore the results of an earlier study that evaluated the relationship between risk factors and heart disease in 24,767 patients from 52 countries. It found that patients who experienced a high level of psychological stress during the year before they entered the study were more than twice as likely to suffer a heart attack during an average follow-up of five years, even when traditional risk factors were taken into account. The study, known as Interheart, showed that psychological stress is an independent risk factor for heart attacks, similar in heart-damaging effects to the more commonly measured cardiovascular risks, explained Dr Michael T Osborne, a cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital. But what about the effects of stress on people whose hearts are still healthy? Psychological stress comes in many forms. It can occur acutely, caused by incidents like the loss of a job, the death of a loved one, or the destruction of one’s home in a natural disaster. A recent study in Scandinavia found that in the week following a child’s death, the parents’ risk of a heart attack was more than three times the expected rate. Emotional stress can also be chronic, resulting, for example, from ongoing economic insecurity, living in a high-crime area or experiencing unrelenting depression or anxiety. Bereaved parents in the Scandinavian study continued to experience an elevated cardiac risk years later. HOW STRESS DAMAGES THE HEART Dr. Osborne participated with a team of experts led by Dr Ahmed Tawakol, also at Massachusetts General, in an analysis of how the body reacts to psychological stress. He said the accumulated evidence of how the brain and body respond to chronic psychological stress strongly suggested that modern medicine has been neglecting a critically important hazard to heart health. It all starts in the brain’s fear center, the amygdala, which reacts to stress by activating the so-called fight-or-flight response, triggering the release of hormones that over time can increase levels of body fat, blood pressure and insulin resistance. Furthermore, as the team explained, the cascade of reactions to stress causes inflammation in the arteries, fosters blood clotting and impairs the function of blood vessels, all of which promote atherosclerosis, the arterial disease that underlies most heart attacks and strokes. Dr Tawakol’s team explained that advanced neuroimaging made it possible to directly measure the impact of stress on various body tissues, including the brain. A prior study of 293 people initially free of cardiovascular disease who underwent full-body scans that included brain activity had a telling result. Five years later, individuals found to have high activity in the amygdala were shown to have higher levels of inflammation and atherosclerosis. Translation: Those with an elevated level of emotional stress developed biological evidence of cardiovascular disease. In contrast, Dr Osborne said, “people who are not tightly wired” are less likely to experience the ill heart effects of stress. The researchers are now investigating the impact of a stress-reducing programme called SMART-3RP (it stands for Stress Management and Resiliency Training-Relaxation Response Resiliency Programme) on the brain as well as biological factors that promote atherosclerosis. The programme is designed to help people reduce stress and build resilience through mind-body techniques like mindfulness-based meditation, yoga and tai chi. Such measures activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which calms the brain and body. DEFUSING STRESS AND ITS EFFECTS Even without a formal programme, Dr Osborne said individuals could minimise their body’s heart-damaging reactions to stress. One of the best ways is through habitual physical exercise, which can help to tamp down stress and the body-wide inflammation it can cause. Given that poor sleep increases stress and promotes arterial inflammation, developing good sleep habits can also reduce the risk of cardiovascular damage. Adopt a consistent pattern of bedtime and awakening, and avoid exposure at bedtime to screens that emit blue light, like smartphones and computers, or use blue-light filters for such devices. Practice relaxing measures like mindfulness meditation, calming techniques that slow breathing, yoga and tai chi. Several common medications can also help, Dr. Osborne said. Statins not only reduce cholesterol, they also counter arterial inflammation, resulting in a greater cardiovascular benefit than from their cholesterol-lowering effects alone. Antidepressants, including the anesthetic ketamine, may also help to minimize excessive amygdalar activity and ease stress in people with depression.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/experiences/new-gyms-fitness-centres-singapore-2420441,Who’s behind Singapore’s latest crop of gyms and fitness centres?,"If the past two pandemic years have been taking a toll on your health – both physically and mentally – now is the time to make a change. Let 2022 be the year you seize life by the horns and do something that will make you feel and look better than you have in a long time. And if you need a little extra oomph to kickstart your fitness journey, we’ve got your back. A slew of new gyms have just launched to offer that brand new start you have been craving. Located within the central business district are two new gym brands, Freedom Gym at UIC Building – which boasts state-of-the-art equipment – and Urban Den at Change Alley Mall, a grungy-chic boutique gym. Other fitness joints opening in the central area include Platinum Fitness’ second outlet at Tanglin Mall, slated to launch in January, Sugar Boxing at Orchard Cineleisure and Popsicle Rhythmic Cycling at UE Square. The latter two are operated by Active Fitness, which has three other fitness concepts in Singapore. And for Easties who may not wish to travel to the city for their fitness fix, The Flow Pilates by Lab Studios, a reformer-only fitness studio, will open in Joo Chiat in January. Indeed, while the pandemic has impacted many lives and businesses, fitness and wellness is one industry that has been gaining traction as more people pay attention to their health. These new openings follow hot on the heels of 2021 launches including CRU Orchard, a spin, HIIT and yoga studio and holistic wellness and fitness club Trapeze Rec Club on Duxton Road. NEW TO THE MARKET: FREEDOM GYM In fact, a new entrant to the fitness club scene, Freedom Gym, was launched after co-founder James Koh Jiuh Wey gained an epiphany over the past year. “The pandemic really hit me. I felt that health was really important and that it was my best defence against illnesses,” said Koh. He began training with fitness trainer Alex Liu and was so impressed by Liu’s holistic approach to fitness that included balanced and personalised training programmes with a good diet that the two teamed up to launch Freedom Gym in November 2021. The 6,000 sq ft space, which cost S$1.6 million to renovate, features impressive equipment from brands including Arsenal Strength Gym Equipment, Kabuki Strength and Prime Fitness USA. More interestingly, it is designed to cater to both gym-goers as well as freelance fitness trainers as their own clients can access the gym without a membership. This flexibility is likely to appeal to gym-goers who may not wish to be locked into traditional memberships in a time when many uncertainties abound. “Everyone has a right to be at their peak health, and should not be hindered in achieving their best. We envision Freedom to be a place where freelance personal trainers can present their services and where clients can choose what’s best according to their budget and goals,” said Koh. EXPANDING ITS HORIZONS: PLATINUM FITNESS Another personal trainer-focused gym, Platinum Fitness, which currently has a branch at OUE Downtown, will also be launching a second 3,000 sq ft outlet at Tanglin Mall. In the last year, its freelance personal trainer business has accounted for about 70 to 80 per cent of turnover, said Marc Torel, its owner. The gym works with trainers by offering them a location to train their clients and use its facilities in the form of a revenue share. “COVID-19 enhanced consumer demands to maintain their health. Personal trainers directly received that additional demand but sacrificed their own free time in order to support new customers,” he observed. “Our intention in scaling is to continuously assist the freelance trainer community by centralising their operations through our facilities at no additional cost. Ultimately, their positive feedback justifies our means in creating an ecosystem in which we can all thrive.” A benefit of catering to a diverse range of trainers that specialise in different aspects of fitness means that the gym can cater to a wider group of clients beyond the usual 20- and 30-somethings. For example, the trainers at Platinum Fitness have areas of expertise beyond general strength and conditioning including postpartum, female-focused and senior-focused specialty training. In the future, Torel is planning to introduce relaxation zones and to develop designated rooms that can serve various fitness verticals such as group personal training, industry training initiatives and rehabilitation practices to become a one-stop fitness hub. SOCIAL NETWORKING WHILE SWEATING IT OUT: URBAN DEN The opportunity to be in a safely distanced environment that allows for a small measure of interactions with other people has been another draw for gym bunnies in recent times. “We want to create an environment where our members find like-minded friends and encourage one another to attain common exercise goals,” said Wee Cheng Yan, Urban Den’s Fitness Manager. “We may be in the middle of a pandemic, but our government is steering the country towards living with COVID-19 and opening up to a new normal. People miss social interactions due to the restrictions for the past two years. Exercising is certainly one positive way to enjoy social interactions while attaining health benefits.” What Urban Den offers is the insider, clubby vibe of boutique gyms together with the ample space and wide range and equipment of a larger establishment. “People are attracted to these boutique gyms because of the community vibe, which pushes them beyond their expectations and has a fun social element. However, these are generally very small boutiques with very limited equipment and focus on one or two types of exercises,” observed Wee. At the spacious 15,000 sq ft Urban Den, there is not only a fully decked out gym floor, there are also three studios to offer a wide range of classes. These include familiar favourites like BodyPump and BodyAttack that are set at a higher intensity, spin cycling sessions and recovery yoga. Since its launch in November 2021, members have given positive feedback about the “grungy and dark aesthetic” of the gym as well as its “substantial” range of services, Wee observed. ADAPTING TO CHANGE: TRUE FITNESS Still, things have not necessarily been smooth sailing for the fitness industry. Capacity limitations and safe distancing measures, in particular, have impacted the ability of gyms to sign on more members.   “True’s gyms and studios are built for much larger numbers than the approved 50-person capacity. Hence, we had to implement a booking system with allocated time slots for members to access the gyms on a first-come-first-served basis,” said Reina Lim, group chief financial officer and chief operations officer of True Group. This impacts the appeal of big box gyms which used to allow members to freely access their gyms and attend as many sessions as they would like and has led to a loss in members who have been frustrated over booking matters, she said. “The continued uncertainties of the pandemic, for example when we may go into another Heightened Alert, the impact of new variants or revised safe management measures has also resulted in members not renewing their contracts,” said Lim. Despite this setback, True Fitness decided to embark on a major makeover of its Novena outlet in November 2021 to better cater to its members. With class capacities reduced by more than half, the gym’s management discovered that more members now prefer training on the gym floor and with personal trainers. So, the team made the decision to streamline rental costs by giving up one floor space and focused on providing members with the latest equipment to meet their training needs. Now, the newly unveiled outlet boasts new boxing and functional training areas, turf flooring running tracks and fancy new equipment like Singapore’s first Fitbench where full-body functional workouts can be carried out in just one station. “Members are now spoilt for choice in this environment, where they have access to more performance-driven equipment not easily available elsewhere. They hardly need to wait to use each equipment, and the spaciousness among the free weights and equipment zone allows members to work out more comfortably than before,” said Lim. DIET AND NUTRITION PROGRAMMES On top of putting in hours at the gym, it is also essential to pay attention to one’s diet to ensure optimal results. “Diet and nutrition is as equally important as what you do in the gym. You’re looking at giving your body the energy it needs to push, and you’re looking at giving your body the right amount of macros (protein, carbs and fat) so you can build muscle mass and increase recovery time,” said Freedom Gym’s Liu. To complement its fitness programmes, the gym has a nutritional plan in collaboration with Wafuken, a sous vide-themed restaurant in OUE Downtown where members can make an order at the reception area and receive their food after their session. Separately, for those looking to experience a health reboot from the inside out, holistic wellness centre Balanced Living has a newly launched ten day gut makeover programme that helps to set you on the path to greater food consciousness. This fuss-free programme comprises six days of meal deliveries, which includes wholesome yet hearty dishes such as a cauliflower rice salad and bread-free salmon burger, to help take the guesswork out of eating well. The meal boxes also come in sufficient variety so that you will not feel like a rabbit grazing on salad leaves for days on end. Even better, the programme starts with an in-depth session with in-house practitioner Toni Baker, who is a whiz at sharing practical tips and advice on how to modify one’s eating habits without coming across as being judgemental. Baker will also be available via WhatsApp through the duration of the programme to provide guidance where needed, which might just be the additional push some might require to finally commit to their fitspo goals. So, ready, steady and reset!"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/breast-cancer-women-health-breast-removal-reconstruction-2405711,Commentary: No correct answer about whether to remove breasts because of cancer,"SINGAPORE: “Will I need to remove my breast?” As a breast cancer surgeon, I get asked this question all the time.  The diagnosis of breast cancer evokes anxiety in women, not just because it is a cancer, but also because of the possibility of surgical removal of the breast. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in Singapore with more than 2,000 women are newly diagnosed every year.   Other than surgery, breast cancer may also require additional treatments such as chemotherapy and endocrine therapy, both of which can result in short- and long-term changes in a woman’s life. Research has shown that the psychosocial impact of breast cancer occurs not just at diagnosis, but also during treatment and survivorship. Women may experience distress associated with fatigue, mood, sexual and reproductive issues, self-image, spiritual challenges, relationships with others and fears of recurrence.  Yet in clinical practice, how a woman copes with a breast cancer diagnosis may vary widely, depending on her age, family situation, attitude, and life priorities. *Anna was diagnosed with breast cancer five years ago at 41. She could have opted for a smaller surgery to keep the breast. Instead, she chose to have her breast removed. She also nonchalantly declined breast reconstruction to minimise surgery time and complications. She told me: “My mother had breast cancer too and I watched her suffer through the treatment. I want to come out of this better and stronger than she did.” Her priority was no-fuss surgery, swift recovery and quickly moving on to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, minimising long-term relapse risk. Then there is *Celine who was 77 years old when a breast biopsy confirmed cancer. As the changes were extensive, she required a mastectomy. Despite the risks at her age, she insisted on breast reconstruction.   “Doctor, I won’t feel complete without the breast. Please arrange for me to have reconstruction,” she told me. Fortunately, she was found to be surgically fit for her age and she successfully underwent mastectomy and implant reconstruction.  These two cases show there is no one size fits all approach. Women play many roles in life – as a wife, a mother and a daughter. These roles strongly influence their attitudes towards breast cancer treatment.  Some mothers of young children are driven to treat the breast cancer aggressively, to survive the cancer so they may continue their parenting role. Others fear the treatment will take them away from the family and in contrast may choose less intensive options.  Some opt to relegate their caregiver role completely to other family members. Older women may decline treatment so avoid being a burden to their families. The anatomical function of the breast is for lactation, allowing mothers to nurse their babies. Beyond this, the breast also symbolises femininity and is a major part of constituting a woman’s body image.  This is why removal of the breast has a deep impact on a woman’s body image, taking a physical and psychological toll on patients. Ironically, reconstruction may not ease these feelings. Studies in the early 2000s showed younger women receiving mastectomy and reconstruction for breast cancer reported a more negative body image than those receiving breast conserving surgery, immediately following treatment, but this improved with longer duration from treatment.  Other than surgery, other cancer treatments may also impact body image. Chemotherapy and endocrine treatment often result in hair loss, weight gain and the abrupt onset of menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes, vaginal dryness, decreased libido and reduced sexual functioning.   These changes may cause psychological distress in both the breast cancer patient as well as her partner, potentially impacting on the emotional support that is critical in relationships.  Breast reconstruction plays a major role in contributing to the acceptance of mastectomy by women diagnosed with breast cancer. Immediate breast reconstruction is when the reconstruction surgery is performed at the same sitting as the mastectomy, hence the patient wakes up from surgery with minimal perception of losing the breast.   This can be done using breast implants or autologous tissue from the patient’s own body tissue such as tissue from the tummy, thigh or back. In our Asian culture, women generally favour autologous tissue reconstruction over implant reconstruction, although other factors such as the patient’s physical make up may also come into play.   Breast reconstruction is not without its risks, as the surgery will be longer and often more complex and with slightly higher risk of surgical complications. However, with proper patient selection and balance of risks and benefits, mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction has been found to have fairly high levels of satisfaction in quality-of-life scores in the long term. I first met *Joan six months ago. She is 42 with a daughter in her early teens who is very attached to her. When she was diagnosed, she was adamant at removing both breasts even though the cancer was only confirmed on one side. In her own quiet but determined manner she told me: “I want to do everything to reduce my risk in the long run. I want to make sure I will always be there for my daughter.”  In the last 20 years of clinical practice, I have witnessed a paradigm shift in women’s attitudes towards mastectomy. Conventionally, the breast is preserved whenever possible, especially if the cancer is localised. In recent years, more women are open to undergoing mastectomy even when breast conservation can be safely undertaken. I believe one of the most important reasons is due to the Angelina Jolie effect. Angelina Jolie was a well-known actress and celebrity, who in 2013 pronounced to the world that she had undergone bilateral mastectomy with implant reconstruction after discovering she possessed a BRCA gene mutation, which placed her at an inordinately high lifetime risk of breast cancer.   It accelerated a movement in the USA where women made proactive decisions to be in control of their own destiny. In the last decade, there has been an increasing trend in women opting for bilateral mastectomy when the cancer is confined to only one breast.  Reasons cited include fear of cancer recurrence, family history of cancer, stress surrounding follow up and improved breast reconstruction outcomes. Ironically, it has been suggested that in these women, bilateral mastectomy may even have psychological benefits.  *Joan eventually did go ahead with bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction. Further laboratory testing subsequently discovered cancer in the other breast as well, which likely would have manifested some years later. So choosing bilateral mastectomy was the right choice for her and her family.  For most women however, mastectomy can be a difficult decision as it still invokes an image of disfigurement and loss of femininity, despite significant advances in breast reconstruction techniques.   Efforts in multi-disciplinary breast cancer care continue to focus on the psycho-social needs of this group of women. As a surgeon I hope every woman diagnosed with breast cancer will have access to adequate information and support in making the best decision for themselves, whether it is a mastectomy or breast conservation.  We can’t make breast cancer go away, but we can make the treatment more acceptable and we can empower women to make the best choices suited to them. *Pseudonyms were used in this commentary.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/living/tech-trends-smart-home-electric-car-apple-google-facebook-samsung-matter-2417091,From electric cars to smart homes: 4 tech trends that will invade our lives in 2022,"Some trends for 2022 that tech companies are pushing are things you will have heard of before. A chief example is virtual reality, the technology that involves wearing goofy-looking headgear and swinging around controllers to play 3D games. That is expected to be front and centre again this year, remarketed by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and other techies as “the metaverse.” Another buzzy category will be the so-called smart home, the technology to control home appliances by shouting voice commands at a speaker or tapping a button on a smartphone. The truth is, the tech industry has tried to push this kind of technology into our homes for more than a decade. This year, these products may finally begin to feel practical to own. Another recurring technology on this list is digital health gear that tracks our fitness and helps us diagnose possible ailments. And automakers, which have long talked about electric cars, are beginning to accelerate their plans to meet a nationwide goal to phase out production of gas-powered cars by 2030. Here are four tech trends that will invade our lives this year. 1. WELCOME TO THE METAVERSE For more than a decade, technologists have dreamed of an era where our virtual lives play as important a role as our physical realities. In theory, we would spend lots of time interacting with our friends and colleagues in virtual space, and as a result, we would spend money there, too, on outfits and objects for our digital avatars. “We’re in a world where people several times per day send out an image reflecting themselves,” said Matthew Ball, a venture capitalist who has written extensively about the metaverse. “The next phase takes that visual representation and dimensionalises it. You go into an environment and express yourself through an avatar.” That sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie. But throughout year two of the pandemic, a critical mass of factors came together to make the metaverse more realistic, Ball said. For one, the technology got better. Last year, Facebook announced that it had renamed itself Meta after shipping 10 million units of its virtual-reality headset, the Quest 2, which was a milestone. For another, many of us were willing to splurge on our digital selves. Hordes of investors bought NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, which are one-of-a-kind digital objects purchased with cryptocurrency. Eminem and other celebrities even invested in virtual yachts for hundreds of thousands of dollars. There’s more to come this year. Apple plans to unveil its version of a virtual reality headset, which will look like a pair of ski goggles and, for computing power, rely on a separate computing device that is worn elsewhere on the body. Apple declined to comment. Google has also developed virtual reality products for years, and Microsoft has offered a virtual reality headset for businesses and government agencies. The metaverse could still turn out to be a fad, depending on what products emerge and who buys them. Carolina Milanesi, a consumer technology analyst for the consulting firm Creative Strategies, said she worried that it could become a reflection of the privileged few who can afford to treat their digital selves. “The boating market is dominated by white upper-class middle-aged men,” she said. “Will we just transfer all of that into the metaverse?” 2. THE SMART HOME  Over the last few years, smart home products like internet-connected thermostats, door locks and robotic vacuum cleaners made major progress. The devices became affordable and worked reliably with digital assistants like Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant and Apple’s Siri. Yet the smart home, for the most part, has remained chaotic. Many smart home products didn’t work well with other technology. Some door locks, for example, worked only with Apple phones and not Androids; some thermostats were controlled by talking to Google Assistant and not to Siri. The lack of compatibility has created long-term issues. An Apple-compatible lock isn’t useful for the family member or future tenant who prefers Android. It would also be more convenient one day if our home devices could actually talk to each other, like a washing machine telling a dryer that a large load was ready to be dried. This year, the tech industry’s biggest rivals – Apple, Samsung, Google and Amazon – are playing nice to make the smart home more practical. They plan to release and update home technology to work with Matter, a new standard that enables smart home devices to talk to each other, regardless of the virtual assistant or phone brand. More than 100 smart home products are expected to adhere to the standard. “We’re all speaking a common language built on already proven technologies,” said Samantha Osborne, a vice president of marketing for SmartThings, the home automation company owned by Samsung. This means that later this year, when you shop for a product like an automated door lock, look for a label indicating that the device is compatible with Matter. Then, in the future, your smart alarm clock may be able to tell your smart lights to turn on when you wake up. 3. CONNECTED HEALTH Fitness gadgets like the Apple Watch and Fitbit, which help us track our movements and heart rate, keep getting more popular. So tech companies are experimenting this year with smaller wearable devices that gather more intimate data about our health. Oura, a health tech company, recently introduced a new model of its Oura Ring, which is embedded with sensors that track metrics including body temperature to accurately predict menstruation cycles. This week at CES, a tech trade show in Las Vegas, Movano, another health tech startup, unveiled a similar ring that stitches together data about your heart rate, temperature and other measures to inform a wearer about potential chronic illnesses. Medical experts have long warned about the potential consequences of health tech. Without proper context, the data could potentially be used to misdiagnose illnesses and turn people into hypochondriacs. But if the widely sold-out COVID rapid test kits are any measure, more of us appear ready to be proactive in monitoring our health. 4. ELECTRIC CARS Last year, President Joe Biden announced an ambitious goal: Half of all vehicles sold in the United States would be electric rather than gas-powered by 2030. In response, major automakers are hyping their electric cars, including at CES this week. On Tuesday, Ford announced plans to increase production of its F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck. Later this week, General Motors plans to unveil a battery-powered version of its Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck. Other carmakers, like Mercedes-Benz, have shared plans for electric cars to be released in coming years. While there’s lots of marketing hype around electric cars, those of us looking for battery-powered vehicles this year will probably still gravitate toward Tesla, Milanesi said. That’s because we have yet to see widespread deployment of solar power and charging stations for electric cars, especially in more rural areas. Tesla has a head start because it has been rolling out charging stations for years, she said. “There’s so much from an infrastructure perspective that needs to happen,” she said. “So it’s a lot of talk, but I don’t know how much of a reality.” By Brian X.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/how-exercise-may-affect-our-alcohol-consumption-2409751,Study reveals people who exercise drink a whole lot more than those who don't,"People who work out regularly and are aerobically fit tend to guzzle a surprising amount of alcohol, according to a new study of the interplay between fitness, exercise and imbibing. The study, which involved more than 40,000 American adults, finds that active, physically fit men and women are more than twice as likely to be moderate or heavy drinkers as people who are out of shape. The results add to mounting evidence from previous studies – and many of our bar tabs – that exercise and alcohol frequently go hand in hand, with implications for the health effects of each. Many people, and some researchers, might be surprised to learn how much physically active people tend to drink. In general, people who take up one healthy habit, such as working out, tend to practice other salubrious habits, a phenomenon known as habit clustering. Fit, active people seldom smoke, for instance, and tend to eat healthful diets. So, it might seem logical that people who often exercise would drink alcohol sparingly. But multiple studies in recent years have found close ties between working out and tippling. In one of the earliest, from 2001, researchers used survey answers from American men and women to conclude that moderate drinkers, defined in that study as people who finished off about a drink a day, were twice as likely as those who didn’t drink at all to exercise regularly. Later studies found similar patterns among college athletes, who drank substantially more than other collegians, a population not famous for its temperance. In another revealing study, from 2015, 150 adults kept online diaries about when and how much they exercised and consumed alcohol for three weeks. The results showed that on the days they exercised the most, they also tended to drink the most afterward. But these and other past studies, while consistently linking more physical activity and more drinking, tended to be small or centred on the young, or relied on somewhat casual reports of what people told researchers about their workouts and alcohol intake, which can be notoriously unreliable. So, for the new study, titled Fit And Tipsy? and recently published in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, researchers with The Cooper Institute in Dallas and other institutions turned to more objective data about tens of thousands of American adults. All were part of the large and ongoing Cooper Center Longitudinal Study, which looks at cardiovascular health and its relationship to various behavioral factors and other medical conditions. Study participants visited the Cooper Clinic in Texas for annual checkups and, as part of those exams, completed treadmill tests of their aerobic fitness. They also completed extensive questionnaires about their exercise and drinking habits and whether they worried about their alcohol intake. The researchers gathered records for 38,653 participants who were of legal age and reported drinking at least once a week. (The authors left teetotalers out of the study mix, because they wanted to compare light drinkers to heavier drinkers.) Then they ran numbers. PEOPLE WHO ARE FITTER TEND TO DRINK MORE As in earlier studies, the fitter people were, the more they tended to drink. The fittest women were about twice as likely to be moderate drinkers as women with low aerobic capacities. Moderate drinking meant the women drank between four and seven glasses of beer, wine or spirits in a typical week. The fittest men were more than twice as likely to be moderate drinkers – up to 14 drinks per week – as men who were less fit. The researchers considered people’s reported exercise habits and adjusted for age and other factors that could have influenced the results, and the odds remained consistently higher. Fit men and some women also had a slightly higher likelihood of being heavy drinkers – defined as having eight or more weekly drinks for women and 15 or more for men – than their less fit peers. Interestingly, fit women who were heavy drinkers often reported concerns about their level of alcohol intake, while fit men in that category rarely did. WHAT IT MEANS FOR YOUR HEALTH What might these results mean for those of us who work out regularly to try to stay in shape? While they clearly show that fitness and increased drinking go hand-in-hand, “most people probably don’t associate physical activity and alcohol intake as linked behaviors,” said Kerem Shuval, the executive director of epidemiology at the Cooper Institute, who led the new study. So, people who exercise should be aware of their alcohol intake, he said, even tracking how often they imbibe each week. Doctors and scientists cannot say with certainty how many drinks might be too many for our health and well-being, and the total likely differs for each of us. But talk to your doctor or a counselor if your drinking worries you (or worries your spouse or friends or training partners). Of course, this study has limits. It mostly involved affluent, white Americans, and it showed only an association between fitness and alcohol intake and not that one causes the other. It also cannot tell us why working up a sweat might lead to excess boozing, or vice versa. “There probably are social aspects,” Dr Shuval said, with teammates and training groups bonding over beers or margaritas after a competition or workout. Many of us likely also put a health halo around our exercise, making us feel our physical exertions justify an extra cocktail — or three. And, intriguingly, some animal studies show that both exercise and alcohol light up parts of the brain related to reward processing, suggesting that while each, on its own, can be pleasurable, doing both might be doubly enticing. “We need a lot more research” into the reasons for the relationship. Dr Shuval said. But for now, it is worth keeping in mind, that our running or cycling outings or trips to the gym could influence how often, and how enthusiastically, we drink in the new year.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/smoking-cessation-health-withdrawal-symptoms-addiction-2413491,Commentary: The secret to stopping smoking? Just stop,"LONDON: In the spirit of any aspirational self-help guru/writer/wellness entrepreneur, I thought I would use this timely opportunity to lay out my Failsafe Guide for Quitting Cigarettes This Year. I modestly offer you my strategy for how to stub it out for good. Herewith, my secret formula. The best way to stop smoking — is to stop. Admittedly, as a methodology, it’s not especially exciting. It doesn’t come with mindful meditation exercises to start you on the quitting “journey”. Nor does it offer a host of spicy condiments to act as substitutes. I have no reading matter, nicotine inhibitors or any other gadgets, such as vapes, to help you. And yet, my method is absolutely foolproof. Honestly, it can’t be beat. Stopping smoking is a doddle. I promise you it can be done. All it requires is the decision that you really do want to quit. It has been three years since I wrote, somewhat boldly, about how I had been off the fags for a week. It was possibly a little early to be so confident about my non-smoking future, but the announcement did at least force me to make a real attempt. Having spent more than two decades sucking on the Marlboros, I had finally realised that smoking wasn’t chic. It was ageing, smelly and expensive. Plus, I couldn’t stand the thought of sparking my teenager daughter’s own potential habit by leaving unfinished packs of cigarettes around the house. People like to manufacture hysteria over the act of quitting. Nicotine, they warn, is horribly addictive. We are constantly reminded of how often people fail. Vast tranches of the UK’s health service are geared towards cessation, with huge budgets and resources allocated for support groups, therapy and aids. Another multibillion-pound industry has been built on the idea that to quit will require new investment — in hypnotherapy or acupuncture, in addiction apps or books by Allen Carr. Subsequently, the general narrative around smoking suggests that quitting is inevitably a fail. Which suits both the nicotine industry and those who want to thwart it, too. More than 5.2 trillion cigarettes were consumed globally annually in 2019, at a value of about US$705 billion. The global smoking cessation market, meanwhile, is expected to reach some US$64 billion by 2026. Having been told that quitting will be awful, many smokers are inclined to give up the giving up. I had tried and failed before this latest effort. But what no one really told me was that stopping isn’t all that hard. The final decision to unfriend my 10 to 20 daily cigarettes felt like flicking off a switch. Instead of reminding myself continually about the fag breaks I was missing — I simply shut down all thoughts of them instead. It has really been quite straightforward. And even in the face of triggers such as the pandemic, disruption and a family bereavement I can, hand on heart, say that I haven’t smoked a single one. Sure, I’ve hung out around other smokers, and occasionally inhaled quite deeply in a smoky room. But with the rare exception of a perfect balmy summer evening, I rarely miss my former friends. Smoking was falling out of fashion but COVID-19 has seen the uptake surge again. Despite UK plans to be smoke-free by 2030, in August Cancer Research UK found the number of 18 to 34-year-olds who classed themselves as smokers had increased by a quarter: 652,000 more young adults in England now define themselves as smokers than did before the pandemic began. New Zealand is facing an even greater challenge, as it aims to eliminate smoking in the coming decades. This month it announced plans for extraordinary legislation that will make it illegal for anyone who is now 14 years old or younger to buy cigarettes at any time throughout their lives. Such prohibitive legislation, I would hazard, is unlikely to prompt young people to comply with the new laws. Surely making smoking so illicit will only burnish its cachet? But I am not a young person. Nor am I in much danger of not being legally allowed to buy my nicotine. But I do know that I won’t. Me and cigarettes are done — and while I once rated our relationship as being profound and more productive, I’m so much richer, pinker and, sadly, plumper now. I write this not as some act of triumphalist self-congratulation but to demonstrate that giving up is not so hard to do. “You literally say I’m addicted to cigarettes and take it from there”, says Alexa Chung, who quit last summer following an epic lockdown smoking binge.  “As soon as you understand you can’t have a single one,” she observes of her success as a non-smoker, “it’s a piece of piss.” So don’t be fooled by the propaganda. There will be a wodge of pieces reinforcing the idea that stopping requires a lot of “work”. There will be books and recommendations. There will be new treatments for you to try. But the challenge is by no means insurmountable, and those cessation aids are not what you really need. You just need to decide that the relationship is over, and throw your cigarettes in the bin."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/people/saladstop-singapore-heybo-wooshi-2408871,"After raising S$12 million, what’s next for health food purveyor SaladStop!","When she first started patronising SaladStop! in 2010, Linda Goh saw it as a convenient way to eat a quick, healthy lunch before getting back to her work at a private bank. These days, Goh continues to frequent the healthy food chain, albeit through its online store. “While it didn’t matter to me in the past, today, I am more conscious about what I eat. So, I appreciate the nutritional information that comes with my meals at SaladStop! and that the company has a purposeful mission towards sustainability,” said the 43-year-old Singaporean. Goh is part of a growing number of consumers who place an increasing focus on the provenance of the food they eat and how committed the businesses they patronise are to the principles of eco-sustainability. It is a group that SaladStop! identified when it launched 12 years ago, with a commitment to “Eat Wide Awake”. The slogan reflects its ethos that eating well encompasses not just treating our bodies kindly, but the world around us too. “At that time, we could see that people were looking for healthier food. We knew the world was changing,” recalled Swiss-born Adrien Desbaillets, who established SaladStop! with his father Daniel in 2009. Two years later, his sister Katherine joined the business while her husband, Frantz Braha joined in 2015. “Very early on, we knew that this could be something big,” Adrien continued. “Once we knew we were on the right track, we signed three to four locations. We were very bullish. We thought this was make or break.” CREATE IT TILL YOU MAKE IT Evidently, it’s been quite the “make”. In November 2021, the company raised S$12 million in Series B funding, led by Temasek Holdings and with participation from big-name investors such as US-based Vulcan Capital, Singapore’s K3 Ventures, Indonesian VC East Ventures and existing investor DSG Consumer Partners. “(The round) was a great validation of what we are doing,” said Adrien. “Through the pandemic, especially, we proved how resilient the business is. A lot of it shifted online, but we managed to maintain the same top line and continued driving things forward. “We are fortunate to be in an ecosystem that was starting to evolve in Singapore and that other funds had an interest in. (With) Singapore’s 30 By 30 goals, all the investments that are happening in agri-food tech, and how deeply embedded we are in that ecosystem, it was clear to us that if we managed to find investors that were in that space… then we would fit right in.” MAKING INROADS
 
Much of SaladStop!’s success has been in larger regional markets such as Indonesia and The Philippines where the company has identified various gaps in secondary cities and in less polished parts of the capitals. To address those gaps, it started two concepts: Heybo, offering warm bowls focused on local flavours, and DIY maki roll concept Wooshi. “[These brands] are meant to go far beyond where SaladStop! can go,” Adrien explained. “SaladStop! can work well in Jakarta, Bali and Ho Chi Minh City, but when you get to Surabaya and Medan, for example, it becomes harder. We want to go deep in those markets and that’s where we need different brands.” Another investment priority is in accelerating the company’s digital transformation. Technology helped the company through COVID-19 as they pivoted to not only work with delivery companies but also develop their own sales channels. “The big focus will be how we develop that online experience. We have a CTO joining us in the next two months and are hiring our own tech team. So that’s really our commitment to improving the online experience for customers,” he continued. Sustainability continues to drive the company’s mission. This year, the brand’s first net zero outlet will open in Singapore. Adrien explained: “We look at a store being net zero in two ways: One, from the store operating perspective – how do you reduce water consumption, how to source as close as possible and use more plant-based options to reduce your carbon footprint? We’ve worked on that part for many years and we now have a consulting firm working out of the UK that will help us validate more of that data and improve that over the next few years. “The second part, which we’ve never really had an opportunity to explore, is on the construction side. How do we look at lighting, the materials we use, working more closely with landlords to look at solar panels, etc? For that, we are working with two architectural firms to look at reusing materials like plastic bottles to use as construction materials, all the way down to using upcycled wood for our chairs and tables… We know we will not become net zero that way and we’ll still need to offset, but we are challenging ourselves to try and bring all that down to as low as possible and offset the debt.” HARNESSING DATA SaladStop!’s early reliance on data enabled it to respond quickly to the pandemic. Its first hard-hit market was Hong Kong, where the drastic drop in business gave the company a glimpse of what was to follow in its other territories. A quick pivot to online channels saw the business not only grow, but thrive, so it is no surprise that SaladStop! has redefined its model to a hybrid one comprising physical stores and cloud kitchens. The data it collects will drive its longer-term plan to become a personalised nutrition company, where customers can order based on their health goals. “We see a huge gap in the market when it comes to personalised nutrition and health. There are lots of solutions out there that will help guide you along that journey… But no one has been able to offer you that in real time and at affordable price points. So, this is us leveraging on what we’ve built over the years… If you land on a SaladStop! of the future, you can tell us what you want and we can tailor that meal exactly to you. Fundamentally, it’s adding value to our customers. We think (this) can be a huge IP for the group; it’s what can set us apart,” said Adrien. “We’ve spent a lot of time building all the pieces of our business and our brands that are now recognised and trusted. Being able to take that and add a layer of technology and really supercharge what we have today… that’s what we’re super excited about.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/new-year-2022-tips-how-improve-mental-health-2408441,Want to improve your mental health in 2022? Here's how,"The year 2021 was one of emotional whiplash. There was anticipation for vaccines, followed by confusing rollouts. Then, we saw some hope as many people were inoculated, only to find new variants, a tumultuous news cycle and widespread confusion around the bend. The good news is that people across the country — including experts, public figures and kids — started talking more openly and publicly about the importance of mental health. And there are many tools to help one stay balanced in the face of so much stress and anxiety. Here are the top pieces of advice from our the most popular mental health stories in 2021,  to help you carry calm and clarity into 2022. 1. GIVE YOUR FEELING A NAME. Back in April, Adam Grant had already called it; he said, “Languishing might be the dominant emotion of 2021.” People certainly knew they were feeling some kind of way, but it wasn’t burnout or depression or even boredom. “Languishing is the neglected middle child of mental health,” Dr. Grant wrote. “It’s the void between depression and flourishing — the absence of well-being.” He provided some tips to cure languishing, but the powerful first step Dr. Grant proposed was simply naming the feeling. Doing so gave us “a clearer window into what had been a blurry experience,” he wrote, and a socially acceptable response to the question: “How are you?” 2. GIVE YOUR MENTAL ILLNESS A NAME, TOO. While Lily Burana had always been candid about her depression and anxiety, getting a third diagnosis this spring — for A.D.H.D. — made it harder to discuss her mental health clearly, she wrote. So Ms. Burana gave “the whole bundle” a nickname: Bruce. As in Springsteen, a public figure who has been open about his own struggles with mental health. “The nickname allows me to efficiently keep people apprised of my status, as in: ‘Bruce has really been bringing me down this week,’” she wrote. “The nickname helps me lighten up about my own darkness.” 3. FIND MEANING IN EVERYDAY ACTIVITIES. A growing body of research shows that there are simple steps you can take to recharge your emotional batteries and spark a sense of fulfilment, purpose and happiness. The psychology community calls this lofty combination of physical, mental and emotional fitness “flourishing.” One easy way to get there is by doing your everyday activities with more purpose. Something as simple as cleaning the kitchen or doing yard work, or even washing your pillowcases, can build toward a sense of accomplishment. Set a 10-minute timer and go for a short jog, or try a one-minute meditation. 4. TRY MEDITATING ANYWHERE. Your brain is like a computer, and it has only a certain amount of working memory, said Dr. Judson Brewer, the director of research and innovation at Brown University’s Mindfulness Center. That’s why negative emotions like anxiety and stress can make it harder to think or solve problems. “The first thing we have to do is ground ourselves in the present moment so we can calm down,” said Dr. Brewer, who suggested keeping this meditation technique in your back pocket: Hold one hand in front of you, fingers spread. Now, slowly trace the outside of your hand with the index finger on your other hand, breathing in when you trace up a finger, and out when you trace down. Move up and down all five fingers. When you’ve traced your whole hand, reverse direction and do it again. 5. ALLOW YOURSELF TO GRIEVE ‘SMALL’ LOSSES. In the hierarchy of human suffering during the pandemic, a cancelled prom or vacation or lost time with grandchildren may not sound like much, but mental health experts say that all loss needs to be acknowledged and grieved. We need to give ourselves permission to mourn, Tara Parker-Pope wrote in an article about disenfranchised grief. “Once you accept that your grief is real, there are steps you can take to help you cope,” she said. “Consider planting a tree, for example, or finding an item that represents your loss, like cancelled airline tickets or a wedding invitation, and burying it.” 6. IF YOU NEED ONE, TAKE A ‘SAD DAY.’ When your brain and body need a break, taking a mental health day off from work or school can help you rest and recharge. As one clinical psychologist told Christina Caron: “You wouldn’t feel bad about taking time off when sick. You shouldn’t feel bad about taking some time off when you’re sad.” You don’t need to tell anyone why you’re taking the time off. In most situations, just say that you need to take a sick day, and leave it at that, the experts told Ms. Caron. But try not to spend the day checking your messages or feeling guilty. Make a plan to do something that will help you recharge. Our readers offered their suggestions here. 7. WRITE DOWN WHAT’S BOTHERING YOU BEFORE BED. Chronically bad sleep is more than just a nuisance. It weakens the immune system, reduces memory and attention span, and increases the likelihood of depression. Anahad O’Connor, who reported on the rise of sleep disturbances during the pandemic, said that one of the most effective treatments for “coronasomnia” was cognitive behavioural therapy, or C.B.T., because this approach helps you address the underlying thoughts, feelings and behaviours that are ruining your sleep. One C.B.T.-inspired strategy is to write down all your thoughts, especially anything that is bothering you, two hours before bed, then crumple up the paper and throw it away. This symbolic gesture empowers you and calms your mind, a sleep medicine doctor told Mr. O’Connor. 8. COUNT SHEEP … OR WHATEVER. If you can fall asleep at night, but have trouble staying asleep, you may need other tactics to beat insomnia. Waking up at 3 a.m.? Anahad O’Connor had advice for that predicament too, like limiting your alcohol intake and reducing caffeine. Our readers had other tips: Maria De Angelo, a teacher in Los Angeles who also renovates houses, said she closes her eyes and thinks of a complicated electrical wiring scheme in a kitchen she once renovated. The mental exercise induces boredom, much like counting sheep, which helps her drift back to sleep. On other nights, to mix things up, Ms. De Angelo shuts her eyes and recites the names of every state in America in alphabetical order. “I haven’t yet made it past ‘N,’” she said. “Either method — or both — will work 95 percent of the time.” 9. IF YOU CAN, GIVE BACK. Well before a pandemic tore people away from their loved ones, experts were warning of “an epidemic of loneliness” in the United States. A potential cure? Kindness toward others, Christina Caron wrote in an article about the benefits of volunteering. Research shows that giving back can improve our health, ease feelings of loneliness and broaden our social networks. Start by setting a small goal, like volunteering once a week, or even once a month, and building from there. 10. FINALLY, GIVE YOURSELF A BREAK. During our two-week Fresh Start Challenge, Tara Parker-Pope heard from a lot of readers who were berating themselves for gaining weight or exercising less during the pandemic lockdowns. Her response? “Shaming yourself is counterproductive.” Instead, practice self-compassion. One of the simplest ways to do so is to ask yourself one question: “What do I need right now?”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/how-curb-drinking-festive-season-boozing-dry-january-2400751,Here’s how to embrace mindful drinking during this festive season,"  Dry January – or Drynuary, for the initiated – offers your body and mind a chance to reset and reflect after the seasonal bloat and weariness. For a vocal movement, the approach of scaling back drinking to live more fully in the moment can, and should, happen year-round. Rather than cutting out alcohol entirely, though, a growing number of people are “sober curious,” exploring elements of a booze-free lifestyle without fully abstaining. “Mindful drinking,” a phrase and philosophy that brings the self-reflection of meditation to a glass of wine or beer, has become increasingly commonplace in recent years, said Rosamund Dean, a journalist in London who published a book based on the term in 2017. She wanted to become more intentional about her relationship to drinking, she said, instead of seeing alcohol as a habit or a crutch. “It was going to the work event where there was nasty, cheap white wine and knocking it back,” or “putting the kids in bed after a busy day and cracking a bottle open,” she said. “It’s the drinking you do without really thinking about it.” Mindful drinking, by contrast, means “bringing awareness to your behaviours in terms of your decision to drink alcohol”: for example, tallying how many cocktails you consume in a given night, or paying close attention to why, where and when you’re drawn to drinking. This moderation mind-set might particularly appeal to people searching for ways to scale back on troubling habits they developed during the pandemic. Studies have shown a dramatic increase in problematic drinking over the last year, especially among women. As the pandemic slogged on, “We had a real spike in people coming to us,” said Millie Gooch, who founded the Sober Girl Society collective in 2018. The community connects sober and “sober curious” women for events like “boozeless brunches” and virtual breakfast discussions. Ruby Warrington, a writer in New York, started using the term “sober curious” five years ago. At the time, she said in an interview, her drinking habits appeared to be under control: She never blacked out, or even drank more than two nights in a row. But she drank more than she wanted to, she didn’t feel able to say no. Ms. Warrington craved a middle-ground approach to drinking: the ability to interrogate her relationship to alcohol without ending it completely. In 2018, she published “Sober Curious: The Blissful Sleep, Greater Focus, Limitless Presence, and Deep Connection Awaiting Us All on the Other Side of Alcohol,” articulating the philosophy behind what she calls “choosing to question” her impulse to imbibe. Ms. Warrington says that interrogating one’s drinking habits often leads people to adopt more mindful drinking strategies. “Collectively, we’ve inherited this story about alcohol that the only way to change your drinking is if you’ve hit rock bottom,” said Dru Jaeger, co-founder and director of programs at Club Soda, an online community that sprouted up nearly seven years ago in Britain. The group hosts online and in-person social events without alcohol, as well as free and paid programs that teach members how to reduce their drinking habits. About half of Club Soda’s over 70,000 members are interested in moderating their drinking, rather than in becoming entirely sober. The group has seen consistent growth, particularly in the United States, in recent years, as well as more interest from people in their 20s concerned about the toll drinking takes on their mental health. There is limited scientific evidence on the efficacy of using mindfulness to moderate drinking behaviours. A 2017 study of 68 heavy drinkers in Britain found that those who received 11 minutes of mindfulness instruction reduced their alcohol consumption significantly the next week. This “micro dose of meditation” may have helped participants regulate their emotions, encouraging them to rely on mindfulness when they might otherwise turn to alcohol to cope with stress, said Sunjeev Kamboj, a psychology professor at University College London and the lead author of the study. The mindful drinking approach also draws on similar strategies to cognitive behavioural therapy, a psychological intervention used to address depression and anxiety, said Kenneth Stoller, associate professor of psychiatry and behavioural sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. By encouraging people to identify the impact alcohol has on their thoughts, feelings and behaviours, mindful drinking can be an effective tool for people interested in reducing their alcohol consumption, he said, but not for anyone with a severe drinking problem or alcohol-use disorder. Some experts and “sober curious” veterans offered tips for becoming more thoughtful about alcohol. STOP AND REFLECT Ms. Warrington recommends that people interested in cutting back remove alcohol from their lives for an extended period, typically between 30 and 100 days. That hiatus is an opportunity for reflection, she said. Ask yourself about the role alcohol plays in your life and the moments throughout your daily routine – the weekend dinner with friends, the TV episode before bed – that most make you crave it and find other ways to fill in the gaps. Dr. Stoller advises thinking through what you like and don’t like about drinking. Is it the taste of alcohol that draws you in? The bodily sensation of a buzz? Identify the amount of alcohol you typically consume to induce a certain effect, and then consider the facets of drinking you enjoy less, like hangovers or the sense of losing control. Articulating these aspects of your drinking life can help you form realistic guidelines for cutting back, he said. MAKE A PLAN Drinking narrows our focus on the world, Dr. Stoller said, creating what some psychologists call “alcoholic myopia” – we focus only on the present moment. That’s why it’s crucial to establish a plan for mindful drinking ahead of time, he said. This can include drinking with a friend who’s also practicing mindful drinking, making sure you eat while you’re drinking and asking the bartender to use half the amount of alcohol in a cocktail. These tricks will slow the rate of alcohol entering your system, he said, which can help you be more intentional about the drinks you do choose to consume. Ms. Dean sticks to what she calls the rule of three: three drinks or less, no more than three nights each week. Often, she ends up drinking less than that, she said, and the hard limit prompts her to savour each beverage. ASK QUESTIONS Don’t take booze for granted. If you are going to drink, make it a conscious, deliberate choice. Think about whether alcohol will add value to your experience – what difference will drinking make to your time at a party or your night at the bar? And if you’re drinking to try to enjoy an event where you’re not having a good time, consider just going home. Ms. Gooch encourages those new to mindful drinking to keep asking questions about the motivating factors behind their alcohol consumption – like the friends with whom they drink the most, and the situations that tempt them to head to the bar. “If you really want to have a glass of wine, have a glass of wine,” Ms. Warrington said. But pay attention to the sensation of drinking it. How does the wine taste? What prompted you to crave alcohol? How do you feel the next day? “Stay curious,” she said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/people/sarvesh-shashi-sarva-yoga-2408856,Meet the entrepreneur whose yoga studio is backed by J Lo and other celebs,"In 2019, Sarva Yoga was booming. Founded in 2013 by Kerala-born Chennai-based university dropout and first-time entrepreneur Sarvesh Shashi when he was just 21 (it rebranded from Zorba to Sarva in 2016), it employed more than 400 staff in 92 studios across 32 cities in India, and was set to expand overseas, starting with three studios in London. “We had joked about Sarva being a kind of ‘Starbucks for yoga’,” recalled the now 29-year-old. “What’s a place where you find friends and never want to leave? It's like a coffee shop, but for yoga, designed to engage the optical, olfactory, audible, tactile and kinesthetic senses with a pleasing sight, warm lights, a familiar homely scent that calms the mind, a harmonious soothing melody that plays in the studio, a welcoming touch and an energetic vibe”. Along the way, it drew a star-studded constellation of investors such as American celeb Jennifer Lopez, Bollywood actress Malaika Arora, British entrepreneur and private equity investor David Giampaolo, and fitness enterprise Zumba Fitness LLC, to the tune of US$11 million (S$15 million). “All the investors are first and foremost people who believe in the power of Yoga. Once they are convinced that the core offering is authentic, the rest is relatively easy,” he said. Then COVID-19 struck, causing India to go into a strict lockdown, and Sarva to shut down all but two of its yoga studios, and reduce staff headcount to 75. Far from being decimated, it rose from the ashes of the pandemic fallout, by reinventing itself as a 100 per cent digital wellness platform in the form of a mobile app called Sarva – Yoga & Mindfulness. Launched in March 2020, it offers 1,500 hours of multilingual video content for yoga practice, audio content for meditation, as well as yoga teacher training and certification, by, in Shashi’s words, “instructors from top yoga schools, from the birthplace of Yoga (India)”. Prices start at US$5.99 for a monthly plan to US$84.99 for a lifetime plan – an amazing value proposition when you consider that the average hour-long live yoga class in Singapore costs about S$30, while an online class here costs S$10. “The pandemic has been a rough time for the entire world, and Sarva is here to help. For the international Day of Yoga, we urged people to #StartTohKaro (loosely translated from Hindi, it means #JustStart!) and that’s something we have been focusing on,” Shashi said. This pivot from a “bricks and mortar” expansion plan to mostly online, has proved even better for Sarva’s fortunes. According to Shashi, the app has achieved 750,000 downloads in 17 months. Quarter-on-quarter growth since 2020 has averaged 100 per cent. Users in 97 countries across the world have downloaded the app. More than 100 brand partnerships for corporate wellness have been inked, with attendance rising to 70 per cent. The app’s most premium offering, personal training, saw a 100 per cent renewal rate in July 2021. Users give it an overall average quality score of 8.6 (out of 10), based on metrics such as quality of workshops, quality of instructors, and variety of offerings. Its aim for 2022 is to accelerate growth in India, USA and the UK. “I think it's safe to say that the Eskimos are loving the ice,” Shashi quipped in response to my comment that he’s managed to repackage and resell yoga to Indians, before exporting it across the world. “I think we have the right combination to connect seven billion breaths through Yoga,” he said, quoting Sarva’s mantra. That’s pretty impressive considering his very first yoga studio was run as a one-man show, with him wearing several hats as instructor, receptionist, handyman, and cleaner. “I didn't have any work experience prior; I had the opportunity to join my family business, but had made up my mind that I wanted to start a yoga studio. My parents supported the decision as they themselves practise yoga and have benefitted immensely from it,” he said, sharing that his father is an entrepreneur running 17 businesses with an annual revenue of about US$200 million, while his mother is “CEO of our home” with interests like yoga, alternative healing, meditation and fashion. The oldest of three children, Shashi’s younger sister is a photographer and yogini, while his younger brother is a psychology student. His first encounter with yoga was when as a child, his father had to rush off halfway through a yoga class and bade Shashi to complete it on his behalf. “The year 2020 marked the end of physical studios as we knew it, and the statistics around COVID-19 have been just as alarming,” he noted, quoting figures such as how more than 264 million people of all ages suffer from depression (World Health Organization); between 10 per cent and 30 per cent of adults struggle with chronic insomnia (Sleep Foundation); approximately 463 million adults (aged 20 to 79 years) are living with diabetes (International Diabetes Federation); one in 10 women suffer from Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), with 40 per cent of PCOS sufferers at risk for depression and self-esteem issues (Voyage Healthcare); and how worldwide obesity has nearly tripled since 1975 (WHO). “Stress, anxiety, and obesity are all becoming a global epidemic and what better time to start yoga than now, as yoga offers a solution for all of these? It’s not just us saying it; the whole world realised this in the short period of 18 months since nationwide lockdowns in March 2020. Global fitness trends dictate what users want: Better health, better fitness, better nutrition, better appearance, better sleep, better mindfulness,” he declared. Shashi, who describes his management style as “collaborative”, describes his typical work week as “full of deadlines, brainstorming, firefighting, continuous pivoting, and lots of small successes compounded in a giant success at the end of our monthly sprints”.
 
“I don't have any work-life balance!” he admitted. “I believe in something where personal and professional lives come together for who you are as a person. If you love what you do in life and you love what you do in your personal life, it becomes a seamless structure. This isn’t work-life balance, this is work-life harmony… I consider this a fortunate situation, where what I care about deeply in my personal space and something I am capable of, became something I dedicated my life to.” Outside of work, fitness and sports are a big part of his life. “I enjoy playing cricket (when he was six, he aspired to be a professional cricket player), I do yoga and meditation, and I also work out in a gym, which a lot of people find strange. But these two can co-exist, and they are better when done in the right combination,” he said, adding: “I am also an adventure junkie. I’ve jumped from the highest point in the world, I got my water scooter licence in Miami, I’ve done skydiving, scuba and a lot more. I am not a movie or a TV buff. But I love crime thrillers and investigative movies as it makes me think about ‘How to Solve’.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/obesity-kids-overweight-health-risk-factor-covid-19-sedentary-2375601,Commentary: Singapore children are getting fatter and it’s worrying especially during a pandemic,"SINGAPORE: As a paediatrician assessing children with acute COVID-19 infection for their suitability for home recovery during this pandemic, it struck me that a worrying proportion appeared overweight. As part of any paediatric assessment, we routinely ask for their weight as dosage of medications is often based on weight. By my estimate, about one in five kids I saw was overweight (body mass index over 85th percentile) or worse, obese (above 95th percentile). One child in primary school was even morbidly obese, that is, the Body Mass Index (BMI) was higher than 99 per cent of children of the same age. What I am seeing in my clinic is reflective of national data and it worries me. About 13 per cent of Singapore schoolchildren were obese in 2017, up from 11 per cent in 2013, according to the Ministry of Health (MOH)’s National Population Health Survey when data on childhood obesity was last captured. The pandemic has made things worse. KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital reported seeing more cases of overweight children since COVID-19 hit. This might be due to a more sedentary lifestyle amid restrictions. Schoolchildren couldn’t mingle with friends in other classes during recess, participate in group activities like PE and co-curricular activities or when they were stuck at home for home-based learning. In our current situation this is worrying, as obesity may increase the risk of severe COVID-19, including in children. Stanford University researchers recently found the virus targets fat cells – making those who are overweight at greater risk of serious illness.  The exact mechanisms for this association need further study but the signs are there – being overweight is a risk factor. A common misconception people have is to think of obese children as just being fat. The reality is it affects our body systems: Obesity contributes to hormonal imbalance and increases resistance to insulin in Type 2 diabetes. The more obese one is, the higher one's insulin resistance. Excess weight puts more load on our joints and can lead to osteoarthritis. Obesity is also one of the biggest contributing factors to plaque formation in our heart vessels – which can start from adolescence or even earlier – and present later in adulthood as coronary heart disease.  Studies also show about 70 per cent of obese kids grow up to be obese adults. If we tackle obesity at childhood, we can reap many beneficial downstream outcomes. Adults I know who shed extra pounds find their lives improve – they sleep better, their pre-diabetes and fatty liver conditions resolve, they no longer need medications, monitoring devices or even frequent visits to their doctors. In the long run, it reduces healthcare costs too. A study done in the US estimated that the direct medical cost of child with obesity is between US$12,660 and US$19,630 higher than a child of normal weight and allowing for normal weight gain to adulthood. Many obese children I see also have overweight or obese siblings and parents. Quite often, they come from middle to lower income families, with both parents working to supplement the family income. They tell me it’s hard to cook healthy food and “quick and easy” fast food meals are the norm.   Those who work long hours also don’t have the time nor energy for activities so everyone leads a sedentary lifestyle at home. Of course, there are also genetic factors – not everyone with unhealthy lifestyles is overweight.  But there is no denying our lifestyles have an impact on our weight – largely being sedentary, big portions when eating, snacking, overconsumption of hidden high calories like sugared drinks, late dinners and binge eating after attempting dieting are common. So how do we address these?  Those growing up in the 90s would be familiar with the now-defunct Trim-and-Fit (TAF) club in schools that compelled overweight children to skip recess to exercise – sometimes in horror of having to do so in front of peers. While some success was reported, a study also suggested it may have contributed to eating disorders.  Since 2008, schools refer to a Holistic Health Framework for all students, not only those who are overweight.  At the tertiary healthcare level, both paediatric hospitals (NUH and KKH) run clinics that focus on childhood weight management. It is a multi-disciplinary approach involving a paediatrician, oftentimes a paediatric endocrinologist, dietician and occupational and physical therapists and sometimes a medical social worker.  Successful weight management often requires consistent lifestyle changes and we know this is hard to achieve. There are multiple and diverse challenges and weight management clinics identify what the most likely barriers are for specific cases and develop targeted interventions.  Examples of these barriers include poor education of what normal, healthy weight is, risks of obesity, poor motivation, concurrent mental health problems and lack of family support.  Hopefully, these interventions work and we won’t need to reach the stage of military-style weight loss boot camps, like in China, where childhood obesity has also become a rising public health concern. In Singapore, only overweight boys must serve a longer stint for National Service. We want to prevent obesity and these health issues before they even happen. It is easier to enforce healthy lifestyle changes as a child and these changes can become good habits that children can continue to practice as adults and later, pass down to their own kids when they become parents themselves. Initial strategies should aim for a slower weight gain first followed by targeting to reach a healthy weight as the child grows.  From my experience, a significant proportion of overweight children appear to be from families with a family or parental history of obesity, from lower socio-economic strata or lower educational backgrounds. If this can be confirmed, we can then focus our energies there. Intervention for such kids is already in place. They range from school to community interventions and tertiary healthcare facilities. School interventions are free and those by the Health Promotion Board (HPB) interventions are affordable.  If finances are a barrier, a medical social worker can help many low-income families. The most common and challenging barrier to break through is motivation.  A laissez-faire attitude towards the child’s health, poor commitment in sticking to the treatment plan, poor attendance at intervention sessions are all too common.   For intervention to succeed, the whole family needs to rally together. However, every other member of the family may have different competing priorities making family-based treatments even more challenging. A collaboration, perhaps between MOH-HPB, ECDA and MOE – culminating in a multi-ministry effort will probably be most fiscally responsible, efficient and effective.  Some gaps that can be addressed include: Increasing community-based initiatives after office-hour programmes and developing programmes that nurture a child’s natural predilection for play thereby embedding exercise into their routine. It is imperative we do not stigmatise the overweight child as this will likely lead to negative self-image and potentially leads to future eating disorders. The 2020 iteration of MOH’s survey indicates that obesity rate among adults has risen to the highest level since 2010, with 10.5 per cent of Singapore residents found to be obese. Our nation has declared a war on diabetes and adult-onset diabetes is associated with obesity.  Let’s address this problem of childhood obesity as a priority. It is far better to prevent a war than to fight one. Dr Lim Yang Chern is consultant paediatrician at the Thomson Paediatric Centre (Jurong East)."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/health-tips-blood-pressure-medications-2403421,Did you know that common medications can raise your blood pressure?,"High blood pressure remains a leading cause of death and disability today. Nearly half of adults have high blood pressure, and only a quarter of them have their blood pressure under control, putting them at increased risk of heart attack, stroke, dementia, kidney disease and other ills. Before the coronavirus pandemic, high blood pressure caused or contributed to more than half a million deaths a year in the United States, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. Those numbers have most likely increased, as blood pressure readings have shot up during the pandemic. You may have long thought your blood pressure was within normal limits. But in 2017, based on better long-term data, experts lowered the numbers that constitute a healthy blood pressure, resulting in a greater proportion of the population with this risky condition. The former upper limit of “normal” blood pressure, once believed to be 140 over 90 millimetres of mercury, was recognized as too high to prevent serious health problems over time. The current upper limit of normal is 130 over 80, and a blood pressure consistently above 120 over 80 is now considered problematic. There are many reasons for the nation’s high rate of uncontrolled hypertension, the medical term for high blood pressure. Being overweight and, for many, excessive consumption of salt lead the list, followed by inconsistent use of medically prescribed remedies and a failure to adopt lifestyle measures that can reduce elevated blood pressure. Now, a new study has highlighted another problem often unknown to patients and overlooked by doctors that can complicate treatment of hypertension and swell the ranks of those with uncontrolled high blood pressure: the large number of medications and supplements people take, some of which can raise blood pressure and undermine the benefits of otherwise effective treatment. The study involved 27,599 adults, 35.4 per cent of whom had uncontrolled hypertension, who were part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. The periodic surveys, which are known as NHANES and track the health of a representative sample of Americans, found that many people took medications and other substances that could raise an otherwise normal blood pressure or limit the effectiveness of treatment prescribed to lower an elevated blood pressure. Among adults in the survey, 17.5 per cent whose hypertension was not adequately controlled were taking prescription drugs that can raise blood pressure, the researchers reported. And 18.5 per cent of survey participants with hypertension that was effectively treated were also taking such drugs, suggesting that some of these people might not otherwise need blood pressure treatment. The study was published online in November in JAMA Internal Medicine. Its senior author, Dr. Timothy S. Anderson, a primary care doctor at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre in Boston, said he and his colleagues hoped to alert more doctors and patients to the ways medications or other substances might be contributing to increased blood pressure. Increased awareness would be especially helpful before patients were prescribed drugs to lower blood pressure or given more potent drugs to enhance the effectiveness of current treatment. For some medical conditions unrelated to hypertension, switching to a different drug might bring a patient’s elevated blood pressure back down to normal. For example, the study authors suggested, women on an oestrogen-containing oral contraceptive, which can raise blood pressure, might be switched to a progestin-only or nonhormonal contraceptive. Similarly, those taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID, to control pain might use acetaminophen instead. There’s a long list of prescribed medications, as well as over-the-counter drugs and recreational substances and supplements, that can interfere with effective treatment for hypertension. In addition to oestrogen-containing drugs and NSAIDS, the list includes widely used medicines like antidepressants and oral steroids such as cortisone; substances like nicotine, alcohol and cocaine; herbal supplements like licorice or ginseng; and, of course, salt. Caffeine, too, can raise blood pressure over the short-term in some people. When doctors fail to ask patients what else they may be taking, using or consuming that can affect blood pressure – or if patients neglect to mention all of the over the counter and herbal remedies and prescription drugs they take – patients may be prescribed an unnecessary or more potent blood pressure drug that may have bothersome side effects. Dr. Anderson said that doctors were “taught to screen patients initially for other drugs being taken that can raise blood pressure, but patients are not necessarily rechecked for such drug use over time.” He said that it was important for doctors to take good medical histories, including what might have changed in patients’ lives since their blood pressures were last under control. “Maybe there was a change in diet that caused a quick rise in blood pressure,” Dr. Anderson said. “For example, some patients are very salt-sensitive,” he said. “Along with age and weight, it’s the strongest predictor of high blood pressure over time.” Changing just one frequently consumed high-salt food, like pizza, cured meats or canned soup, may be enough to lower the risk of hypertension. Complicating matters is that people’s reactions to various substances, like the commonly prescribed S.S.R.I. antidepressants, are “very idiosyncratic,” he explained. “A particular S.S.R.I. may have a high impact on blood pressure in some patients but not others.” For patients with hypertension who need to take a drug that can raise blood pressure, Dr. Anderson advised using a home blood pressure monitor. A sudden rise in blood pressure after starting a new drug can help alert the prescribing doctor to the need to switch to an alternative remedy if one is available. Even if you’ve had normal blood pressure for five or more decades, there’s a 90 per cent chance that you’ll develop hypertension as you get older, which makes it all the more important to modify risks like dietary salt and excess weight while you’re still healthy. Even a modest weight loss of 10 pounds can both reduce the risk of developing hypertension and lower blood pressure in overweight people who already have this condition. Another common predictor is a sedentary lifestyle. Adopting a habit of regular physical activity can help people maintain a normal blood pressure throughout life. Other effective measures to control hypertension include quitting smoking and limiting consumption of alcohol. “Even a modest reduction in smoking and drinking can have a positive impact on blood pressure,” Dr. Anderson said. Before you start medication for hypertension, show your doctor a list of all the drugs – prescribed and otherwise –  you take, and disclose any problematic substances, especially high amounts of dietary salt, you regularly use or ingest.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-lifestyle/twitching-eyelid-serious-health-problem-2405051,What causes your eyelids to start twitching? We got the answers,"Sometimes your eyelid twitches on and off for days – weeks, even. It’s distracting and irritating. So how do you get it to stop? And should you be concerned? Eyelid spasms, while annoying, are “rarely a sign of something serious,” said Stephanie Erwin, an optometrist at Cleveland Clinic’s Cole Eye Institute. The most common type of eye twitch is a series of muscle contractions called eyelid myokymia, which produces involuntary and intermittent contractions of the eyelid, typically the lower one. Only one eye is affected at a time because the twitch originates in the muscle surrounding the eye, and not the nerve that controls the blink reflex, which sends the same message to both eyes simultaneously, Dr. Erwin added. The spasms can last from hours to days to months. “If the twitching persists for a long period of time, or is accompanied by additional symptoms, it is a good idea to be checked by an eye doctor to make sure nothing else is going on,” she said. If the twitching spreads to other muscles in the face or if you notice both eyes are twitching at the same time, those are indications of a more serious problem. Other red flags include a drooping eyelid or a red eye. But if just one eyelid is twitching on and off, it is usually a harmless (and often exasperating) case of eyelid myokymia. As for why it happens: “Nobody knows exactly why,” said Dr. Alice Lorch, an ophthalmologist at Massachusetts Eye and Ear in Boston. Sometimes it stems from a small irritation, for example a contact lens rubbing against the eyelid, she added. But more commonly, it is stress, lack of sleep or excessive caffeine intake that brings on eyelid twitching, the experts said. Dry eye, a common affliction among those who stare at screens most of the day, is another culprit. Studies have indicated that we blink less when looking at digital devices, which makes our eyes feel dry. There is no quick fix for an eyelid twitch once it starts, Dr. Lorch said. But artificial tears, eyedrops that lubricate the eye, can help. Ideally, choose ones that are preservative-free, because chemical preservatives can sometimes be irritating. You can also try massaging your eyes in the shower or covering your eyes with a damp, warm washcloth right before bed, she added, which will help relax your eye muscles and open the glands on the margins of the eyelids. This increases oil flow into the eyes and slows down tear evaporation. Other preventive measures include getting more rest and reducing stress. “Twitching is a signal by your body asking you to slow down,” said Dr. Raj Maturi, a spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Decreasing caffeine intake can also help prevent eye twitching, because large amounts of caffeine can lead to muscle tension. Having one or two cups of coffee each day should be fine, Dr. Lorch said. It’s also important to stay hydrated and eat a balanced diet that includes foods high in potassium (potatoes, bananas and lentils are great sources), magnesium (found in leafy green vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts and fish) and calcium (try dairy, sardines, dark leafy greens or fortified breakfast cereals), since imbalances in these minerals may lead to twitching. Tonic water is sometimes touted as a remedy for eyelid twitching because it contains a small amount of quinine. Quinine, a medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat malaria, has also been used off-label to treat night-time leg cramps, something the F.D.A. says is neither safe nor effective. There is no scientific evidence that tonic water prevents or alleviates eyelid twitching. Rarely, eye doctors will use Botox to stop the twitching by injecting a small amount into the orbicularis muscle that surrounds the eyelids, but this is done “only in severe cases,” Dr. Erwin said. Eyelid myokymia usually goes away on its own without medical intervention, the experts said. For most patients, it’s just a matter of resting, taking steps to reduce stress, lubricating the eye and waiting it out.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/fitness-wellness-health-plan-short-workouts-mind-body-2406601,"Fitness in 2021: All about shorter workouts, greater clarity, longer lives","In a year filled with Covid-related hopes, setbacks, advances and losses, the most vital exercise science of 2021 provided a reminder that for many of us, our bodies and minds can strengthen, endure and flourish, no matter our circumstances. If we move our bodies in the right ways, a growing body of evidence suggests we might live with greater stamina, purpose and cognitive clarity for many years to come. And it may not take much movement. In fact, some of the year’s biggest fitness news concerned how little exercise we might be able to get away with, while maintaining or even improving our health. A study from January, for instance, showed that just five minutes of intense calisthenics substantially improved college students’ aerobic fitness and leg strength. Another series of studies from the University of Texas found that four seconds — yes, seconds — of ferocious bicycle pedalling, repeated several times, was enough to raise adults’ strength and endurance, whatever their age or health when they started. Even people whose favourite workout is walking might need less than they think to reach an exercise sweet spot, other new research suggested. As I wrote in July, the familiar goal of 10,000 daily steps, deeply embedded in our activity trackers and collective consciousness, has little scientific validity. It is a myth that grew out of a marketing accident, and a study published this summer further debunked it, finding that people who took between 7,000 and 8,000 steps a day, or a little more than three miles, generally lived longer than those strolling less or accumulating more than 10,000 steps. So, keep moving, but there’s no need to fret if your total doesn’t reach a five-figure step count. Of course, exercise science weighed in on other resonant topics this year, too, including weight. And the news there was not all cheering. Multiple studies this year reinforced an emerging scientific consensus that our bodies compensate for some of the calories we expend during physical activity, by shunting energy away from certain cellular processes or prompting us unconsciously to move and fidget less. A study from July, for example, that examined the metabolisms of almost 2,000 people concluded that we probably compensate, on average, for about a quarter of the calories we burn with exercise. As a result, on days we exercise, we wind up burning far fewer total calories than we might think, making weight loss that much more challenging. On the other hand, exercise seems essential for weight maintenance, according to other research this year. A new scientific analysis of participants from the TV weight-loss contest “The Biggest Loser” found that those who exercised the most in the years after the program ended were the least likely to have regained all of the pounds they shed during the show. Exercise also has a disproportionate impact on our odds of enjoying a long, healthy life. According to one of the most inspiring studies this year, overweight people who started working out lowered their risk of premature death by about 30 per cent even if they remained overweight, with exercise providing about twice as much benefit as weight loss might. Exercise enhances our brain power, too, according to other memorable experiments from this year. They showed physical activity fortifying immune cells that help protect us against dementia; prompting the release of a hormone that improves neuron health and the ability to think (in mice); shoring up the fabric of our brains’ white matter, the stuff that connects and protects our working brain cells; and likely even adding to our creativity. In a nifty study from February, physically active people tended to dream up more-inventive ways to use car tires and umbrellas, a standard test of creativity, than people who seldom moved around much. Taken together, this year’s exercise neuroscience research makes “a strong case for getting up and moving” if we hope to use our brains with ongoing clarity and in imaginative ways deep into our golden years, as one of the researchers said to me. Still, the study that stuck with me most this year had less to do with the myriad ways exercise remodels our bodies and brains and more with how it might shape our sense of what matters. In the study, which I wrote about in May, active people reported a stronger sense of purpose in their lives than inactive people. “A sense of purpose is the feeling you get from having goals and plans that give direction and meaning to life,” the study’s lead researcher told me. “It is about being engaged with life in productive ways.” The study found that exercise amplified people’s purposefulness over time, while simultaneously, a sturdy sense of purpose fortified people’s willingness to exercise. In effect, the more people felt their lives had meaning, the more they wound up moving, and the more they moved, the more meaningful they found their lives. It’s a result worth remembering as we look ahead with wary optimism. So, stay healthy, active and in touch in 2022, everyone. Here’s to a happy new year!

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/how-cope-loneliness-mental-wellness-volunteering-2399346,Feeling lonely? Volunteering may just be the answer,"Well before a global pandemic tore us away from our loved ones, and the Omicron variant threatened to upend holiday plans, experts were warning of “an epidemic of loneliness”. Three in five Americans surveyed in 2019 reported feeling lonely, which the researchers attributed to a variety of factors, including a lack of social support, infrequent meaningful social interactions, poor physical and mental health and an imbalance in daily activities. In addition, nearly one quarter of those 65 and older are considered socially isolated, according to the National Health and Aging Trends Study. Loneliness often stems from unwanted solitude. But it is also driven by a discrepancy between how you perceive your relationships versus what you want (or expect) from them. That disconnect is why you can be surrounded by family at Christmas and still feel like an outsider. A potential cure? Kindness toward others. Something as simple as volunteering can improve our health, ease feelings of loneliness and broaden our social networks, studies suggest. Opportunities to give back – both in person and virtually – are more commonplace than they were last year, and the need for volunteers hasn’t let up, especially at food pantries. “Volunteering is one of the best, most certain ways we can find a purpose and meaning in our life,” said Val Walker, the author of “400 Friends and No One to Call: Breaking Through Isolation and Building Community.” THE BENEFITS OF VOLUNTEERING In a study of 10,000 volunteers in Britain, about two-thirds agreed that their volunteering had helped them feel less isolated, particularly those ages 18 to 34. Sam Boyd, 24, the director of volunteer management at Special Olympics Maryland, said she sees even her most withdrawn volunteers “come alive” during a shift, and by the end of the day, “they’re fist bumping and elbow tapping with other people.” When volunteering, you can also “get to know more about yourself and broaden your view of the world,” she added. Among older adults, social isolation and loneliness are associated with higher rates of mortality, depression and cognitive decline. Experts say that volunteering not only helps people feel less lonely, it can also improve physical well-being. A five-year study of more than 800 people in Detroit found that helping others who don’t live with you can act as a buffer against the negative effects of stress. Although the study participants encountered stressful life events like illness, job loss or financial difficulties, those who spent time doing tasks for others – like errands, childcare and housework – were less likely to die than those who had not helped others. AARP Foundation Experience Corps, an intergenerational tutoring program, found numerous benefits to volunteering: More than 85 per cent of volunteers felt that their lives had improved because of their involvement with the program and 98 per cent reported that the program helped them stay physically and mentally active, said Lisa Marsh Ryerson, president of AARP Foundation, the charitable affiliate of AARP. “People want to matter and to be valued across their life,” Ms. Ryerson said. HOW MUCH VOLUNTEERING DO YOU NEED TO DO? Gary Bagley, executive director of New York Cares, the largest volunteer organization in New York City, suggested setting a small goal at first, like volunteering once a week or even once a month, and building from there. “One of the biggest mistakes you can make is to decide ‘I will volunteer twice every day for the next year’ because you’ll burn yourself out on it,” he said. “So think of something that’s manageable for you – not frightening in its scope of commitment – and just take the first step.” Research suggests that volunteering consistently is what appears to reap the most benefits. In one study, widowers ages 51 and above who volunteered two or more hours a week felt less lonely – and were no lonelier than the married volunteers. Meg Goble, 68, a real estate lawyer who lives in Brooklyn, began volunteering with New York Cares 17 years ago. “In my other life, I’m a lawyer,” she said. “I like my job,” she added, but “it’s not as fulfilling as it used to be.” Ms. Goble lives alone, but in her work as a volunteer – helping elementary school students with their homework and arranging flowers with BloomAgainBklyn – she is continually socializing. During the pandemic, she also found ways to volunteer from a distance by doing virtual mock interviews with immigrants preparing to take the U.S. citizenship test and writing over 400 letters to seniors in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. TIPS ON CHOOSING A VOLUNTEER ACTIVITY If you’re interested in volunteering, look for websites that can direct you toward in-person or virtual volunteer opportunities in your area. Be sure to ask what rules the organization has in place to keep volunteers safe. Some require their volunteers to be fully vaccinated and masked, for example. If you’re feeling uneasy about indoor settings, you can choose to volunteer in well-ventilated, uncrowded places, or outdoors. Even during the height of the pandemic, Patricia Novy of Clark, N.J., 72, a retired art teacher and former Girl Scout leader, rallied former teachers, family members and neighbours to fill Easter baskets and Christmas stockings for those who could not afford them. They were distributed by Family Promise, an organization that assists low-income families with housing and other services. “I was determined not to let that lockdown situation bring my mood down,” Ms. Novy said. The type of activity you choose matters less than whether you find it meaningful, said Ms. Walker, the “400 Friends and No One to Call” author. In her 25 years as a rehabilitation counsellor, mostly in Virginia and Maine, she placed her clients in volunteer activities to help them build confidence and develop social skills. “They used volunteering as a bridge to help them reconnect to the community,” Ms. Walker said. Some worked toward a political or environmental cause. Others were driven to share a passion, like woodworking. Think also about the type of environment in which you would like to volunteer and whether it will facilitate social interactions, Ms. Walker said. If you help out at a museum, for example, you can meet larger groups of people than if you were volunteering one-on-one as a tutor, she added. ‘I HAVE THIS WHOLE REAL PURPOSE NOW’ Some volunteers are driven to heal others – and themselves. Robyn Houston-Bean, 52, said when her 20-year-old son Nick died of an accidental overdose in 2015 after participating in a drug-treatment program, she went from being “a real go-getter always doing a million things” to sitting numb on the couch for months. “The last thing I expected was for him to die,” she said. Her friends and extended family were also in shock, she said, and she found it hard to process her grief with them, largely because this kind of loss was not something any of them had ever experienced. Several months after his death, Ms. Houston-Bean discovered a volunteer organization that distributed clothing, food and other supplies to drug users living on the streets. She was intrigued. Her sister urged her to check it out in person. When she finally did, she found a non-judgmental space full of volunteers whose loved ones had also been touched by addiction. Soon, she was heading out once a month to help those in need. “I felt like I could give my mothering to them that I couldn’t give to Nick anymore,” Ms. Houston-Bean said. Later that year she started a peer grief support group for those who have lost someone they love to substance abuse – the first of its kind in Braintree, Mass., her hometown. It became so popular that she created a non-profit and found enough volunteer facilitators to run 13 groups in different parts of the state. “It takes the focus off of my grief and puts it somewhere else,” she said. “I have this whole real purpose now.” By Christina Caron © The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/hangover-cure-remedy-tips-2393321,Hangover remedies: Does coconut water or coffee help? What about a heavy breakfast?,"With only a couple of days left until we finally say goodbye to 2021, it’s undoubtedly that time of the year when festive celebrations are in order – whether it’s dinner with family or mini get-togethers with friends.  After Christmas and Boxing Day come another round of merrymaking this weekend – and for those who might take it too far when it comes to drinking, there’s always the risk of the dreaded hangover. If you’re struggling to get up and deal with a whole range of symptoms, such as dizziness, fatigue, thirst, muscle aches, headache, nausea and sensitivity to light and sound, read on. WHY YOU FEEL SICK What’s making you feel nauseated and sick is the build-up of acetaldehyde formed when your body tries to digest alcohol. Furthermore, many east Asians (such as Chinese, Japanese and Koreans) break down acetaldehyde slower due to their genetic make-up, said Dr Chua Tju Siang, a gastroenterologist from Mount Elizabeth Hospital.  That’s not all that alcohol does to your body. “Alcohol also blocks the kidneys from signalling to the brain that you are thirsty,” said Melanie Anthonysamy, the nutrition team lead at HealthifyMe.  You end up not drinking enough water but passing out your fluids, which can lead to dehydration and an imbalance of electrolytes and minerals, she said. This imbalance is what causes the symptoms of headache and fatigue.  Furthermore, alcohol dilates your blood vessels, which causes pain and your body to bloat, explained Anthonysamy.  As for the nausea, there are various reasons behind the unpleasant feeling, she said. Alcohol can irritate your stomach lining and increase stomach acid production.  At the same time, it also delays gastric emptying, which means the food in your stomach is sitting there bathed in gastric juices – ripe for vomiting out.  HOW TO TREAT HANGOVERS Other than chugging water, what about the other hangover remedies that your drinking buddies have told you about? We put them to the experts for their takes on just how effective they are.  That painful throbbing in your skull is caused by the brain shrinkage created by dehydration, said Anthonysamy. Plain water helps to prevent further shrinkage and alleviate the pain.  No harm giving ginger tea a try but steer clear of teh halia with milk if you have lactose intolerance. “As alcohol irritates the stomach lining, ginger tea can soothe and improve digestion. It also boosts energy,” said Anthonysamy. If you have been vomiting, you’d have lost electrolytes such as potassium, sodium and calcium, said Dr Chua. Coconut water contains potassium and some sugar, which can help to rehydrate and replenish some of the stuff you’ve lost, he said. “The potassium that coconut water has helps to improve nerve and muscle function,” said Anthonysamy. “Coconut water has the same pH as blood plasma and is low in calories; therefore, it lifts your energy levels without causing collateral damage.” Like coconut water, these beverages are packed with electrolytes and can help to replenish what you’ve lost after an alcohol binge.  But is one better than the other? “Coconut water is touted to be a natural sports drink. Isotonic drinks are something man-made,” said Cheryl Teo, a Singapore Sports Institute sports dietitian on MyActiveSg.com.  “If we look at [these drinks] in a nutrient perspective, [they are] the same. It just depends on whether one would like something that is natural or man-made,” she said.  And might we add, what your tastebuds prefer when hungover.  It might seem like a good idea to have some coffee to get over the tipsiness and drowsiness. “The caffeine in coffee is a stimulant, which raises our heart rate. It also constricts blood vessels to help ease aches and pains,"" said Anthonysamy. In fact, some pain relief medications use caffeine to alleviate pain that way.  But if you are sensitive to caffeine or typically develop a headache after a cappuccino, hold that cup of joe. Furthermore, as Dr Chua reminded, “coffee contains caffeine, which can help with the headache; but remember that coffee itself is a diuretic and can worsen dehydration”. Before you order a Bloody Mary or some other alcoholic beverage because your friend advised you to do so, read this: You’re just delaying the hangover symptoms and creating worse symptoms later, said Dr Chua.  Anthonysamy agreed. “Alcohol will make the hangover worse because it will increase dehydration levels in the body. Having more alcohol is not a right way to ease hangover. It will worsen the condition,” she said. “Soups are useful for rehydration and can be comfort food for those feeling very sorry for themselves because of the hangover,” said Dr Chua.  Anthonysamy added that soups also help “replenish nutrients, soothe the stomach and aid digestion”. But don’t get cream-based soups. Instead, opt for bouillon soups, which are thin, vegetable-based broths that are a good source of vitamins and minerals, she said. Or opt for miso soup. “It is often revered as a hangover cure because it reduces inflammation and helps in gut health,” she added. Bananas are good sources of B6, magnesium and potassium, said Anthonysamy. “B6 is a vitamin that is purported to help with hangovers, while magnesium calms the blood vessels and is known to ease headaches in some people.” She continued: “Eating one or two bananas in the morning can relieve the muscle and body aches”. If you can tolerate the sound of the blender when hungover, make a banana smoothie with coconut water, she suggested, for a super potassium-charged drink. Not fond of bananas? Try watermelon. It is high in natural sugars, potassium and water, she said. A big, oily plate of fried bee hoon with luncheon meat and fried egg, or a McDonalds Big Breakfast is another method touted to work. Does heavy, greasy food really help?  “Greasy food needs to be eaten before the alcohol binge in order to be of help,” Dr Chua. “The greasy food slows down alcohol absorption, and hence, reduces the chance of actually getting a hangover.” Anthonysamy added that eating all that greasy breakfast food in the morning might cause stomach upset instead.  It’s probably too late to tell you to drink in moderation when you already have a splitting hangover headache. But if you’re expecting alcohol at your next gathering, do this: Alternate between an alcoholic beverage and a glass of water to reduce your risk of waking up with a hangover, advised Anthonysamy.  And drink moderately, which is defined as one drink a day for women and two for men, according to the American Cancer Society and American Heart Association. “Our body can process about one drink per hour,” reminded Anthonysamy."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/covid-19-cases-record-high-around-world-omicron-testing-quarantine-2406026,Some nations look to shorten isolation rules as Omicron races around the world,"ROME/WASHINGTON: Global COVID-19 infections hit a record high over the past seven-day period, Reuters data showed on Wednesday (Dec 29), as the Omicron variant raced out of control and governments wrestled with how to contain its spread without paralysing fragile economies. Almost 900,000 cases were detected on average each day around the world between Dec 22 and 28, with myriad countries posting new all-time highs in the previous 24 hours, including the United States, Australia, many in Europe and Bolivia. Although studies have suggested Omicron is less deadly than some previous variants, the huge numbers of people testing positive mean that hospitals in some countries might soon be overwhelmed, while businesses might struggle to carry on because of workers having to quarantine. Fearful of the economic impact of keeping so many people at home, some governments are looking at shortening the period that people have to isolate if they are COVID-19 positive or have been exposed to someone who is positive. Spain said on Wednesday it was reducing the quarantine period for people who have tested positive for COVID-19 to seven days from 10, while Italy said it was planning to relax isolation rules for those who came into close contact with sufferers of the virus. Earlier this week US health authorities released new guidance shortening the isolation period for people with a confirmed infection to five days from 10, so long as they are asymptomatic. ""Delta and Omicron are now twin threats driving up cases to record numbers, leading to spikes in hospitalisation and deaths,"" WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news briefing. ""I am highly concerned that Omicron, being highly transmissible and spreading at the same time as Delta, is leading to a tsunami of cases."" French Health Minister Olivier Veran told lawmakers France was seeing a ""dizzying"" rise in cases, with 208,000 reported in the space of 24 hours - a national and European record. The US government expects a contract for 500 million antigen tests promised by President Joe Biden to help address the surge in cases to be completed late next week and deliveries for manufacturers to start in January, White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients said in a briefing. Britain, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Cyprus and Malta all registered record numbers of new cases on Tuesday, while the seven-day average number of new daily cases in the United States hit a record 258,312, according to a Reuters tally on Wednesday. The previous peak was 250,141, registered last January. Despite the surge in coronavirus infections, deaths and hospitalisations are comparatively low, CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said on Wednesday. While the current seven-day daily average of cases is about 240,400 per day, up 60 per cent over the previous week, the hospitalisation rate for the same period is up just 14 per cent to about 9,000 per day over the same period. Deaths were down about seven percent to 1,100 per day, Walensky added. It is unclear so far the degree to which Omicron's rapid spread may be hampering a US economy that appears solidly on track to end the year at a gangbuster growth rate. Weekly national data on new claims for unemployment benefits, for instance, have shown no indication that Americans are losing work due to Omicron's ascendance in recent weeks. Britain reported 183,037 COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, a new record and over 50,000 more than the previous highest figure registered just a day earlier, government statistics showed. Ireland, too, reported record cases on Wednesday, with more than 16,000 new infections. Despite the growing number of cases, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he will not bring in new restrictions this year in England to limit the spread of Omicron, which now accounts for 90 per cent of all community infections, according to health officials. Australia registered almost 18,300 new cases, eclipsing Tuesday's previous pandemic high of around 11,300. In Spain, demand for free testing kits from the Madrid regional government far outstripped supply, with long queues forming outside pharmacies. Early data from Britain, South Africa and Denmark suggests the risk of hospitalisation from Omicron is lower than from Delta, the WHO said in its latest epidemiological report. However, the WHO's top emergencies expert, Mike Ryan, said it was too soon to draw definitive conclusions because Omicron was so far circulating largely among younger, less vulnerable age groups. A number of governments are increasingly worried by the economic impact of huge numbers being forced into self-isolation because they had been in contact with a coronavirus sufferer. ""We just can't have everybody just being taken out of circulation because they just happen to be at a particular place at a particular time,"" Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters. While Spain and Italy moved to relax some isolation rules, China stuck to its policy of zero tolerance, keeping 13 million people in Xian, capital of central Shaanxi province, under rigid lockdown for a seventh day as 151 new cases were reported on Tuesday, albeit none with Omicron so far. ""I just want to go home,"" said a 32-year-old mechanic who was in the city on business last week when it was effectively shut off from the outside world. "

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/exercise-home-workout-fitness-covid-19-pandemic-2395771,"Commentary: Make exercising correctly, not exercising more, your new year resolution","SINGAPORE: The COVID-19 crisis has changed the exercise habits of many Singaporeans. Work from home has allowed people to exercise more frequently at their own time, while safe distancing rules on indoor sports facilities have encouraged many to pick up new outdoor sports. According to a January 2021 Ipsos survey on exercise behaviour during COVID-19, about 40 per cent of Singaporeans increased their exercise activities, while 24 per cent exercise less. However, 30 per cent of Singaporeans reported an average weight gain of 4.8kg. In my clinic and on daily jogs, I've seen a surge in people trekking, running, and cycling. However, many stopped after one to two months after overdoing it. Take *Ms Loo, for example, a middle-aged woman who has decided to become more active since the pandemic hit. She started exercising 30 minutes five times a week and alternated her workout with climbing stairs, walking, cycling and jogging. Unfortunately, after a month, she developed an overuse injury and was diagnosed with patellar tendonitis.  The trouble is Ms Loo progressed too quickly without proper conditioning. People who lead a sedentary lifestyle for more than six months should start with a shorter duration of 10 to 20 minutes (depending on intensity) three times a week. They should progress slowly with no more than 20 per cent of duration, distance, or frequency weekly. It's a positive development that more are exercising since COVID-19. As the new year rolls around, many are bound to make new year resolutions of losing weight or leading more active lives. However, training too much without adequate rest and recovery may be bad for our body and mental wellbeing. That's why it's hard to stick to demanding fitness plans. Strava, a popular social network for runners and cyclists, analysed user data and predicted most people drop their new year resolutions within a month – on Jan 19, to be exact. Researchers have yet to find the optimal amount of exercise. The question of how much exercise is too much depends on an individual's fitness level and health conditions. But the reason why many drop their fitness goals is not because they were unrealistic, but how they've trained to achieve those goals.  *Mr Ng is in his late 40s and diagnosed with hypertension and pre-diabetes. During the pandemic, he started exercising to improve his health. After a few months of training, his friends encouraged him to train for a marathon. He set a goal to qualify for the next Boston marathon within a year. Following a marathon training programme from the Internet, he increased his running mileage to about 20km daily. However, he developed exercise-induced hematuria (blood in urine). Like Ms Loo, Mr Ng had the determination and motivation to train hard. However, his problem was in the duration of his training, which is over three hours. When exercising in a warm and humid climate like ours, replenishment of water and electrolytes is needed every 15 minutes once exercise exceeds an hour. When exercise exceeds two hours, fuel replenishment such as energy bar or gel is necessary every 45 minutes. When exercise intensity increases, it uses up our body's carbohydrates stores, resulting in tiredness, mental dullness, higher heart rate, and in some severe cases, exertional rhabdomyolysis – the breakdown of muscle. People with diabetes risk hypoglycemia, where blood sugar levels fall to dangerous lows. The risk increases with exercise intensity, so those with diabetes should not exceed 60 minutes of moderate-intensity or 30 to 45 minutes of intense activity. Here, the aim of exercising is to lower blood glucose levels and improve insulin resistance to lessen the dependence on medication. To do that, we can improve the body's sensitivity towards blood glucose by strengthening physical fitness. *Richard is a classic example of improving fitness to fight diabetes. He is retired and diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. For the past 30 years, he has been using insulin therapy to control his blood glucose levels. His exercise regime includes walking two hours daily.  I shortened his daily exercise to 45 minutes, starting with 10 minutes of high-intensity continuous interval (HIIT) exercise followed by heavy resistance exercises. Richard has managed well, and his doctor told him to stop insulin therapy after seven months of hard work. He further reduced his medication to a minimum dosage after a year. He can now complete 30 minutes of HIIT followed by functional resistance training daily. Exercise triggers the release of endorphins creating the ""feel-good effect"" in the brain, which is why it's addictive for some. However, the effect depends on the exercise intensity. When overexertion combines with insufficient rest, cortisol (stress hormone) levels increase. Not only does this make us tired and depressed, but we may experience mood swings, impaired immune system, reduced mental focus, troubled sleeping, and even weight gain. It may also lead to overtraining, burnout, frequent injuries, and infections when we fail to recover adequately before the next training.  *Grace is a middle-aged woman who is overweight and has hypertension. She decided to begin exercising for weight loss. She controls her diet and diligently participates in HIIT classes every evening after work. However, she gained weight instead. She constantly felt tired and had trouble sleeping. She lost her motivation and found excuses not to exercise after a month. High-intensity exercises can burn more calories but are more stressful and are not sustainable for most people. Weight loss is a long-term project. When starting an exercise regime to lose weight, improving fitness should be the primary goal. A higher fitness level can enable individuals to exercise at a greater intensity, expending more calories with less exertion. For example, a person who does brisk walking for an hour may complete 5km, expending about 350 calories. However, a fitter person who can complete 10km in the same amount of time can expend double the amount of calories. Start with most exercises at a comfortable intensity, limiting higher-intensity activities to once a week. Stress management is also important to improve weight loss and boost motivation. Exercise is an important part of life, but to gain maximum benefits, it should be planned carefully to achieve specific ends. Most people want aerobic fitness, so they go jogging, cycling, and swimming. Minimally, this should be for 10 minutes at moderate intensity to enhance cardiovascular fitness. Then there are those who want to build muscle strength and endurance and for that, there's weightlifting, stairs climbing, and HIIT body-weight exercises. These should consist of ""heavy"" resistance training with low repetitions and long rest intervals. And to improve flexibility and mobility, do yoga and stretching exercises which are less effective for cardiovascular fitness. On the other hand, cardio activities may not increase muscular strength and flexibility as effectively as strength training and stretching exercises.  A good exercise regime should include strength training, flexibility exercises, and cardio activities. The key is to find what suits your purpose and keep an eye for overuse injuries. You need to build up intensity slowly and stretch and hydrate if you are hitting an hour.  *Pseudonyms were used in this commentary.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/gluten-free-bread-really-healthier-regular-bread-2387896,Is gluten-free bread really healthier than regular bread?,"At my grocery store, the bread selection stretches across an entire aisle. And among those amber waves of bread loaves, bagels and buns are a few gluten-free options, which can cost about twice as much as their wheat-based counterparts. Are they a more nutritious choice? As is often the case with nutrition questions, the answer will depend on your individual circumstance, said Jerlyn Jones, a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and a registered dietitian in Atlanta. But for most people, choosing a gluten-free bread instead of a wheat-based bread is not an inherently more nutritious option, she added. And, gluten-free breads can be harder on your wallet, she said, since they are often more expensive and have a shorter shelf life. Gluten is a protein found in the grains of wheat, barley and rye. In traditional bread made from wheat flour, gluten forms a protein network that makes dough cohesive and stretchy and gives bread that quintessentially satisfying, chewy texture. But gluten or other components of wheat can cause health problems in some. For the estimated 1 per cent of people worldwide who have celiac disease, a serious autoimmune condition triggered by eating gluten, the protein causes intestinal damage that can impair nutrient absorption and lead to symptoms like diarrhoea, weight loss, fatigue, anaemia and a blistery, itchy rash. The only effective way to manage celiac disease is strict and lifelong gluten avoidance. For others with milder wheat-related sensitivities, eating the grain doesn’t cause the intestinal damage found in celiac disease, but can cause gastrointestinal discomfort and symptoms like fatigue and headache that usually go away when wheat is avoided. It’s not clear how many people have this condition, called non-celiac wheat sensitivity, but it may be more common than celiac disease. A third, much less common wheat-related condition is a wheat allergy, which can cause allergic reactions like diarrhoea, vomiting, facial swelling or difficulty breathing within minutes to hours after eating wheat. If you have celiac disease, wheat sensitivity or a wheat allergy, going with a gluten-free bread is clearly the better choice. But in a 2017 survey of 1,000 people in the United States and Canada who purchased gluten-free groceries – conducted by the food and beverage ingredient supplier Ingredion – 46 per cent said they bought those products for reasons other than a medical condition. Among their top motivations: Wanting to reduce inflammation or consume fewer artificial ingredients, believing that gluten-free products were healthier or more natural, and thinking that such products would help with weight loss. However, none of these beliefs are true, said Anne Lee, a registered dietitian and an assistant professor of nutritional medicine at the Celiac Disease Center at Columbia University Medical Center. “Typically, the gluten-free products are higher in fat, higher in sugar, higher in salt and lower in fibre and your B vitamins and iron,” she said. Making bread without gluten is a technological challenge, and manufacturers tend to rely on ingredients like refined rice, potato or tapioca flours, which contain much less protein and fibre than wheat flours, Dr Lee said. Most of the refined wheat flours used in the United States are enriched with iron and the B vitamins folic acid, niacin, riboflavin and thiamin, while the flours used in gluten-free products generally don’t contain these added nutrients. Gluten-free bread manufacturers also often add sugar, fat and salt to their products to make them taste better, Dr Lee said. And in part, because gluten-free breads tend to contain more water, fat and refined starch than wheat-based breads, they spoil and become stale more quickly. For these reasons, going gluten-free is not always a better choice. “If you think you have an intolerance to gluten, before you take it out of your diet, go see a gastroenterologist and really be tested appropriately,” Dr Lee said. An added benefit: Celiac disease is more difficult to diagnose in people who have already eliminated gluten. There’s also quality of life to consider. Restricting your diet can make you more anxious in social situations or make you more reluctant to try homemade foods at family meals, Jones said. Food “is not only fuel for our bodies, but it also gives us enjoyment, too. You don’t want to miss out on enjoyment, especially nowadays,” she added, referring to those who avoid gluten without a medical reason. For her patients who need to eliminate gluten, Dr Lee advises focusing less on packaged gluten-free products and more on whole foods like fruits, vegetables, beans and gluten-free whole grains and seeds like amaranth, buckwheat, quinoa, teff and millet. “If you do a gluten-free diet where you’re using foods that are naturally gluten-free, like all these wonderful grains, then your diet can be incredibly healthy,” she said. But if you’re craving a sandwich, you’ll need bread. The good news is that gluten-free products have improved – “they’re better than they were even five years ago,” Dr Lee said. Many manufacturers have started to include more gluten-free whole grains in their products, which can boost fibre, protein and some vitamins and minerals. Just as wheat-based breads can range widely in nutritional quality, from highly processed white bread to whole grain loaves, the same is now true of gluten-free options, Dr Lee said. To identify better gluten-free breads, Dr Lee recommended comparing their nutrition labels with those from whole wheat breads. Check for similar levels of fibre and protein and minimal added sugar, and look for a bread with whole grains among the first few ingredients, which are listed in descending order by weight, so that the first ingredient is always present in the largest amount. “If your first ingredients are water and tapioca starch, put the bread back on the shelf,” Dr Lee said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/christmas-diet-overeating-calories-holiday-weight-2395456,Commentary: That Christmas dinner may mean 12 hours of walking to burn calories,"LOUGHBOROUGH, England: Overeating at Christmas time is almost like a tradition. Many of us look forward to piling our plates full of festive foods, snacking on chocolate throughout the holidays or sipping on festive drinks. Even if you were trying to eat healthier, indulgent foods are often displayed more prominently in supermarkets and shops during the holidays, making it difficult to pass up on our favourite foods and drinks. The British Dietetic Association estimates that on Christmas day alone people might consume around 6,000 calories – with Christmas dinner responsible for most of these. But spending time with friends, work Christmas parties and New Year’s celebrations might all see us overeat in the days and even weeks before and after Christmas. It’s no wonder the average adult gains around 0.5-1 kg over the Christmas holidays. While that might not sound like a lot, the weight we gain during the festive season isn’t always lost in the new year. This excess weight gain over the years could see some people become overweight or obese, which may increase their risk of many conditions, including cancer, diabetes, hypertension or stroke. But research shows that giving people information about how many minutes of walking (or running) it will take to burn off the calories from foods or drinks can help people eat less and avoid gaining weight at Christmas. So, how much walking do you need to do in order to burn off Christmas dinner? For an adult weighing 84kg it will take about 12 hours of steady paced walking (around four miles or 6.4km an hour) to burn off the calories of an average Christmas dinner. This is the equivalent of walking approximately 50 miles or 80km. Or, if you prefer, you could jog for about five to six hours. Of course, the number of calories in your dinner will also depend on what foods you eat, how you prepare them and whether you go back for seconds. For example, if you cut out the pre-dinner nibbles and appetisers, and only have a yule log for dessert alongside two glasses of wine, your Christmas dinner may only come in around 2,080 calories. For someone weighing 84kg, this would only take around six and a half hours of walking to burn off. The amount of physical activity you’ll need to do to burn off your dinner will also depend on many factors such as age, gender and weight. Holiday weight gain does not have to be inevitable – and walking is a great activity you can do by yourself or with others. While walking for 12 hours straight isn’t something anyone wants to do during the holidays, there are many easy ways you can sneak more physical activity in during the holidays each day. For example, try walking to the shops instead of using your car if you can, or take a cycle around your neighbourhood with your children to look at the Christmas lights. Of course, it’s hard not to indulge over Christmas since it only comes around once a year. Some other easy ways to eat fewer calories during the holidays include snacking wisely, and being cautious with your portions. If you find that you have gained weight after Christmas don’t be disheartened and try to focus on reducing the treats, and setting yourself a goal to get your weight back on track as soon as you can in the new year.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/coffee-health-benefits-harmful-caffeine-drink-2391191,Commentary: Why you should moderate your coffee intake,"READING, England: You’ve probably heard it before: Drinking coffee is good for your health. Studies have shown that drinking a moderate amount of coffee is associated with many health benefits, including a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. But while these associations have been demonstrated many times, they don’t actually prove that coffee reduces disease risk. In fact, proving that coffee is good for your health is complicated. While it’s suggested that consuming three to five cups of coffee a day will provide optimal health benefits, it’s not quite that straightforward. Coffee is chemically complex, containing many components that can affect your health in different ways. While caffeine is the most well-known compound in coffee, there is more to coffee than caffeine. Here are a few of the other compounds found in coffee that might affect your health. Alkaloids. Aside from caffeine, trigonelline is another important alkaloid found in coffee. Trigonelline is less researched than caffeine, but research suggests that it may have health benefits, such as reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes. Polyphenols. Some research shows that these compounds, which are found in many plants, including cocoa and blueberries, are good for your heart and blood vessels, and may help to prevent neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. Coffee predominantly contains a class of polyphenols called chlorogenic acids. Diterpenes. Coffee contains two types of diterpenes – cafestol and kahweol – that make up coffee oil, the natural fatty substance released from coffee during brewing. Diterpenes may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Melanoidins. These compounds, which are produced at high temperatures during the roasting process, give roasted coffee its colour and provide the characteristic flavour and aroma of coffee. They may also have a prebiotic effect, meaning they increase the amount of beneficial bacteria in your gut, which is important for overall health. The way your coffee is grown, brewed and served can all affect the compounds your coffee contains and hence the health benefits you might see. First, growing conditions can affect the levels of caffeine and chlorogenic acids the coffee contains. For example, coffee grown at high altitudes will have both lower caffeine and chlorogenic acid content. The two types of coffee beans, arabica and robusta, have also been shown to have different caffeine, chlorogenic acid and trigonelline levels, although neither type has been shown to be more beneficial to health. Processing will also affect the coffee’s chemical composition. For example, some coffee is decaffeinated. This is typically done before roasting, and depending on the decaffeination method, it may further affect other compounds. For example, small levels of chlorogenic acids are lost during the decaffeination process. The extent that coffee is roasted is also key. The more severe the roasting, the more melanoidins formed (and the more intense the flavour). But this lowers chlorogenic acids and trigonelline content. In the UK, instant coffee is the most commonly consumed type of coffee. This is typically freeze-dried. Research shows that instant coffee contains higher levels of melanoidins per serving compared with filter coffee and espresso. How you prepare your coffee will also affect its chemical composition. For example, boiled coffee contains a higher level of diterpenes compared with filter coffee. Other factors – such as the amount of coffee used, how finely it was ground, water temperature and cup size – will also affect the coffee’s chemical composition. Every compound has different effects on your health, which is why the way coffee is produced and brewed can be important. Chlorogenic acids, for example, are thought to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by improving the function of your arteries. There’s also evidence they may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes by controlling blood sugar spikes after eating. On the other hand, diterpenes have been shown to increase levels of low-density lipoprotein, a type of cholesterol associated with cardiovascular disease. While less research has focused on trigonelline and melanoidins, some evidence suggests both may be good for your health. Adding cream, sugar and syrup will change the nutritional content of your cup. Not only will they increase the calorie content, they may also increase your intake of saturated fats and sugars. Both of these are associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease and may counter the beneficial effects of the other compounds your cup of coffee contains. There’s also evidence that people may respond differently to some of these compounds. Regularly drinking three to four cups of coffee daily has been shown to build tolerance to the blood pressure raising effects of caffeine. Genetics may also play a role in how your body handles caffeine and other compounds. Increasing evidence also points to the gut microbiome as an important factor in determining what health effects coffee may have. For example, some research suggests the gut microbes play an important role in chlorogenic acid metabolism, and hence may determine if they will benefit your health or not. Researchers need to conduct large studies to confirm the findings of these smaller studies, which seem to show that coffee is good for your health. But in the meantime, minimise the sugar and cream you use in your coffee. And if you’re in good health and aren’t pregnant, continue to take a moderate approach to coffee consumption, choosing filter coffee where possible.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/severe-food-allergies-parents-children-epipen-coping-2383871,"'We can never be complacent': Parents of children with allergies battle anxiety, low awareness","SINGAPORE: The day she had to administer an EpiPen to her five-year-old daughter is seared into Ms Candice Huang’s memory. In December last year, Ms Huang allowed her daughter to eat some chocolate that was given out at a mall. She checked that the ingredients on the label did not include cow’s milk or eggs, which the girl is severely allergic to. She warned her daughter to take a little first, as was usual with new foods, but the girl “wolfed down” a large chunk. Then she began complaining of pain. “She started crying and vomiting and her eyes became bloodshot and she had so many dots around her eyes, which looked like burst blood vessels. She was crying and screaming and clenching and clawing at her throat.” Ms Huang gave her antihistamines first, as is usual for an allergic reaction. But it did not work because her daughter was ""vomiting nonstop"". She started spitting out streaks of blood, which is when Ms Huang rushed to get an EpiPen. The auto-injector contains adrenaline that is used to treat someone who has a life-threatening allergic reaction. Her daughter regained her composure 30 seconds after the EpiPen was administered, but the experience was “so scary”, Ms Huang said. Although it was a lesson learnt the hard way, she said it has helped her whole family, including her daughter, to understand the consequences of a severe allergic reaction. “After they witnessed the EpiPen episode, I feel like my whole household is very vigilant now,” she told CNA. Her daughter is also more careful with chocolates now, and takes a small bite and waits for five minutes before taking another bite.  While the incident was caused by incorrect labelling, Ms Huang said she has to bear some of the responsibility. “An allergy parent can never be too overly cautious and we can never be complacent for a second,” she said. Parents CNA spoke to said that there is generally low awareness of severe allergies and how bad reactions can be. “Unless you have personally witnessed a severe allergic reaction, you would never imagine it to be like that,” Ms Huang said. She added that people tend to make light of the potential consequences, mostly due to ignorance. She recounted an incident when she wanted to buy some cookies, but realised they contained ingredients her daughter was allergic to. But the woman selling the cookies simply said: “Aiyah, a little bit sure can one lah.” “I cannot fault her or blame her for it because there’s simply just not enough awareness,” Ms Huang said. The lack of awareness is common, said Ms Izlin Ismail, whose nine-year-old son is severely allergic to cow’s milk and eggs. “Even the 'point point rice' or nasi padang I stay away, because it’s very difficult. The tongs that they use usually means cross-contamination, and some of them don’t get it – that there’s cross-contamination,” she said. Even at restaurants, many do not know what allergens might be in the food they serve, said Ms Amanda Chan, who has a six-year-old son who is severely allergic to eggs, dairy and peanuts. Sometimes, restaurants within the same chain may also give conflicting information, she added. Singaporean Tan Wen Yang, whose five-year-old daughter had multiple severe allergies to foods like eggs, cow’s milk and nuts when he was living in Japan for 12 years, said things are different there. Information on allergens was more readily available in Tokyo and Kanagawa, where he lived. The majority of popular or chain restaurants have a list that states the most common allergens used in their dishes, he said. ""It's easy to check before ordering and many of the family-friendly restaurants have an allergen-free menu item,"" he said. ""In general, many waiters and waitresses will know about allergies and advise correctly."" A severe or dangerous allergic reaction – or anaphylaxis – includes respiratory symptoms like coughing, wheezing, feeling of something stuck in the throat, change of voice and difficulty breathing.  It could also manifest in symptoms like fainting, looking pale, severe tummy pain and persistent vomiting, said National University Hospital's Dr Lydia Wong, who specialises in paediatric allergies. Dr Mohana Rajakulendran, a paediatrician at Parkway East Hospital, said that anyone who has had a previous severe life-threatening allergic reaction needs to carry an EpiPen. This includes people with multiple food allergies or with shellfish or peanut allergies, as they have a higher risk of more severe reactions, said Dr Mohana, who has a special interest in allergy and immunology. About 1 per cent of her patients need to carry an EpiPen, she said. “It acts on receptors on blood vessels and tissues to help improve circulation and blood pressure and reduce swelling during life-threatening reactions.” Most food allergic reactions are mild to moderate in severity, but even when anaphylaxis occurs, most patients recover with no long-term complications if treated promptly and correctly, said Dr Chong Kok Wee, the head of allergy service at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital. “Death from food-related anaphylaxis is rare but can occur, and is usually preventable. Children with anaphylaxis should immediately be administered with an adrenaline auto-injector if available, or emergency medical services should be immediately activated,” said Dr Chong. It is not just restaurants' food parents have to be wary of, it’s food served in schools too. Preparing food for their school-going children and educating their teachers comes with the territory. Ms Huang told CNA that her daughter's childcare centre customises meals for her to ensure they are allergen-free. But the centre is not able to provide suitable snacks, so her daughter brings her own snacks. However, as her daughter grows up, some situations have become harder for her to accept. “This year, she came home a few times and cried, asking: ‘Why my friends can eat all these and I can’t?’” Ms Huang said. While she feels sad hearing this, Ms Huang said there is not much she can do. She provides a separate dessert for her daughter if she knows that there will be a celebration, but sometimes there is no advance notice. She also goes the extra mile to ensure that her child’s teachers know how to help her in case of an allergic reaction. She conducts her own training once a year on how to administer an EpiPen. Ms Izlin enrolled her son in a primary school that had a staff member who knew about allergies and how to administer an EpiPen. She packs food for her son for his recess breaks, and her domestic worker goes to the school to pass him lunch as his after-school student care centre does not provide allergen-free food. But despite the efforts, a sandwich containing dairy was accidentally given to him earlier this year. The boy complained of stomach pain and was sent to the sickbay in school, where he remained for an hour before he called his mother and sounded like his throat was blocked. Her son wears a bracelet that indicates his allergies. “I was thinking: ‘You are having an allergic reaction. Nobody is doing anything, what happened?’” she said.  Underneath the face mask he was wearing, he had broken out in hives, a symptom of his allergic reaction. It was Ms Izlin who eventually administered an EpiPen to him when she arrived at his school. Hearing of such incidents makes Ms Chan, whose son will be entering Primary 1 in January, more anxious than she already is. “It’s a huge leap from kindergarten where the teachers may be more attentive,” she said, adding that children in primary school are expected to be more independent. Apart from being expected to order food at the canteen himself and look after his own belongings, Ms Chan’s son will have to take care of his own safety. “He … needs to be very concerned about who’s eating what food around him and he’s got to be very careful that he isn’t exposing himself to his allergens unnecessarily,” she said. “That part is incredibly difficult.” The EpiPen can make a difference between life and death, but parents have had to deal with the sometimes unpredictable supply of the device, following global disruptions. Among them is Ms Deborah Tan, who had to administer the EpiPen on her two-year-old daughter twice in three months this year. After the second incident, when her daughter was hospitalised, Ms Tan was told by the hospital that they were out of EpiPen Jr for young children. “That was really traumatising because after this second time, when she actually needed two EpiPens (to get her condition under control), we were going home without any in hand,” she said. After calling other hospitals and retail pharmacies and realising that she could not get her hands on an EpiPen Jr, Ms Tan put up a “plea for help” on a Facebook group run by non-profit organisation Eczema and Allergy Support Foundation (SPEAK), asking if anyone could lend her one. “A kind mother reached out to me and I got it from her that same day,” she said. Cost is also an issue, said Ms Chan, who is SPEAK’s chairperson. Each EpiPen typically costs S$160, and those with severe allergies are usually expected to carry two, in case one fails. The cost is not subsidised and ""adds up"", she said. Parkway East Hospital's Dr Mohana suggested that the Health Ministry look into sourcing for more brands of auto-injectors so that are more options available to patients and to minimise disruptions to supply.  She added that the cost of EpiPens should be subsidised.   “The price can be an important deterrent to many low- to middle-income families who do not purchase EpiPens due to the cost though medically advised to. EpiPens can save lives,” she said. Parents said they hope that there is more awareness of allergies – especially severe ones – in school so they can rest assured that their children are safe. “It comes to a point where I may not be able to send my allergic child to daycare as I don’t have childcare options to support my having a full-time job,” said Ms Huang. “I hope there’ll be more awareness in schools, in the education sector so allergy kids can feel more included and their allergies can be professionally managed.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/keeping-pounds-how-exercise-affects-metabolism-and-weight-loss-2382716,Keeping the pounds off: How exercise affects metabolism and weight loss,"Many of us remember The Biggest Loser, the somewhat notorious reality television show that ran for more than a decade starting in 2004, in which contestants competed feverishly to drop massive amounts of weight over a short period of time. One of the biggest lessons of the show appeared to be that extreme exercise, along with draconian calorie restriction, would lead to enormous weight loss. Media coverage of the contestants years later, though, seemed to tell a different story, of weight regain and slowed metabolisms and the futility of attempting long-term weight loss. Now a new scientific analysis of the show and its aftermath, published last month in the journal Obesity, suggests many beliefs about The Biggest Loser may be misconceptions. The analysis tries to untangle what really happened to the contestants’ metabolisms and why some of them kept off weight better than others. It also looks into the complex role of exercise and whether staying physically active helped the contestants keep their weight under control for years, or not. For those who may have forgotten, or tried to, The Biggest Loser ran on NBC to generally high ratings for more than a dozen seasons. Contestants competed to drop the most pounds using extreme calorie restriction and hours of daily strenuous exercise. “Winners” typically shed hundreds of pounds in a few months. Such rapid and extreme weight loss caught the attention of Kevin Hall, a senior investigator at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. An expert on metabolism, Dr Hall knew that when people drop lots of weight in a short period of time, they typically send their resting metabolic rates – the baseline calories we burn every day just by being alive – into free-fall. A lower resting metabolic rate can mean we burn fewer calories over all. This effect was believed to be caused, in part, by the loss of muscle during dieting. A relatively active tissue, muscle burns more calories than fat, and more muscle typically means elevated metabolic rates. So, Dr Hall wondered, would the maniacal levels of exercise during The Biggest Loser help dieters hold onto muscle and keep their resting metabolism high, even as they cut calories? Starting more than a decade ago, Dr Hall and his colleagues began the first of a series of experiments to find out. In a study from 2012, they compared 16 men and women who had lost massive amounts of weight by cutting calories, thanks to gastric bypass surgery, and 16 contestants from The Biggest Loser, whose extreme weight loss involved exercise as well as dieting. As expected, the bypass group shed muscle, as well as fat, while The Biggest Loser contestants kept most of their muscle and primarily dropped fat. But everyone’s resting metabolic rate dropped, and to about the same extent, whether they remained well-muscled or not. Dr Hall said he and his colleagues were surprised by the results. And their confusion intensified when, for a 2016 study, they rechecked 14 of the same contestants six years after their competition, expecting their metabolisms to have rebounded by then. Most dieters’ resting metabolisms rise somewhat after they stop actively losing weight, and especially if they regain pounds. Larger people burn more baseline calories than people who are slighter. By this time, most of the contestants had regained weight. But their resting metabolisms remained stubbornly slow, burning an average of about 500 fewer daily calories than before they joined the show. The next year, a follow-up study concluded physical activity had helped some contestants stave off weight gain. If they moved around or formally exercised for about 80 minutes most days, they added back fewer pounds than if they rarely worked out. But their exercise did not boost their resting metabolisms. The exercisers, in fact, showed the greatest relative declines in their resting metabolic rates. Perplexed, Dr Hall recently began to reconsider the Biggest Loser studies in light of an emerging concept about how human metabolism fundamentally works. This idea grew out of an influential 2012 study showing that highly active hunter gatherers in Tanzania burn about the same relative number of calories every day as the rest of us, even though they move around far more. The scientists involved in that research postulated the tribespeople’s bodies must automatically be compensating for some of the calories they burned while hunting for food by decreasing other physiological activities, such as growth. (The tribespeople tended to be short.) In that way, the researchers felt, the hunters’ bodies could keep the overall number of calories they burned each day in check, no matter how many miles they jogged in search of tubers and game. The scientists called this idea the constrained total energy expenditure theory. Aware of this research, Dr Hall began to see potential parallels in The Biggest Loser results. So, for the new analysis, he looked back at his group’s data for hints about whether contestants’ metabolisms had behaved, in effect, like the metabolisms of the hunter gatherers. And he found clues in their resting metabolic rates. That number plummeted early in their Biggest Loser filming, he noted, when they slashed how much they ate, and their bodies, understandably, reduced the calories they burned to avoid starving. But in later years, when contestants typically returned to eating as they had before, their metabolisms stayed depressed because, he concluded – and this was key – most of them still exercised. Counter-intuitively, he wrote in the new analysis, frequent physical activity seems to have prompted their bodies to hold resting metabolic rates low, so total daily energy expenditure could be constrained. “It’s still just a hypothesis,” Dr Hall said, “but it seems like what we’re observing” in the Biggest Loser data “is an example of the constrained energy model.” So, what could this rethinking of The Biggest Loser story mean for the rest of us, if we hope to keep our weight under control? First and most fundamentally, Dr Hall said, it suggests that abrupt and colossal weight loss generally will backfire, since that strategy seems to send resting metabolic rates plunging more than would be expected, given people’s smaller body sizes. When people drop pounds gradually in weight-loss experiments, he pointed out, their metabolic changes tend to be less drastic. Second and more befuddling, if you have lost substantial weight, Biggest Loser style, exercise likely will be both ally and underminer in your efforts to keep those pounds at bay. In Dr Hall’s new interpretation of contestants’ long-term weight control, frequent exercise kept contestants’ resting metabolic rates low but also helped them stave off fat regain. In essence, the contestants who worked out the most wound up adding back the least weight, even though they also sported the slowest relative resting metabolisms. Exactly how, then, exercise aided with their weight maintenance is not yet clear, Dr Hall said. He suspects that exercise affected people’s appetites in ways that may have made them less prone to overeating, while also burning some extra calories. He hopes to develop future experiments to elucidate how exercise influences metabolisms, for better and worse, he said. For now, though, the most reverberant lesson of The Biggest Loser may be that long-term weight loss, although daunting, is not unfeasible. Yes, most Biggest Loser contestants regained weight, Dr Hall said, but not necessarily every pound they dropped. After six years, most still weighed about 12 per cent less than before joining the show, a meaningful difference, and the most successful of the former contestants were those who still worked out.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/fast-food-mental-health-diet-junk-food-obesity-2371661,Commentary: Angsty and irritable? It could be your poor diet,"CALGARY, Canada: Emotional, non-rational, even explosive remarks in public discourse have escalated in recent years. Politicians endure insults during legislative discussions; scientists receive emails and tweets containing verbal abuse and threats. What's going on? This escalation in angry rhetoric is sometimes attributed to social media. But are there other influences altering communication styles? As researchers in the field of nutrition and mental health, and authors of The Better Brain, we recognise that many in our society experience brain hunger, impairing their cognitive function and emotion regulation. Obviously, we are not deficient in macronutrients: North Americans tend to get sufficient protein, fats (though usually not the best fats) and carbohydrates (usually not the good complex carbs). But we are being cheated of micronutrients (minerals and vitamins), particularly in those whose food choices are dominated by ultra-processed products. Ultra-processed products include things like soft drinks, packaged snacks, sweetened breakfast cereal and chicken nuggets. They generally contain only trivial amounts of a few micronutrients unless they are fortified, but even then, only a few at higher amounts. Three published analyses from the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey and the 2018 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey revealed these sobering statistics: In Canada, in 2004, 48 per cent of the caloric intake across all ages came from ultra-processed products; in the United States 67 per cent of what children aged two to 19 years consumed and 57 per cent of what adults consumed in 2018 were ultra-processed products. Most of us are aware that dietary intake is a huge issue in physical health because diet quality is associated with chronic health conditions such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The public is less aware of the impact of nutrition on brain health. Given that our society's food choices have moved so strongly toward ultra-processed products, we need to learn about the substantial scientific evidence proving that micronutrient intake influences mental health symptoms, especially irritability, explosive rage and unstable mood. The scientific evidence base for this statement is now vast, though it is so rarely mentioned in the media that few in the public are familiar with it. A dozen studies from countries like Canada, Spain, Japan and Australia have shown that people who eat a healthy, whole foods diet have fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety than people who eat a poor diet (mostly ultra-processed products). Correlational studies cannot prove that nutritional choices are the cause of mental health problems. For that we turn to some compelling prospective longitudinal studies in which people with no apparent mental health problems enter the study, are evaluated for their health and dietary patterns, and are then followed over time. Some of the results have been astonishing. In a study of about 89,000 people in Japan with 10-15 years of followup, the suicide rate in those consuming a whole foods diet was half that of those eating less healthy diets, highlighting an important new direction not yet covered in current suicide prevention programs. Here in Canada, similarly powerful findings show how children's dietary patterns, as well as following other health guidelines on exercise and screen time, predicted which children aged 10 to 11 years would be referred for diagnosis of a mental disorder in the subsequent two years. It follows that nutrition education ought to be one of the first lines of treatment for children in this situation. Irritability and unstable mood often characterise depression, so it's relevant that multiple independent studies have found that teaching people with depression, who were consuming relatively poor diets, how to change to a whole foods Mediterranean-style diet resulted in significant improvements. A Mediterranean-style diet is typically high in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, seafood and unsaturated fats such as olive oil. In one such study, about one-third of the people who changed to a whole foods diet in addition to their regular treatment found their depression to be in remission after 12 weeks. The remission rate in the control group using regular treatment but no diet changes was fewer than one in 10. The whole foods diet group also reported a cost savings of about 20 per cent in their weekly food budget. This final point helps to dispel the myth that eating a diet of ultra-processed products is a way to save money. Important evidence that irritability, explosive rage and unstable mood can be resolved with improved micronutrient intake comes from studies evaluating micronutrient supplements to treat mental health problems. Most public awareness is restricted to the ill-fated search for magic bullets: Studies of a single nutrient at a time. That is a common way to think about causality (for problem X, you need medication Y), but that is not how our brains work. To support brain metabolism, our brains require at least 30 micronutrients to ensure the production of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine, as well as breaking down and removing metabolic byproducts. Many studies of multi-nutrient treatments have found improved mood regulation and reduced irritability and explosive rage, including in placebo-controlled randomised trials of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and mood dysregulation. The evidence is clear: A well-nourished population is better able to withstand stress. Hidden brain hunger is one modifiable factor contributing to emotional outbursts, aggression and even the loss of civility in public discourse.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/health-costs-pushed-or-worsened-poverty-over-500-million-people-2374921,Health costs pushed or worsened poverty for over 500 million people,"More than half a billion people globally were pushed or sent further into extreme poverty last year as they paid for health costs out of their own pockets, with the COVID-19 pandemic expected to make things worse, the World Health Organization and the World Bank said on Sunday (Dec 12). The pandemic disrupted health services globally and triggered the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it even more difficult for people to pay for healthcare, according to a joint statement from both the organisations. ""All governments must immediately resume and accelerate efforts to ensure every one of their citizens can access health services without fear of the financial consequences,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. Tedros urged governments to increase their focus on health care systems and stay on course towards universal health coverage, which the WHO defines as everyone getting access to health services they need without financial hardship. Healthcare is a major political issue in the United States, one of the few industrialised countries that does not have universal cover for its citizens. Globally, the pandemic made things worse and immunisation coverage dropped for the first time in 10 years, with deaths from tuberculosis and malaria increasing. ""Within a constrained fiscal space, governments will have to make tough choices to protect and increase health budgets,"" said Juan Pablo Uribe, global director for health, nutrition and population at World Bank."

I was on a road trip with my 20-year-old son from our home in Los Angeles to his college in Michigan. Eli, trying to be patient, plowed down I-40 as daylight dimmed and I scrolled through my phone searching for a restaurant or dish that would not cause me pain. After years of carefully navigating dinners out and meals in, it had finally happened: There was nowhere I could eat. “I’m so sorry, honey,” I said. “I feel really, really bad.” And I did. I was on the verge of tears, as much out of self-pity and shame as any maternal concern. Eli shook his head. “It’s OK, Mum. It’s not your fault.” But it was. Because of me – or, to be precise, my digestive system – we would not eat until we reached Amarillo, Texas, at 10 pm, and bought frozen food from a grocery store near our Airbnb. My gut is not a carefree traveller. Ingest the wrong items, and my stomach feels as though someone’s scoured it with a Brillo pad. For the next few hours, I may also experience migraines, achy joints and a foggy, feverish sensation like I’m coming down with the flu. My doctors call this irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS I call it a terrible shame. IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion, a so-called functional disorder scribbled in your chart only after every test and examination has come back normal. Simply put, there’s nothing wrong with my stomach that our current medical tools can detect. Some physicians and researchers have described this condition in terms of a mind-gut connection. “Everybody has contractions in their gut,” said Dr Emeran Mayer, a gastroenterologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the author of The Mind-Gut Connection: How the Hidden Conversation Within Our Bodies Impacts Our Mood, Our Choices and Our Overall Health. The same contractions that go unnoticed by most people cause pain in IBS patients, who have become hypersensitive to sensations in their gut, he said. Calm the mind, the thinking goes, and the gut may follow. Fair or not, I hear this prescription and think, “Oh, so this is all in my head?” Then I fear my stomach aches are my fault, the product of an anxious mind that I cannot tame into submission. That night on the highway, I kept wanting to apologise to my son again. But as Eli flicked on the headlights, I realised he accepted me the way I was. And I wondered, what if I could, too? My IBS journey started about nine years ago, at age 44, when I noticed that my migraines – for decades reliably yoked to my menstrual cycle – were accompanied by a sour stomach, like my gut was sucking on lemons. Cutting out gluten helped, but as the years passed, my gut continued to deteriorate. I later learned my experience is not unusual. Studies suggest that female sex hormones modulate the brain-gut connection, and as these hormones wane, women may experience more severe IBS symptoms. Eventually, I dropped 10 pounds because eating had become so painful. That’s why, in 2015, I landed in the office of a gastroenterologist. He ran a bunch of tests – blood, scopes – and when everything came back negative, he diagnosed me with IBS. It could have started with a past infection, he said. Recent stresses in my life probably didn’t help. He had no way of curing me, but he advised me to relax more and manage my diet. If my IBS was triggered by stress, I thought, “I must be the most neurotic person I know.” Thoughts like these did not help me calm down. But that became my new goal: to relax so my belly would no longer hurt. I’d download a new meditation app or try a different therapist or attend restorative yoga classes. My list of restricted foods continued to grow though – no more dairy, soy, alcohol, peanuts, garlic, beans or lentils. I avoided wine and cheese gatherings and scoured the ingredients on packaging and menus. When I stayed off problem foods, my stomach felt better. If I decided I was calmer and began to edge off my strict diet, I’d be miserable again. When I asked Dr Mayer why no amount of calming would allow me to eat gluten or garlic without pain, he warned me not to underestimate the power of fear. “It’s a very common thing in IBS patients,” he said. He added that an IBS patient’s system “looks at food as a potentially dangerous thing.” Then, this August on that same trip with Eli, I read about a new theory for IBS. A paper published in The New England Journal of Medicine theorised that an abdominal infection can temporarily disturb the cell barrier that lines the colon. With the barrier disturbed, allergy-inducing proteins can get absorbed by the colon, triggering localised allergic reactions to certain inflammatory foods like gluten and leading to reverberations up and down the digestive tract. I’d been telling people for years that I didn’t have allergies to certain foods, even though my body’s response to them felt automatic. Now this research seemed to indicate what I was feeling could be an allergic reaction – one no amount of hypnotherapy or journaling was going to make disappear. When I read this, scrolling through my phone at a motel in Illinois, I thought: I knew it. The stabbing stomach pains that woke me at 3 am after eating garlic or black beans weren’t caused by my subconscious; it was my damaged gut. Later, I called Dr Marc E Rothenberg, one of the paper’s authors and the director of the division of allergy and immunology at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, to get more clarity. “Stress modifies, and can exacerbate, the underlying disease physiology,” Dr Rothenberg said. “But stress is not the cause of IBS.” There’s an exhaustion that comes from years of trying to make something go away that insists on hanging around. These days, I’m a little less tired from the struggle and a little more at peace with my body. I’ve finally come to the conclusion that suits me: my gut is different than other people’s. From time to time, I still try new remedies to improve digestion or better manage anxiety – a probiotic, Chinese herbs, a new meditation app. But if I’m never able to eat another grilled cheese sandwich (dairy cheese, wheat bread, actual butter), I can live with that. And that’s the most relaxing mantra there is. By Constance Sommer © The New York Times. The article originally appeared in The New York Times.   "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/did-pandemic-get-your-blood-pressure-rising-take-deep-breaths-youre-not-alone-2362951,Did the pandemic get your blood pressure rising? Take deep breaths – you're not alone,"Last year was a tough one. Americans grappled with a global pandemic, the loss of loved ones, lockdowns that splintered social networks, stress, unemployment and depression. It is probably no surprise that the nation’s blood pressure shot up. Recently, scientists reported that blood pressure measurements of nearly a half-million adults showed a significant rise last year, compared with the previous year. These measurements describe the pressure of blood against the walls of the arteries. Over time, increased pressure can damage the heart, the brain, blood vessels, kidneys and eyes. Sexual function can also be affected. “These are very important data that are not surprising, but are shocking,” said Dr Donald M Lloyd-Jones, president of the American Heart Association, who was not involved in the study. “Even small changes in average blood pressure in the population,” he added, “can have a huge impact on the number of strokes, heart failure events and heart attacks that we’re likely to be seeing in the coming months.” The study, published as a research letter in the journal Circulation, is a stark reminder that even in the midst of a pandemic that has claimed more than 785,000 American lives and disrupted access to health care, chronic health conditions must still be managed. Almost half of all American adults have hypertension, or high blood pressure, a chronic condition referred to as a “silent killer” because it can have life-threatening consequences, though it produces few symptoms. Hypertension may also put people at greater risk for severe disease if they are infected with the coronavirus. (The evidence for that link is mixed, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) The new study, by researchers at the Cleveland Clinic and Quest Diagnostics, examined data from hundreds of thousands of employees and family members in wellness programs that tracked blood pressure and other health indicators, like weight. The participants, from all 50 states and the District of Columbia, included people who had elevated blood pressure and normal blood pressure at the start of the study. “We observed that people weren’t exercising as much during the pandemic, weren’t getting regular care, were drinking more and sleeping less,” said Dr Luke Laffin, the lead author, a preventive cardiologist who is co-director of the Center for Blood Pressure Disorders at the Cleveland Clinic. “We wanted to know, was their blood pressure changing during the pandemic?” The researchers found that blood pressure readings changed little from 2019 to the first three months of 2020, but increased significantly from April 2020 through December 2020, compared with the same period in 2019. Blood pressure is measured in units of millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and consists of two numbers. The first number refers to systolic pressure as the heart contracts, and the second number refers to diastolic pressure as the heart rests between beats. Normal blood pressure is said to be 120/80 mm Hg or less, although there is decades long dispute about the optimal levels. The new study found that the average monthly change from April 2020 to December 2020, compared with the previous year, was 1.10 mm Hg to 2.50 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure, and 0.14 to 0.53 for diastolic blood pressure. The increases held true for both men and women, and in all age groups. Larger increases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were seen in women. The average age of the study participants was just over 45, and slightly more than half were women. But critics said the failure to include information on the race and the ethnicity of participants was a significant weakness in the study, as hypertension is much more prevalent among Black Americans than among white or Hispanic Americans. Black people have also been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Laffin said information on race and ethnicity was available only for 6 per cent of the study participants, so an analysis would not be meaningful. But there is a big difference between Black Americans and white and Hispanic Americans when it comes to hypertension, said Dr Kim Williams, a cardiologist at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago and an author of the national blood pressure guidelines that were issued in 2017. “The hypertensive state has been epidemic in the African American population for decades,” he said. “Our therapies have improved and our attempt at calling it out have improved, yet the gap is widening. And we know the pandemic has hit different cultures and different aspects of society in different ways.” The causes of an overall increase in blood pressure are not clear, Laffin and his colleagues said. The reasons may include an increase in alcohol consumption, a decline in exercise, rising stress, a drop in doctors’ visits and less adherence to a medication regimen. The researchers dismissed a possible effect of weight gain, known to raise blood pressure, saying that the men in the study had lost weight and that the women had not gained more weight than usual. But other experts pointed out that average figures for weight gain might mask gains in segments of the population. “It is probably multifactorial,” said Lloyd-Jones, referring to the overall rise in blood pressure. “But I think a critical piece is that we know so many people lost contact with the health care system, and lost control of blood pressure and diabetes.” Americans must pay greater attention to overall health and the management of underlying medical conditions despite the pandemic, Laffin said, adding that the penalty for not doing so might outlast the coronavirus itself. “There are also public health consequences from not seeing your doctor regularly, making poor dietary choices and not exercising,” he said. “If we think about the long-term implications, that’s potentially more profound.” By Roni Caryn Rabin © The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-insider/whats-in-your-toothpaste-5-things-know-teeth-whitening-sensitive-rinse-spit-tiktok-brush-2371206,What’s in your toothpaste? 5 things to know for your teeth’s sake (and your children’s),"SINGAPORE: Brushing of teeth is a habit acquired as children, but how many of us know what toothpaste we should use, or why young children should not swallow the substance? CNA Insider kicks off a Talking Point web original series with a look at what’s in toothpaste, an everyday item most people sleepily reach for in the morning and before crawling into bed at night. Tristan Peh, a dentist with 17 years’ experience, fielded some of your questions, and his replies may make you brush more carefully, visit your dentist regularly and read toothpaste labels more closely in future. Here are five things to know. Look for one that contains at least 1,000 parts per million of fluoride, said Peh of St Andrew’s Dental Surgeons. Fluoride can help to prevent and even reverse tooth decay, he said. “If there’s any initial decay, it actually helps to re-mineralise (and) strengthen the tooth surface.” To relieve tooth sensitivity, it is good to get toothpaste with potassium nitrate because of our teeth’s dentinal tubules: Small, hollow channels that travel from the inside of each tooth through its middle layer, the dentine. Teeth get more sensitive when the enamel surface wears away and dentinal tubules are exposed. Potassium nitrate helps to cover the tubules up, thereby reducing sensitivity, said Peh. If you are looking at whitening toothpaste, pick one that contains either hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide, he said. Do-it-yourself whitening remedies, such as charcoal or baking soda, come with risks. The substances may be abrasive and wear out the tooth surface. “If you brush away the enamel, the dentine exposed can lead to sensitivity,” he said. “If you have extensive wear, even if you use toothpaste for sensitive teeth, it might not even help. So you might (be looking at) either fillings or maybe crowns later on.” WATCH: What’s in your toothpaste? Key ingredients to whiten teeth, and reduce sensitivity (5:03) Whitening treatment administered by dental professionals deliver more predictable results and a faster whitening process. It does not really matter, according to Peh. If you brush after breakfast, however, and had consumed acidic food or drinks such as coffee, it would be helpful to wait half an hour before brushing. Alternatively, rinse your mouth out before brushing. This is because the acids weaken the surface of the teeth; brushing may then wear away the surface, said Peh. After brushing for two minutes — the duration that would enable us to clean all tooth surfaces — and spitting out your toothpaste, it is up to you to rinse out your mouth or not, said Peh. Not everyone can bear the taste of toothpaste in the mouth after brushing, he noted. Besides, there is more than one way to prevent tooth decay: By brushing and flossing well, using fluoridated toothpaste and limiting sugar intake, he cited. For children younger than three years old, use a rice-grain amount or a smear of toothpaste, said Peh. For children less than eight years old, use a pea-sized amount of toothpaste. Children below the age of eight should spit out their toothpaste. This is because excessive intake of toothpaste when permanent teeth are developing can lead to dental fluorosis — white stains on the teeth."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/hearing-loss-elderly-age-aids-treatment-2338271,"Age-related hearing loss common, but seniors don't seek help for it early","SINGAPORE: When Ms Choy visited her parents in 2015 after moving out, she could hear the television blaring as she approached the flat from the lift. That was the first telltale sign that something was wrong with her now 84-year-old father’s hearing. She got him tested and found he had lost about 60 per cent of his hearing. But when he saw the cost of hearing aids, he refused to have them fitted. This was despite Ms Choy insisting that she would pay for them. “I assured him that the cost doesn’t beat the quality of life that he’ll get. I’m ready to pay all that’s required,” she said. With her father not getting help, his hearing progressively got worse, said Ms Choy, a 40-year-old marketing executive. “We needed to talk to him louder and louder, till we were shouting at him,” she said. She also had trouble talking to him on the phone, as she would not be able to get a response from him despite speaking at her loudest. He would eventually tell her to text him. Although he did not cut back on his social outings, like his weekly chess sessions with old friends, he resorted to getting them to write or text him instead of talking. When out, he would tell shopowners upfront that he could not hear, Ms Choy said. Things changed earlier this year after he was referred to the Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery at National University Hospital (NUH). Ms Choy’s father was then referred to the hospital’s mobile hearing clinic, where he was assessed to have 80 per cent hearing loss and was fitted with hearing aids. Communication with him is easier now, Ms Choy said. And in October this year, at a family wedding, his relatives were able to have a conversation with him after a long time, she said.  “Whatever (level of) hearing comes along is a delightful surprise to us,” she added. Her father’s case is not uncommon. Speaking at a media event in October to announce an innovation that allows seniors to have their hearing tested in the community, Professor William Hal Martin from NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine said that 93 per cent of seniors aged 60 years and above have some degree of hearing loss. He was citing findings from Project Silver Screen, an initiative started in 2018 by the Ministry of Health and Temasek Foundation Cares to screen more seniors for hearing problems. “What’s probably more alarming is that 61 per cent of them failed the hearing screening, indicating or suggesting the presence of a significant hearing loss,” said Prof Martin, who is from the Department of Otolaryngology. These seniors often do not seek help immediately – the average reported time from when a person has enough hearing loss to benefit from amplification and actually getting such help is at least 10 years, Prof Martin said. Consequences of untreated hearing loss include decreased quality of life, depression, anxiety and paranoia, accelerated brain tissue loss and an increased risk of dementia,  he said. Several barriers prevent people from seeking help, chief among which is that the elderly – especially in Asia – often think hearing loss is part of ageing and nothing can be done about it. Some also worry about whether they can afford hearing aids. But with means-tested government funding available, affordability is not an issue for most seniors, chief audiologist at NUH's Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery Dr Jenny Loo said. Another barrier is access – not everyone knows where and how to seek help. On that front, three community-based hearing clinics have been set up in Pioneer Polyclinic, Tiong Bahru Community Health Centre and Singapore General Hospital Sleep Centre. The clinics use a new boothless method developed by the hearing research team at NUS Medicine. This allows hearing evaluation to be done anywhere, instead of only in a sound-insulated booth at a hospital. Some elderly people also have the misconception that hearing aids do not work or are noisy, which discourages them from seeking help. Dr Loo said that while the old hearing aids were indeed noisy, new ones are “quite crystal clear”. Early detection and intervention are essential, she said. ""Otherwise the brain will start to forget how sounds are like, and it will be harder to intervene with hearing devices."" Seniors will typically not admit that they have hearing loss, Dr Loo said. Their hearing loss may start with losing the ability to hear certain pitch of sounds, but still having good residual hearing to pick up other sounds. For example, they may not be able to hear certain consonants like “f” and “s” clearly but can still hear vowels well. With everyone wearing masks, it is even harder for seniors who have hearing loss as they cannot lip-read, she said. Principal audiologist at SGH’s ENT Centre Leem Pei Shan said seniors “hearing what they want to hear” can be one of the symptoms of hearing loss and as age-related hearing loss progress gradually over the years, this may be a cause of miscommunication between family and elderly. Other signs include frequent mishearing, raising television volumes or seniors asking for repetition, she added. Ms Leem urged family members to encourage seniors to get their hearing checked if they show signs of hearing loss.  If diseases involving the ear or hearing are detected, medical intervention will be the first step. Otherwise, a hearing aid or cochlear implant is the solution, Dr Loo said.  “Most importantly, the medical team need to devise a customised plan based on patient’s needs, degree of hearing loss and lifestyle,” she said. President of the Hearing Professionals Association Ronald Pang said that hearing aids are modelled for varied lifestyle needs. A senior who is not very mobile and wearing the aid primarily in a quiet home setting would benefit from a “basic model” that cost a “few hundred dollars”. More intelligent hearing aids designed for active retirees cost more, but can suppress noise better or have Bluetooth features linked to their mobile phones. Premium models also operate more effectively against echos and wind, Mr Pang said. “The most expensive hearing aids in the premium range, designed for working adults and those with higher expectations, can cost more than S$7,000 each,” he said. Beyond getting fitted with hearing aids, it is important to maintain them and go for a follow-up within three months of being prescribed, said senior Ear, Nose and Throat specialist at Farrer Park Hospital Dr Soon Sue Rene.  Dr Soon also stressed that there needs to be more awareness about hearing loss. “Hearing is important for healthy ageing. It shouldn’t be the case that you are 60 or above 60, think hearing loss is normal and then wait again for years before it becomes moderate to severe to seek help,” she said. “That will be a bit too late because it comes with dementia, cognitive decline and social isolation.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/how-staying-physically-active-simple-ways-can-lower-risk-dementia-we-grow-old-2360846,How staying physically active in simple ways can lower the risk of dementia as we grow old,"Staying physically active as we age substantially drops our risk of developing dementia during our lifetimes, and it doesn’t require prolonged exercise. Walking or moving about, rather than sitting, may be all it takes to help bolster the brain, and a new study of octogenarians from Chicago may help to explain why. The study, which tracked how often older people moved or sat and then looked deep inside their brains after they passed away, found that certain vital immune cells worked differently in the brains of older people who were active compared to their more sedentary peers. Physical activity seemed to influence their brains’ health, their thinking abilities and whether they experienced the memory loss of Alzheimer’s disease. The findings add to growing evidence that when we move our bodies, we change our minds, no matter how advanced our age. Already, plenty of scientific evidence indicates that  bulks up our brains. Older, sedentary people who begin walking for about an hour most days, for instance, typically add volume to their hippocampus, the brain’s memory center, reducing or reversing the shrinkage that otherwise commonly occurs there over the years. Active people who are middle-aged or older also tend to perform better on tests of memory and thinking skills than people of the same age who rarely exercise, and are nearly half as likely eventually to be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Almost as heartening, active people who do develop dementia usually show their first symptoms years later than inactive people do. But precisely how movement remodels our brains is still mostly mysterious, although scientists have hints from animal experiments. When adult lab mice and rats run on wheels, for example, they goose production of hormones and neurochemicals that prompt the creation of new neurons, as well as synapses, blood vessels and other tissues that connect and nurture those young brain cells. Rodent exercise also slows or halts ageing-related declines in the animals’ brains, studies show, in part by strengthening specialised cells called microglia. Little understood until recently, microglial cells are now known to be the brain’s resident immune cells and hall monitors. They watch for signs of waning neuronal health and, when cells in decline are spotted, release neurochemicals that initiate an inflammatory response. Inflammation, in the short-term, helps to clear away the problem cells and any other biological debris. Afterward, the microglia release other chemical messages that calm the inflammation, keeping the brain healthy and tidy and the animal’s thinking intact. But as animals age, recent studies have found, their microglia can start to malfunction, initiating inflammation but not subsequently quieting it, leading to continuous brain inflammation. This chronic inflammation can kill healthy cells and cause problems with memory and learning, sometimes severe enough to induce a rodent version of Alzheimer’s disease. Unless the animals exercise. In that case, post-mortem exams of their tissues show, the animals’ brains typically teem with healthy, helpful microglia deep into old age, displaying few signs of continuous brain inflammation, while the elderly rodents themselves retained a youthful ability to learn and remember. We are not mice, though, and while we have microglia, scientists had not previously found a way to study whether being physically active as we age – or not – would influence the inner workings of microglial cells. So, for the new study, which was published in November in the Journal of Neuroscience, scientists affiliated with Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, the University of California, San Francisco, and other institutions, turned to data from the ambitious Rush Memory and Aging Project. For that study, hundreds of Chicagoans, most in their 80s at the start, completed extensive annual thinking and memory tests and wore activity monitors for at least a week. Few formally exercised, the monitors showed, but some moved around or walked far more often than others. Many of the participants died as the study continued, and the researchers examined stored brain tissues from 167 of them, searching for lingering biochemical markers of microglial activity. They wanted to see, in effect, whether people’s microglia appeared to have been perpetually overexcited during their final years, driving brain inflammation, or been able to dial back their activity when appropriate, blunting inflammation. The researchers also looked for common biological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease, like the telltale plaques and tangles that riddle the brain. Then they crosschecked this data with information from people’s activity trackers. They found a strong relationship between being in motion and healthy microglia, especially in portions of the brain involved in memory. Microglia from the most active elderly men and women contained biochemical markers indicating the cells knew how to be quiet when needed. But microglia from sedentary participants showed signs of having become stuck in unhealthy overdrive during their final years. Those inactive men and women also generally scored lowest on cognitive tests. Perhaps most interesting, though, these effects were greatest in people whose brains showed signs of Alzheimer’s disease when they died, regardless of whether they had serious memory impairments while they were still alive. If these people had been inactive, their microglia tended to look quite dysfunctional, and their memories tended to be spotty. But if people frequently had moved around during late life, their microglia usually appeared healthy after their deaths, and many had not experienced notable memory loss in their later years. Their brains may have showed signs of Alzheimer’s, but their lives and thinking abilities had not. What these findings suggest is that physical activity may delay or alter memory loss from Alzheimer’s disease in older people, partly by keeping microglia fit, said Kaitlin Casaletto, an assistant professor of neuropsychology at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center, who led the new study. Encouragingly, the amount of activity needed to see these benefits was not large, Dr Casaletto said. None of the participants had been running marathons in their twilight years. Few had formally exercised. “But there was a linear relationship” between how still they were and their brain health, she said. “The less they sat, the more they stood, the more they moved around, the better their outcomes.” The study is important, said Mark Gluck, a professor of neuroscience at Rutgers University in New Jersey, who was not involved in the research. The findings are “the first to use post-mortem analyses of brain tissue to show that a marker of inflammation in the brain, microglial activation, appears to be the mechanism through which physical activity can reduce brain inflammation and help protect against the cognitive ravages of Alzheimer’s disease,” he said, though further research in living people is needed. In addition, no one believes microglia are the only aspect of the brain affected by movement, Dr Casaletto said. Physical activity changes countless other cells, genes and chemicals in the brain, she said, and some of those effects may be more important than microglia in keeping us mentally sharp. This study also does not prove activity causes microglia to work better, only that healthy microglia are common in people who are active. Finally, it does not tell us whether we get extra brain benefits from being physically active when we are far younger than 80-plus. But Dr Casaletto, who is 36, said the study’s results keep her exercising. By Gretchen Reynolds © The New York Times Company This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/how-exactly-does-poor-sleep-affect-your-health-whats-sweet-spot-good-nights-rest-2362861,How exactly does poor sleep affect your health? What’s the sweet spot for a good night’s rest?,"Sleep – both its quantity and its quality – is one of the most frequently discussed health topics. How often have you told a friend or relative, “I’m exhausted, I was up half the night""? Surveys have found that more than one-third of American adults are unable to consistently get a good night’s sleep, with millions having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. And the pandemic seems to have only made things worse, even for those who were previously “good” sleepers. Remote work gave many people more hours in the day for personal use, but at the same time turned the workday into a 24/7 endeavour, with emails, texts and Zoom calls occurring at odd and often unpredictable times. Working parents who lacked child care options or had to help young children with online schoolwork during the day may have resorted to late-night or early-morning hours to get their own work done with minimal interruptions. They essentially became shift workers with erratic sleep schedules. Others lost sleep pondering whether their jobs were worth the stress and how they might reshape their working lives going forward. And for countless thousands, the death of a loved one from COVID-19 has resulted in long-lasting difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep long enough to feel rested. A study from 2019 by researchers at Northwestern Medicine and Rice University found that grieving spouses who reported sleeping poorly had high levels of chronic, bodywide inflammation, which can increase their susceptibility to heart disease and cancer. POOR SLEEP TAKES A TOLL ON MIND AND BODY Persistent fatigue may be the main complaint of sleep-deprived people. But beneath the surface, growing evidence indicates that disrupted or insufficient sleep can have widespread damaging impacts on their physical and mental health. Sleep deprivation increases the risk of developing heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke and Type 2 diabetes. It muddies clear thinking, depletes energy, increases irritability and dampens one’s sex drive. Even those who sleep soundly but for fewer than the commonly recommended seven or eight hours a night may not be as medically well off with short sleep cycles as they think. For example, a major study suggests that middle-aged people who are chronically short on shut-eye face an increased risk of developing dementia in their later years. The study, published last spring in the journal Nature Communications, followed nearly 8,000 50-year-olds in Britain for about 25 years. Compared with those who averaged seven hours of sleep a night, the study participants who slept six hours or fewer on weeknights were 30 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with dementia nearly three decades later. THERE IS A SLEEP SWEET SPOT Those who sleep significantly more than seven hours a night, however, are not necessarily spared sleep-related health risks. For optimal health, there seems to be a sweet spot of six to eight hours of nightly sleep. A six-year study of more than 1 million adults ages 30 to 102 by researchers at the University of California, San Diego, and the American Cancer Society revealed a U-shaped curve, with the highest mortality rates among those who slept more than eight hours or less than four hours a night. In a Nurses’ Health Study that followed 71,617 women for a decade, those who slept eight hours a night had the lowest risk of developing heart disease. But in another study that followed 84,794 nurses for up to 24 years, those who slept nine or more hours a night were twice as likely to develop Parkinson’s disease as those who averaged six hours or less. Still, many more people, both lay and professional, worry more about too little sleep than an excess of shut-eye, and with good reason. Sleep-deprived people have more accidents and are more likely to fall asleep at inappropriate times, such as at a play or concert or, most seriously, while driving. Drowsy driving slows reaction time as much as drunken driving does. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, fatigue results in 100,000 auto crashes and 1,550 automotive deaths a year in the United States. Several automakers, including Subaru, Audi, Mercedes and Volvo, now offer drowsiness-detection systems that monitor a car’s movements, such as lane deviations, and alert sleepy drivers to take a break. Sleep deprivation was a factor in some of the biggest environmental disasters in recent decades, including the 1979 nuclear accident at Three Mile Island, the 1986 nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl and the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. HOW WE SLEEP MAY IMPACT HOW WE EAT Although you might expect the opposite, several studies have shown that short sleepers tend to weigh more than those who sleep for longer periods, even though people expend more calories while awake than asleep. A study of 990 working adults in rural Iowa found that the less sleep they got on weeknights, the higher their body mass index tended to be. A Canadian study of 240 children ages 8 to 17 showed that it was not helpful to try to make up for short weeknights by sleeping longer on the weekend. Fluctuating hours of sleep can impact appetite-regulating hormones in ways that prompt people to eat when they’re not hungry and eat past the point of satiation. The Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study found that short sleepers had low levels of the appetite-suppressing hormone leptin, and higher levels of the hormone ghrelin, which signals people to eat more. Furthermore, an attempt to make up for lost sleep on the weekend has been associated with eating in the absence of hunger or in response to fatigue, as well as being unduly tempted by the sight or smell of food. I can attest to a common tendency to eat more – especially snacks of questionable nutritional value – when staying up past what should have been a reasonable bedtime. FOSTERING A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP Experts offer a variety of tips for getting a better night’s sleep. Among them: – Avoid all sources of caffeine in the late afternoon and evening, as well as a big heavy meal close to bedtime. – Practice good sleep hygiene. Go to bed and get up at about the same time each day. – Do not use alcohol to help you unwind. Try a warm bath or meditation. – Reading before bed is great, as long as it’s not on a computer or tablet that emits sleep-inhibiting light. – If outside light impedes sleep, install light-blocking shades or curtains or use a sleep mask. If noise is a problem, use earplugs or a white-noise machine. – Consider cognitive behavioural therapy, which challenges underlying thoughts or behaviours that may be keeping you up at night.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/new-zealand-ban-cigarette-smoking-nicotine-2368426,New Zealand plans lifetime ban on cigarette sales to stamp out smoking,"The New Zealand government plans to ban young people from ever buying cigarettes in their lifetime in one of the world's toughest crackdowns on the tobacco industry, arguing that other efforts to extinguish smoking were taking too long. People aged 14 and under in 2027 will never be allowed to purchase cigarettes in the Pacific country of five million, part of proposals unveiled on Thursday (Dec 9) that will also curb the number of retailers authorised to sell tobacco and cut nicotine levels in all products. ""We want to make sure young people never start smoking so we will make it an offence to sell or supply smoked tobacco products to new cohorts of youth,"" said New Zealand Associate Minister of Health Ayesha Verrall in a statement. ""If nothing changes, it would be decades till Maori smoking rates fall below 5 per cent, and this government is not prepared to leave people behind."" Currently, 11.6 per cent of all New Zealanders aged over 15 smoke, a proportion that rises to 29 per cent among indigenous Maori adults, according to government figures. The government will consult with a Maori health task force in the coming months before introducing legislation into parliament in June next year, with the aim of making it law by the end of 2022. The restrictions would then be rolled out in stages from 2024, beginning with a sharp reduction in the number of authorised sellers, followed by reduced nicotine requirements in 2025 and the creation of the ""smoke-free"" generation from 2027. The package of measures will make New Zealand's retail tobacco industry one of the most restricted in the world, just behind Bhutan where cigarette sales are banned outright. New Zealand's neighbour Australia was the first country in the world to mandate plain packaging of cigarettes in 2012. The New Zealand government said while existing measures like plain packaging and levies on sales had slowed tobacco consumption, the tougher steps were necessary to achieve its goal of fewer than 5 per cent of the population smoking daily by 2025. The new rules would halve the country's smoking rates in as few as 10 years from when they take effect, the government said. Smoking kills about 5,000 people a year in New Zealand, making it one of the country's top causes of preventable death. Four in five smokers started before age 18, the country's government said. Health authorities welcomed the crackdown, while retailers expressed concern about the impact on their businesses and warned of the emergence of a black market. The government did not give specifics about how the new rules would be policed or whether and how they would apply to visitors to the country. ""Cigarette smoking kills 14 New Zealanders every day and two out of three smokers will die as a result of smoking,"" said New Zealand Medical Association chair Alistair Humphrey in a statement. ""This action plan offers some hope of realising our 2025 Smokefree Aotearoa goal, and keeping our tamariki (Maori children) smoke-free."" However, the Dairy and Business Owners Group, a lobby group for local convenience stores, known in New Zealand as dairies, said while it supported a smoke-free country, the government's plan would destroy many businesses. ""This is all 100 per cent theory and zero per cent substance,"" the group's chairman, Sunny Kaushal, told Stuff.co.nz. ""There’s going to be a crime wave. Gangs and criminals will fill the gap with ciggie houses alongside tinnie houses.""

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/next-pandemic-could-be-more-lethal-covid19-omicron-2361146,"Next pandemic could be more lethal than COVID-19, vaccine creator says","LONDON: Future pandemics could be even more lethal than COVID-19 so the lessons learned from the outbreak must not be squandered and the world should ensure it is prepared for the next viral onslaught, one of the creators of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine said. The coronavirus has killed 5.26 million people across the world, according to Johns Hopkins University, wiped out trillions of dollars in economic output and turned life upside down for billions of people. ""The truth is, the next one could be worse. It could be more contagious, or more lethal, or both,"" Sarah Gilbert said in the Richard Dimbleby Lecture, the BBC reported on Monday (Dec 6). ""This will not be the last time a virus threatens our lives and our livelihoods."" Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology at the University of Oxford, said the world should make sure it is better prepared for the next virus. ""The advances we have made, and the knowledge we have gained, must not be lost,"" she said. Efforts to end the COVID-19 pandemic have been uneven and fragmented, marked by limited access to vaccines in low-income countries while the ""healthy and wealthy"" in rich countries get boosters, health experts say. A panel of health experts set up by the World Health Organization to review the handling of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has called for permanent funding and for greater ability to investigate pandemics through a new treaty. One proposal was for new financing of at least US$10 billion a year for pandemic preparedness. The COVID-19 outbreak was first detected in China in late 2019. Vaccines were developed against the virus in record time. Gilbert said the Omicron variant's spike protein contained mutations known to increase the transmissibility of the virus. ""There are additional changes that may mean antibodies induced by the vaccines, or by infection with other variants, may be less effective at preventing infection with Omicron,"" Gilbert said. ""Until we know more, we should be cautious, and take steps to slow down the spread of this new variant."" "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/virgil-abloh-cardiac-angiosarcoma-rare-cancer-2349396,What is cardiac angiosarcoma? The rare cancer that took Virgil Abloh's life,"On Nov 28, Virgil Abloh, a noted designer and artistic director of men’s fashion at Louis Vuitton, died at 41 in Chicago after a two-year battle with cardiac angiosarcoma. WHAT IS CARDIAC ANGIOSARCOMA? First described by doctors in 1934, cardiac angiosarcoma is a rare form of cancer that causes cells inside the blood vessels of the heart to multiply and form tumors. The cancerous cells are often found in blood vessels lining the musculature of the wall of the heart, said Dr Robert Maki, a medical oncologist and the clinical director of the Sarcoma Program at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia. These cancers are part of a larger family of cancers called sarcomas, which affect the connective tissues that support and surround other parts of the body, including muscle, fat and blood vessels. Angiosarcomas are a kind of sarcoma that specifically afflict cells that line blood vessels, and cardiac angiosarcomas are angiosarcomas that occur within or around the heart. Cardiac angiosarcomas that begin in the heart are known as primary cardiac angiosarcomas, whereas cancers that form elsewhere and then spread to the heart are secondary cardiac angiosarcomas. It’s unclear which kind Abloh had, but it’s likely it was primary, said Dr Sumeet Mitter, a cardiologist at The Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, because if the tumor had originated elsewhere it would probably be described differently. Angiosarcomas are aggressive and can also spread, or metastasise, to other parts of the body, including the lungs, liver and bone marrow, Dr Maki said. HOW COMMON ARE CARDIAC ANGIOSARCOMAS? Cardiac angiosarcomas are extremely rare. Of the 17,000 or fewer people in the United States who are diagnosed with sarcomas each year, up to 700 are diagnosed with angiosarcomas, and then only 30 to 40 of those have cardiac angiosarcomas, Dr Maki said. Angiosarcomas are more common in dogs, especially retrievers, Dr Maki added, where they often afflict the spleen. WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS? Cardiac angiosarcomas can be difficult to identify because people often do not have symptoms, or they have only vague symptoms like shortness of breath or fatigue during physical exertion, said Dr Ankit Mangla, a medical oncologist at the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center in Cleveland. These symptoms typically arise because the tumors make it harder for blood to flow through the chambers of the heart. But while many people experience shortness of breath and fatigue, only a very small portion of people with these symptoms have cardiac angiosarcoma. Typically, people have other heart problems instead – the heart muscle itself might be weak, or it may be too muscular and stiff, Dr. Maki said. HOW ARE CARDIAC ANGIOSARCOMAS DIAGNOSED? Diagnosing these rare cancers can be difficult, because the tumors cannot always be seen using common imaging techniques such as CT scans, which are often administered to patients in emergency rooms who complain of shortness of breath, Dr Mangla said. During a physical exam, a doctor might, however, be able to hear the sounds of blood rushing around the tumor. They might then conduct an ultrasound of the heart to visualise and identify a tumor, and then follow up with other kinds of imaging, including MRI, PET scan or three-dimensional echocardiography. HOW DO DOCTORS TREAT CARDIAC ANGIOSARCOMA? It depends on the patient, but treatment might include surgery to try to remove the heart tumor, or a heart transplant. But sometimes – even in transplant patients – the tumor can reappear. Generally, if the cancer has not yet spread, it won’t be treated with chemotherapy or radiation. “It’s very rare for us to be able to treat just the heart itself with something like chemotherapy, and you also don’t want to necessarily radiate the heart either, because that will damage it,” Dr Maki said. By Melinda Wenner Moyer © The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times. If the cancer has spread, though, a patient might undergo chemotherapy, radiation or treatment with other cancer-fighting drugs that can kill the spreading cancer. It is unclear whether Abloh’s cancer had spread, but if he had it for two years, that is certainly possible, Dr Maki said. WHAT IS THE PROGNOSIS? Because cardiac angiosarcomas can damage the heart, which is a vital organ, and because they are aggressive and often spread, these cancers are often fatal. Some research suggests that if people do not undergo surgery, or their surgery does not remove all of the cancer, they typically survive for up to nine months, Dr Mangla said. With surgery and other treatments, patients may live for 12 to 30 months. WHAT ARE THE RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIAC ANGIOSARCOMA? Because so few people are diagnosed with this kind of cancer, we don’t know much about specific risk factors, Dr Maki said. However, people are more likely to be diagnosed with angiosarcomas in general if they have undergone radiation therapy or have been exposed to high levels of vinyl chloride (a chemical used to make PVC.); arsenic; or thorium dioxide, a chemical people can be exposed to in drinking water if they live near sites that mine for the radioactive metal thorium or use it in manufacturing.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/infertility-miscarriage-pregnancy-loss-parenting-2352196,"You’re allowed to complain about your kids, even after infertility","I clamped my hands over my ears as the obstetrician cranked up the volume on the ultrasound machine. After three pregnancy losses, I was convinced that we’d be met only with static. “I think you’re going to want to hear this,” the doctor said. And there was the unmistakable drumming of my son’s heart. At that moment, I promised myself that I would always be grateful for this baby, and for my body that found a way to grow with him. And yet, when it’s 4:58 a.m. and I’m awakened by him bellowing for potato chips and cartoons, parenting can feel tedious, lonely and exhausting. I often find myself asking: How can parents like me, who have struggled with infertility or pregnancy loss, reconcile gratitude for having a child at all with the everyday frustrations of parenthood? When I had a video call with Loree Johnson, a therapist based in Hermosa Beach, California, who specialises in infertility and loss, to begin unpacking that question, she was draped in a rainbow-themed nursing cover and was holding the serene yet alert infant she delivered after three miscarriages and one pregnancy terminated for medical reasons. Though we were strangers, we spoke with the intimacy of mothers who had just crawled out of a foxhole together. Dr Johnson observed that many of her patients with living children preface darker comments about parenting with the phrase: “I’m really grateful but …” Parents can find themselves jumping through verbal hoops to avoid seeming insensitive to those who have been through the same sad journey. “When you are part of a community bound by loss and its heaviness, there is some concern for what your experience is like for others,” Dr Johnson said. Everyone needs someone to commiserate with about the tougher moments of child rearing, she added. It’s important to seek out friends who provide that mental safe space. “Those are people that know you’re grateful, and that talking about challenging feelings doesn’t mean that you’re not,” she said. Jay Tansey of Cape Elizabeth, Maine, found that being a sounding board for others helped him process the loss of his full-term daughter Bella in 2017. Tansey’s best friend also lost a baby. “We formed an informal group my friend dubbed the Sad Dads Club, an ever-growing network of guys who’ve lost children,” he said. The men know one another’s stories and provide comfort on the birthdays of the children they lost. Tansey and his wife, Elly Pepper, paid out of pocket for therapy sessions soon after Bella died – a financial burden for them at the time. He credits therapy with helping him to separate the loss of Bella from his more lighthearted, hope-filled experience of parenting their three living children. “When we lost Bella, one of the least helpful comments made was how I should be happy with what we had – a healthy, wonderful two-year-old,” Pepper said. The remark threw her into a shame-spiral, she added, making her question whether her grief and desire to have more children were negatively affecting her parenting. Now her perspective has shifted: “I can be grateful for my kids, and it can be hard,” she said. “I can treasure the children I have but wish Bella were here.” Dr Pooja Lakshmin, a psychiatrist based in Austin, Texas, and the founder of Gemma, a digital education platform focused on women’s mental health, said that “it is 100 per cent normal to feel conflicted about parenthood even if you went through hell to become a parent.” “The gratitude can be there buried inside of you,” she added, “even when the most prominent feeling you have at this moment is sheer rage because your toddler is driving you insane.” Heather Camarillo, who lives with her family in Southern California, documents the highs and lows of parenthood on Instagram. Many of her followers are dealing with infertility or child loss. She and her wife, Jess Camarillo, welcomed their son Bowie in March after enduring multiple rounds of in vitro fertilization and ultimately adopting three embryos. But Heather has never posted online about the postpartum depression she experienced after bringing Bowie home from the hospital. “The only person I even told was my wife,” she said. “I just felt I should not be feeling this way. After everything we’ve been through, why should I have any kind of depression?” In addition to steady support from Jess, Heather found healing in social media posts and comments from other mothers, some of whom also struggled to become parents. “Reading those stories really helped me, because I knew at that point I was not alone.” Kristin Jones from Wayne, Pennsylvania, felt alone for a long time, too. Already the mother of a toddler son, she was 39 weeks pregnant with her second child, Kalliope. While filling out a baby book in anticipation, she realised she hadn’t felt any movement in her belly that day. She rushed to the hospital the next morning. “We went in and found out that the baby was dead,” she said. “There hadn’t been any red flags, so it was really shocking.” She miscarried another baby before delivering a daughter, who had significant digestive issues and was constantly crying. An avid runner, Jones craved the release of exercise but felt too guilty to work out. “You can’t strap a screaming child into a jogger and go out without feeling like people are staring at you and judging,” she said. Nowadays, when a fun excursion with her son isn’t going smoothly, she says she wonders: “Should I be doing something different so that I’m maximising my time with him? I’m so lucky to have him.” She’s found relief in repeating an affirmation to herself: “Parenting is hard and not every moment of being a parent is going to be worth savouring.” I’ve recently found comfort in expressing similar thoughts out loud and in confiding in a mom friend who also stumbled through infertility. We huddle on my lawn, complaining about the impossibility of juggling work, elementary school and tantrums while gushing about our kids. Our contradictory feelings are as mismatched as a sock drawer. I can hold it all – the jagged grief that never really went away after a fourth miscarriage, the amazement of watching my son climb to the top of the jungle gym that first time, and the cheerlessness of rushing to the morning school bus in the November frost.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/healthy-food-nutrition-guidelines-best-tips-2346456,There's a better way to healthy eating without completely removing 'bad foods' from your diet,"There are no “good” foods and “bad” foods. Rather, it’s your overall dietary pattern that matters most when it comes to healthful eating. That’s the main message from the American Heart Association in its latest nutrition guidelines to improve the hearts and health of Americans of all ages and life circumstances. The experts who wrote the guidelines recognise that people don’t eat nutrients or individual ingredients. They eat foods, and most people want to enjoy the foods they eat while staying within their budgets and, the association hopes, without injuring their bodies. This doesn’t mean you need to totally avoid Big Macs, Cokes and French fries, but it does mean you should not regularly indulge in such fare if you want to stay healthy. Dr Robert H Eckel, a former president of the American Heart Association, and an endocrinologist and lipid specialist at the University of Colorado Denver, told me he “occasionally” indulges in foods outside a wholesome dietary pattern. The operative word here, though, is “occasionally.” Dr Neil J Stone, a preventive cardiologist at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University, who praised the thoughtfulness and expertise of the guidelines committee, said in an interview, “There’s no such thing as one diet that fits all, but there are principles to form the basis of diets that fit everyone.” He added: “The goal is to make good nutrition possible for all. The healthier we can keep everybody in this country, the lower our health costs will be.” In the 15 years since the heart association last issued dietary guidelines to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, almost nothing has changed for the better. The typical American diet has remained highly processed. Americans consume too much added sugars, artery-clogging fats, refined starches, red meat and salt and don’t eat enough nutrient-rich vegetables, fruits, nuts, beans and whole grains that can help prevent heart disease, diabetes and cancer. But rather than become discouraged, the association decided to try a different approach. For too long, nutrition advice has been overly focused on individual nutrients and ingredients, Alice H Lichtenstein, the guidelines’ chief author, told me, and it hasn’t been focused enough on overall dietary patterns that can best fit people’s lives and budgets. HOW THE GUIDELINES WORK  So instead of a laundry list of “thou shalt not eats,” Dr Lichtenstein said, the association’s committee on nutrition and cardiovascular disease chose to promote heart-healthy dietary patterns that could suit a wide range of tastes and eating habits. In avoiding “no noes” and dietary revolutions, the new guidelines can foster gradual evolutionary changes meant to last a lifetime. The committee recognised that for people to adopt and stick to a wholesome dietary pattern, it should accommodate personal likes and dislikes, ethnic and cultural practices and life circumstances, and it should consider whether most meals are consumed at home or on the go. For example, rather than urging people to skip pasta because it’s a refined carbohydrate, a more effective message might be to tell people to eat it the traditional Italian way, as a small first-course portion. Or, if pasta is your main course, choose a product made from an unrefined carbohydrate like whole wheat, brown rice or lentils. “We’re talking about lifelong changes that incorporate personal preferences, culinary traditions and what’s available where people shop and eat,” said Dr. Lichtenstein, a professor of nutrition science and policy at the Friedman School at Tufts University. “The advice is evidence-based and applies to everything people eat regardless of where the food is procured, prepared and consumed.” The guidelines’ first principle is to adjust one’s “energy intake and expenditure” to “achieve and maintain a healthy body weight,” a recommendation that may be easier to follow with the next two principles: Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, and choose foods made mostly with whole grains rather than refined grains. A HEALTHY DIET FOR YOU AND THE PLANET  If cost or availability is an issue, as is the case in many of the country’s food deserts where fresh produce is scarce, Dr Lichtenstein suggested keeping bags of frozen fruits and vegetables on hand to reduce waste, add convenience and save money. Some wholesome protein choices that the committee recommended included fish and seafood (although not breaded and fried), legumes and nuts, and low-fat or fat-free dairy products. If meat is desired, choose lean cuts and refrain from processed meats like sausages, hot dogs and deli meats that are high in salt and saturated fat. The committee’s advice on protein foods, published during the climate talks in Glasgow, was well-timed. Choosing plant-based proteins over animal sources of protein not only has health value for consumers but can help to foster a healthier planet. Experts have long known that animal products like beef, lamb, pork and veal have a disproportionately negative impact on the environment. Raising animals requires more water and land and generates more greenhouse gases than growing protein-rich plants does. “This is a win-win for individuals and our environment,” Dr Lichtenstein said. However, she cautioned, if a plant-based diet is overloaded with refined carbohydrates and sugars, it will raise the risk of Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. And she discouraged relying on popular plant-based meat alternatives that are ultra-processed and often high in sodium, unhealthy fats and calories, and that “may not be ecologically sound to produce.” To protect both the environment and human health, the committee advised shifting one’s diet away from tropical oils – coconut, palm and palm kernel – as well as animal fats (butter and lard) and partially hydrogenated fats (read the nutrition label). Instead, use liquid plant oils like corn, soybean, safflower, sunflower, canola, nut and olive. They have been shown to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease by about 30 percent, an effect comparable to taking a statin drug. As for beverages, the committee endorsed the current national dietary guideline to avoid drinks with added sugars (including honey and concentrated fruit juice). If you don’t currently drink alcohol, the committee advised against starting; for those who do drink, limit consumption to one to two drinks a day. PREVENTION IS KEY All told, the dietary patterns that the committee outlined can go far beyond reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases like heart attacks and strokes. They can also protect against Type 2 diabetes and a decline of kidney function, and perhaps even help foster better cognitive abilities and a slower rate of age-related cognitive decline. The earlier in life a wholesome dietary pattern begins, the better, Dr Lichtenstein said. “It should start preconception, not after someone has a heart attack, and reinforced through nutrition education in school, from Kindergarten through 12th Grade.” And during annual checkups, Dr Eckel said, primary care doctors should devote three to five minutes of the visit to a lifestyle interview, asking patients how many servings of fruits, vegetables and whole grains they consume and whether they read nutrition labels.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/sexual-health-midlife-women-singapore-menopause-study-nuhs-2353301,70% of sexually active women in midlife experience sexual dysfunction: NUHS study,"The majority of women in Singapore who are in midlife and are sexually active, experience sexual dysfunction, according to a new study led by the National University Health System (NUHS). The study, which was unveiled at a media briefing on Wednesday (Dec 1), used questionnaires to get a comprehensive look at the female respondents' health, including aspects such as physical function, bone health, menopausal health and urogenital health.  Of the 1,048 Chinese, Malay and Indian women aged 45 to 69 years old who were surveyed, 57 per cent were found to be sexually active, according to the study. Of these, 70 per cent experienced female sexual dysfunction, which is characterised by a lack of sexual interest or arousal, an inability to orgasm and/or experience genital pain. The study also highlighted risk factors associated with female sexual dysfunction, which include vaginal dryness, increasing age, post-menopausal status, menstruation, not having given birth, higher depressive symptoms, lower body mass index and weaker handgrip strength.  “Vaginal dryness is the biggest risk factor of female sexual dysfunction,” said Professor Yong Eu Leong, who led the study. This condition increases the risk by “a whopping 13.8-fold, which is about 1,300 per cent”, said Prof Yong, who is Emeritus Consultant at the National University Hospital’s (NUH) Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.  The study also showed that moderate to severe vaginal dryness was associated with women who were more than 10 years post-menopause, reaffirming the findings of previous studies that showed how sexual function may worsen with advancing menopause status. Treating menopause using hormone replacement therapy helps protect against sexual dysfunction, the study also found, with Prof Yong adding that such treatment can reduce the risk by a significant 70 per cent.  NUHS said its study was driven by the lack of discussion about sexual issues among midlife Asian women during medical care, due to “embarassment, religious sensitivities and Eastern values”, it said in press material.  “Female sexual function in Asia is under-reported, under-treated and under-studied,” it said, adding that it is working on a second assessment to help build on the findings of the study.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-insider/too-much-noise-can-harm-your-health-thats-potentially-problem-singapore-2350251,Too much noise can harm your health. That’s potentially a problem in Singapore,"SINGAPORE: For months, Wayne Chan has been putting up with renovation noise coming from neighbouring units. The full-time emcee, who has had to host events virtually from home during the pandemic, was so annoyed he posted a video on Facebook, complaining about the noise. Besides drilling, he cited hacking and hammering sounds and things being dragged around. “This (means) I can’t do these shows as well as I’d like to,” he said. “I always … worry that when I’m in the middle of hosting, drilling is suddenly going to happen.” He is not alone in finding noise levels a problem. The Housing and Development Board (HDB) received about 11,400 noise-related complaints between January and September last year, a threefold increase compared to the same period in 2019. Noise from neighbours, however, is not the only thing plaguing Singaporeans. The programme Talking Point explores the different types of environmental noise, how some neighbourhoods are worse off than others, and the impact on health — in ways people least expect. There are also ways to block out noise, instead of suffering in silence. Most of the noise-related complaints people make tend to be about furniture being dragged in the unit upstairs, the sound of running feet, the playing of loud music or musical instruments and renovation noise. That is according to Lim Lan Yuan, principal master mediator at the Law Ministry’s Community Mediation Centre (CMC), who helps mediate neighbour dispute cases registered at the CMC. And with many people still working from home, he does not expect a drop in the number of noise-related cases. “When there are more activities (at home), they’re bound to generate more noise that could affect your neighbours,” he said. Renovation work like drilling and demolition can produce noise levels above 100 decibels at any given time. By comparison, the National Environment Agency’s (NEA’s) noise limit for construction work is 90 decibels, measured as an average over five minutes at residential buildings less than 150 metres from the construction site. Outdoor noise levels around Singapore can also be higher than the prescribed limit. A 2017 study conducted by National University of Singapore (NUS) researchers found that the average outdoor sound level measured throughout the day was 69.4 decibels, compared to the NEA’s recommended limit of 67 decibels averaged over an hour. Over 10 weeks, the team took more than 18,700 audio readings across the country, with the help of 52 volunteers who went about their day while using calibrated iPhones. The noisiest neighbourhoods were Serangoon (73.1 decibels), Orchard and Outram (both 72.8 decibels) and Bukit Timah (72.6 decibels). Residential areas higher on the list comprised mainly mature estates, like Clementi, Kallang and Rochor, as these have a higher road density than other areas. WATCH: Top 4 noisiest neighbourhoods in Singapore (3:00) There were also differences between Singapore’s five regions: On average, the north and west regions recorded lower daytime noise levels compared to the other regions. The road density is lower in these two regions. The north region also encompasses the Central Water Catchment area and agricultural and industrial zones — generally less populated than residential zones — while the west region includes a heavy industrial zone. One of the researchers, senior audiologist Diong Huey Ting from Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, told Talking Point that the way an estate is designed, such as where the buildings and overhead bridges are placed, contributes to the acoustic environment. Enclosed spaces can be worse. “When we have an enclosed area, it traps the sound,” she said. Sound would otherwise dissipate in an open area. As to whether flats on the upper floors are less affected by noise than residents living below, she noted that while those flats may be physically further from traffic and construction, they could still be exposed to renovation noise. There are also fewer physical barriers higher up a building to block sounds. When it comes to renovation noise, not much can be done either. Chan, who complained to his condominium management besides posting on social media, found that out as no one was breaking the rules. The HDB guidelines, which also apply to condominiums, classify renovation into two types: General and noisy. Noisy renovation, like drilling and demolition work, can be carried out only between 9am and 5pm on weekdays; general renovation, which includes carpentry work and painting, can go on until 6pm on weekdays and Saturdays. Renovation is not allowed on Sundays and public holidays. Chan said, however, that just having to deal with the noise has affected him physically. “(It) makes you a little bit more … tense. And all of that would result in you not resting as well as you’d like to,” he said. “I feel pretty trapped in my own house.” Indeed, noise can have a real impact on one’s health, according to William Hal Martin, the director of NUS’ graduate studies in audiology who led the 2017 research, Singapore’s biggest study of environmental noise and the health implications. The professor said prolonged exposure to city noise, like from aeroplanes, construction and diesel buses, is associated with long-term health problems such as general stress, insomnia and even cardiovascular disease. This is why, noted Diong, the World Health Organisation’s guideline for community noise in outdoor living areas, for example, is a limit of 55 decibels averaged out over the daytime and evening. In a paper published this year, the researchers said their study therefore suggests the Singapore population “is potentially at risk of adverse non-auditory health effects”, referring to non-ear-related issues. These include metabolic effects, cognitive impairment and mental health impacts in the long term. The risk of hypertension may also increase. Another kind of noise that can pose a danger is sound loud enough to cause physical damage to the inner ear, for example from loud music at places like nightclubs or even dance studios. “It’s a combination of how high the volume is and how long you hear it that causes the damage,” said Martin. In the inner ear, a structure called the cochlear has thousands of hair cells — as many as 18,000 in a young, healthy ear, he noted. Loud noise damages these cells, which do not regenerate, and may cause permanent hearing loss. There are ways, however, to spot the warning signs of hearing loss. “The first people who are probably going to notice are going to be your friends and family, because you’ll be saying, ‘Huh, what?’ (and) missing a lot,” said Martin. “Another (sign) is something we call tinnitus — ringing in the ears.” WATCH: The full episode — Noisy Singapore? How noise pollution is affecting us (23:09) Tinnitus is often a sign of damage to the inner ear. And a hearing test is advised, he added. But besides thinking twice about pumping up the volume, what are some ways to deal with the noise around us that we cannot control? One novel solution being developed by Nanyang Technological University researchers is a prototype called an Anti-Noise Control Window, which promises to cut noise levels by at least 10 decibels. Microphones installed in small speakers on the window can pick up outside noise and reduce it by generating opposite sound waves. But the team still faces two main challenges: The speakers obstruct the view from the window, and they need to be a lot bigger to reduce noise in a space like an apartment. Lam Bhan, the assistant professor who developed the prototype along with other researchers, said the window is a “proof-of-principle prototype” and that they hope to solve the challenges within five to 10 years. In the meantime, there are alternative methods of dealing with noise pollution, as suggested by Ng Teng Fong General Hospital’s head of audiology, Gary Lee. He said sound can be used therapeutically to create “a sense of peace”, lower stress and even “evoke good memories”. Hence a white noise app playing pleasant sounds in the background, like the sounds of water or nature, can help. “You set it at a level that isn’t too loud — it doesn’t need to mask the annoying sounds. But it kind of fills the noise floor, and then subconsciously, it’d evoke pleasant feelings,” said the doctor. Air purifiers that emit neutral background noise can also help to “reduce the distinction between the noise floor and other trigger sounds that perhaps you have in your neighbourhood”. There is even a sound pillow, with a little speaker inside, that can be connected to a phone or compact disc player. “There are a lot of tools to help people make their homes filled with pleasant and soothing sounds,” said Lee.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/processed-meats-health-risks-luncheon-meat-bacon-sausage-2332881,"Luncheon meat, hotdogs: Here's how your favourite processed foods are really made","A show of hands if you enjoy Korean army stew piled high with sliced luncheon meat and hotdogs. Let’s have a count, too, if you can’t resist ordering salted egg and pickled mustard with congee for supper. Your favourite weekend activity is checking out the latest cafe for a brunch of bacon or sausages? Got it. It’s no secret we’ve all got a complicated relationship with processed meats. They’re either a guilty pleasure or our go-to comfort food. At the same time, we’ve been warned about eating too much of these items because of what they contain. For instance, what do they add to ham to make it look pink? How do they get the meat in hotdogs so finely minced and compacted, you can’t tell it’s meat? And do they really smoke bacon and beef jerky to create that smoky flavour? Just how dangerous are the additives used in these – and should you be worried about cancer in the long run?  CNA Lifestyle reached out to a dietitian and a gastrointestinal surgeon to find out more about what goes into some of our favourite foods.  LUNCHEON MEAT AND HOTDOGS As tasty as they are in your hotdog bun or between slices of bread, these items are actually made from the leftover bits found on chicken or pork bones.  After the valuable cuts (such as chicken breasts, thighs, drumsticks, pork loin and pork belly) have been removed, the carcass is forced through a high-pressure sieve to create a meat paste consisting of remnant meat, cartilage and other tissues. Yummy.  What follows is a cocktail of chemicals: Nitrates such as sodium nitrate to preserve as well as enhance flavour and colour, according to Jaclyn Reutens, a clinical and sports dietitian, and the founder of Aptima Nutrition and Sports Consultants.  Lactate and phosphate compounds may also be added to regulate acidity and provide further preservation. And finally, flavour enhancers such as MSG and dextrose to make the meat product tasty, she said.  The additives with the highest quantity used are typically listed first on the ingredient list, so that’s how you watch out for them, said Reutens.  “From a nutritional perspective, these foods are normally high in sodium and saturated fat, which can increase the risk of blood pressure and heart disease if consumed frequently,” she said. GROUND MEAT Yup, even supposedly “natural” food such as ground meat can be cause for suspicion. That tray of minced beef or pork looks pink and fresh for a reason – carbon monoxide or CO could be introduced under the plastic wrap to keep the meat from oxidising and turning brown.  As alarming as it sounds, CO-treated meats are safe for consumption, said Reutens, and “not associated with any health risks”.  “It is difficult to detect the use of carbon monoxide as it’s an odourless gas. But it should not matter because there is no risk posed to humans,” she said. MEAT PATTIES AND NUGGETS Back in 2012, 70 per cent of ground beef in the US was said to contain pink slime or, if you want to put it more delicately, finely textured meat. It is generally used as a filler by food manufacturers when making burger patties – or the chicken version of pink slime when manufacturing chicken patties and nuggets.  By 2013 though, pink slime use dropped to about 5 per cent – a significant reduction caused in part by the US media’s coverage of the additive.  What exactly is pink slime? It is made from cooking remnant bits of fatty meat to separate the fat from the meat. Gaseous ammonia is then added to “disinfect” the resulting pink meat product before it is flash-frozen and shipped to food manufacturers.  You might pick up on pink slime if you see “lean finely textured meat” on the ingredient list, said Reutens. “Apart from that, it is hard to tell.” But is it safe to eat pink slime? There is ammonia used after all. “It is not the most nutritious form of meat but it is safe to eat pink slime,” said Reutens.  “Ammonia is added to such meat products to prevent the growth of potentially harmful bacteria and pathogens,” said Reutens. This is, of course, different from the ammonia that we use to disinfect bathrooms and are “regarded as safe in small quantities by the US Food and Drug Administration”.   DELI MEATS SUCH AS HAM Viruses are not good news (think: COVID-19). So when you hear about spraying viruses onto ready-to-eat deli meats, alarms inadvertently go off in your head.  More accurately, the food industry uses bacteriophages or phages, which are viruses that infect and kill bacteria that cause food poisoning, such as salmonella, E coli, camphylobacter, listeria and pseudomonas, said Reutens. “Bacteriophages are safe for use on food. They only attack bacteria and are harmless to humans. If anything, they are protective,” she said.  Furthermore, you cannot tell if phages have been sprayed onto your ham, she added. BACON AND OTHER SMOKED MEATS That lovely smokiness you smell when you fry up bacon? It’s courtesy of the liquid smoke used to flavour it and other BBQ foods, said Reutens. Liquid smoke sounds like alchemy magic but according to Reutens, it is made by burning hickory or applewood chips or sawdust at high temperatures, then condensing the smoke into liquid. “Other ingredients like salt, molasses, vinegar and caramel colour can be added,” she said.  It is important that the liquid smoke is filtered twice, said Reutens, to remove cancer-causing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. “You probably cannot tell if liquid smoke is used,” she said. From the list above, you would already have a sense of what food additives do – and their functions aren’t just limited to processed meat. Food additives are needed to keep your bag of potato chips crisp. They play a role in sweetening and fortifying your orange juice with Vitamin C. They’re there to ensure the chilli sauce doesn’t come out of the bottle watery.  Additives let your chocolate melt in your mouth and not in your hand. They are the compounds that allow boba pearls to stay chewy, no matter how long they soak in the milk tea. So yes, as despised as food additives are by the health-conscious, they fulfil many functions.  As for regulatory measures, a spokesperson from the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) commented that ""source accreditation, random inspections and sample testing"" are in place. ""Checks are also done on processes across the entire supply chain from pre-import to sale."" To help consumers make informed choices, all prepacked food products have to carry a listing of all the ingredients and additives used, added the spokesperson. For the list of approved additives, you can check the SFA website. YES, FOOD ADDITIVES ARE GENERALLY SAFE BUT… From the medical standpoint, it can be difficult ""to prove that a certain additive causes cancer in humans"" as ""this is usually an epidemiological association, which can be influenced by other confounding factors"", said Dr Melvin Look, a general surgeon from PanAsia Surgery with an interest in gastrointestinal surgery. On the whole, it doesn't hurt to reduce the intake of processed foods as they typically contain high levels of salt, which has been linked to stomach cancer. “High salt levels damage the stomach lining and cause the cells to die,” said Dr Look.  This link between cancer and salt explains why people who eat more salt-preserved foods, such as the Chinese, Japanese and Koreans, have a greater chance of developing stomach cancer. Other risk factors include smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, a personal history of Helicobacter pylori infection, and a family history of stomach and gastrointestinal cancers, said Dr Look. While stomach cancer ranks low in Singapore (seventh among men and ninth among women, according to the National Registry of Diseases), it is showing up in younger patients. The high-risk group actually consists of individuals above age 45 and they’re predominantly male, said Dr Look.  “Studies have found that people who consume large amounts of pickled vegetables and foods have about a 50 per cent increased risk of gastric cancer compared to those who consume them minimally,” said Dr Look. Your diet should not be saltier than an auntie who missed out on a supermarket discount. But as you can already guess, Singaporeans salt their food way too liberally. For comparison, the recommended daily intake of salt is less than 5g a day or just one teaspoon full. However, the average adult in Singapore consumes about 8.3g of salt daily – more than 60 per cent above the recommended level, according to the 2010 National Nutrition Survey.  WHAT OTHER ADDITIVES COULD LEAD TO CANCER? Processed meat such as bacon, sausages, ham and hot dogs typically use nitrates and nitrites as preservatives. They are the chemicals that keep these meat products looking pink and fresh instead of brown and old.  Interestingly, nitrates and nitrites can be found naturally in vegetables such as spinach, lettuce, celery, carrots, radish and beets. And they are actually advantageous for cardiovascular health and immunity, according to Dr Look. But when nitrates and nitrites are used as preservatives in processed meat such as bacon and sausages, it’s a different story altogether. “Ingested nitrates can be converted into nitrites by the bacteria in our mouth,” explained Dr Look.  When these nitrites enter the acidic environment of the stomach, along with the amines found in protein-rich meat, they become harmful nitrosamines, he said. Sometimes, nitrites can directly transform into nitrosamines without entering our mouths, such as during high-heat cooking. And it is these nitrosamines that play a role in stomach cancer.   “Besides stomach cancer, nitrates and nitrites play a role in increasing the risk of colorectal cancer as well,” said Dr Look. “It has been estimated that the risk of colorectal cancer increases by 18 per cent per 50g of processed meat intake per day.” Pickling, which uses salt to preserve food, can also produce carcinogenic compounds such as nitrosamines. “Studies have found that people who consume large amounts of pickled vegetables and foods have an approximately 50 per cent increased risk of gastric cancer compared to those who consume this minimally,” cited Dr Look.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/binge-drinking-young-adults-singapore-health-survey-2338061,Binge drinking can put a person at risk of developing future alcohol dependency: Experts,"SINGAPORE: Up until a year ago, Andrew (not his real name) would go out drinking with friends at least four days a week. “I was drinking pretty much every Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday,” said the 28-year-old, adding that he would have between four and six drinks at each session. The turning point for him, he said, was when he noticed that his body was not tolerating alcohol changes as well as before. “I started to realise that my body couldn’t take the alcohol and break it down as quickly as compared to before. I wasn’t recovering as quickly as I used to the next day,” he said. These days, Andrew has decreased the frequency of his drinking sessions to once every two months. But he has never considered himself to be a binge drinker, even though his previous drinking habits fall within the definition of one, according to a recent survey by the Ministry of Health (MOH). Binge drinking is defined as five or more alcoholic drinks for men and four or more alcoholic drinks for women in a session. “For me, even though I was drinking quite regularly in the past, it was for a social reason and not for the sake of drinking. It was an activity I did with friends,” said Andrew. “I would think that binge drinking is like forcing yourself to drink, but I never did that.” Published on Nov 18, MOH's annual National Population Health Survey 2020 found that binge drinking is becoming more common in Singapore, particularly among men and younger adults. The survey also found that younger adults in the 18 to 39 years age group were more likely to binge drink compared to other age groups. Despite this, young adults CNA spoke to said they did not consider themselves binge drinkers, even though they typically consume at least four drinks in each session. “I don't think four drinks is over the limit. I think binge drinking is perhaps when you have maybe 10 glasses in a single session,” said Kelly (not her real name). “Personally, I pace myself well. So if I have four or five drinks a night, this would be across a five-hour social gathering or session, which I think is quite reasonable,” said the 28-year-old. For 29-year-old David (not his real name), who drinks less than twice a week, what constitutes binge drinking is more about the mindset than numbers. “I don't think it’s fair to assign a number to binge drinking and it’s not a good gauge because there are many factors at play, including gender and size,” he said. “I have some bosses who at 4pm every day say ‘I need a drink’. Whereas some people may drink a lot in one sitting during a celebration or special event but don’t really see the need to drink that often,” he added. “So in this case, I would think those who drink at more frequent intervals than those who drink a lot in one sitting would be considered binge drinkers.” MOH's survey results came amid a global rise in ""pandemic drinking"", with studies finding more people turning to booze to cope with the toll COVID-19 has taken on mental health and addiction. In the US, a survey conducted by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, published in December last year, found that 60 per cent of its more than 800 respondents were drinking more during the pandemic. In MOH's survey, 10.5 per cent of respondents said they had a habit of binge drinking, up from 8.8 per cent in 2017. The ministry said it will continue efforts to reduce binge drinking, largely by raising awareness in schools and collaborating with government agencies to include messages on responsible drinking. Dr Victor Lee, a general surgeon at Mount Elizabeth Hospital’s digestive and liver surgery department, said there appeared to be two distinct groups of binge drinkers in Singapore – infrequent and frequent binge drinkers. The infrequent binge drinkers were more likely to be younger and unmarried. They also had higher educational levels and higher incomes, said Dr Lee. Those who were frequent binge drinkers were older, had lower educational levels and lower incomes. Interventions against binge drinking can, thus, be targeted at different socio-economic profiles to be more effective, he said. “Policy decisions and health education are probably the more effective strategies in curbing binge drinking. Increased alcohol taxation may have limited impact as this strategy may not impact the higher income infrequent binge drinkers.” While having a drink or two with friends can be considered recreational drinking, experts CNA spoke to said binge drinking can put a person at risk of developing future alcohol dependency. Dr Adrian Wang, a consultant psychiatrist at Gleneagles Medical Centre, said this can lead to problems such as memory loss, irrational and impulsive behaviour, accidents and injuries, and loss of consciousness. “I have seen patients who binge drink and then get into fights – for example with taxi drivers because they are too intoxicated to pay their fare – misplace their mobile phones and wallets, and even engage in risky sex,” he said. Repeated binge drinking may also be an early warning sign of someone who is unable to moderate their alcohol intake, said Dr Guo Song, a senior consultant at the Institute of Mental Health’s National Addictions Management Service (NAMS). “Although there is no immediate risk for alcohol use disorder, binge episodes can gradually increase until alcohol is consumed or required on a daily basis, and the individual thereby develops an alcohol use disorder over a period of time,” he said. He added that signs of alcohol use disorder include a strong and continuing compulsion to drink in order to ""feel the buzz"" as well as giving up or reducing important social, occupational or recreational activities. Responding to queries from CNA, NAMS said it has not seen a significant increase in the number of alcohol addiction cases during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it noted that stocking up on alcohol at home and ordering alcohol deliveries have become more commonplace amid dine-in restrictions. “Increased accessibility to alcohol at home, unusual pressures in relation to the pandemic and a lack of social outlets may lead to higher risk of developing alcohol use disorder,” said Dr Guo. ""Habitual drinking may occur as a convenient but maladaptive method of coping with stressors, and a substitute for healthy social activities which includes exercise and hobbies,” he added. Ultimately, experts say drinking alcohol should be done in moderation. Dr Lee suggested limiting alcohol to two drinks a day for men and one a day for women. “Younger adults are not less susceptible to alcohol-related diseases, as the health effects are largely dose-dependent,” he said, adding that increased consumption can increase the risk of alcohol-related diseases.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/endometriosis-womens-health-cramps-pain-diagnosis-2334906,Commentary: Endometriosis - better understanding of pain descriptors result in faster diagnosis,"BIRMINGHAM: Though endometriosis affects an estimated one in 10 women of reproductive age, most women with the condition visit a GP over 10 times before being referred to specialist care for a diagnosis. This can mean an average wait of eight years to receive a diagnosis. Given the chronic pelvic pain that endometriosis causes – which can sometimes be incapacitating – this delay can severely impact sufferers' physical, social and mental health. While a key cause of this delay is the dismissal and normalisation of women’s pain, another cause may be the challenge of adequately communicating how it feels – which is something our latest study explored. We found that both women and doctors find current tools for communicating endometriosis pain inadequate. We also found that some of the language women used to articulate their pain wasn’t recognised by GPs. This miscommunication could mean many women aren’t getting the diagnosis or treatment they need – or may be waiting longer than necessary for it. To conduct our study, we first surveyed 131 women with endometriosis. We asked them about the difficulties they faced talking about their pain with doctors prior to being diagnosed and how they describe their pain. Many women reported that the numeric rating scales (zero being no pain and severe pain being a 10) commonly used in consultation didn’t accurately capture the severity and impact of their pain on their day-to-day lives. Some expressed the need for linguistic or visual tools, with one participant stating: “I did not associate what I was feeling as ‘pain.’ I needed to see a list of feelings … like burning, dragging, squeezing.” Women also reported feeling unheard when they tried to describe their symptoms in consultations. They often felt rushed or discouraged from talking and some felt intimidated. This not only posed challenges for effectively communicating their pain to their GP, it also made women feel their pain was being dismissed. Research shows that this kind of invalidation by health professionals is associated with lower self-esteem and depression in patients with endometriosis. Our research also revealed that many women use metaphors and similes to describe their pain. The most common metaphors were those that invoke violence. For example, a recurrent metaphor women used to describe their pain was “as if somebody is repeatedly stabbing me with a large knife”. Other common metaphors compared pain to heat – “like having a hot poker planted inside your stomach” – or pressure, describing it as having “a balloon inside me pushing on everything”. While these metaphorical expressions aren’t typically used by GPs to diagnose endometriosis, the language still gives a good indication of the type and intensity of the pain being experienced. We also conducted interviews with 11 GPs, asking how they assess suspected endometriosis pain and how their patients talk about such symptoms. We then presented them with the metaphors that women commonly used to describe their endometriosis pain. Three of the GPs we spoke to reported they wouldn’t initially suspect endometriosis if women used these common metaphors and similes. Some of the expressions such as those including or suggesting words like stabbing or burning were also more likely to make the GPs suspect nerve pain or an infection rather than endometriosis, which they would want to investigate first. One GP also said that they would associate “more of crampy type pain” with endometriosis, as opposed to the words women used to describe their sensations. While most GPs reported using the numeric rating scales in their diagnoses, many also felt it was an insufficient tool for assessing pain on its own. Instead, they reported using the scale along with questions about how the pain impacts a patient’s life, as well as the location, frequency, duration and quality of the pain. Most of the GPs, however, did identify these metaphors as indicative of possible endometriosis – even recognising them as ones they often hear from patients with the condition. Some GPs also found use of metaphors and similes helpful in their investigations – even saying it can help patients describe their symptoms when they’re struggling to find the words. Research with UK GPs has also shown that endometriosis is challenging to diagnose because symptoms resemble those of other conditions they seek to rule out first. We know that when physicians use metaphors, it can improve communication with seriously ill patients. And other research shows that when healthcare providers know the common metaphors used by chronic pain sufferers, it can make them less likely to dismiss or misunderstand a patient’s symptoms. This is why improving GPs’ knowledge of pain metaphors commonly used by women with endometriosis could increase the likelihood that their pain will be understood and believed, which is central to improving diagnostic times. Our study shows that new and different ways of communicating endometriosis pain to doctors is needed to improve how quickly a patient is diagnosed. Metaphor, simile and other creative ways of communicating might be one way of doing this, as shown by our research. Pain is subjective. This is why communicating endometriosis pain is such a challenge. We know from our research and other studies that metaphors and similes are a useful tool for pain sufferers in describing these internal experiences. The key now will be making sure GPs know how to recognise the common language women use to communicate their endometriosis pain so more can benefit from a diagnosis.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/covid-19-vaccination-children-under-12-singapore-risks-pfizer-2334041,Commentary: Parental concerns brewing ahead of approval for COVID-19 vaccinations for kids under 12,"SINGAPORE: Parents in Singapore with kids aged five to 11 will have to make a big decision very soon. The Health Ministry’s director of medical services Kenneth Mak said on Saturday (Nov 20) that Singapore hopes to extend COVID-19 vaccines for children aged five to 11 from January 2022, pending the recommendation of the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination. As a mother, I can understand the conflicts and concerns that parents have. Choosing to get that jab for our young ones just doesn’t seem straightforward. On one hand, we celebrate that a vaccine is finally available for children as we know mass vaccination of the world population is our ticket out of the pandemic. Most of Singapore’s eligible population have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. And we are fortunate many effective COVID-19 vaccines have been produced and authorised for use in record time, and made available to us in Singapore. Many countries, especially in less developed countries, still have issues accessing these life-saving vaccines. Many countries have also launched successful vaccination campaigns, including for adolescents after published clinical trial data demonstrated vaccine efficacy at preventing symptomatic infection in children aged 12 to 15.  Several also rolled out or recommended vaccinating younger age groups or are currently deliberating it. In the United States, more than 2.6 million children between five to 11 have already received their first dose. Parents in Singapore who may have eagerly taken their own shots didn’t seem to hesitate when vaccinating their children above 12 years of age. As of Nov 23, 85 per cent of our total population are fully vaccinated - one of the highest worldwide - especially with about 90 per cent among youths and young adults. Will we do the same with younger children when the time comes? On the other hand, many parents can’t help but wonder whether the vaccine is safe. With no long-term data on the effects of vaccines, parents are concerned about possible side effects.  These are unknowns that can only be addressed after real-world vaccination programmes are established. These are known as Phase 4 data used in all medicines and vaccines developed previously. Besides allergic reactions which manifest within the study period, there is particular concern about the increased risk of myocarditis or pericarditis. To date, the incidence of myocarditis appears to be higher in adolescent and young adult males.  But Singapore data has shown low rates of serious adverse events – about 0.006 per cent of almost 10 million doses administered as of Oct 31 according to the Health Sciences Authority. Parents might also have to contend with the practical challenge of limiting young energetic children’s activities and physical movements for two weeks after vaccination – not an easy feat. On top of that, younger children will naturally be afraid of vaccination and needles. Parents may find it more difficult to manage children who have yet to reach the maturity to understand the need and rationale for the vaccine. But parents are also savvy enough not to think of risks in isolation. Are the benefits of vaccination worth its risks? Don’t children have a lower risk of developing severe disease? In high Human Development Index (HDI) countries, the risk of severe COVID-19 in children and adolescents is low, with a mortality of 1 to 2 per million population – or similar to seasonal influenza, which we provide to children older than six months.  But it would be oversimplified to say children can get infected with little consequence. Risk of severe disease depends on individual risk factors. Within the paediatric age group, apart from infants, the greatest risk factor for severe COVID-19 or death is underlying medical conditions including obesity, chronic lung disease and neurologic disease.  Specifically, among adolescents hospitalised for COVID-19 in the US, 70.6 per cent had at least one underlying medical condition. Vaccinating children who are vulnerable and with underlying medical conditions will certainly help reduce their own risk of severe illness and deaths. Another major concern is the multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) linked to COVID-19, as well as the risk of long-COVID.  Singapore has recently experienced its second wave of COVID-19, and children have not been spared from infection, with at least 1,732 cases in children below 12 from Nov 9 to 15. However, there are low numbers of children who require oxygen, intensive care or intubation. It is fortunate no child or adolescent in Singapore has died due to COVID-19 to date.  Vaccinating children helps to reduce the possibility of symptomatic disease - as the vaccine has high efficacy of 90.7 per cent - and assuage parents’ anxieties about children’s participation in schools, extra-curricular activities and after-school activities like tuition.  It can lower the extent of transmission as well as the possibility of infection for both adults and children. Isolating young children alone for home recovery will be challenging and a caregiver will need to be available.  Reducing infection in children can also reduce the risks of them infecting their grandparents or parents who are unable to take the vaccines due to other underlying conditions like cancer treatment or severe allergies. In a way, Singapore and many parents have already adopted a cocoon strategy to protect our little ones – parents, older siblings, childcare teachers, pregnant women as well as lactating women are getting vaccinated.  Studies conducted at the National University Hospital have shown vaccinated mothers transfer protective antibody to their babies during pregnancy as well as after delivery through breastmilk. In COVID-19 infected mothers, vaccination also reduces the risks of some pregnancy complications, and of mother-to-baby transmission during pregnancy, at or after delivery. A recent United Kingdom study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal also found that vaccination helps to reduce household transmission of the Delta variant, allows quicker clearance of infections, and shortens the duration of viral shedding which reduces exposure for children in the household. Parents can also consider vaccinating the most vulnerable children first, such as those with underlying respiratory and cardiac issues, immunocompromised children, and certainly children of healthcare professionals or frontliners. It is also worth vaccinating children living with immunocompromised household members at higher risk of life-threatening COVID-19. Parents whose children have yet to complete their basic childhood immunisation due to disruptions like last year’s circuit breaker should complete them first.  Only then will they be able to make sound decisions to protect their families and give our children a chance to return to the playgrounds and group activities.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/save-your-knees-running-workout-exercise-2326761,Does running ruin the knees? How to save your joints without giving up your workout,"In the annals of unsolicited advice, few nuggets have been dispensed as widely and with less supporting evidence than this: “If you keep doing all that running, you’re going to ruin your knees.” The latest salvo in the debate over knees and running – a systematic review of 43 previous MRI studies that finds no evidence that running causes either short-term or long-term damage to knee cartilage – is unlikely to convince the opinionated ex-football star at your Thanksgiving table who swears his bum knee was caused by wind sprints. But given that nearly half of Americans are expected to develop painful knee osteoarthritis at some point during their lives, the findings do raise a nagging question: If abstaining from running won’t magically protect your knees, what will? FEED THE CARTILAGE Researchers have lately begun to rethink long-held dogmas about the properties of cartilage, the smooth layer of tissue that cushions the bones of the knee and other joints and whose breakdown is the primary cause of osteoarthritis. “Since cartilage doesn’t have a blood or nerve supply, we used to think it couldn’t adapt or repair itself,” said Michaela Khan, a doctoral researcher at the University of British Columbia and the lead author of the new review on running and cartilage, which was published in the journal Sports Medicine. But that’s not the case. Cyclic weight-bearing activities like walking and – wait for it – running squeeze the cartilage in the knee joint like a sponge, expelling waste and then drawing in a fresh supply of nutrient- and oxygen-rich fluid with each step. Instead of an inert shock-absorber doomed to get brittle and eventually fail with age, Ms. Khan said, cartilage is a living tissue that adapts and thrives with regular use. That explains why, for example, in a small study from 2010, non-runners who followed a 10-week running program saw a 1.9 per cent improvement in a marker of cartilage strength and quality. It also helps explain why swapping one form of exercise for another at the first sign of knee pain may be counterproductive. People with incipient knee problems often switch to low-impact activities like swimming and cycling because they believe it will protect their joints, said Jackie Whittaker, a physical therapist and arthritis researcher also at the University of British Columbia, “but actually what they’re doing is starving the cartilage”. GO SHORT AND FREQUENT Still, there’s a limit to how quickly the joint can adapt to unfamiliar stresses. Jean-François Esculier, head of research for The Running Clinic and Kahn’s co-author, suggested that knee pain that persists for more than an hour after exercise, or that shows up the morning after a workout, is a sign that the joint was overloaded. That doesn’t mean you need to stop exercising, he said, but that you should adjust what you’re doing. Consider shorter and more frequent workouts. According to Keith Baar, a physiologist at the University of California, Davis, who studies the molecular properties of cartilage and other connective tissues, the cells in cartilage respond positively to exercise for about 10 minutes. After that, you’re just accumulating more stress and damage in the tissue with no further adaptive benefits. So, if a weekly two-hour tennis marathon leaves you with aching knees, you might try swapping it out for one-hour sessions twice a week. BEWARE THE WEEKEND WARRIOR EFFECT Of course, no workout takes place in a vacuum: What your knees can handle today depends on what you’ve been doing with them over the preceding weeks and months. That’s why the arrival of ski season is a source of predictable carnage for physical therapists, as enthusiastic weekend warriors hit the slopes after months of inactivity. Dr Whittaker suggested taking the first day on the slopes easy and being willing to cut subsequent days short when it feels like your leg muscles or joints have had enough. “It’s pacing,” she said. “It’s adapting to the capacity of your body to handle the load.” Better yet, she strongly suggested doing some strength training to prepare your legs before putting any new stresses on them. A simple, generic programme of squats and lunges can strengthen the muscles that keep the knee stable and stiffen the tendons and ligaments around the joint. For starters, aim for three sets of 10 to 15 repetitions, lifting a weight that leaves you with shaky muscles and the feeling that you could have done two or three more reps if necessary. STAY OUT OF THE ER As it turns out, the most serious long-term risk from activities like skiing isn’t the prolonged squatting. Instead, it’s traumatic knee injuries like a torn ACL, which in roughly half of cases will lead to osteoarthritis within five to 15 years. That’s partly because of lingering damage or instability in the joint, but also because people tend to be less active and consequently gain weight even after the knee heals. In fact, according to one study, the higher risk of knee osteoarthritis observed among former elite athletes in sports such as soccer is largely explained by a history of traumatic knee injury rather than by accumulated wear and tear. Fortunately, the risk of acute knee injuries can be cut in half by implementing a so-called “neuromuscular” training program, said Ewa Roos, an osteoarthritis researcher at the University of Southern Denmark. Specific exercises tailored to each sport promote good movement patterns that keep your joints stable, and they can be performed either on their own for 15 minutes three times a week, or as a pre-workout warm-up. Dr Roos recommends the website fittoplay.org, hosted by the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center in Norway, which offers detailed neuromuscular programs for more than 50 sports. Alpine skiing, for example, starts with exercises such as bodyweight squats, weight shifts, Bosu tucks and forward jumps, then progresses to more challenging ones. OPTIMISE YOUR MOVEMENT PATTERNS For athletes, the benefits of such preventive programs are clear. For the average person with – for now – no knee pain, it’s more debatable. “It’s also a philosophical question,” Dr Roos said: There’s a risk of over-medicalising life by spending all your energy trying to prevent problems that haven’t yet happened. But there are some relatively unobtrusive ways of tilting the odds in your favor, even if you’re currently healthy. Dr. Roos suggested focusing on high-quality movement patterns during day-to-day activities like getting up from a chair: Use both feet and no hands, and keep the knee and hip aligned over the foot. Apply similar focus to climbing stairs and sitting down on the toilet; if you can’t keep the joints aligned, that’s a sign you need to strengthen your leg and hip muscles. DON’T SEEK SALVATION IN A BOTTLE There’s no high-quality evidence that supplements, including glucosamine and chondroitin, make any difference, according to both Dr Roos and Dr Whittaker – though they don’t appear to be harmful either. “If you’re OK paying for it, and you want to take it because you think it’s doing something to preserve your joint, not a problem,” Dr Whittaker said. “But in addition, can you please also be doing some cyclical weight-bearing activity and so on?” There is one intriguing possible exception. A small 2011 study by researchers at Tufts Medical Center found that cartilage quality in the knee improved after six months of taking 10g of collagen daily. More recently, Dr Baar’s research on lab-grown ligaments, which, like cartilage, are primarily made of collagen, also supports the idea that consuming collagen before exercise can trigger new collagen synthesis in the body. But for now, the real-world benefits of this approach remain unproven. To Dr Whittaker, the most important priority remains debunking the notion that you should stop being active as soon as you notice knee pain. Staying active, strengthening the muscles around the joint and developing good movement patterns can alter, and in some cases reverse, the trajectory, she said. “A lot of people think that osteoarthritis is just a normal consequence of aging, right? It’s not inevitable. There’s a lot you can control.” By Alex Hutchinson © The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/dominique-low-brain-aneurysm-stroke-recovery-2321871,She had two brain aneurysms and a stroke in a year: One woman's journey to recovery,"Sitting across from Dominique Low, you would never suspect that little more than a year ago, she was fighting for her life in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Tan Tock Seng Hospital.  To this day, the founder of Wanderlust Brand Communications has little recollection of what happened that fateful day in August 2020.  “I was in the bathroom and one of my cats had followed me in. The next thing I knew, I saw stars and collapsed onto the floor. And when I came to, it was to my cat’s yelping. I recall it being really loud and he was jumping on me, so I think he knew something was wrong,” the 49-year-old recounted. Somehow, Low managed to open the bathroom door, where her partner saw that she had a huge bump on her head where she hit the floor. “I managed to look in the mirror and realised that my arms kept shaking and I was still seeing stars, so he rushed me to the hospital, which turned to be an extremely good thing.” Even Low’s partner, 47-year-old Greg Rawson, who co-owns the consultancy, had no idea how bad the situation was as she was still able to ask questions and give instructions during the car ride.  A RUPTURED BRAIN ANEURYSM At the hospital, Low was sent for a CT scan and the doctors told Rawson that Low had a ruptured brain aneurysm – and that it would have to be treated immediately.  An aneurysm is a bulge in the blood vessel that can result from a weak blood vessel wall. This causes pressure to build up as blood passes through, causing the vessel to expand outwards like a balloon.  The heart and brain are the most common places for it to occur. In the brain, it can cause bleeding that can lead to haemorrhagic stroke, or worse, death. Low was then whisked into surgery. Upon cutting into the area, the doctor found another aneurysm, just next to the one that had ruptured, which hadn’t come up in the scan.  The surgery took six hours, and for it, Low said that they had to shave her hair and cut through a muscle membrane to get to the aneurysm.  “The muscle membrane is elastic, so after they cut through it, it kind of collapsed,” Low explained as she showed me the slight depression near her temple.  Once out of the operating theatre and in the ICU, Low said she was doing fine at first, although she doesn’t remember much of her days there.  “I think I was only consciously present in the later part of my recovery, but in-between, I was definitely in and out,” she said. A SUDDEN STROKE WHILE IN ICU But one week after the surgery, Low found herself back in the operating theatre fighting for her life once more.  “One of the side effects of any brain surgery is that the patient could suffer from a haemorrhagic stroke (where blood from an artery begins to bleed into the brain after a blood vessel bursts).” The result: The left side of Low’s face started to droop. Low said she was fortunate because the nurses checked on her hourly and caught the stroke in time, and were able to rush her back into the operating theatre. “My doctor managed to pump some medication directly into my brain to stop the stroke. But the downside was that things became challenging for Low again. “I had heard that patients who have had brain aneurysms but didn’t get haemorrhagic strokes would have a slightly better recovery process.” THE REAL RECOVERY PROCESS After a month in the hospital, Low was moved to Thye Hua Kwan Hospital in Ang Mo Kio for her rehabilitation and recovery.  And she had her work cut out for her.  The combination of two brain aneurysms and a stroke had left her unable to function as she had done before.  “Because of the stroke, my right leg couldn’t move properly so I couldn’t walk normally. And on my left side, I was unable to balance well. So I couldn’t even take a step. I always felt like I was going to fall,” she recalled.  To help her get back on her feet, literally, Low had a busy schedule at the rehabilitation centre. “I had to do different kinds of physical therapy, which included walking and going up and down steps. I had to do simple Pilates or yoga exercises that I followed on-screen. I also had to work on my coordination through ball throwing exercises, and there were mental exercises that involved matching type games on the iPad.  “The one thing I remembered most clearly during my time was that I was very tired.”  Through it all, Low said that even though the nurses, doctors and even Rawson would tell her what she had gone through, she never fully understood it, until one day, when one of the doctors came in to check on her.  “She was telling me what had happened and then all of a sudden, I understood, and I went quiet. It’s funny because it was not like people were trying to hide the situation from me, but I guess I didn’t understand the significance till that day.” “I STILL DON’T KNOW WHY IT HAPPENED” Low said she hasn’t been able to figure out why the brain aneurysms happened, although her doctor told her that stress can play a big part, and that women tend to have a higher risk of getting it. “I run my own company, and I remember I was juggling a few projects back then, and also taking care of some new businesses that were coming in. But I wouldn’t say I was overly stressed, so I’m not really sure how it all happened.” The avid adventure sports enthusiast suspects that her less than healthy lifestyle – going to bed in the early hours of the morning after rushing to meet deadlines – her constant indulgence in desserts and an increasingly sedentary lifestyle because of the pandemic, might have contributed to it.  “I used to go on mountaineering expeditions – I’ve been up Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa, Mount Kinabalu in Malaysia and even to Everest base camp. We’ve been taught to believe that if you lead a healthy-ish and somewhat active lifestyle, something like this wouldn’t happen to you. But it can.” She said the saddest part of the whole experience is that she’s now unable to do anymore expeditions. Her doctor has advised her against it as it’s unclear how her brain will be affected by high altitudes of 2,000m and above.  “My doctor said no high-elevation trekking for now,” she said, explaining that another brain aneurysm could happen. “Although, I can get on a plane and fly.” SUPPORT FROM FRIENDS AROUND THE WORLD Besides the doctors and therapists, Low also credits her support system of friends for helping her to pull through.  “One of my friends started a group chat, and every now and then, Greg would send updates to them. I can’t recall how many people there were in the chat, but I know that there were folks from all over, from school friends to business friends and even former colleagues.  “I was really touched when I read their messages. I didn’t know so many people cared.”  Low also shared that she had friends visiting her from November 2020, when she felt ready to receive guests, and that “the visits really boosted my morale”. Some friends also started fundraising campaigns to help with living expenses because Low and Rawson could not work as much.  WORKING HARD ON HER RECOVERY Low’s true and steady champion throughout has been her partner of 10 years, Rawson. “I keep forgetting that he was also stressed by what had happened. To be honest, I’m not sure if I could do as good a job as he did if the roles were reversed.” Rawson played the role of caregiver, coach, teacher and parent during Low’s year of recovery.  “He would write out daily schedules and I would have to follow them. The doctors and therapists would set me assignments, and he made sure that I followed them.” These included daily walks at the sky garden where they stay, reading and mental exercises.  According to Low, Rawson even wrote stories for her to read along, with 10 questions she had to answer about it. “These stories had dates and numbers and details that I had to remember because it was supposed to help with my short-term memory; it was so tricky.” Low said her short-term memory and vocabulary were affected after the incident, especially during the early months of her recovery, where she struggled even to remember how to construct a simple sentence.  “For instance, if I wanted Greg to move a cushion on the sofa, I was unable to find the words to describe it or the action. I would go, ‘You see that thing, you need to push it’ instead.”  Even reading was difficult. “I could make out the words, like how to pronounce them, but I couldn’t make out what they meant, so I had to read them a few times to be able to understand what the sentence meant.” It was these little things that Low said made her worry initially because she wondered when she would fully recover.  “In the beginning, everything was difficult. I was really worried how I would recover and when I would recover because I didn’t know how long it would take.  “Unlike a physical injury, like breaking an ankle (which coincidentally Low did in 2018 while she was climbing Mount Rinjani in Indonesia) where you can see how it is healing; when it is something like the brain, you have no clue how it’s doing.” And you know what they say about things happening in threes? Low almost suffered yet another setback earlier in 2021, when her doctor found excess liquid building up inside her brain, which is another side effect of brain surgery.  “He gave me a month to try to reduce the amount of liquid, because if it didn’t, I would have to undergo another surgery where he would have to put a shunt inside, which would be connected to my stomach. And I thought, ‘Oh my god, I don’t want to go through all that’.” Low was told there were things she could do. “He told me to keep my circulation going, which meant I had to keep active. So I focused on that. I went for walks every day from my place in Toa Payoh to MacRitchie Reservoir, I did Pilates workouts at home, and thankfully, it all helped.” Her efforts paid off because by the end of the month when she went back for her follow-up, the amount of liquid had reduced. GETTING THE ALL-CLEAR ON HER HEALTH To check that she had fully recovered, Low had to undergo a four-hour face-to-face test with a clinical psychologist to assess if her cognitive abilities had returned to her pre-aneurysm days.  “It’s a test that will be on your record because it is evidence that your brain is functioning normally, or as normally as it had.  “And here’s the scary part, you can only take this test one time.” Low explained that it was mainly IQ-related, and included puzzles, drawings, arithmetic and even listening comprehension.  The good news: Low passed.  “Generally, the doctors say that I’m fully functional, about 98 per cent back to my pre-incident self. That missing 2 per cent, I can feel it. But I hope with time, I’ll get back to the person I was. “This brain aneurysm, it’s a mystery. You don’t know when it’s coming. I’ve heard that some people try to prepare themselves for it by going for scans, so if there’s one coming up, they can get it treated. But how many of us would do that?”  Today, Low is back in the swing of things. For Christmas last year, she even cooked a dish and baked two cakes – although she said she had trouble following the recipe because she kept forgetting the steps. “I would look at what needed to be done, then forget it the moment I stepped away. So I had to keep going back to check the recipes, but I did it. It took two days but I pushed through,” Low declared proudly.  She’s even started work again at her brand agency. In March, she embarked on her first project after her incident, with a digital marketing agency, helping with their brand and content strategies. Only one person on the team knew what she had gone through.  “It was a good exercise for me. I found that my brain was working a little differently from before, and that it took me longer to get to where I wanted to go, like when I was doing certain tasks, so I had to get used to that and slowly refine my methods over the months.” Asked if there were moments during her recovery journey that she felt like giving up, Low said the thought never crossed her mind.  She credits her strong “can do” attitude for this. “I’ve always tried to be more of a ‘can do’ person. And sometimes, I do fail, but it’s okay because it’s still an experience. You push through and do you best, whatever the outcome might be.”  What is her biggest takeaway from all this?  “I felt really stupid in the beginning. I had to try to remember the simplest things, like how to make a cup of coffee. It was not difficult, but I realised that things that used to come so naturally, required more effort now.  “But that said, I’m grateful for all the good things that have happened. Despite this incident, I feel more positive, and choose to focus on what I have instead of what I don’t have. I also focused on my recovery, what I went through and that I survived. I’m still shocked and amazed.  “It also made me realise not to take things for granted, and to make more of an effort to keep in touch with my loved ones. And if there is an opportunity to care for someone, I should reach out more.” CNA Women is a section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/psychologists-treat-chronic-pain-no-medication-2318421,Struggling with chronic pain? Here's how psychologists can help,"Over the past two decades, as the opioid crisis has shaken the public’s view of painkillers and pharmaceutical companies have come under fire for their marketing practices, many patients are looking for alternatives. One of the leading contenders has become treating pain with talk therapy. Psychologists, therapists and social workers have quietly become a crucial part of pain treatment programs, proving to be as effective or more so than medication. In 2018, the medical journal The Lancet went so far as to recommend education and psychological treatment as first-line interventions for chronic low back pain, before pharmacological treatment. A spokesman for the American Psychological Association said they have only recently started tracking pain psychology and in 2021 found that nearly 40 percent of its members report their patients frequently have chronic pain. The organization is currently drafting guidelines for chronic pain treatment, a sign, according to Lynn Bufka, a Maryland psychologist and a senior director at the A.P.A., that it’s an important and growing field with science-based solutions. Still, finding the right pain counselling can take a bit of effort on the part of the patient. Here are a few things to consider before you get started. WHAT DOES A PAIN PSYCHOLOGIST DO? Many pain psychologists treat chronic pain with cognitive behaviour therapy, or C.B.T., which focuses on reframing thoughts to positively affect behaviour and emotions, or mindfulness, which involves learning to become conscious of feelings without reacting to them. Acceptance and commitment therapy combines mindfulness and C.B.T. to help patients accept their emotions and respond to them. Another method psychologists use to treat pain is biofeedback, which monitors a person’s muscle tension, heart rate, brain activity or other functions in real time to make patients aware of their stress and learn to control it. Lastly, some clinicians use hypnosis, which can be effective at managing pain for some people. What unifies all these treatments is a focus on teaching patients how they can use their minds to manage their pain. HOW DO YOU FIND A PAIN PSYCHOLOGIST? Finding a pain psychologist can be tough. Large medical centres and boutique practices are more likely to have comprehensive pain treatment but also tend to be in urban areas. People in rural areas or those who can’t afford the services get left out, said Rachel Aaron, an assistant professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Johns Hopkins Medicine. But even in urban areas, not all large medical networks have pain services. “It’s definitely a challenge to get from the initial pain diagnosis to psychological care no matter what system you’re in,” said Dr. Aaron. There are no specific certifications for pain management therapists, said Eric Garland, director of the Centre on Mindfulness and Integrative Health Intervention Development at the University of Utah, nor does the American Psychological Association track their numbers. But most experts agree there is a shortage of pain-focused psychologists, just as with other mental health professionals. If you are interested in trying a pain therapist, Dr. Aaron said, the first stop is your primary care doctor. Some insurance plans cover pain psychology, but others do not. It’s important to talk to a mental health provider first about how to get treatment covered. After that, look for specialized pain clinics by calling hospitals in your area or use the Find a Therapist function on the Psychology Today website. Search for a provider who either treats your specific condition, be it fibromyalgia or migraines, or who treats chronic pain more broadly, a specialty often referred to as behavioural medicine or health psychology. There are also online programs that are evidence-based and freely available; Dr. Aaron recommends PainTRAINER and Pain Course. Some experts recommend working with licensed professionals with doctorates or master’s degrees in psychology or clinical social work with additional training in chronic pain, and to interview them about their training and approach before getting started. “If they can’t give a clear answer on their approach or how they would treat your specific pain issue, they probably don’t have good training,” Dr. Garland said. Most importantly, you should feel comfortable enough to open up with them. WHAT SHOULD YOU EXPECT? Most pain therapy programs start with six to eight weekly sessions, said Fadel Zeidan, an associate professor of anaesthesiology and executive director at the Centre for Mindfulness at the University of California, San Diego. Often the first session is an evaluation to learn about the pain problem and the emotional issues it may be causing. You might then learn mindfulness techniques to separate the physical and emotional aspects of pain, train yourself to reframe negative thought patterns or practice paying more attention to pleasant sensations. One recent paper in JAMA Psychiatry found that two-thirds of chronic back pain patients who underwent four weeks of psychological treatment were pain-free, or nearly so, afterward. However, most studies show a more modest effect – about one-third of participants see a significant decrease in pain. To put this in perspective, this is about the same as opioids’ effect on chronic pain, but those benefits diminish over time (and they come with risks). The effectiveness of psychological pain management skills, on the other hand, can increase with practice. Dr. Zeidan recommended trying different methods at once – individualized therapy, pain management courses and group therapy. “We don’t actually know what the silver bullet is because there likely isn’t one to cure pain. So testing, validating and optimizing multiple approaches is a critical step.” WHAT IF YOU CAN’T SEE A PSYCHOLOGIST IN PERSON? The definitions insurance companies use for chronic pain are rapidly changing – with pain being increasingly seen as its own disease – but for now it’s hard to get a trip to a pain psychologist covered. That can put one-on-one treatment out of reach for many. “We do not have enough trained psychologists to address all of the need,” said Beth Darnall, the director of the Stanford Pain Relief Innovations Lab. “We really have to look beyond what we are doing now.” Dr. Darnall said that technology could provide new alternatives, since many of the psychological tools shown to diminish pain can be learned and shared with minimal training. She has created a program, based on C.B.T. and other models, called Empowered Relief, which is affordable and can be done from your own home. Patients can sign up, often for free, for a single two-hour online class delivered by her or one of 300 instructors, all health care professionals, who offer simple skills to calm the nervous system, reframe pain and change how your brain processes it. It’s been integrated into the Cleveland Clinic for chronic pain and spine surgery patients, as well as several insurance companies. In one trial, a single class was comparable to eight sessions of C.B.T. She’s also currently working on an app and even virtual reality platforms. “You can live on a ranch in Idaho and get quality access to evidence-driven pain care,” she said. Dr. Darnall stressed that psychological counselling is just one component of a treatment program for chronic pain, which can also include medication or lifestyle changes. “It’s not psychological treatments or medication,” Dr. Darnall said. “It’s a menu, and patients might land on two or three different options that offer a good formula for them.” By Sushma Subramanian © The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/beauty-guide-facelift-without-surgery-home-micro-current-device-2324096,Beauty guide: Can you give yourself a surgery-free face-lift at home?,"Raise your hand if you’ve ever pulled your skin taut across your face after glancing at yourself in a mirror – or worse, in the little Zoom box – just to see what you’d look like. Congratulations: You just got an at-home face-lift. For a few seconds, anyway. According to a report from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, people in the United States spent US$16.7 billion (S$22.7 billion) on cosmetic procedures in 2020, almost US$1.9 billion of it on face-lifts. Second only to nose reshaping and eyelid surgery, face-lifts were the third most popular cosmetic surgical procedure, with 234,374 performed in 2020 — a 75 per cent increase from 20 years prior. But what if you could skip the cosmetic surgery – which costs, on average, US$8,005 – and sculpt your face from the sofa instead? Social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram are rife with beauty tutorials offering ways to achieve a more lifted look through facial massage, at-home micro-current devices and even face tape. (Yep, it’s exactly what it sounds like. Tape. On your face.) CAN ANYTHING PROVIDE FACE-LIFT-LEVEL RESULTS AT HOME? To put it bluntly: No. “The ‘at-home face lift’ is a great marketing term,” said Dr. Jacob D. Steiger, a facial plastic surgeon in Boca Raton, Fla. “But anything you do at home is only going to be treating the skin. You will never get deep enough to be able to fix the ligaments of the face.” Our faces contain ligaments, which hold up the cheek, jawline and neck structures. As people age – usually around their late 40s and early 50s –those ligaments can start to sag, resulting in droopy cheeks, hanging jowls and the glamorous-sounding “turkey neck,” a fleshy pouch of loose skin and fat under the chin. A face-lift, or rhytidectomy, is a surgical procedure “that lifts those structures in the face” that were causing the droopy appearance, “and restores them back to their original position,” Dr. Steiger said. This results in a tighter, more contoured face that can make you look more youthful. Sure, you can improve skin texture through laser resurfacing at a dermatologist’s office, or create the illusion of a lift with injectable fillers. You can even tighten trouble spots with radio-frequency therapy, a nonsurgical skin tightening procedure that heats the deeper layers of skin to encourage production of collagen and elastin, proteins that make skin firm and plump. But even that procedure only gets you so far, said Dr. Debra Jaliman, a dermatologist in New York City. “We always say to patients, ‘Yes, it’s going to tighten your skin, but remember: It’s not a face-lift.’” As for taping your skin to keep features in place and stop facial muscles moving? “Old-time actresses used to use this trick a lot,” said Dr. Michele Green, a dermatologist in New York City. Alas, she said, while you may briefly look tauter, “when you remove the tape, it all goes back to your previous state like a house of cards.” WHAT ABOUT AT-HOME MICRO-CURRENT DEVICES? Micro-current facial-toning devices, like those made by NuFace and Ziip, claim to lift and tighten skin by using a low-voltage electric current to stimulate facial muscles and encourage collagen and elastin production. But experts are lukewarm on their effectiveness. “There’s not a lot of substantial data or any well-conducted studies showing strong evidence that these devices actually promote skin tightening,” said Dr. Rina Allawh, a dermatologist practicing in a suburb of Philadelphia. While Dr. Allawh has patients who claim to see results, she said it’s possible that some of the improvement may actually come from the serum they’re pairing it with. “A lot of these devices come with gel primers that contain hyaluronic acid, which is an ingredient we use in fillers to help plump the skin,” she said. Because at-home devices use a low level of power – the NuFace runs on a 9-volt battery, while most physician-grade devices typically need around 110 volts – “they’re required to be used frequently and often” in order to see any kind of results, said Dr. Kenneth Rothaus, a plastic surgeon in New York City and partner at Modrn Sanctuary medspa. (NuFace, which touts “the 5-minute facial lift” recommends using it five times a week for five to 20 minutes at a time for the first 60 days, then two to three times a week thereafter.) “Not many people are really going to be compliant with that,” Dr. Rothaus said. “The reality is going to be like that treadmill that functions as a coat rack.” Dr. Green said that strict usage may “temporarily make you look better – but just temporarily.” Any effects will tend to last only a few days, she said. An at-home micro-current device “is certainly not going to replace Botox or laser resurfacing or an actual face-lift,” she added. “I don’t really see that this could have long-term benefits.” If you do decide to try it, don’t overdo it – and consider what you know about your skin before you start. If you’re prone to sensitivity and irritation, Dr. Jaliman said, an at-home experiment may not be worth the gamble. CAN FACIAL MASSAGE HELP? Massaging your face with a piece of jade or rose quartz may be having a moment on social media, but gua sha and jade rolling have been used in Chinese medicine for centuries to move the body’s flow of “chi” (or energy) and relieve muscle pain and tension, said Giselle Wasfie, a doctor of Chinese medicine and founder of Chicago-based REMIX Acupuncture and Integrative Health.   Though it was traditionally done on the shoulders and neck, facial gua sha – in which you glide a contoured stone tool across your skin – has grown in popularity as a beauty treatment in the United States over the last few years, Dr. Wasfie said. Along with pushing topical products into the skin for better absorption, both gua sha and jade rolling can increase blood flow, improve lymphatic drainage and reduce inflammation and puffiness, she said. Since the gua sha tool is more precise than a jade roller, Dr. Wasfie added that she has noticed that it gives her clients a little more of a “lifted” look than a jade roller does. The massaging motion of both techniques can also help relieve tight muscles in the face and jaw. “You can get a soothing benefit from the stone on your skin,” she said. “It’s almost like a little meditation.” What gua sha and jade rolling won’t do is promote collagen production or erase wrinkles, Dr. Allawh said. “To date, there is little evidence to support this.” WHAT CAN I DO AT HOME TO GET A MORE YOUTHFUL LOOK? With the budget you’d use for an at-home micro-current device – the NuFace Trinity costs US$339, the Ziip GX is US$495 — Dr. Jaliman advised investing in skin care products instead. A retinol, glycolic acid toner, vitamin-C serum and a cream with niacinamide can “really make your skin look great at home,” she said. You can also try a product with hyaluronic acid for hydration and an eye cream with peptides to stimulate collagen production. “I think you’d see more bang for the buck in the end,” she said. And of course, sun protection is key. “A lot of the time, the reason we see that drooping of the face or sagging is sun damage,” Dr. Allawh said. “Prolonged sun exposure actually accelerates the loss of collagen in our skin.” That means (you guessed it) that you should be relentlessly dedicated to SPF. “I tell people the three most important things are sunscreen, sunscreen, sunscreen,” Dr. Green said. “Nothing you’re going to use is going to replicate just avoiding sun damage.” For a quick fix, take a page from beauty influencers and fake it with makeup. “It’s all about the play of light and shadow,” said Danielle Vincent, a celebrity makeup artist and founder of the beauty brand Kimiko. “You can trick the eye into seeing something three-dimensional that isn’t there.” To create the illusion of a more lifted cheek, blend highlighter along the very top of your cheekbone, then add blush right below it, on the outer section of the cheekbone, Ms. Vincent said. Finish with a matte contour makeup slightly above the natural hollow of your cheek. You can blend contour makeup along the jawbone to mask sagging, “or even slightly above, so that you’re receding something that might be catching light,” she said. Whatever you try, make sure to manage your expectations. And reserve a healthy dose of scepticism toward the idea of an at-home face-lift. “It’s like a pipe dream,” Dr. Green said. “It’s a sexy term that has mass appeal. Who wouldn’t want to get a face-lift at home – without needles, without anaesthesia, without any recovery?” Unfortunately, she said, “It’s just a medical impossibility.” By Holly Burns © The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-vaccination-children-under-12-singapore-moh-2327331,Singapore ‘hopeful’ of extending COVID-19 vaccines to children below 12 from January,"SINGAPORE: Singapore hopes to extend the COVID-19 national vaccination programme to children below the age of 12 in January 2022, said the Ministry of Health’s (MOH) director of medical services Kenneth Mak.  Speaking at a multi-ministry task force press conference on Saturday (Nov 20), Assoc Prof Mak noted that children below the age of 12 made up about 11.2 per cent of all COVID-19 cases in Singapore on Nov 19.  Four weeks ago, this figure was 6.7 per cent, he added, noting that Singapore is seeing a rising “slow trend” for cases in this age group.  The proportion of cases of those between 12 and 20 years old has not changed “in the same way”, he said, adding that it “continues to hover” between 4 and 5 per cent, noted Assoc Prof Mak.  “These children remain vulnerable because they are not yet eligible for vaccination to protect them from infection. And it’s generally harder to get them to comply with disciplined mask-wearing and safe separation and measures.”   Many of these children have “mild infections”, but Singapore has seen a “small number” of children who need paediatric ICU care for more severe infections or complications from the infection.  There were also a few cases of multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) reported to MOH, said Assoc Prof Mak, noting that this was addressed earlier.  At the time, four such cases had emerged among the more than 8,000 paediatric COVID-19 cases in Singapore since the start of the pandemic.  All four children were admitted to hospital between October and November this year, and these cases are “considered rare”, MOH said at the time.  Health authorities are working with the expert committee on COVID-19 vaccines to extend the national vaccination programme to cover children aged between five and 11 to reduce their risk of getting infected, said Assoc Prof Mak.  The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) will also work with Pfizer on the necessary regulatory approvals, he added.  “We remain hopeful that we may be able to launch the extended national vaccination programme following these approvals for children less than 12 years of age, hopefully sometime in January 2022.” "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/dining-social-gatherings-fully-vaccinated-restaurants-hawker-centres-covid-2327241,Dining in and social gatherings to resume in groups of up to 5 from Monday,"SINGAPORE: Fully vaccinated people, including those from different households, can dine together in groups of up to five from Monday (Nov 22), Singapore's COVID-19 multi-ministry task force announced on Saturday. The group size limit on social gatherings will also be raised from two to five people, and the cap on household visitors will likewise increase to five, said task force co-chair Gan Kim Yong.  Speaking at a press conference, Mr Gan said that Singapore’s Stabilisation Phase will end on Nov 21, and the country will return to the Transition Phase.  “We are now in a better position to further relax the safe management measures,” he added.  The situation and proportion of severe COVID-19 cases have remained stable, with the week-on-week infection ratio staying at about 1 or lower, said Mr Gan.  Daily case numbers have fallen to below 3,000 a day on average. Close to 99 per cent have mild or no symptoms and the ""vast majority"" are recovering at home, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a separate press release.  The proportion of patients who need oxygen supplementation was at 0.8 per cent of total cases in the past 28 days, while 0.2 per cent needed ICU care.  “The number of cases in the ICU remains high but stable in the past week at around 120 cases per day. Our overall ICU occupancy in the past week is at approximately 60 per cent,” the ministry said.  “The unvaccinated continue to make up a disproportionate number of ICU patients and those requiring hospitalisation.” The easing of dining-in restrictions to allow groups of up to five will apply to hawker centres and coffee shops from Tuesday – but only if they have implemented vaccination checks.  Hawker centres and coffee shops that are unable to do so can only have fully vaccinated diners in groups of up to two, said Mr Gan, who is also the Trade and Industry Minister.  Those who are unvaccinated are not allowed to dine in and can continue to only take away food, the Health Ministry said in its press release.  Unvaccinated children aged 12 and below can be included in groups of five people dining in as long as they are all from the same household.  People who are medically ineligible to take the COVID-19 vaccination can also be included from Dec 1.  “Nevertheless, we continue to caution medically ineligible persons of their susceptibility to severe illness if infected with COVID-19, and urge them to be careful despite such a concession,” MOH said. It urged households to “accept only visitors who are vaccinated” to protect those who are unvaccinated against COVID-19 from exposure to the virus.  “Unvaccinated individuals should also exercise caution and protect themselves by reducing their movement and staying at home as much as possible,” the ministry said.  “In addition, visitors to households that have an unvaccinated person or vulnerable elderly are strongly encouraged to test themselves prior to the visit to ensure that they do not unwittingly transmit COVID-19 to those who are vulnerable.”  Safe management measures for wedding solemnisations and receptions will also be adjusted from Monday.  The wedding couple can remain unmasked throughout the reception or solemnisation, and members of the wedding party will be allowed to sing at the reception, subject to “additional precautions”.  To allow for such activities, the wedding couple or the individuals involved will have to take an antigen rapid test (ART) supervised by the venue operator or have a valid pre-event test result within 24 hours before the event, said MOH in the press release.  Vaccination-differentiated measures will be expanded to all public libraries and selected activities in community clubs or centres under the People’s Association.  “By restricting entry to only individuals who have been fully vaccinated, we can further reduce the risk of transmission in such settings,” the ministry said. There may be “pent-up demand” from people who want to go out during the year-end festivities, said Health Minister and task force co-chair Ong Ye Kung.  “So as far as possible, we don’t want to do an opening move that’s significant in the month of December, because we risk once opening, social activities will spike up very high, and it can drive and spark off a new wave,” he added.  The situation will be monitored over the next few weeks, and if it remains stable, Singapore will “consider the next series of moves” around end-December, said co-chair Lawrence Wong.  ""It’s not a 'big bang' approach. This approach will require all of us to be patient, to be disciplined and to exercise social responsibility.  “But we are confident that this approach in the longer term will yield better results, will minimise casualties and will, importantly, allow us steady progress towards becoming a COVID-resilient nation.” Mr Gan urged Singaporeans to remain vigilant and exercise social responsibility even though dining-in restrictions have been eased.  ""Please don't rush to celebrate and have multiple gatherings in a day,"" he said,  warning that if this happens, cases will multiply and set back Singapore's reopening.  ""If you need to go to big gatherings or big events, please take a test to make sure that you are not the one that is imposing risks on other people.""

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/exercise-reduce-cancer-risk-health-tips-2321356,5 hours of moderate exercise every week may reduce your cancer risk,"More than 46,000 cancer cases in the United States might be prevented each year if almost all of us walked for about 45 minutes a day, according to an eye-opening new study of inactivity, exercise and malignancies. The study, which analysed cancer incidence and the physical activity habits of nearly 600,000 American men and women in every state and the District of Columbia, found that about three per cent of common cancers in the United States are strongly linked to inactivity. Something as simple as getting up and moving, the findings suggest, might help tens of thousands of us avoid developing cancer in the coming years. Already we have plenty of evidence that exercise affects cancer risk. In past experiments, physical activity has changed the immune system in ways that amplify the body’s ability to fight tumour growth. Exercise can, for example, ramp up the activity of certain immune cells known to target cancer cells. Exercise has also been associated with longer survival in people with certain forms of cancer, possibly by boosting levels of inflammatory substances that inhibit cancer cell growth. A 2016 review in JAMA Internal Medicine concluded that our risks for at least 13 types of cancer, including breast, bladder, blood and rectal cancers, drop substantially if we are physically active, and a separate 2019 report calculated that those reductions could be as high as 69 per cent. At the same time, many studies show that being inactive raises our risks for various cancers. But scientists know surprisingly little about how those risks translate into actual cases or, more concretely, how many people each year are likely to develop cancers closely linked to moving too little. So, for the new study, which was published in October in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, researchers with the American Cancer Society and Emory University in Atlanta used a sophisticated type of statistical analysis called P.A.F. to measure the links between cancer and inactivity. P.A.F. stands for population-attributable fraction and is a mathematical way for scientists to estimate how many occurrences of a disease – or drug responses or other biological reactions – within a larger population seem to be the result of a particular behaviour or other factor. It can tell us, in essence, how many annual cases of, say, colon cancer – out of all the known instances of the disease each year – can reasonably be laid at the feet of smoking or alcohol or fatty foods or over-sitting. To start calculating the P.A.F. of cancer resulting from inactivity, the American Cancer Society scientists first pulled anonymized data from the U.S. Cancer Statistics database about cases, nationally and by state, for all Americans 20 and older between 2013 and 2016. The team focused both on total cancer cases and on seven types of cancer that in past studies had been closely tied in part to activity (or inactivity), which are stomach, kidney, oesophageal, colon, bladder, breast and endometrial tumours. Next, they checked on how much American adults claim to move, based on more than half a million replies to two large federal surveys. Both ask people in what ways and how often they exercise. The researchers drew responses from adults in every state and grouped them, based on whether people met the American Cancer Society recommendations for physical activity. Those guidelines call for, ideally, 300 minutes, or five hours, of moderate exercise, like a brisk walk, every week to reduce cancer risk. Finally, the researchers adjusted these statistics for body mass and other factors, gathered additional data about cancer risks and plugged all of the numbers into an equation, which then spit out the P.A.F. for cancers linked to inactivity. That number turned out to be 46,356, or about three per cent of all cancers annually (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers). When they then looked at individual types of cancer, stomach cancer was most tied to inactivity, with about 17 per cent of all cases annually attributable to not moving, versus four per cent of bladder cancers. Likewise, the numbers varied by state, rising to nearly four per cent of cancers in many Southern states, where residents tend to report getting relatively little exercise, but about two per cent in much of the Mountain West, which has relatively active populations. The good news, however, is that these numbers are malleable. We have the ability to lower them. Exercise could “potentially prevent many cancers in the United States,” said Adair K. Minihan, an associate scientist at the American Cancer Society, who led the new study. If everyone in America who can exercise started walking for an hour on weekdays, she said, theoretically the 46,356 cases tied to inactivity should disappear. Of course, cancer is a bogglingly complex disease that has many overlapping, entwined causes, with inactivity playing just a small potential role. Furthermore, statistical risks never drop to zero. Many of the most active people can and do develop cancer, Ms. Minihan pointed out. This study, she emphasized, is not meant “to shame people for not exercising,” or suggest someone’s tumour is his or her fault for skipping the gym sometimes. “There are so many obstacles” to exercise, she said, and so many factors that go into who ultimately develops cancer. But the results do intimate that if each of us could find a way to fit in 45 minutes a day or so of simple exercise, like walking, we might reshape our odds of developing many types of malignancies.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/exercise-tips-chronic-pain-tai-chi-2310581,Suffering from persistent pain but still need to exercise? Here's how,"For 25 years, Wei Liu had been practicing and teaching tai chi, including to people suffering from chronic knee pain, believing the exercises strengthen legs and instils calm. Then he began running experiments with tai chi and surprised himself. A professor of physical therapy at the University of Texas Health Science Centre at San Antonio, he used motion capture sensors to analyse people’s movements during a typical tai chi session. He noticed people shifting their weight and squatting, movements that can actually stress knees and exacerbate pain for some people, not alleviate it. Today Dr. Liu still tells students that tai chi is good for chronic knee pain – just not all of the movements, or forms, that make up a typical session. People with creaky knees should probably skip Laying the Lute (form 5) and Creeps Low Like Snake (form 16), which caused the greatest knee strain in his study. They could continue with Part the Horse’s Mane on Both Sides (form 2) and any other form that doesn’t amplify pain. Dr. Liu’s study, and a wealth of additional science and experience, demonstrate that movement is desirable and therapeutic for almost anyone experiencing chronic pain. But finding the best activities to help you deal with your particular pain may require mixing and matching exercise options, asking the right questions about why you hurt afterward and finding the right trainer or physical therapist. IF YOU HURT, EXERCISE HELPS. Not so long ago, most doctors and therapists advised people with chronic pain to rest and avoid activity, according to a 2017 review of studies related to exercise and chronic pain. But accumulating evidence in the past few decades showed that “being inactive will tend to reinforce pain sensitivity pathways,” said Daniel Belavy, a professor of physiotherapy at the University of Applied Sciences in Bochum, Germany, who studies how moving influences chronic pain, especially back pain. Exercise, on the other hand, often reduces feelings of pain immediately afterward and raises people’s pain thresholds, studies show. Its benefits, in fact, often eclipse those of other common treatment options, such as massage and stress management. Today, “international clinical guidelines for most chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions recommend exercise therapy and physical activity as core treatments,” said Jonas Bloch Thorlund, a professor of musculoskeletal health at the University of Southern Denmark who studies exercise and pain. The problem is that, while some type of exercise generally helps almost everyone deal with chronic pain, finding the precise workout to relieve your particular pain often requires trial and error and persistence. Even activities famous for soothing pain do not work for everyone. FIND THE RIGHT ROUTINE. Take yoga. In a 2020 analysis of research about it and similar practices, the authors conclude that yoga generally improves physical function, quality of life and pain for many people with “knee osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, neck pain, headaches and low back pain.” But, the review said, relief is often slight, and some participants wind up reporting more pain after they take up yoga. The same dynamic plays out in other studies of exercise therapy for chronic pain. “Some people respond well” to yoga or tai chi or swimming or strength training or walking, and others do not, said Dr. Melissa Phuphanich, a resident in physical medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was an author of the 2020 analysis. The good news is that this very inconsistency opens options. “In knee osteoarthritis, which is one of my research areas,” Dr. Thorlund said, “researchers cannot really find a large difference between different types of exercise” for pain management. So, maybe start with a short walk in a scenic spot, like a park, and see how your body reacts (after clearing it with your doctor, of course). IN THE GYM? THE WATER? THE GARDEN? YES. Once you have clearance from a health professional to exercise, evaluate your pain, life, schedule, dislikes and finances as objectively as possible, since each influences your ideal exercise routine. “Certain activities may be friendlier to people with certain limitations,” said Kirsten Ambrose, the associate director of the Osteoarthritis Action Alliance at the University of North Carolina’s Thurston Arthritis Research Centre. “Non-weight-bearing activities, like water-based or pool activities or bicycling, may be more tolerable for some people with joint pain.” But joining and getting to a facility with a pool or purchasing a bike and navigating roads and paths can be intimidating or prohibitively expensive. In that case, start small. “You don’t have to limit yourself to traditional exercise, like walking on a treadmill for a certain number of minutes or miles,” Ms. Ambrose said. “You can count gardening or walking the dog. The goal is to increase the amount of time spent moving versus sitting.” FOLLOW THE TWO-HOUR RULE. Anyone beginning a new exercise program, however, should be aware that the effort often hurts at first. Some soreness a day or so after an unfamiliar workout is normal and even desirable, since it signals the muscles are reacting as they should to the exercise, Dr. Belavy said. But it can be difficult to tease apart this from pain that indicates new damage. So, follow the two-hour rule, Ms. Ambrose said. “If pain is worse two hours after finishing exercise than it was before you started, this is an indication that you have overdone it and should scale back the next time.” Consult a physical therapist or clinical exercise physiologist, too, if you worry your exercise routine might exacerbate your pain. “Sometimes, there will be things you can’t see for yourself, like perhaps you are nervous about a particular movement,” Dr. Belavy said, and wind up performing it in a way that is so tentative or truncated it becomes ineffective or even harmful for your joints or body. As a result, “you might need to be gradually exposed to certain kinds of movements, even if they seem frightening,” he said. People with knee pain who worry about going up and down stairs, for instance, might start by walking in place, raising their knees as if climbing the stairs, until they feel confident in that movement. “Professional guidance can help.” EXERCISE IS A PLACEBO. AND THAT’S OK. Finally, know that some of the pain relief from exercise probably originates in your mind. “For many patients with chronic pain, no matter the treatment, a large part of the effect is contextual,” said Dr. Thorlund, who last year studied the impacts of telling people exercise would decrease or increase their sensations of pain afterward, which it then did. Contextual factors, he continued, are aspects of exercise that can be psychological or emotional, such as whether you like your physical therapist, enjoy the colour and fit of your workout wear, remember elementary-school physical education classes with nostalgia or dread and, yes, the annoying enthusiasm of your spin-class instructor. According to a wide-ranging review Dr. Belavy wrote with colleagues this year, exercise is only a little better for treating chronic pain than placebos, like pills or fake electrical pulses that subjects thought were painkillers. But people experienced some relief in all cases, suggesting that placebos do help ease pain. “Exercise definitely has beneficial effects on chronic pain,” Dr. Belavy said. It’s just that some of those effects depend on how well you expect exercise to work. So, if you are exercising and your pain is barely budging, try changing something – or everything – about your workouts, until you feel confident in their benefits. Speed date with spin class instructors to find the one whose energy syncs best with yours, purchase comfy new sneakers, ask your physical therapist to update his dreary waiting-room soundtrack or take up tai chi for the first time. “Find the exercise that works for you and keep at it,” Dr. Belavy concluded.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/covid-19-vaccine-dogs-cats-pets-2324031,Worried about your pet getting COVID-19? Here’s what you need to know,"Over the past year, coronavirus vaccines have gone into billions of human arms – and into the fuzzy haunches of an ark’s worth of zoo animals. Jaguars are getting the jab. Bonobos are being dosed. So are orangutans and otters, ferrets and fruit bats, and, of course, lions and tigers and bears (oh, my!). Largely left behind, however, are two creatures much closer to home: domestic cats and dogs. Pet owners have noticed. “I get so many questions about this issue,” Dr. Elizabeth Lennon, a veterinarian at the University of Pennsylvania, said. “Will there be a vaccine? When will there be a vaccine?” Technically, a pet vaccine is feasible. In fact, several research teams say they have already developed promising cat or dog vaccines; the shots that zoo animals are receiving were initially designed for dogs. But vaccinating pets is simply not a priority, experts said. Although dogs and cats can catch the virus, a growing body of evidence suggests that Fluffy and Fido play little to no role in its spread – and rarely fall ill themselves. “A vaccine is quite unlikely, I think, for dogs and cats,” Dr. Will Sander, a veterinarian at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said. “The risk of disease spread and illness in pets is so low that any vaccine would not be worth giving.” In February 2020, a woman in Hong Kong was diagnosed with COVID-19. Two other people in her home soon tested positive for the virus, as did one unexpected member of the household: an elderly Pomeranian. The 17-year-old dog was the first pet known to catch the virus. But not the last. A German shepherd in Hong Kong soon tested positive, too, as did cats in Hong Kong, Belgium and New York. The cases were exceedingly mild – the animals had few or no symptoms – and experts concluded that humans had spread the virus to the pets, rather than vice versa. “To date, there hasn’t been any documented cases of dogs or cats spreading the virus to people,” Lennon said. But the prospect of a pet pandemic sparked interested in an animal vaccine. Zoetis, a veterinary pharmaceutical company based in New Jersey, began working on one as soon as it heard about the Hong Kong Pomeranian. “We figured, ‘Wow, this could become serious, so let’s start working on a product,’” Mahesh Kumar, a senior vice president at Zoetis who leads vaccine development, said. By the fall of 2020, Zoetis had four promising candidates for a vaccine, each of which elicited “robust” antibody responses in cats and dogs, the company announced. (The studies, which were small, have not been published.) But as vaccine development progressed, it became increasingly apparent that the infection of pets was unlikely to pose a serious threat to animals or people. With scientists learning a lot more about how the virus affects our pets. Here’s what you need to know. CAN I GIVE THE VIRUS TO MY PETS? Yes. Humans can transmit the virus to their pets the same way they transmit it to other people: through tiny, respiratory droplets. Most dogs and cats that catch the virus appear to get it from infected humans in their household. Studies have consistently shown that cats are more likely to become infected than dogs, for reasons that scientists do not completely understand. (Biology and behaviour may both play a role.) In one study of 76 pets living with people who had the virus, 17.6 percent of cats and 1.7 percent of dogs also tested positive. Of the infected pets, 82.4% had no symptoms. CAN MY PETS GIVE THE VIRUS TO ME? There have been no documented cases of cats or dogs transmitting the virus to humans. And there are few signs that these animals readily pass the virus to each other. Studies show, for instance, that stray cats are much less likely to have antibodies to the virus than cats that live with humans. That suggests that the animals are largely getting the virus from us, rather than passing it around among themselves. WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS IN PETS? Most have no symptoms at all. Those that do get sick typically have mild symptoms, which may include coughing, sneezing or diarrhoea. The animals typically make full recoveries without treatment, although more severe cases do occur occasionally. SHOULD I VACCINATE MY PET? Though scientists have developed promising vaccine candidates for cats and dogs, there are no pet vaccines approved in the United States. And regulators are not currently accepting applications for cat or dog vaccines. Scientists say that a pet vaccine is unnecessary because cats and dogs do not get very sick from the virus and do not readily transmit it to humans or other animals. HOW CAN I PROTECT MY PET? If you test positive for the virus, isolate yourself from your pets. If you can’t do that, make sure to wear a face mask while caring for them. And get vaccinated yourself. If you don’t become infected with the virus, your pets are exceedingly unlikely to catch it. By Emily Anthes © The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/obesity-rate-rises-highest-level-2010-moh-urges-public-exercise-and-adopt-healthier-diet-2322321,Obesity rate rises to highest level since 2010; MOH urges public to exercise and adopt healthier diet,"SINGAPORE: Singapore’s obesity rate has risen to the highest level since 2010, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Thursday (Nov 18), as it urged residents to increase their physical activity and adopt a healthier diet. Binge drinking also increased among residents last year, particularly among men and younger adults. The data was published in MOH's annual National Population Health Survey on Thursday (Nov 18). The survey, conducted between July 2019 to March 2020 from a representative sample of residential addresses, tracks the health and risk factors, as well as lifestyle practices of Singaporeans and permanent residents aged between 18 to 74. While the fieldwork had been curtailed by COVID-19, MOH said it did not substantially affect the results and that they managed to get “a very good” sample size of around 6,000 adults for the household interviews and 5,000 adults for health examinations. However, MOH acknowledged that the survey did not capture the subsequent impact of COVID-19 as the survey was stopped in March last year. Among its findings, the survey found that during the period of 2019 to 2020, 10.5 per cent of Singapore residents were obese. This is the same obesity level as in 2010. In comparison, the crude prevalence of obesity was 8.6 per cent in both 2013 and 2017, when data on obesity was collected. “Increases in obesity prevalence between 2017 and 2019-2020 were mostly among the older adults aged 50 to 74 years, males and Malays,” the report said. More than two in 10 respondents, or 20.7 per cent, also had high risk Body Mass Index (BMI), the survey showed, up from 18.7 per cent in 2017. Similar to the obesity prevalence, there was a higher proportion of men (22.6 per cent) with high risk BMI than women (18.8 per cent). Malays (38.7 per cent) and Indians (31.8 per cent) had higher proportion with high risk BMI than Chinese (16.1 per cent). The survey also found that fewer Singapore residents engaged in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week - the recommended level prescribed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) - last year. According to the report, 76.4 per cent of respondents achieved the recommended level in 2020, “significantly lower” than the 80.9 per cent recorded in 2017. This, MOH said, was despite a 4 percentage point increase in the number of people who engaged in leisure-time regular exercise, which refers to any sports or exercise for 20 minutes or more at least three days a week. “An observed increase in prevalence in obesity and high risk BMI can potentially increase the risk of developing chronic diseases. Aside from genetic factors, obesity can also result from a lack of physical activity and an unhealthy diet,” said MOH. To encourage residents to be more active, MOH said it will continue to improve accessibility to its regular exercise programmes, such as by bringing them online and creating more exercise sessions in community spaces. Programmes such as the National Steps Challenge also aim to get residents to lead more active lifestyles. Meanwhile, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) is planning to ramp up efforts to spur reformulation of reduced-sodium sauces and seasonings, with the latest survey results showing that residents are consuming saltier diets. HPB will also embark on a nationwide campaign to encourage residents to reduce sodium consumption in their diets, with more details to be released in the coming months, said MOH. During a virtual technical media briefing on Thursday, HPB said mandatory nutrition labels, also known as ‘Nutri-Grade’, and advertising prohibitions on pre-packaged non-alcoholic beverages will come into effect from the fourth quarter of 2022, instead of end-2021 as previously announced. “We've extended the period for the industry to implement that because of the shifts and the disruptions brought about by COVID,” said HPB. It added that it is also working on extending those measures to freshly prepared beverages. Results from the latest survey showed a decrease in smoking prevalence, in line with trends observed over the past decade. The crude prevalence of daily smoking was 10.1 per cent in 2020, a drop from 11.8 per cent in 2017. According to the report, the decline was more pronounced in men compared to women, with the latter’s prevalence remaining relatively constant at around 3 per cent in recent years. In 2020, 17 per cent of the men surveyed had smoked daily, compared with 3.4 per cent for women. The report also found that daily smoking was most prevalent in adults aged between 50 and 59 years and least prevalent among older adults in the 60 to 74 years age group. Responding to a question from the media about factors that may have contributed to the decline in smoking rates, MOH said the decrease can be attributed to its “holistic” approach. This includes increasing education and outreach efforts - from pre-schools to institutes of higher learning - about the harmful effects of smoking. “There are innovative ways that we reach out to the different age segments for them to understand the message as well as to be the influence to the family to help with smoking reduction,” said MOH. “Over and above that, HPB actually works with many of our community leaders to reach out in a more (culturally) acceptable way to have the various population segments actually embarked on or start thinking about smoking cessation,” MOH added. It added that it will continue efforts to keep smoking prevalence low, such as enhancing education in mainstream schools and through smoking cessation programmes. On the flip side, binge drinking continued to increase from 8.8 per cent in 2017 to 10.5 per cent in 2020. The survey defines binge drinking as five or more alcoholic drinks for men and four or more alcoholic drinks for women in a session. ""Binge drinking was more prevalent among males (14.6 per cent) than females (6.5 per cent); and among Chinese (11.6 per cent) and Indians (11.4 per cent) compared to Malays (1.7 per cent),"" said MOH. The report also showed that younger adults in the 18 to 39 years age group were more likely to binge drink compared to the other age groups. In particular, among the men surveyed, about one in five had a habit of binge drinking. MOH said it will monitor binge drinking trends in Singapore and continue efforts to reduce it by raising awareness in schools and collaborating with agencies to include messages on responsible drinking. MOH also reiterated the importance of regular health screening for early detection of disease. As part of Screen for Life (SFL) programme, MOH said eligible Singapore residents are offered “heavily subsidised” screening tests for cardiovascular risk factors including obesity and diabetes, cervical cancer and colorectal cancer. “We will continue our efforts to reach out to the unscreened population, to encourage Singaporeans to participate in screening regularly,” MOH added."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/covid-pregnancy-experience-isolation-ward-2316446,She got COVID-19 at 38 weeks pregnant: A first-time mum shares her experience and fears,"I am a preschool teacher and considered an essential worker, so working from home isn’t an option for me. Due to the nature of my work, my company nominated me for COVID-19 vaccination in March this year. It was around that time that I found out I was pregnant with my first child.   At that time, there wasn’t enough research about the safety of COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant women, so when I indicated that I was pregnant on the vaccination registration form, I found out that I wasn’t eligible for the vaccine. I would just have to be extra careful.  That was the start of my constant worry about the long hours of commute – my workplace is in Punggol, a one-hour-and-15-minute journey from my home at Hillview.  I took many extra precautions, such as not touching escalator handrails and constantly sanitising my hands. I would also sit away from crowded carriages on the train. At one point, I wore double masks, including an N95 mask.  My biggest worry was the hours of exposure as I travelled between work and home, and my husband was concerned, too.  NOT BEING SURE IF SHE SHOULD GET VACCINATED On May 30, when I was four months pregnant, the COVID-19 Multi-Ministry Task Force said in a press conference that the vaccine was safe for pregnant women. It meant that I would be able to register and make an appointment to get vaccinated starting as early as Jun 4. But I was still hesitant.   My husband and I went back and forth for the next two months, trying to make a decision about whether I should get vaccinated. By that time, I was already in my second trimester, about 19 to 22 weeks pregnant.  On one hand, by not being vaccinated, I could cause someone else – or even my baby – to get infected. I didn’t want to be negligent. But on the other hand, there were so many speculations and fears surrounding the vaccine and its lack of research – and how it could affect unborn babies. I was wary about its potential long-term effects.  GOING AHEAD WITH COVID-19 VACCINATION AT 30 WEEKS It was only in September, when COVID-19 cases in Singapore rose to the thousands daily, that I spoke to my gynaecologist about taking the vaccine.   My doctor strongly advised me to get vaccinated due to my increased exposure to the virus at work and during my daily commute. By then, more research had been done, such as how the antibodies from immunisation would be transferred to the baby in the womb.  I felt slightly more assured, and decided to get my first shot on Aug 25. I was in my third trimester by then. I got my second dose on Sep 17, about three weeks after receiving the first jab. I had a mild fever after the second jab, but it went away after a few hours.  During that week itself, one of my colleagues tested positive for COVID-19, so I was thankful that I had gotten vaccinated in time.  GETTING INFECTED  HERSELF   But about a month later, on Oct 21, I developed a mild runny nose. I was 38 weeks pregnant, and my baby was due on Nov 2 – I could go into labour anytime.  Despite taking warm showers and drinking hot water, the runny nose didn’t go away, although there were no other symptoms.  By then, I had already started working from home. My employer allowed me to do so because of the high number of daily infections and as I was finding it physically hard to do my daily commute.  Even though I was working from home, I was still required to take an Antigen Rapid Test (ART) weekly. I had already done one three days before my runny nose started and it was negative. But as a precaution, I decided to do the ART again.  When I saw the second line appear on the test, indicating a positive result, my heart was beating very fast. I was very scared and I didn’t know what to do. My husband was out at the time, so I quickly called him and told him that he needed to come home right away. Upon finding out I was COVID-19 positive, my husband was really worried about the baby and me. He feared that the virus could be transmitted to the baby. He did a lot of research and asked some friends in the medical field about the risks of mother-to-baby transmission. He later found out from a newspaper report that there’s a 1 to 4 per cent chance of the mother passing COVID-19 to the foetus. That night, I cried myself to sleep. FEARING THE WORST My biggest fear was having to give birth alone. This was my first baby and I didn’t know what to expect. I needed my husband for support. If I needed to give birth during the isolation period, I would have to give birth alone, without my husband. I was also worried about being separated from my baby after birth. If I was still positive and my baby was negative, I wouldn’t want to pass the virus to him.  Would my baby be okay? Would I be separated from him? And how would I handle that? I called KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) and was told that I couldn't walk in based on the ART, so I needed to get a Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (PCR) done the next day.  I got my PCR on Oct 22, and by then, my husband and I were already self-isolating and staying in different rooms. On Oct 23, my PCR came back positive, and I received an order from the Ministry of Health (MOH) to self-isolate at home for 10 days. I called MOH to ask if there were extra precautions I needed to take as I was already 38 weeks pregnant. Coincidentally, the Multi-Ministry Task Force announced on the same day that fully-vaccinated pregnant women who are younger than 35, and less than 26 weeks pregnant, would be eligible for the Home Recovery Programme (HRP). That is, after they are clinically assessed at selected public hospitals, such as KKH. MOH informed me that if I were to go into labour during the 10-day home isolation period, I could call the ambulance or take SHNGrab, a special service meant to help people under isolation order travel safely between places.  There weren't specific instructions, but later that afternoon, my gynaecologist from KKH called to tell me that I didn’t qualify for the HRP as I was more than 26 weeks pregnant. She wanted me to check into the hospital so they could monitor my baby and me, since I was very close to my due date. Upon her instructions, I called MOH again to update them that both KKH and my gynaecologist were aware of my COVID-19 diagnosis, and to ask them to expedite my hospital admission. The ambulance came and brought me to KKH that night. In the meantime, my husband started looking up the guidelines by the National Environment Agency on how to properly sanitise the house and what protection he needed, such as putting on gloves and a surgical mask before cleaning, and keeping the rooms well-ventilated during cleaning. While I was isolated in KKH,  he went about sanitising the whole house, multiple times to be safe, in fact.  He was preparing for the eventuality that I may give birth while in isolation in the hospital and getting our home ready to welcome our baby Nathan and I home. 'THE DAYS WERE VERY SLOW' At KKH, the hospital staff monitored me in a single room, before transferring me to an isolation ward with other pregnant women who had COVID-19. It was a five-bedder, and there were four other women in the ward with me. One patient was on her eighth day in the isolation ward, another woman was on her 10th day. They were a mix of vaccinated and unvaccinated.  In the afternoon that I was admitted, one woman in the ward had just given birth, while others were in their 28th or 30th week of pregnancy. My gynaecologist said she was thankful that I was fully vaccinated by then, too, and explained that I would be given a PCR test on the sixth day of being COVID-19 positive, and that I could go home if given the all-clear. She also took me through what would happen, if, say, I went into labour before my expected delivery date of Nov 2 and had to give birth in isolation. She said that in a normal pregnancy, she would advise most of her patients to be induced by week 40 to reduce the chances of stillbirth or the need for an emergency C-section.  But in my case, assuming that I would have just recovered from COVID-19 based on the 10-day isolation period, it would be fine for me to be induced a few days past my due date to give my body more time to recover from the infection before giving birth. In some ways, I was thankful that I was admitted to hospital as there would be medical attention if I needed it. It was tough being away from my husband but I was worried about passing the virus to him. The thought of going into labour while in isolation was daunting. Every day was filled with anxiety and I wondered: Will I go into labour today? I psyched myself to give birth without my husband beside me. A typical day in the ward included having the doctors and nurses do their rounds, which included checking my blood pressure, dispensing medication and asking how I was. During the stay, I developed a cough, and had mild symptoms such as a runny nose and occasional chills.  I’d brought my laptop with me and was also on the phone trying to stay connected with my friends and family. I called my husband on Zoom every night, and it helped me to keep sane during this time. Being able to see and talk to him was always the highlight of my day. He was my pillar of support whenever I felt lonely, and would encourage and reassure me that everything would be okay. Knowing that I had him to count on, not only for emotional support, but also knowing that everything was ready should the baby arrive at this time, comforted me.  On the sixth day after testing positive for COVID-19, the medical team took my viral count and the CT value. If your CT value is above 25, it means that your body has created enough antibodies to fight the virus. Conversely, if your viral count is low, it means that you are not infectious anymore.  On the morning of Oct 27, after my PCR test results were out, the hospital told me that I could go home, without needing to isolate myself from my husband.  The hospital gave me a special memo saying that I had fully recovered and I could be discharged even though I didn’t serve the full 10 days in isolation. IT’S BETTER TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS  I was due to give birth in three days so I was very thankful that I had some time to settle down at home before that. Nathan was born on Oct 31. Through this experience, the biggest lesson I learned was that getting COVID-19 was not something I could control.   At the same time, it’s important to remain calm throughout the whole process. I am thankful that my husband was very strong for the three of us.  My advice to pregnant women would be to get vaccinated as there’s enough research to show that it doesn’t affect the foetus. It’s better to take precautions to make sure that you don’t end up with serious symptoms if you do get infected. And if you are going through the isolation process, stay strong and remember that there’s light at the end of the tunnel, and you will see your loved ones again soon.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/testicular-cancer-checks-risk-treatment-2304411,Are you at risk of testicular cancer? A doctor explains the red flags to look out for,"Here's a question for men: Other than the annual digital rectal examination for prostate cancer by your doctor, which we assume you have been diligently doing, when was the last time you’ve really examined things down there? And, yes, by that, we mean your testicles.  Like women, who should be performing monthly breast self-examinations for breast lumps, men should also be conducting monthly self-examinations for lumps in the testicles, according to Dr Chong Weiliang, an associate consultant with Tan Tock Seng Hospital’s Department of Urology.  This is particularly important if you have a high risk of testicular cancer, he said.  “During this self-check, each testis should be examined for unusual lumps. If any is present, medical attention should be sought and appropriate tests ordered,” he explained.  Although testicular cancer represents a small percentage (1 per cent to 2 per cent) of all cancers in men worldwide, the incidence rate has steadily increased over the past few decades in Singapore. According to the Singapore Cancer Registry Annual Report, the number of cases has risen from 92 from 1998 to 2002, to 202 cases from 2013 to 2017.  “Thankfully, the absolute number remains relatively low and, if diagnosed early, can be treated successfully in the majority of cases,” said Dr Chong. If this has brought on more questions, for instance, are you at risk if you’ve injured your groin area before or if you’re an avid cyclist, here are some answers from Dr Chong: The important question to ask is, what happened to the missing testis. Here a few possibilities:  WHAT ARE THE SIGNS OF TESTICULAR CANCER? Testicular cancer can sometimes go unnoticed as it could be present as a painless, pea-sized lump in one of the testicles – and they can grow much bigger, according to Cancer.net. In some cases, there may be swelling, pain, discomfort, numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the affected testicle.  What may also happen is one testicle may become firmer than the other, and at times, cause the affected side to grow or shrink, noted the website.  There may be symptoms not related to the scrotum at all. These include a dull ache in the lower abdomen or groin. For some young or middle-aged patients, developing a blood clot may be the first sign of testicular cancer. Signs of such clots could be the swelling of one or both legs, or shortness of breath.  In later-stage testicular cancer, there may even be lower back pain, shortness of breath, chest pain, and bloody phlegm, according to Cancer.net.  WHO IS AT RISK OF DEVELOPING TESTICULAR CANCER? In case you think only elderly men who can’t control their bladder well are at risk, you’d be wrong. According to Dr Chong, testicular cancer patients often fall in the age range of 20s to 40s.  A family history of testicular cancer is another risk factor. Having a father who suffers from it increases your risk by four times; and by eight times if you have a brother who has the cancer.  HOW IS TESTICULAR CANCER DIAGNOSED? Using a combination of physical examination as well as an ultrasound scan, according to Dr Chong. “The physical examination would commonly reveal a hard testicular lump, while the ultrasound scan would often show a mass arising from within the testis.”  If malignant, the scan would also pick up an increased blood flow to the lump and “possible invasion into the surrounding tissues, such as the spermatic cord or the scrotum”.  Blood tests for tumour markers, including alpha-fetoprotein, B human chorionic gonadotropin and lactate dehydrogenase, may also be ordered to determine the cancer type, said Dr Chong.  HOW IS THE CANCER TREATED? Before any treatment is performed, sperm banking is advocated, said Dr Chong, as both surgery and chemotherapy can affect the patient’s fertility.  Then, the whole diseased testis and its cord will be removed through an inguinal incision, explained Dr Chong. “If picked up early enough, this is sufficient to render the patient disease-free and would only require regular surveillance scans and blood tumour markers.” However, he explained, if the cancer is deemed high risk or if the disease has spread from the testis into the lymphatic system or beyond, chemotherapy would be required.  Should the cancer persist post-chemotherapy, further surgery may be used to clear up the lymph nodes in the abdomen. “This surgery, known as a retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, is a major undertaking, and expert hands will be required to perform such a complex surgery,” said Dr Chong. WHAT IS TESTICULAR CANCER’S LINK TO HAVING HAD AN UNDESCENDED TESTICLE AS AN INFANT? “It isn’t entirely clear why a previously undescended testis can increase the risk of testicular cancer,” said Dr Chong, although there are some hypotheses.  During pregnancy, the testes actually develop within the foetus’ abdomen, just below the level of the kidneys, he explained. “As the testes mature, they progressively move downwards to take their place in each hemi-scrotum.” This descent happens by the 26th to 28th weeks of the pregnancy, well before birth.  An undescended testis is an indication that its cells are “abnormal to begin with”, said Dr Chong. Moreover, its undescended position after birth could further expose the testis to an environment that induces cancerous mutations. The latter is the reason why surgical correction is needed for an undescended testis by about 18 months, said Dr Chong. “It is to reduce the chance of future malignancy and preserve fertility.” However, this intervention does not nullify the baby’s risk of testicular cancer. Monthly self-examinations later in life are still required for the early detection of the cancer.  Just how common are undescended testicles in babies? “Globally, the incidence of an undescended testis in a full-term baby ranges from 1 per cent to 3 per cent, while a premature baby may have an incidence of up to 30 per cent,” said Dr Chong.  HOW DO YOU TELL IF A BABY HAS AN UNDESCENDED TESTICLE? “Often, it appears as an absent, under-developed hemi-scrotum, possibly with a testis felt in the groin on the same side,” said Dr Chong. “Rarely do you have both testes being undescended.” If the condition is not picked up during infanthood or childhood, the patient may notice an absent hemi-scrotum during adulthood, he said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/painful-sex-vaginismus-dyspareunia-treatment-gynaecologist-2303016,Treatment for vaginismus: Where women can get help for painful sex,"Recent research shows that female sexual dysfunction is prevalent across the world, and that vaginismus – which is when a woman experiences pain during vaginal penetration – is the most common condition. It is related to dyspareunia, which is when sex is possible but painful. In Singapore, cases of vaginismus are increasing, which experts say could contribute to the country’s already declining birth rate. A local study also found that nearly 60 per cent of women suffer from low sexual function – an indicator they were at risk of developing such a condition.  If sex is consistently painful for you or if you are unable to tolerate even a Pap smear, rest assured help is available.  WHERE TO BEGIN? If you have no references and no idea where to start, you can get the ball rolling by first consulting a general practitioner (GP), who may interview you about various aspects of your medical history including your menstrual patterns, past pregnancies, your use of contraception and medication, as well as other medical conditions you might have. During this visit, the doctor may suggest a pelvic examination to determine the possibility of lower genital tract infection or skin conditions, but such a procedure at this stage of treatment is not for everyone, warned Dr Tan Tse Yeun, a senior consultant at the Department of Reproductive Medicine at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH). “An internal examination should not be performed for patients with suspected vaginismus against their wishes, especially at first visit when she may be highly anxious and fearful,” Dr Tan said.   “It is important to note that many patients with vaginismus are still virgins and in the primary care setting, internal vagina examinations should be avoided.  “A thorough explanation of what is involved in an internal pelvic examination and its possible implications, such as a torn hymen, should be undertaken, and consent should be documented,” she added.  If a pelvic examination is conducted and it is found that the patient has an infection, the patient’s condition will be diagnosed accordingly and medication is prescribed. For example, superficial dyspareunia could just be due to a yeast infection, which resolves once it is treated with antifungal medication, said Dr Tan.  If the medicine doesn’t help, the doctor may refer you to a dermatologist – to investigate the skin condition further – or a gynaecologist. Your GP may also refer you to KKH, where you’re likely to go through the hospital’s Sexual Health Clinic. This is where you and your partner will go through an assessment that includes not just your medical history but also your “comprehensive sexological history”, said Dr Tan.  This assessment records the patients’ sexual behaviours or patterns (such as if they currently have one partner or more), masturbation habits and past incidents of sexual trauma.  The couple may also share if they have experienced symptoms of sexual dysfunction such as low sexual desire, inability to have an orgasm and pain, and if these symptoms are general or situational, and acquired or lifelong. Once these are all determined, a “multisystemic and multidisciplinary” approach to managing dyspareunia and vaginismus is recommended, said Dr Tan. This requires collaborating with other specialists, such as physiotherapists and psychotherapists, to “co-manage” medical factors that contribute to sexual dysfunction. TREATING VAGINISMUS WITH PHYSIOTHERAPY “Pelvic floor assessment by a physiotherapist experienced in pelvic floor dysfunction is important as women with chronic sexual pain commonly have reduced pelvic floor function and increased tension,” Dr Tan said.  In your sessions with a physiotherapist, you will learn more about the female genitalia, specifically the muscular functions in your pelvic area, said Dr Tan.  You may also be given exposure therapy, which in this context involves graduated penetration, she said. Patients receive step-by-step guidance at the clinic and will be taught manual techniques for relaxing their pelvic floor muscles, which they are encouraged to practise at home.  Some patients may undergo electromyographic biofeedback, which incorporates the use of an apparatus that feeds electrodes to a patient’s muscles to help them relax.  Patients at KKH’s Sexual Health Clinic will be referred to in-house specialists, but those who aren’t may also seek out independent physiotherapists – so long as they specialise in pelvic floor training. Laura O’Byrne, a specialist senior physiotherapist at Health2U clinic, told CNA Women that treating individuals with vaginismus requires a special touch.  “Unfortunately, in Singapore, there is a lot of this and it only gets discovered after they get married and try to have a baby.  “Because the culture here is so different, generally tampons are not used for menstrual health – it’s all pads. And masturbation is something that tends to get looked down on.  “So until you get married, you’ve not had anything inside your vagina,” said O’Byrne.  “Then you get married, you try to have sex for the first time and it’s .... horrible. It’s awful, so you see a gynaecologist, who tries to put a speculum inside you and you’re clamping down and they tell you to ‘relax, relax, relax’. “By the time they come to see me, they’ve had gynaecologists try to put a probe in there, their husband trying to put (his penis) in there and everyone asking them, ‘When are you going to have a baby?’.” And so, O’Byrne said she has to “spend a long time” with vaginismus patients. “The first thing I tell them is that I’m only going to go as far as they want me to – they are 100 per cent in control. And if that means I only get to the entrance of their vagina, that’s fine. Sometimes just assuring them I’m not going to prod something into them is enough to promote relaxation,” she said.  According to O’Byrne, one of the first steps to recovering from vaginismus is learning how to “correct your breathing” as this is connected to the pelvic floor.  While breathing sounds straightforward, teaching someone how to breathe to relax can be “difficult” and “a very slow process” because “I’m now having to undo everything that brought her to me”, she said.  Aside from manual exercises, O’Byrne said she also sometimes recommends wearables that the couple can use at home. An Ohnut, for example, is a round silicone tube that fits on the base of a man’s penis. It has separate parts that can be stacked according to how deep the couple wants penetration to be.  “He still has a kind of firm sensation around his penis but it stops him from going in as deep. So it’s just a question of managing what the symptoms are in the best way we can,” said O’Byrne.  THE ROLE OF PSYCHOTHERAPY Once medical examination has excluded the possibility of infection, endometriosis and structural issues, the most common cause of vaginismus turns out to be psychological, said Associate Professor Tan Thiam Chye, an obstetrician and gynaecologist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital.  “This needs a discussion with the psychologist,” Assoc Prof Tan said.  Incidentally, the recent KKH study on female sexual dysfunction found that the majority of the women who had low sexual function also reported depressive or anxiety symptoms.  Elaborating, KKH’s Dr Tan said that “often, an individual’s subjective sexual experience, thoughts, emotions and behaviour play a role in contributing to her difficulties”. Psychological therapy can be useful in helping them explore and manage these factors, she added.  “The goal is to help patients and their partners work through their distress, learn helpful coping strategies and change negative beliefs about sexual functioning and sexuality,” Dr Tan said.  “Not all patients require or are motivated to pursue psychotherapy, but a provision of brief sexological counselling sessions are still helpful for most couples for education and support,” Dr Tan said. SEX THERAPY AND EDUCATION “Sex is often a taboo topic in our conservative Asian society,” said Assoc Prof Tan. “We should be more open to discussion on this topic, rather than brush it under the carpet.” According to Dr Tan, conditions such as dyspareunia are associated with “a lot of distress”.  “Achieving pain-free intercourse often becomes the main focus of each sexual experience. This causes anxiety and prevents one from being able to relax or fully engage with other aspects of the sexual experience,” said Dr Tan, adding that it would be helpful if women could “purposefully pay attention to arousing or pleasurable sensations” during sex. Senior principal physiotherapist at KKH, Caroline Chua, said “educating women about sexual wellbeing and sexuality issues, destigmatising and normalising these topics as well as encouraging more discussions … will go a long way in encouraging a better sexual experience in women”.  There are workshops you can attend and even online courses packed with information from those who study human sexual behaviour.  Popular sex toy brand Smilemakers, for example, has what it calls a “pleasure-positive” sex education programme called Vulva Talks, which you can sign up for for free.  Some topics addressed in the course are how to have an orgasm, how to give and receive pleasure, and why pain during intercourse is so common. The curriculum is also delivered through Smilemakers’ hour-long physical workshops, which allow participants to talk about what sex and pleasure mean to them.  “This helps people see sex very differently, more inclusively, more positively,” said brand director Cecile Gasnault. For those who prefer something more personal and customised, sex therapy is another avenue. Love and intimacy coach Andrea Tan, who typically meets with clients after they have seen a GP or gynaecologist, said her work looks at how a person’s emotional and mental health affects her sexual function and her drive or desire for intimacy.  Among the things she has seen influence a person’s level of anxiety during sex are “the belief that sex is shameful or something that is taboo based on how they were brought up”, prior bad experiences, and past relationship trauma.  It could also be a combination of these things, said Tan.  Even a seemingly insignificant event, such as listening to someone else’s painful experiences, can make the body respond negatively to the idea of intimacy, relationships, sex or just penetration, she added.   To ascertain these conditions, Tan’s clients are put through what she calls a “discovery process” that involves filling in a “pre-intake form”, as well as coaching tools like talk therapy. “With experience, it’s also about asking the right questions on the spot to uncover what the client is trying to achieve through the healing process. That usually gives clues to what may be blocking their ability to heal,” she said.  Coaching is conducted one to two weeks apart, through video calls, said Tan, adding that sessions may involve only the client or the client and her partner.  After every session, the client is given “homework” practices that Tan said helps to “re-wire certain mind-body conditions with respect to what we are working with”.  Typically, clients attend up to several sessions across one to three months before they are “confident enough” to say they have resolved their condition.  “There are a handful that take longer … Everyone heals in their own time,” said Tan. The coach said that the definition of recovery is “co-created” with the client or the couple but it typically revolves around being able to have sex without pain.  “Being able to ‘force through penetration’ does not mean the vaginismus is healed,” said Tan.  The important thing to note, said Tan, is that women who successfully resolve this condition are those that “put in effort to work through the process and stick with it until they come out on the other side”. “Therapy doesn’t work if it’s the counsellor or coach giving all the pointers but the client doesn’t do the work (exercises). It has to be a co-created journey,” she said.  CNA Women is a section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-flu-vaccine-influenza-deaths-cases-international-travel-2307306,Resumption of international travel will likely mark the return of influenza: Experts,"SINGAPORE: The resumption of international travel and open borders amid loosening COVID-19 restrictions is likely to mark the return of other respiratory infections like influenza, said infectious diseases experts.  Most respiratory viruses started to decline when Singapore moved to DORSCON orange in February 2020, and became nearly absent during the “circuit breaker” from Apr 7 to Jun 1 last year, with the strictest pandemic measures in effect, said Dr Matthias Maiwald, a microbiologist with KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH).  The Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level guides Singapore's approach to outbreaks like COVID-19.  The colour-coded system - which has Green, Yellow, Orange and Red categories - shows the current situation. It also indicates what needs to be done to prevent and reduce the impact of infections. A study conducted by Dr Maiwald and Dr Wan Wei Yee, a microbiologist with the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) showed that in Phase 1 and Phase 2 of Singapore’s opening between June and December last year, some viruses “came back”, but influenza remained almost totally absent throughout this year.  “Our assessment is that the respiratory infections will return sooner or later when the measures are lifted. They will likely return when wider travel resumes, we don’t quite know when it will return but we predict it will return,” said Dr Maiwald.  The National University Hospital (NUH) saw zero cases of influenza this year, said Professor Paul Tambyah, senior consultant with its Division of Infectious Diseases.  Quoting Ministry of Health (MOH) reports on influenza surveillance, Prof Tambyah noted that Singapore had one case of influenza B in July 2021, one in April 2020 and zero cases of influenza A since March 2020.  “As there were zero cases of influenza, there was zero influenza death,” said Prof Tambyah, who is also a Professor of Medicine at the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine. However, the reasons why influenza has disappeared in most of the world while other viruses have reappeared are “unclear”, he added, noting that this was observed in NUH and across other SingHealth hospitals.  “No one has a good explanation for this. There are various theories including - cross-protection between influenza and coronaviruses, or possibly different modes of transmission between the different respiratory viruses.”  The main reasons for the sharp drop in influenza cases are COVID-19 measures - mask-wearing, increased attention to hand hygiene, social distancing and the shutdown of international travel, said Associate Professor David Lye of Nanyang Technological University’s (NTU) Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine. 
The return of influenza depends on these measures moving forward, he added.  “It is expected that once most countries open up there will be a resurgence of influenza,” he added.  “From our study, we did hypothesise that the … lack of travel was quite strongly associated with the downfall of influenza in the DORSCON orange phase,” said Dr Maiwald.   “So the reverse conclusion could be true, that when international travel recurs, influenza will come back. That is a reasonable construction.”  Safe management measures were “really effective” at reducing respiratory infections like influenza, said Professor Teo Yik Ying of the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.  However, it is “premature” to discuss deaths from influenza after the COVID-19 pandemic since this depends on whether safe management measures will continue, he added.  It also depends on whether the deaths that would “normally be attributable” to influenza would be split between COVID-19 and influenza, said Prof Teo.  In this scenario, Singapore could see slightly lower numbers of deaths from influenza, but a generally higher number of deaths when considering both diseases, he added.  It is also “possible” for Singapore to see a more severe influenza season as the COVID-19 pandemic fades, said Dr Maiwald.  “This is possible but strictly speaking, it is not known. We do not have data, but there is such a possibility,” he added.  One “nightmare scenario” after the pandemic is over could be the emergence of a new strain of influenza in early-2023, since the world has not seen influenza for “such a long time”, said Prof Tambyah.  For example, this may be a new subtype of influenza A, like H2N1, or a re-emergence of H2N2, which disappeared in 1968, he noted.  “And we will be back to square one with the next pandemic. We will have to go through the whole process we went through with each pandemic from 1918, 1957, 1968, H1N1 2009 and now the COVID-19 pandemic all over again from epidemic to pandemic to endemic,” said Prof Tambyah.  A novel strain or re-emergent strain of influenza will result in more deaths among young people than older folks, like in the 1918 pandemic, he added.  This is also similar to what happened with the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, said Prof Tambyah.  ""The older people who had lived through the 1918 influenza A H1N1 pandemic paradoxically did not have as severe disease as some of the younger people, especially pregnant women. ""This applies more to re-emergent strains than a totally new strain, although the experience of countries who have had quite severe disease in children with H5N1 is not reassuring about novel strains of influenza.""  The resulting outbreak could even be worse than the current pandemic, Prof Tambyah warned, noting that influenza has ""some similarities"" with COVID-19.  ""It spreads rapidly, can be infectious before the onset of symptoms and vaccines are not that effective in prevention,"" he added.  People are currently protected from severe seasonal influenza ""to a certain extent"" because of previous vaccination or exposure to circulating H1N1 and H3N2 strains, he noted.  ""If there is a new strain or a re-emergence of the 1957 H2N2, there is high risk that there will be a rapidly spreading pandemic that could have a much higher mortality rate than the 2 per cent reported globally for COVID-19,"" said Prof Tambyah.  While there are no overseas studies yet that show that a year with fewer influenza infections would then cause a “rebound”, the concern still remains that the risk is higher if individuals are exposed to the influenza virus and spreads it in the community, said Dr Esther Tan, a respiratory physician with SGH.  The experts who conducted the study urged individuals to not only get vaccinated for COVID-19, but also influenza. “For individuals 65 years and older we definitely recommend that you do get vaccinated. However, for the individuals that are younger than 65 years old, it is recommended for those that have specific medical conditions or indications,” Dr Tan noted.  This could include those with chronic disorders of the lung or heart, or recurrent hospitalisations due to chronic diseases like diabetes and kidney or kidney problems, she added."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/magic-mocha-cenly-eazys-slimming-products-banned-substance-hsa-2302701,3 people suffer adverse effects after taking slimming products containing banned substance,"SINGAPORE: Three people suffered adverse effects such as palpitations and nausea after taking slimming products that contained the banned substance sibutramine, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) said on Wednesday (Nov 10). The products are Magic Mocha, Thao Moc Ho Tro Giam Beo Cenly and Cynthia Beauty EazyS Instant Coffee Powder. They were sold on e-commerce sites like Carousell, Lazada, Shopee and Qoo10 and social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. ""They were marketed with misleading claims which included 'fast-acting', 'fat-burning', 'reduce fat storage' and 'accelerate the breakdown of stubborn fat',"" said HSA. The authority said it has issued warnings to the sellers and platform administrators have since removed the affected listings. HSA said it received three reports from consumers who experienced palpitations, nausea, extreme thirst, migraine or dizziness after taking the products. An analysis of the slimming products showed that they contained sibutramine, which can cause serious adverse effects. Continued intake of the products could have led to serious health consequences such as heart problems and central nervous system disorders like psychosis and hallucinations, said HSA. The authority explained that Singapore has banned sibutramine, which was a prescription-only weight loss medicine, since 2010 due to an increased risk of heart attack and strokes. Past consumers have reported other adverse effects including insomnia and hallucinations. ""In 2019, a consumer experienced extremely fast heart rate and became unconscious. She was resuscitated and suffered debilitating consequences requiring the implantation of a defibrillator (a medical device) to help her heart function,"" added HSA. The authority advised all sellers and suppliers to stop selling the products immediately. Anyone selling or supplying products adulterated with banned substances can be prosecuted and jailed for up to two years, fined up to S$10,000 or both if convicted. HSA also advised consumers to stop taking the affected slimming products immediately and consult a doctor if feeling unwell or concerned about their health. ""Be wary of products that carry exaggerated claims or deliver unexpectedly quick effects. They can contain potent ingredients that can seriously harm your health,"" said HSA. ""Exercise caution when buying such products online or from well-meaning friends. You cannot be certain where and how these products were made."" Weight control should be achieved through a combination of balanced diet and appropriate exercise, it added."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/integrated-shield-plan-disputes-be-addressed-through-new-process-2300621,Integrated Shield Plan disputes to be addressed through new process,"SINGAPORE: Private health policyholders under the Integrated Shield Plan can file to resolve clinical claim disputes through a new process from Tuesday (Nov 9).  Called the Clinical Claims Resolution Process (CCRP), it will help facilitate the resolution of disputes like unfair rejections of medically justifiable claims by insurers, as well as over-charging and overservicing by doctors or medical institutions. “While disputing parties can of course at any point in time, as in the case today, refer cases to regulators for further regulatory action, the CCRP was set up with the aim of providing an objective determination for the parties and to facilitate a more amicable resolution to any of these disputes,” said Senior Minister of State for Health Koh Poh Koon at a briefing on Monday.  This is why the process will be voluntary, he added.  The new claims resolution process will be administered by a secretariat from the Academy of Medicine Singapore, and will be the main resolution channel for disputes of clinical nature under the Integrated Shield Plan, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a press release.  The process will also be supported by funding from the Health Ministry, said Dr Philomena Tong, medical director from the ministry’s MediShield Life claims management office.  Based on numbers for similar cases filed through the Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre, MOH also estimates that the process will see about 60 to 70 cases per year, though this may “pick up”, she added. The cost of providing the new process is estimated to be about S$200,000 to S$400,000 per year, depending on the number of cases and the number of reviewers required each time, said Dr Tong, adding that these are “very rough” estimates.  Integrated Shield Plans are made up of two components – MediShield Life, run by the Central Provident Fund Board, and an additional private insurance coverage component run by insurance companies. The latter covers hospitalisation in A- and B1-type wards in public hospitals as well as private hospitals. The insurers offering Integrated Shield Plans are: AIA, Aviva, AXA, Great Eastern Life, NTUC Income, Prudential and Raffles Health Insurance. For each dispute, a panel of five members will be convened, comprising specialists from the Academy from the relevant specialty and medical directors from selected insurers with the Integrated Shield Plan, said the Health Ministry.  The Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) will also support the panel as a “consumer advocate”, the press release read.  As the process is voluntary, all parties must “mutually agree” to participate and enter into a contractual agreement to abide by the panel’s decision, said the Health Ministry.  However, parties should first attempt to resolve the disputes among themselves, before bringing it to the panel, the press release read.  The disputes should also be filed under the process within six months after the insurer’s final reply to the parties involved, said MOH in the release.  For example, policyholders with disputes about the insurers’ decision to turn down their claim should show that they have not been able to resolve the dispute with the insurer before filing one through the new process.  “This is because IP (Integrated Shield Plan) insurers have claims and dispute management capability that can deal with specific issues from an individual’s purchased IP,” the release read.  Cases brought to the panel will be anonymised to “ensure objectivity”, and those on the panel must be “free of any conflict of interest”, said MOH. Panel members will also remain anonymous to the parties involved in the dispute.  For disputes starting with insurers and medical practitioners or institutions, there will be a threshold of three incidents, said the Health Ministry.  In bringing an incident to the panel, the complainant must show that there were two or more prior related claims disputes with the other party within the last five years, indicating a pattern, the press release said.  This will ensure that one-off cases are not brought to the new process, said MOH in the release.  However, this threshold will not apply to disputes that policyholders themselves bring to the panel.  Those filing a claim dispute through the new process can do so online at www.ccrp.com.sg. They will also need to pay an administrative fee per dispute - S$50, S$200 and S$500 for policyholders, medical practitioners, and medical institutions or insurers respectively.  Where there are subsequent cases involving “recalcitrant parties”, the complainant may be advised by the panel to refer the case to regulators including the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), MOH or the Singapore Medical Council, depending on which parties are involved, said Dr Koh.  “MAS has informed MOH that they will take appropriate supervisory action against any insurer who has been determined by the CCRP panel to be at fault and recalcitrant,” he added.  The number of private specialists on Integrated Shield Plan panels has also increased, said Dr Koh, adding that the committee has been working to increase the size of the panels to provide policyholders with a wider choice of specialists.  Currently, close to 80 per cent of 1,235 active private specialists are on at least one Integrated Shield Plan panel panel, said MOH in the press release.  This figure was about 20 per cent in 2019, Dr Koh noted.  Most Integrated Shield Plan insurers have “further committed” to gathering at least 500 private specialists for their panels by the end of this year, said the Health Ministry.  With this increase, about 80 to 90 per cent of private medical institution claims will be from providers on panels, the press release read. “The MHIC has made very good progress in giving patients wider access to panel doctors and better choices to their appropriateness of care,” said Dr Koh.  With the launch of the new claims resolution process, patients, Integrated Shield Plan policy holders, doctors and insurers will have a platform for their issues to be deliberated on and resolved fairly, objectively and “hopefully much more amicably”, he added.  “With patients’ and policyholders’ interests at heart, MOH will continue to support the work of the MHIC and also this CCRP process to ensure that issues are heard and resolved between all the stakeholders.” "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/dining-groups-five-vaccinated-same-household-restaurants-hawker-centres-2298466,Fully vaccinated household members can dine out in groups of five from Nov 10,"SINGAPORE: Fully vaccinated people from the same household can dine out together in groups of up to five from Wednesday (Nov 10), announced co-chair of the multi-ministry COVID-19 task force Gan Kim Yong.  The easing of dining-out restrictions will not apply to those from different households, where the cap remains at two fully vaccinated people, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a separate press release.  It will also not apply to hawker centres and coffee shops, as F&B outlets must be able to administer ""comprehensive"" vaccination checks, the ministry said.  “We are prepared to extend the same concession to hawker centres and coffee shops once they have put in place additional control measures.”  The National Environment Agency and Singapore Food Agency will engage the hawkers’ associations and coffee shop operators on this, and further updates will be provided when ready, the ministry said.  F&B outlets will also be allowed to play ""soft recorded music"" from Wednesday, but live music and entertainment remain banned. Social gatherings are still limited to a maximum of two people and should be kept at one a day, whether to another household or in a public place. The cap on household visitors remains unchanged at two a day; this does not apply to grandchildren being cared for by grandparents. Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Mr Gan noted that although Singapore is still recording more than 3,000 new COVID-19 cases per day, the situation has stabilised in the past two weeks.  “The week-on-week ratio of infections has come down to below one over the last few days, and it was at 0.81 as of Nov 7. The number of cases in hospitals and the proportion of cases with serious illness has also remained stable,” he said.  Thanking Singaporeans for “working together” to slow down the transmission of COVID-19, Mr Gan said: “With the situation stabilising, we are now in a better position to ease some of our safe management measures without overwhelming our healthcare system.""  While the number of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and under intensive care remains high, it is stable – ICU utilisation is ""hovering at around 70 per cent"", said MOH.  Authorities will also explore the further easing of measures for fully vaccinated people, with vaccination-differentiated safe management measures and pre-activity testing, said Mr Gan.  This will begin with pilot resumption of more activities for those who are fully vaccinated in sports and selected meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE) events. If successful, it will be extended to other settings, said the Health Ministry. More school activities will also resume, including in-person classes, group work and co-curricular activities, said Mr Gan.  “These are very important for the education for our children,” said Mr Gan, who is also Trade and Industry Minister. He added that the Education Ministry will provide more details later.  The capacity at cinemas, live performances and MICE events will be increased. Safe management measures for businesses will also be refined to “better facilitate operations”, he said. “As we gradually reopen, it is inevitable that the number of COVID-19 cases will rise, as seen in our past experience.  “We will need to continue to protect those that are unvaccinated as they are at higher risk of severe outcomes,” said Mr Gan.  Task force co-chair Lawrence Wong said despite the easing of restrictions, people should not ""let their guard down"". ""We have been careful in putting together this package of adjustments which we hope will be meaningful for families to dine-in together, as well as for sports, school life and other activities to resume, all this while keeping risks under control,” said Mr Wong.  “We are easing off slightly on the bicycle brakes, but we must not let our guard down and lose control as we go downslope,” he added.  “It’s not just about adjusting the rules, it’s also about how all of us as individuals and as a community behave and respond,” said Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister, urging the public to remain vigilant.  “If we take this approach, then we can avoid a sharp resurgence of cases, we can protect our healthcare system, and we can support all our healthcare workers through the coming weeks and months.” "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/f1-pit-building-covid-19-treatment-elderly-patients-2295126,COVID-19 treatment facility at F1 Pit Building to accept patients from Nov 9,"SINGAPORE: The F1 Pit Building at Marina Bay, used for Singapore's Grand Prix races before the pandemic, has been converted into a COVID-19 treatment facility that will start taking in patients from Nov 9. The 721-bed facility will only take in elderly COVID-19 patients – those who are unvaccinated and above 70 years old, or vaccinated and above 80 years old.  They have to be generally well and should also be independent, without needing assistance in daily activities like going to the toilet or having meals.  “Most of these patients are stable, but they have stable chronic diseases. For example, diabetes, hypertension, (high) cholesterol, but they are elderly, 70 years or more, and are diagnosed with COVID-19,” said medical director of the centre Dr Jonathan Ong.  These patients typically “require a higher level of care”, he added.  Patients will be admitted after assessment by hospitals. They will also be monitored by medical staff round the clock. With its number of beds and focus on elderly patients, the facility will help to “decongest” public healthcare institutions, Dr Ong said.  Singapore's soaring COVID-19 cases – with thousands of new infections reported daily – have placed significant strain on its healthcare system. Nearly 90 per cent of the 1,650 isolation beds for COVID-19 patients in public hospitals have been filled. Health Minister Ong Ye Kung on Saturday said 17 community facilities and private hospitals, with a total of 2,300 beds, have been set aside for COVID-19 treatment. ""We expect to add even more (COVID-19 treatment facility) capacity, reaching around 4,000 beds by the end of this month,"" he said in a Facebook post.  The F1 Pit Building treatment facility was set up by the National University Health System with private healthcare group Health Management International, which will also supply doctors and nurses to staff the centre. The space was provided by the Singapore Tourism Board, and planning and design of the facility by MOH Holdings and Surbana Jurong. Integrated Health Information Systems will provide tech support with more than 80 computers-on-wheels and Mandarin Oriental hotel will curate ""a healthy menu"" and engage the seniors through activities, said the minister. The three-storey facility has 721 beds, eight isolation rooms and 12 sick bays.  There are three wards on the second floor and four on the third, and each ward will be manned by up to 17 staff members, said Dr Ong, who is also a consultant with the National University Hospital’s neurology division.  Patients will be segregated by gender – men will stay on the second floor and women on the third floor. The wards overlook the F1 track and Kallang River area.  Three meals a day are provided and free Wi-Fi is available. A care pack is given to patients with basic necessities like a mug, a toothbrush and toothpaste, as well as face masks, Milo, instant coffee packets and crackers. Patients also get a towel, a pillow and a personal cabinet with a lock to store their belongings.  Seniors can also take part in daily activities like games and magic shows, as well as use provided materials in the communal areas for reading, light exercise and handicraft.  In conceptualising the facility, the team wanted to ensure it was “elder-friendly”, said Dr Ong.  “From the lighting, to the way that the beds are arranged, to the care packs that we've given them, to the activity area where they can participate in daily activities to occupy their time, such as visual therapy, simple exercises,” he said.  “All this we believe will go a long way in preventing the elderly from functionally declining significantly prior to their discharge back to the community. We’re catering to both their mental and physical wellness.”  Beds are set up in pairs, with a set of tables and chairs between them, to “encourage communal chit chat” among the patients, said Dr Ong.  “This is quite a nice concept that we envisaged so that they can care for one another.”  Beds are also equipped with an emergency call button, so patients can call for a doctor or nurse in an emergency. In the corridors between beds, guiding lights close to the floor light the way to help prevent falls. Grab bars and anti-slip mats are also installed in the toilets.  For privacy, eight changing rooms have been set up at each ward, and these rooms can also be used to conduct swab tests for the patients.  The project was first initiated in mid-October, and the team was given about two weeks to set up the facility, said Mr Brian Lim, assistant director with MOH Holdings’ infrastructure projects division.  Since the original lifts at the building were too small for the transfer of patients in a hospital trolley, an industrial construction lift had to be installed, he added.  The facility also has an onsite 24/7 emergency ambulance service with trained paramedics and an ambulance driver, who will transfer patients to the nearest hospital - according to Singapore Civil Defence Force protocols - if necessary.  “While we have catered for such events, we do not foresee this to happen very frequently because part of the medical commitment for this facility is daily ward rounds,” said Dr Ong.  “And we aim to pick up parameters early, address them early, such that they do not deteriorate to the point that we will need to activate this whole chain of events.”  To be discharged from the facility, vaccinated patients will have to clear a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab test on Day 6 from when they were confirmed to have COVID-19, and Day 10 for unvaccinated patients.  If they test positive, vaccinated and unvaccinated patients will be discharged on Day 10 and Day 14 respectively.  Patients who test negative but are still sick may be transferred to a hospital. For patients who are COVID-positive but want to leave the facility and recover at home, the Ministry of Health will assess whether they meet the criteria for the home recovery programme.  Family members must be aware of their decision, and the patient must sign a form acknowledging that they will return home and follow the home recovery programme protocol, he added.  “To the uncles and aunties that will be coming to us, we reassure you that you'll be well looked after in this facility, right from the infrastructure as well as the intentionality of how we curate your meals, as well as your sanitation and your everyday needs,” said Dr Ong.  “We reassure that you will recover well, be happy and return back to your loved ones at the end of your stay here.”  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ncid-covid-19-research-workgroup-wins-award-pandemic-response-2293931,COVID-19 Research Workgroup at NCID wins national award for contributions to pandemic response,"SINGAPORE: The COVID-19 Research Workgroup at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) has won the National Clinical Excellence Team Award for its role in the pandemic response in Singapore and globally. The work group is among six recipients of the National Medical Excellence Awards 2021 announced by the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Friday (Nov 5). In a news release, MOH said the recipients were recognised “for excellence in the areas of care quality, patient safety, research, as well as education and training”. Among the COVID-19 Research Workgroup’s achievements is the world’s first SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation antibody test to identify people previously infected with the virus and who subsequently developed an adaptive immune response. The team was involved in the use of remdesivir and baricitinib to treat COVID-19 patients in Singapore. It also helped provide patient samples used to develop the Regeneron monoclonal antibodies, which have since been shown to be effective in treating hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 in the RECOVERY trial in the UK. The work group was convened on Jan 22, 2020, a day before Singapore reported its first confirmed coronavirus case. Chaired by Professor Leo Yee Sin with Associate Professor David Lye as deputy chairman, it is aimed at conducting studies to better understand COVID-19 and its transmission in Singapore. The team is advised by MOH’s chief health scientist Tan Chorh Chuan. Professor Lisa Ng of A*STAR, Dr Barnaby Young of NCID and Dr Chia Wan Ni of Duke-NUS Medical School are also part of the team. On Jan 24 last year, it recruited its first subject for PROTECT, a study to detect novel pathogens and characterise emerging infections according to an outbreak drawer protocol developed in 2012. The protocol “served as a foundation platform covering all public hospitals in Singapore, and enabled the collection of clinical data and biological samples for research”, said MOH. More than 600 COVID-19 patients had participated as of December 2020. The work group made “significant research contributions” in the pandemic, leading to “improved standards of care, diagnosis, health outcomes, and management of COVID-19 patients both locally and globally”, said MOH. Twenty-three of the 212 publications the group has produced made it to “top-tier scientific journals”, said MOH. These include the New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, JAMA, Science, Nature and Cell. MOH added that their findings “have been translated and incorporated into investigation of outbreaks, infection control measures, and public health policies on quarantine and isolation”. The National Outstanding Clinician Award was given to Professor Dale Fisher of National University Hospital, one of 12 international experts selected for the first WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 to China to investigate and advise on the global response. Prof Fisher also advised on strategies to manage the COVID-19 outbreak at foreign worker dormitories, and enhanced risk communication and communication engagement by helping to establish My Brother SG. “This initiative has received WHO funding to develop a sustained system to support future COVID-19 needs as well as chronic diseases and mental health issues in foreign workers,” said MOH. The National Clinical Excellence Team Award went to the GPFirst programme, an initiative spearheaded by Changi General Hospital in 2014 to encourage patients with mild to moderate conditions to visit a general practitioner instead of presenting themselves at the Accident & Emergency (A&E) Department at first instance. The programme has benefitted more than 33,000 patients in the East from 2014 to 2019 and resulted in a 14 per cent reduction in proportion of attendances at A&E with mild and moderate conditions, as well as a 36.6 per cent reduction in walk-in attendances, according to MOH. It has since been implemented in other hospitals, including Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, National University Hospital, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, Sengkang General Hospital and Woodlands Health Campus. Another recipient, Professor Chong Siow Ann, won the National Outstanding Clinician Scientist Award “for his outstanding contributions to mental health research and treatment, and changing the perception of mental illness”. The National Outstanding Clinician Mentor Award and National Outstanding Clinician Educator Award were given to Associate Professor Wong Kok Seng and Professor Tan Hak Koon respectively. Health Minister Ong Ye Kung gave out the awards at a ceremony held on Friday. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/how-stop-snoring-singapore-survey-2293241,"Stop snoring: Singapore is third noisiest city in the world, according to UK survey","If you’ve been sleepless in Singapore because of the noisy snorer next to you, you’re not alone. According to a UK survey, Singapore has been ranked the third noisiest snoring city across the world – if Google searches are any indication. The results were based on 50 search terms centred around the topic of snoring, and how many times the terms were searched in each location over the last 12 months. The survey, by UK bedding company Sleepseeker, then calculated the number of searches per 1,000 people in each city and ranked the locations accordingly.  Just how desperate Singaporeans are for snoring solutions? In the past year, our population of 5.8 million has made 139,070 online searches about snoring or the rate of 24 searches per 1,000 people.  The world’s top snoring city is the Irish capital Dublin. Here, its population of 1.2 million rakes in 45,510 snoring-related searches, and has a rate of 37.9 searches per 1,000 residents. People aren’t sleeping well in Australia’s capital Canberra either, the second noisiest city on the list and home to about 447,000 people. Here, snorers have led to 14,580 searches and a rate of 32.6 searches per 1,000 residents.   The list of nine English-speaking cities also included Wellington, London, Ottawa, Kingston, Cape Town and Washington DC.  TONGUE TAICHI, ANYONE? Like the muscles in your body, the muscles controlling your tongue and those at the back of the throat can also be strengthened, said Dr Ruebini Anandarajan, the head of dental services at SingHealth Polyclinics. There are upper airway exercises you can perform, though she advised that it is best to do them under the supervision of your sleep specialist. Here are some basic examples you can try at least once a day, said Dr Anandarajan: Tongue curls: Open your mouth wide and stretch your tongue down as far as possible towards your chin. Hold for at least 5 seconds. Repeat 5 times. Tongue press: Suck your tongue upwards against the hard palate. Continue sucking while opening your mouth wide. Repeat up to 5 times. Tongue taichi: Poke your tongue against your left and right cheek alternately. You can increase the resistance against the tongue by pushing your cheek against the tongue with your fingers. Hold for 5 seconds. Repeat up to 5 times on each side. Swallow saliva: Hold your tongue between your lips and swallow your saliva. Repeat up to 5 times. Mouth blowing: Inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth while keeping your lips pressed together like blowing an imaginary balloon. Blow for 5 seconds. You can repeat up to 10 times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/protein-supplements-shakes-bars-bad-health-2287831,Commentary: Protein shakes and superfoods - is there more hype than actual benefits?,"SALEM, Oregon: Do you ever blend up a protein smoothie for breakfast, or grab a protein bar following an afternoon workout? If so, you are likely among the millions of people in search of more protein-rich diets. Protein-enriched products are ubiquitous, and these days it seems protein can be infused into anything – even water. But the problem, as Kristi Wempen, a nutritionist at Mayo Clinic, points out, is that “contrary to all the hype that everyone needs more protein, most Americans get twice as much as they need.” Many of us living in the most economically developed countries are buying into a myth of protein deficiency created and perpetuated by food companies and a wide array of self-identified health experts.  Global retail sales of protein supplement products – usually containing a combination of whey, casein or plant-based proteins such as peas, soy or brown rice – reached a staggering US$18.9 billion in 2020, with the US making up around half of the market. EXPERTS WEIGH IN Weight-loss surgeon Garth Davis writes in his book Proteinaholic that “‘eat more protein’ may be the worst advice ‘experts’ give to the public”. Davis contends that most physicians in the US have never actually examined a patient with protein deficiency because simply by eating an adequate number of daily calories we are also most likely getting enough protein. In fact, Americans currently consume almost two times the National Academy of Medicine’s recommended daily intake of protein: 56g for men and 46g for women – the equivalent of two eggs, a half-cup of nuts and 3 ounces of meat – although optimal protein intake may vary depending on age and activity level. For example, if you’re a dedicated athlete you might need to consume higher quantities of protein. Generally, though, a 140-pound person should not exceed 120g of protein per day, particularly because a high protein diet can strain kidney and liver function and increase risks of developing heart disease and cancer. Walter Willett, chairman of the department of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, describes high protein intake as “one of the fundamental processes that increase the risk of cancer.” Beyond these concerns, processed supplements and protein bars are often packed with calories and may contain more sugar than a candy bar. As stated in The New York Times, however, “the protein supplement market is booming among the young and healthy,” those who arguably need it least. The retail sales of protein products in the United States were at US$9 billion in 2020, up from about US$6.6 billion in 2015. Fats and carbohydrates have, along with sugar, taken turns being vilified since the identification of macronutrients (fats, proteins and carbs) over a century ago. As food writer Bee Wilson points out, protein has managed to remain the “last macronutrient left standing.” Why has protein endured as the supposed holy grail of nutrients, with many of us wholeheartedly joining the quest to consume ever-greater quantities? The history of manufacturing and marketing protein-enriched products goes back almost as far as the discovery of protein itself. German chemist Justus von Liebig, one of the earliest to identify and study macronutrients, came to regard protein “as the only true nutrient.” Liebig was also the first to mass-produce and distribute a product associated with protein in the 1860s, “Liebig’s Extract of Meat.” Author Gyorgy Scrinis writes that through “advertising and favourable publicity, the [Liebig’s Extract of Meat] company achieved ‘considerable success.’” Particularly for those who could not afford to purchase meat, the extract seemed a reasonable and satiating substitute. Protein consumption has remained a central component of nutritional advice and marketing campaigns ever since, even amid recycled and recurring arguments over the optimal amount of protein and whether plant or animal sources are best. Around the time Liebig launched his extract company, John Harvey Kellogg, a staunch vegetarian, set out to redefine traditional American meals at his health sanitarium in Battle Creek, Michigan. The Kellogg family invented flaked breakfast cereals, granola, nut butters and various “nut meats,” which they produced, packaged, marketed and sold across the nation. Kellogg wrote countless tracts denouncing meat-heavy diets and assuring readers that high-protein plant foods could easily replace meat. In an April 1910 issue of his periodical “Good Health,” Kellogg posited that “Beans, peas, lentils and nuts afford an ample proportion of the protein elements which are essential for blood making and tissue building.” Alongside the meat and cereal companies consistently touting the high protein content of their foods, the first processed protein shake appeared on the market in 1952 with bodybuilder mogul Bob Hoffman’s Hi-Proteen Shakes, made from a combination of soy protein, whey and flavorings. In the 1970s through the 1990s, protein products remained visible but receded somewhat with the dietary spotlight firmly fixed on low-calorie, low-fat, sugar-free snack foods and beverages following the publication of studies linking sugar and saturated fat consumption to heart disease.  These decades gave us Slimfast and Diet Coke as well as fat-free (and guilt-free) SnackWell’s cookies and Lay’s potato chips. New research in 2003, however, suggested high-protein diets could aid in weight loss, and protein quickly regained its former nutrient-superstar status. Entire diets followed, each offering an array of protein drinks and bars. Robert Atkins first published his low-carb, high-protein “Dr Atkins’ Diet Revolution” in 1982. It went on to become one of the 50 best-selling books of all time by the early 2000s, despite a New England Journal of Medicine article in 2003 clearly recommending: “Longer and larger studies [were] required to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat diets” such as Atkins’. The long-term pursuit of protein in hopes of achieving bigger muscles, smaller waists and fewer hunger pangs shows no sign of abating, and there has never been a dearth of those willing to take advantage of the public’s dietary goals by handing out unnecessary advice or a new protein-packed product. In the end, most people living in high-income nations are consuming enough protein. When we replace meals with a protein bar or shake, we also risk missing out on the rich sources of antioxidants, vitamins and many other benefits of real food.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/covid-19-self-test-vending-machines-hiv-prevention-2283856,Commentary: Could the use of COVID-19 self-test kits and vending machines be replicated for HIV testing?,"SINGAPORE: When the pandemic first struck, countries around the world started out testing for COVID-19 only among symptomatic individuals with a travel history or were close contacts of a case.  This was a laborious process. A doctor took swabs at the clinic and sent them off for testing in a laboratory. Today, in Singapore, rapid self-test kits can be dispensed at vending machines islandwide. They are distributed through the mail, schools and employers, and readily available over-the-counter in supermarkets and pharmacies. Rapid and on-demand COVID-19 testing is a key pillar of Singapore’s strategy to emerge from ongoing surges towards endemic living. Whether it’s because we might have been exposed, feel a cough coming on or want to protect vulnerable loved ones, testing gives us peace of mind over our health status. It informs what we do next – or not do – to prevent onward transmission to others in the community. Easy access to COVID-19 testing has clear benefits: It saves time and money, encourages social responsibility and reduces intermingling of potential cases in the community.  Normalising access can also lower other barriers to testing, such as apprehension and stigma.  As the local KTV cluster grew in July, karaoke lounge customers must have found it hard to proactively go to the clinic, tell the doctor about exposure, get swabbed and then explain to the family why they end up under quarantine.  Such stigma complicated testing in South Korea in May 2020 after outbreaks were linked to clubs popular with the gay community. Much easier to get reassurance by ripping open a foil bag and waiting 15 minutes, no questions asked.   The speedy roll-out of COVID-19 self-testing and use of innovations like vending machines in Singapore show off possibilities for the prevention of other infectious diseases.  These approaches aren’t actually novel. They have been available for about a decade. The path for COVID-19 testing was paved by another global epidemic most of us forget is still ongoing – HIV.  Self-testing and vending machines have been adopted in the HIV responses in countries like the United States and China but, ironically, not in Singapore.  If an infected person doesn’t get tested, how would they know to inform their partner and seek timely treatment?  This is precisely the problem for about 20 per cent of those living with HIV in Singapore, according to the Ministry of Health (MOH), who don’t actually know they are infected because they haven’t been tested.  Consider this again, when we see 261 new cases reported in 2020 and almost 9,000 diagnosed over the last 35 years. Like COVID-19, HIV testing is important because undiagnosed infections can contribute to wider transmission. There is unequivocal evidence that those who start treatment early and become virally suppressed, meaning they have a low virus level in their bodies and cannot transmit HIV sexually. A series of landmark studies conducted over the past decade found zero infections observed among HIV-negative partners of people with HIV who were virally suppressed, even without the use of other prevention methods, such as condoms or pre-exposure prophylaxis.  Testing later means infected individuals can unknowingly transmit HIV in that longer period and treatment will be delayed.  Getting people to self-initiate HIV testing, however, is incredibly challenging. The proportion of new cases diagnosed through self-initiated testing is falling. Only 16 per cent in 2020 were diagnosed this way, despite 115 clinics offering rapid HIV testing and 10 providing anonymous testing – where MOH will not be notified of positive test results under the Infectious Diseases Act.  It’s well-established that stigma is a key barrier to HIV testing. Stigma arises often out of fear that individuals will be judged for their sexual activities. Even the possibility of being seen in or bumping into an acquaintance outside sexual health clinics can induce such worry.  HIV self-testing offers the anonymity, convenience and autonomy more might need to overcome the heavy burden of stigma. Experience in the US, where self-test kits have been approved for home use since 2012, shows clear benefits. Almost 45 000 new diagnoses were made in the first year self-testing became available - infected individuals who otherwise would have never been tested and missed.  In practice, HIV self-testing resembles either a finger prick test like for diabetes or an oral swab and test strips like for COVID-19 antigen rapid testing (ART) kits most of us are now familiar with. Given how readily we accepted self-testing for COVID-19, we can apply this to other diseases like HIV, if we can address two main implementation concerns. First, like a COVID-19 ART positive result at home, there is no automatic notification to MOH if individuals self-test positive for HIV. This is unlike those who seek testing in a clinic. HIV-infected individuals are thus not linked to healthcare services to get the follow-up they need. But this is not a new problem. Existing anonymous HIV testing also does not require MOH notification, but the big difference is that the testing centre can subsequently act as a touchpoint to guide the person on seeking care. A great many end up doing so thanks to financial support, provided by community groups like Action for AIDS Singapore, to incentivise linkages to the healthcare system. Second, self-testing outside of a clinic or centre makes it difficult to provide pre- and post-testing counselling. Counselling helps individuals learn more about their risks of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections and how to better protect themselves.  But this can be mitigated with digital health innovations such as telehealth and the provision of printed information to accompany test kits - including contacts to support hotlines, advocacy groups and other safe spaces people can seek help without judgement. While less sensitive than the “gold standard” polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, antigen rapid testing has demonstrated a clear value proposition in the fight against COVID-19.  Rapid testing has allowed business, schools and events to restart safely and gradually. Quarantine times are shortened. People gain new mastery over their health. PCR resources can also be better prioritised for unwell patients in clinics and hospitals. Similarly, HIV self-testing won’t replace existing interventions and programmes, but helps extend healthcare and support to people underserved by existing interventions and bridge gaps in prevention and care. The scientific and healthcare community in Singapore and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS target tto end new HIV transmissions and AIDS by 2030. Self-testing can help us reach that goal, but ultimately, still requires initiative, awareness of our own risk and a shift in public mindset around some common misconceptions.  HIV and COVID-19 infections are of course different. But what our COVID-19 experience shows is that Singapore can be pragmatic about precautions and testing when fighting pandemics.  If we can do self-testing for COVID-19, we should be able to do it for HIV too.

Here’s a quick reminder: At the airport: Maintain a distance from people and keep your mask on. Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth before sanitising or washing your hands.  In the aircraft cabin: There’s no need to wipe down common exposed surfaces, such as the armrests and headrest, said Alvin Tan, the founder and managing director of Sureclean, a Singapore-based professional cleaning service.  But the foldaway tray and in-flight entertainment control could have corners and crevices that are hard to reach by the cleaning crew, he said. So, wash or sanitise your hands after touching such common areas, especially before eating, he said.  In the bathroom: Avoid touching unnecessary surfaces other than the door lock, toilet seat, flush button and tap, advised Tan, as some passengers may remove their masks while inside the lavatory. “Possible areas that may be overlooked are the surfaces outside the lavatories, where other passengers may be waiting and possibly come into contact with you,” he said.  On the go: If you’re driving, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends designating someone who isn’t high-risk to be the runner for snacks and drinks at the petrol stations. Have him or her sanitise the hands before coming back into the car.  While filling up on petrol, avoid using your handphone to minimise contaminating the screen. It is also a good idea to keep the windows open if possible to boost ventilation, advised the CDC.  If you’re using ride-share services, keep your mask on and bring a hand sanitiser to use when you arrive at your destination. The CDC recommends not using carpool services as they put you in close proximity with strangers. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/covid-19-coronavirus-flu-influenza-cold-cough-fever-cases-death-hospital-2285371,Commentary: Flu will return with vengeance after all-time low during COVID-19,"NORWICH, United Kingdom: Although COVID-19 infections are currently low or in decline in most Western countries aside from the United Kingdom, there’s still a long way to go before the threat of the pandemic is over. A big concern this winter is if there’s a resurgence of COVID-19 with other respiratory illnesses coming back strongly alongside it – particularly influenza. In both the southern and northern hemispheres, influenza infections rapidly declined and largely disappeared soon into pandemic. Social distancing measures used to contain COVID-19 were even more effective in reducing the spread of influenza. But unfortunately, this means we now need to be braced for flu to be especially bad this year. In some ways, immune responses to COVID-19 and influenza are the same. A relatively recent infection or vaccination provides good protection against a subsequent infection, but soon that protection starts to wane. Early reinfections, however, are generally asymptomatic or relatively mild. But the longer the gap between generating immunity and being reinfected, the more severe the subsequent infection is likely to be. This is particularly obvious when looking at how influenza affects people who live on remote islands. Because they can go for long periods without being exposed to the flu, when they do eventually encounter it, their mortality rates are higher. One study that looked at people living in Tristan da Cunha, a group of isolated south Atlantic islands, found that having just a few years between flu exposures appeared to increase the risk of the disease. So the concern is that, with COVID-19 control measures having almost completely limited people’s exposure to flu over the last 18 months, natural immunity will have fallen across the population. We’ve essentially all been living on remote islands since the beginning of 2020 thanks to the lockdowns, travel restrictions and work-from-home measures that have been deployed. When flu does return, it therefore may affect more people and cause more severe disease than we would normally see in a typical flu season. The same will probably also apply to other respiratory viruses. In fact, this might already be happening. Recently, there have been many anecdotal reports of people getting particularly severe colds in the UK. However, it’s not easy to predict when exactly flu will return, nor how much worse or more common it will be. At present, influenza rates are still quite low in the UK, but this could change quite rapidly if the virus starts to spread. Fortunately, we have safe and effective flu vaccines that reduce both the risk of infection and severe disease. But they aren’t as effective as most of the current COVID-19 vaccines. Plus, how well they work varies year on year. Flu viruses mutate more quickly, meaning multiple strains end up circulating and changing each year. If what turns out to be the dominant viral strain each winter isn’t included in the vaccine, then its effectiveness will be lower. Recommendations for which viruses to include in annual flu vaccines – created separately for the northern and southern hemisphere winters – are made by the World Health Organization, which assesses strains that have been circulating beforehand. But with flu cases having been so low this past 18 months, predicting which viruses will be dominant this winter is more difficult than usual. So on top of potentially being more susceptible to flu, there’s also a greater than normal risk this year of having a vaccine that isn’t as effective as usual. Even before the pandemic, winter flu added significant pressure on both general practitioner services and hospitals each year. Handling it now, at a time when the health service has many COVID-19 patients occupying hospital beds, would be especially difficult and would intensify pressure on the health service further still. Ultimately, more strain on the NHS puts people’s health at risk. But there’s also an additional risk: Co-infection. It’s possible to have COVID-19 at the same time as another bacterial, fungal or viral infection. In fact, one study that looked at hospitalised COVID-19 patients estimated that 19 per cent were also carrying another infection. It found that patients with co-infections were more likely to die. Early in the pandemic, when influenza was still circulating, UK-based researchers were able to compare the outcomes of people with COVID-19 alone vs a COVID-influenza co-infection. People with a co-infection were about twice as likely to be admitted to intensive care, twice as likely to require ventilation and about twice as likely to die than those who just had COVID-19. It’s not possible to say if we’ll see a major influenza epidemic in the UK this year. But if not, there will almost certainly be one soon. And when influenza does return, it’s likely to affect more people than in most pre-COVID-19 years and cause more deaths than is typical. The number could be sizeable. In a bad winter, flu kills over 20,000 people in England. Because of the direct threat posed – and the increased pressure flu will put on health services that will probably still be struggling to cope with COVID-19 – it is doubly important that people take up the offer of influenza and booster COVID-19 vaccines if and when offered.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mental-health-treatment-depression-suicide-2285051,"Almost 50,000 Singapore residents received mental health treatment every year from 2016 to 2019: MOH","SINGAPORE: About 49,800 Singapore residents received treatment for mental health issues every year on average from 2016 to 2019, said Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministry of Health (MOH) Rahayu Mahzam on Tuesday (Nov 2).  This number includes those seen at public and private hospitals, polyclinics and general practitioner clinics, she added.  Data for 2020 is not available yet, said Ms Rahayu, responding to a parliamentary question from Member of Parliament Faisal Manap (WP-Aljunied). Mr Faisal had asked for the number of people receiving treatment for mental health issues every year from 2016 to 2020, those treated for depression and anxiety, and the demographics and causes of these cases.  The average number of residents seeking care for depression and anxiety every year was 33,700 and 34,000 respectively in the same period, though this includes repeat attendances and are “not unique headcounts”, said Ms Rahayu in her response.  About 60 per cent of patients with anxiety or depression are under 60 years old, 70 per cent of them are Chinese, and about 30 per cent live in three-room or smaller public flats, she added.  “Breakdown by patients’ education level is not available,” she added.  The 2016 Singapore Mental Health Study (SMHS) found that unemployment, as well as divorced or separated marital status are “significantly associated” with depression, said Ms Rahayu.  “The same study postulated that stress may be a risk factor for development of anxiety disorder. The 2010 SMHS found that nearly half of those with depression and anxiety also had a chronic physical illness.”  Mr Faisal also asked about the annual number of suicides and attempted suicides, as well as the demographics and causes of these cases.  Younger people aged 19 and below account for “disproportionately fewer” suicides, said Ms Rahayu in her response.  The converse is true for people aged 60 and above, she said, noting that the number of suicide cases is public information, released by the Immigration and Checkpoint Authority (ICA) in its annual report on the registration of births and deaths.  According to the 2020 report published in June this year, there were 452 deaths by suicide in 2020, up from 400 in 2019. Of the 452 cases in 2020, 320 were male and 132 were female. Regarding the demographics of suicide cases, Ms Rayayu said: “By race, Malays account for disproportionately fewer suicides, while converse is true for Indians. Breakdown by education level and economic background (is) not available,”  “There are usually multiple factors that may lead a person to commit and attempt suicide. These factors include relationship, family, social, financial, mental and physical health issues.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/painful-sex-causes-dyspareunia-vaginismus-psychological-fear-2268992,What causes painful sex and how can it affect your marriage?,"For some, sex is a pleasurable experience that deepens the bond between two people. But for others, it is excruciating – and in more ways than one. Why? There are typically two conditions that relate to painful sexual intercourse: Vaginismus and dyspareunia.  Women who suffer from vaginismus are unable to tolerate any form of vaginal penetration due to pain, including medical procedures such as Pap smears. This makes sex “entirely not possible”, said Dr Kelly Loi, an obstetrician and gynaecologist at Mount Elizabeth Fertility Centre. In fact, for patients with severe vaginismus, even the thought of a pelvic examination may cause them to experience palpitations, trembling and nausea, she said. “With dyspareunia, sex is possible but painful and uncomfortable,” Dr Loi added. Partly because of the “difficulties in distinguishing between the two conditions in clinical practice”, both conditions are now classified under one category – genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder (GPPPD), said Dr Tan Tse Yeun, a consultant at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) Department of Reproductive Medicine. Typically, the cause of dyspareunia is vaginismus, which is said to be the most common form of female sexual dysfunction among its patients. But before that is determined, doctors will first eliminate other possible causes, which may include “infections, inflammatory skin conditions, neurological causes, hormonal causes and even structural causes that affect the female genital system”, said Dr Grace Huang, a general practitioner at DTAP Clinic, whose work is focused on women’s and sexual health.  For many women, what causes vaginismus and ultimately, dyspareunia, is an “intense fear of and anxiety about pain before or during vaginal penetration”, said Dr Tan.  “When women anticipate that pain will recur during penetration, their vaginal muscles tighten, making subsequent attempts at sexual intercourse even more painful, resulting in a vicious cycle of pain and worsening fear,” she said. And what causes this fear?  The root cause may differ between individuals, said Dr Huang. “Often, an individual’s subjective sexual experience, thoughts, emotions and behaviour play a role in contributing to her difficulties.” For some women, the anxiety comes from past emotional or sexual abuse, or physical trauma such as a bad childbirth experience, said Dr Loi.  “Very often, however, there is no explanation,” she said.  Nonetheless the whole experience is “very distressing”, said Dr Huang, adding that in severe cases, it can lead to the non-consummation of marriage.  “THE GUILT HAD ACCUMULATED SO MUCH” This was the reality for two individuals CNA Women spoke to.  Kim (not her real name) was unable to consummate her marriage at first as she continuously experienced pain during sex.  “I don’t think I coped well. I felt great pain and anxiety during sexual intercourse, so even though we tried a few times, we were not successful,” she told CNA Women. Several months into her marriage in 2018, the 30-year-old administrator consulted a gynaecologist at KKH about her irregular periods.  The doctor wanted to perform a Pap smear and vaginal ultrasound as part of the investigations on her condition, but Kim was unable to go through with the procedures due to “great pain, fear and stress”, said Cheong Xinyi, principal psychologist with KKH's psychology service. Later that year, Kim was diagnosed with vaginismus, attributed to “sexual naivety and inexperience with processes of sexual intimacy due to a conservative upbringing”, said Cheong. The diagnosis was confusing at first, Kim said. “I didn't quite understand it since it was not a commonly known condition. Even though I was very fearful, I knew that for the sake of myself and my family, I needed to resolve this issue so I gathered my courage and agreed to be referred to the Sexual Health Clinic,” she said.  The Sexual Health Clinic, which is operated under the KKH Women’s Health and Wellness Centre, is said to provide the only multidisciplinary care service in Singapore for women with sexual dysfunction conditions. It adopted this multidisciplinary approach, which harnesses the expertise and support of various specialists including physicians, psychologists and physiotherapists, in 2015. Kim said she visited the clinic monthly for about five months and met with various specialists who worked with her on different aspects of her condition. “The initial period is the most challenging period … For the first three months, I was afraid of the desensitisation exercises (such as gradual digital penetration). I was very anxious whenever I practised and also could not practise consistently at home. So there was not much improvement,” Kim told CNA Women.  But over time and after regular sessions with the care team, Kim started increasing her home exercises, which she did with her husband, and used emotion regulation tips from her psychologist to manage her fear and anxiety. “After repeated practices, I started to build ease with the exercises leading to an increase in confidence in tolerating an object in my vagina. The increase in confidence and seeing some achievement or success helped to further reduce the fear and anxiety,” she said. Kim eventually consummated her marriage in November 2018. Two years later, she and her husband had a baby boy. “I’m really happy and glad that I made the right choice to consult the professionals,” said Kim, adding that previously, gynaecology consultations made her “feel terrible” because doctors would show their “impatience and attitude” towards her inability to tolerate insertion tests. In contrast, the specialists at KKH were “very nice and patient”. “They did not look down on my problem and made me very comfortable. They allowed me to perform the therapy at my own comfort level and pace,” said Kim.  For Puva, who only wanted to be known by her first name, the journey to recovery was much longer and more arduous.  The 39-year-old administrator married when she was 27 and divorced seven years later after repeated unsuccessful attempts to have sex.  The couple had sought ways to improve their relationship, including getting a dog together.  “We thought that getting a ‘pet baby’ would improve our bond and our relationship, but alas, it did not work as well,” she told CNA Women.  One year into her marriage, Puva sought medical attention at KKH for recurrent fibroids. Like Kim, she was unable to go through with the medical examinations and was diagnosed with vaginismus.  She returned to KKH with her husband. At the time, KKH did not yet provide a one-stop multidisciplinary service for female sexual dysfunction and the couple consulted with an obstetrician and gynaecologist. “After the first two sessions, my husband felt that he did not need another male to teach him about sexual matters. He felt the treatment was not benefiting him and he gave it up. Without my husband, I also did not continue with the treatment,” she said.  Their marriage “finally broke down” and the couple went their separate ways after seven years together.  “I requested for a divorce as I could not endure it anymore. The guilt had accumulated so much and we were just not in good relations anymore.  “When I offered to part ways, I could tell he was relieved and in a way, it was my way of making it up to him,” Puva said.  After the divorce, Puva returned to KKH in 2017, which by now had a Sexual Health Clinic that was being managed by a multidisciplinary team.   That was a “turning point”, said Puva. “I found out that a lot of my fear and the pain I felt were due to the conservative background that I was brought up in. I felt like I had rediscovered myself and really got to know myself in all aspects.” Puva eventually met someone new and finally had sex at the age of 37. She now has a son.   “Having a child has been my dream … After 10 long years, I finally got to hold a baby in my arms and now understand how enjoyable sex can be – it need not be painful, full of fear and anxiety as what I had initially experienced.  “Getting treated was truly a life-changing experience,” she said.  “DON’T BE AFRAID” Both Kim and Puva urged other women to take action if they are having problems in the bedroom, despite their fears of doing so in the typically conservative Asian society.  Puva said there is “definitely a stigma with women trying to seek help with sexual health”, which was why she “gathered courage” to share her story and experience.  “In Singapore, a conservative upbringing like mine is common. Hence it is difficult for me to even share these challenges with anyone close to me … Until now, my parents still do not understand my condition well and do not believe that such a condition exists,” she said.  Despite this, she encouraged her peers “not to sit on it or procrastinate” if they suspect a problem.  “Don’t be afraid of being judged or looked at in a different light,” she said.  “I regret not seeking treatment earlier, otherwise I would not be so tired now, trying to run after my toddler and keeping up with his activeness. But of course, better late than never!” Puva added.  CNA Women is a section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/scientists-have-found-out-how-hormones-can-motivate-you-exercise-thanks-study-mice-2268721,Scientists have found out how hormones can motivate you to exercise – thanks to a study on mice,"Oestrogen may change brain activity in ways that could affect how physically active we are, according to a remarkable new study in mice that looked at DNA, hormones and brain cells. Using advanced technology to pinpoint and reprogram specific genes and neurons in living animals, the study found that surges of oestrogen jump-started processes in the mouse brain that prompted the animals – even males – to become more active. The study, which was published recently in Nature, involved mice. While humans share many of the same relevant hormones, genes and neurons, we are not mice and cannot yet say whether our brains and physiological systems work the same way. But the findings may open intriguing avenues of inquiry into why women so often become inactive after menopause, when oestrogen fades. The results also underscore how the brain and internal biological processes work together to play an unexpected and substantial role in whether the body gets up and moves or remains mostly still. MOVING AND MATING For close to a century, since a famous 1924 study involving rats, scientists have known that female mammals tend to be most physically active just before they ovulate, when they are also most sexually receptive. This behaviour makes evolutionary sense, since female animals presumably need to be on the hunt then for a mate. In the intervening decades, researchers began to speculate that oestrogen must play a driving role in this behaviour, with subsequent studies indicating that  typically would surge and wane in tandem with their oestrogen levels. But how could oestrogen, which primarily controls ovulation and other aspects of reproduction, influence physical activity? That physiological puzzle recently drew the attention of Holly Ingraham, the Herzstein Endowed Professor of Physiology at the University of California, San Francisco, who has a longstanding research interest in women’s physiology and metabolism. She and her collaborators wondered if oestrogen might somehow shape genetic activity in the brain, which would then activate brain cells in ways that could set in motion, well, motion itself. To investigate that possibility, the scientists first gathered a crowd of healthy adult female mice and chemically blocked estrogen uptake in some of them, while tracking how much all of the animals moved. Almost immediately, the animals without oestrogen became noticeably more sedentary than the other females, confirming that oestrogen somehow affects physical activity. FINDING THE MOVEMENT CELLS Next, the researchers examined the activity of a number of genes in the animals’ brains, noting that one, in particular, enthusiastically pumped out extra proteins when the animals’ brains were bathed in oestrogen but became almost quiet when estrogen was absent. This gene, melanocortin-4, or Mc4r, previously had been linked in people to food intake and regulation of body weight. But the scientists now guessed it might also be the bridge between oestrogen and the impulse to be physically active, an idea they substantiated by using high-tech genetic mapping techniques refined by one of the study’s authors, Jessica Tollkuhn, an assistant professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory School of Biological Sciences in Cold Spring Harbor, NY. These techniques showed, in real time, oestrogen binding to Mc4r genes in certain neurons, especially those in a part of the mouse brain involved in energy expenditure. These brain cells also shared connections with other neurons elsewhere in the brain that control the speed at which animals move. Taken together, this experiment showed oestrogen firing up a particular gene that turns on certain brain cells that then should be expected to nudge an animal to move. But the scientists had not yet seen these genes and neurons in action, so, as a final aspect of the study, they used a sophisticated technique known as chemogenetics to directly galvanize the relevant neurons in female mice that had been bred to produce no estrogen. Once physically sluggish, these mice now explored, stood, played and ran far more than they had before. Similarly, when the scientists used a form of the gene-editing technology CRISPR to gin up activity of the Mc4r gene in female animals’ brains, the mice became almost twice as active as before, a physical surge that persisted for weeks. Even male mice moved more when their Mc4r gene activity was dialed up by CRISPR, although not as much as the peripatetic females. These results highlight the “complexity of physical activity behaviour,” Dr Ingraham said, and how the willingness to spontaneously move – or not – for any animal likely involves an intricate interplay between genetics, endocrinology and neurology, along with conscious deliberation. The study also raises the intriguing possibility that the “timing of exercise, to have its most beneficial impact for women, might be fine-tuned by considering the changing hormonal milieu,” including the hormonal changes of menopause, said Dr Tamas Horvath, a professor of neuroscience and obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the Yale School of Medicine and chairman of the school’s department of comparative medicine. “Of course, all these observations in mice need to be confirmed to operate in us, humans,” said Dr Horvath, who was not involved in the current research. “However, the fact that this mechanism is found in an ancient part of the brain suggests that it will be applicable for most mammals, including humans.” ‘KNOWLEDGE IS POWER’ Dr Ingraham agreed. “We assume this circuit is working in humans, too,” she said and, if so, the new study and any subsequent, related research could help to explain, in part, why inactivity is so common in women after menopause and also offer some potential strategies for overcoming the pull toward lassitude. Increasing oestrogen levels in older women, for instance, might, in theory, encourage more movement, though oestrogen replacement therapy remains a complicated subject because of heightened cancer risks and other health concerns. The study does hint, however, that it could, eventually, be possible to bypass estrogen and recreate its effects with new therapies that would directly target the Mc4r gene or the relevant neurons in people’s brains and mimic the effects of oestrogen without the hormone itself. Any such medical advances are years in the future, Dr Ingraham said. Already, though, by delving into “the interrelationship between hormones and physical activity in females, this study has significant implications for human research studying the menstrual cycle and hormonal contraceptives and also menopause,” said Paul Ansdel, a lecturer in exercise physiology at Northumbria University in England, who was not involved with the study but has extensively studied menstruation and physical performance. “We know the importance of exercising in later life for promoting and maintaining health,” he continued, “so the challenge for us now is to understand the best ways to stay active throughout the major hormonal transition that is menopause.” “Knowledge is power,” Dr Ingraham concluded. She noted that because so many of us are living longer now, better understanding of why – and whether – we choose to move can help make those years healthier. For example, knowing that biology might angle us toward the couch if we are women and ageing, we could use fitness trackers or training diaries to help us compare our activities from year to year. Or, just honestly assess whether we are as active now as we would like to be, whatever our age (or gender). The brain is a complex organ and our motivations for exercise varied and deep, but we always have the option “to decide to be active,” Dr Ingraham said, to make the choice to get up and move.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/new-aspirin-advice-another-medical-flip-flop-or-just-science-2268531,"Is the new aspirin advice another medical flip-flop, or just science?","When it comes to preventive health, few tenets are as entrenched as daily aspirin. For more than 30 years, many people have relied on the pain reliever for added protection against a first heart attack or stroke. So it came as a shock to many this month when an influential expert panel, the US Preventive Services Task Force, seemed to reverse decades of medical practice, announcing that daily low-dose aspirin should no longer be automatically recommended in middle age to prevent heart attack. “It was almost like a vitamin to some people,” said Dr Eric Topol, a cardiologist and professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research in La Jolla, Calif. At a time when many people already feel whipsawed by shifting pandemic advice (on masks, viral transmission and booster shots), the new aspirin recommendations left some shaking their heads. “Wait long enough, and smoking and heavy cream will be good for you,” Richard Koss, an economist in New York, wrote in a comment after reading about the new guidelines. “The vast majority of people are fed up with this sort of thing and, rightly, pay it no attention.” But experts say it should be reassuring to patients to know that even the most trusted medical guidelines are being reviewed and updated as scientific understanding evolves. “It seems like it happens overnight, but this is how science works,” Dr Sophie M Balzora, a gastroenterologist at NYU Langone Health, said. “If we had the same guidelines all the time, then the question would be: Are we really advancing science? Are we really learning more?” A HISTORY OF MEDICAL FLIP-FLOPS Shifting medical advice is surprisingly common, and it tends to fall into three categories: Emerging guidance, replacement advice and reversals. Emerging guidance comes during times of crisis – like pandemics – and is destined to change quickly. In the past several months, guidance about the best way to treat COVID-19 patients, masks to prevent transmission and the limits of vaccine protection have all shifted as knowledge of the coronavirus and its variants has evolved. Sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference between replacement advice, which is issued when research improves on advice that came before it, and a full reversal, which comes about because a common medical practice got ahead of the science and never actually worked or even caused harm. Here are some examples of true medical flip-flops in recent years. ■ Menopause hormones to protect the heart: In 2002, decades of advice about the heart benefits of menopause hormones seemed to change overnight when a major study called the Women’s Health Initiative was halted after researchers detected more heart attacks in the women taking hormones. In hindsight, doctors had misinterpreted data from observational research. The current advice: Hormones can relieve menopause symptoms but shouldn’t be used for chronic disease prevention. ■ Vioxx as a lower-risk arthritis treatment: In 1999, the Food and Drug Administration approved Vioxx as a breakthrough pain reliever because it lowered the risk of gastrointestinal problems. But by 2004, Merck had withdrawn the drug because studies showed it significantly raised the risk of heart attack. ■ Arthroscopic surgery on aging knees: For years, the partial removal of torn meniscus tissue was the most common orthopedic procedure in the United States, with about 700,000 performed a year. In 2013, a researcher in Finland compared the operation to a “sham” procedure and found there was no benefit. Most doctors now recommend physical therapy instead. ■ Vitamin megadoses to lower cancer and heart risk: For years, doctors believed various vitamins could lower risk for cancer and heart disease, but a number of studies showed just the opposite. A study of beta carotene and vitamin A found that the supplements actually increased the risk of lung cancer in male smokers. A study of vitamin E and selenium, thought to protect against prostate cancer, increased risk for the disease. ■ Stents for stable heart disease: Doctors used to insert stents – tiny wire mesh tubes that prop open arteries – in millions of otherwise stable patients with heart disease. A study found that the surgical procedure was no better than drug therapy for preventing heart attacks. Dr Vinay Prasad, associate professor at the University of California San Francisco, and Dr Adam S Cifu, a professor of medicine at the University of Chicago Department of Medicine, coined the term “medical reversal” and concluded that about 40 per cent of common medical practices that they reviewed turned out to be useless or harmful. In their book, “Ending Medical Reversal: Improving Outcomes, Saving Lives,” they noted that most of these failed treatments were initially embraced because they were based on logical reasoning. “The thing that’s often behind reversal: All of these things have a good story, they have good pathophysiological rationale,” Dr Cifu said. “They should work. But things only work if they’ve been shown in people to work, and people are so complicated.” THE REASON ASPIRIN ADVICE CHANGED While daily aspirin can lower risk of heart attack or stroke, it can also increase risk for internal bleeding. Although the absolute risk of a bleeding event is relatively low, the risk increases with age. Several experts say the new guidance from the Preventive Services Task Force to curb aspirin use is not a true medical reversal and should be viewed as updated advice replacing outdated guidance, which is why the panel exists in the first place. Earlier this year, the task force lowered the age of regular colonoscopy screening to 45, down from 50. The panel caused an uproar several years ago when it recommended that women start breast cancer screening at age 50, instead of 40. “The task force is just constantly re-evaluating based on what data were available,” Dr Barron H Lerner, a medical historian and professor of medicine at NYU Langone, said. “This might be seen as flip-flopping, but it is really making adjustments based on the evolving science.” For people who have had a heart attack, stroke or other major cardiovascular issue, the case for using aspirin to protect them from a second event remains strong. The new Preventive Services Task Force guidelines don’t change that advice. What has changed is the guidance for using aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke. The early evidence in support of aspirin to protect the heart came in 1988 from a randomised controlled clinical trial of 22,071 male physicians, some of whom took regular doses of aspirin. The study was stopped early because the benefit in the aspirin group was so drastic – cutting heart attack risk by nearly half. As a result of the physician study and other research, the task force began updating its aspirin advice. In 2002, the panel was cautious, urging patients to talk to their doctors. But by 2016, the task force had recommended low-dose aspirin for adults 50 to 59 at risk of heart problems. But in the years since the early research showed such a striking benefit to aspirin use, much about the population has changed. Fewer people smoke, and doctors have better treatments to control diabetes, high blood pressure and cholesterol, issues that all affect risk for heart attack and stroke. Aspirin still works to protect the heart, but doctors say the benefits aren’t as pronounced now that other more effective treatments have emerged. As a result, the risks of aspirin, including gastrointestinal bleeding and brain hemorrhage, are of greater concern, though they remain low. Three major studies of aspirin influenced the task force advice this year. ■ A 2018 study of more than 19,000 healthy people 65 and older showed that regular low-dose aspirin use significantly raised bleeding risk and didn’t significantly lower risk of heart problems compared with a placebo. ■ A 2018 study of aspirin use in 15,480 people with diabetes found a benefit to the heart but also a significant bleeding risk. ■ A seven-country study of aspirin use in 12,546 moderate-risk people in their 50s and 60s was inconclusive, most likely because other prevention strategies were muting the effect of aspirin. As a result, the task force this month said that people 60 and older should definitely not start taking aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke. For people ages 40 to 59, the task force suggested discussing the risks and benefits with a doctor. “There is new evidence, and it’s about how we put all the evidence together and apply it to people today. How do we apply it to the US population in 2021?” said Dr Chien-Wen Tseng, a member of the task force and research director at the University of Hawaii John A Burns School of Medicine. Dr Cifu said the revised aspirin guidelines were a sign that the task force review process was working and should give people more confidence in the advice. “Things that we knew were right in the late ’80s early ’90s need to be rechecked to see if they’re still right, given that we’re all quite different than 30 years ago,” Dr Cifu said. “It’s a little uncomfortable that things don’t stay the same forever, but it’s good that medicine is checking itself.” Dr Tseng said she hoped the new guidance about aspirin would prompt more people to talk to their doctors about their heart health. “One of the key messages we need to get out is that aspirin isn’t like a vitamin,” Dr Tseng said. “There are potential benefits and potential risks. Everybody should be having a conversation with their clinician instead of just opening a bottle and taking aspirin automatically because they’ve reached a certain age.” By Tara Parker-Pope © New York Times Company This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/sfa-biscuits-consume-moderation-cancer-chemicals-2277126,Biscuits safe to consume in moderation; ‘impossible’ to prevent occurrence of certain compounds: SFA,"SINGAPORE: Biscuits and crackers are safe to consume when eaten in moderation, the Singapore Food Agency said on Friday (Oct 29).  Consumers are also advised to avoid the excessive consumption of food processed at high temperatures such as fried, baked and roasted items.  Alongside its advisory, SFA said that it is aware of news reports about the detection of certain compounds in pre-packed biscuits and crackers: Acrylamide, glycidyl fatty acid esters (GE) and 3-MCPD esters.  The reports described these compounds to be genotoxic carcinogens, also known as chemicals capable of damaging DNA and causing cancer, said SFA.  However, SFA added that the International Agency for Research on Cancer said there is currently no evidence that ""conclusively demonstrates"" that these compounds can cause cancer in humans. “These compounds are naturally formed when food products are processed at high temperatures and low moisture,"" said SFA.  “The manufacturing of biscuits and crackers involves food processing at high temperatures and the use of ingredients that contain refined fats and oils. It is therefore expected that acrylamide, GE, and 3-MCPD esters were detected in samples of biscuits and crackers tested."" While it is ""impossible"" to prevent the occurrence of such compounds in food products, SFA said Singapore adopts an ""as low as reasonably achievable"" approach for these chemicals, similar to the international standard-setting body for food safety. Although there are currently no international standards that specify limits for these three compounds, the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) has adopted a code of practices to reduce the levels of these substances in food instead of setting a maximum limit.  “This means that manufacturers should reduce the presence of these compounds as much as possible, without adversely impacting the food supply chain,” SFA said. This is similarly followed by other countries such as Australia, New Zealand and the United States. SFA added that it will continue to keep abreast of the latest scientific developments surrounding these compounds and will continue to monitor these compounds in Singapore's food supply to safeguard the health of consumers. Earlier this month, a report from the Hong Kong Consumer Council said carcinogens have been found in 60 brands of flour confectionary products, including popular brands such as Oreo and Ritz. Biscuits from Hup Seng, Jacob’s and Julie’s, which are manufactured in Malaysia, were also included. On Thursday, Malaysia's Health Director-General said that while acrylamide and glycidol were found in biscuits from Hup Seng, Jacob’s and Julie’s, the health risk that comes with consuming them remains low."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/breast-cancer-stage-four-carcinoma-pregnancy-2271256,Fighting stage 4 breast cancer: New mum shares her story while still in chemotherapy,"Snehal Ponde seemed to have the next phase of her life figured out. She was then living in Mumbai, India, and happily married. She was thriving as a human resources professional too, a job she had had for 13 years.  In August 2019, an opportunity of a lifetime came when Ponde’s husband was offered a permanent job in Singapore. At the same time, the couple found out that, after being married for two years, Ponde was about three weeks pregnant with their first child. Excited by the prospect of starting a new life in a new country, the soon-to-be parents welcomed the opportunity, packed up and said their goodbyes to friends and family in Mumbai. They arrived in Singapore in December 2019, just weeks before Singapore reported its first confirmed COVID-19 case, all ready for their next adventure.  WORRYING ABOUT CONSTANT ENGORGEMENT  The 38-year-old spent the next few months settling into her new home and preparing for the arrival of her newborn. Ponde had earlier decided that she would only start looking for a job after her delivery.  In April last year, she gave birth to a healthy baby boy, Samar, and brought him home from the hospital two days later. That was during the ""circuit breaker"" period, where no dine-ins were allowed and people were strongly encouraged to stay home.  What was supposed to be precious bonding time between the new mother and her child grew into worry when Ponde noticed that one breast, her left, was “constantly” engorged. And everything she did to treat it didn’t seem to work.   “I tried heat packs, massages, and I used to get up every two hours at night to try to (pump out my breast milk),” said Ponde. Despite feeling something was amiss, she decided to postpone her visit to the hospital as Singapore was in its circuit breaker.   By August however, she felt it was “high time” to call in a lactation consultant to help her with her declining breast milk supply.  There was no lump, recalled Ponde, and the lactation consultant suspected that it might be mastitis, a common breast infection that nursing mothers face. She then recommended a breast doctor to Ponde. In the same month, Ponde made an appointment with the breast doctor.  THE BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSIS “It doesn’t look like a blocked milk duct,” Ponde’s doctor told her while reviewing her breast ultrasound results.  The doctor performed a 15-minute procedure called fine-needle aspiration biopsy, in which a small tissue or fluid from her left breast was removed with a needle attached to a syringe. She was then sent home and asked to return in a few days to review the results.   The clinic called after a couple of days, asking her to return – and bring her husband along. “I wondered, what did she need my husband for?” At the doctor’s, Ponde found out that she had carcinoma, a type of cancer. The American Cancer Society said on its website that most breast cancers are carcinomas, which are tumours that start in the cells that line the organs and tissues throughout the body. “I don't remember much of that conversation because it was shocking to hear that I have cancer,” said Ponde. She didn’t have a family history of cancer, not did she know anyone who had cancer. She was also worried about having to navigate the treatment and recovery process, including getting a second medical opinion, in a new country and environment. PREGNANCY-RELATED BREAST CANCER  After a series of additional tests, the couple found out that Ponde had stage four inflammatory breast cancer, also known as metastatic breast cancer. This means the cancer had spread to her lungs, liver and bones. “As soon as someone said stage four, my first thought was, I am going to die.” Samar was only four months old then.  Completely devastated by the diagnosis, Ponde asked her doctor how she could have developed cancer. The consultant told her it could have been linked to her pregnancy as her cancer was “oestrogen-positive”. According to Healthline.com, if you have oestrogen-positive breast cancer, your cancer cells grow in the presence of the hormone oestrogen. Oestrogen is responsible for both a woman’s physical characteristics and her reproductive system. With a diagnosis like stage four breast cancer, which Ponde describes as something “you hear in movies”, she recounted her doctor telling her to not feel like “it’s the end of the world”.  There are good treatment options available for her, she said, with increasing advancements in the field. “IT WAS COMPLETELY UNFAIR” “It really seemed like a cruel joke,” Ponde said. “We were looking forward to so many things at that point: A new country, our first baby and we were three years into our marriage.” After the diagnosis, she recalls “feeling numb for the longest time”. Without much time to think or feel anything, Ponde had to move quickly into starting chemotherapy in September. “I honestly felt completely victimised. It was completely unfair to both of us and our baby.” She thought: Did I not exercise enough? Did I not eat well? What did I do wrong to deserve something like this? “I remember feeling very angry. Your whole life flashes in front of you,” said Ponde. Her body and self-esteem also took a huge hit from the chemotherapy, from her changing appearance to fatigue and nausea.  “At that point, my hair started falling out and I was bloated,” she said. “When you see yourself every day in the mirror, you're wondering who this person is. You don't recognise this person at all.” As her appearance started changing, Ponde found herself worrying about what people thought of her – and felt judged. “I had all these fears coming up: What will I look like at the end of this entire thing? What will people feel when they look at me?” Even though Ponde acknowledged that her feelings could just be assumptions or simply her “internal fear”, they were real to her. She found herself succumbing to fears, doubts and judgements about herself.  “I don't want people to pity me. I didn't want people to feel scared looking at me because I don't have hair, eyelashes and eyebrows.” ACCEPTING CANCER – AND HELP FROM OTHERS  Being far from her family back in India was also tough. Ponde’s mum had passed away just before her baby was born and her dad hadn't been able to visit her because of the pandemic. “My biggest regret is not having my immediate family come to see me,” she said. The difficult period, however, made Ponde realise that the “people who matter” would always be there for her. In January this year, one of her best friends Suruchi Shah, a therapist and child counsellor in India, asked if she needed help. “I don’t need therapy. I am strong. I am good,” Ponde told her, initially rejecting her “counselling point of view”. She eventually agreed to start therapy with Shah, and it ended up being one of the best decisions she made, Ponde told CNA Women. From addressing her fear of going out to meet others to removing her feelings of self-pity and judgement, Shah helped Ponde deal with her emotions in a healthy way. “I think my biggest emotional victory at that point was that I finally accepted that I have cancer,” said Ponde. Ponde added that she also benefited greatly from the community she found at the Breast Cancer Foundation (BCF). It’s also where she learnt that asking for help is not a bad thing.  “Reaching out to BCF was definitely a big thing, because there were a lot of answers that they already have and you don't need to start the journey from scratch,” she said.  From finding suitable doctors to helpful inputs about nutrition, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, it was a good place to start.  “It's like this sisterhood where everybody wants to protect everybody, especially for breast cancer where there’s very few people in their younger age,” said Ponde. Being part of the group eventually inspired her to start thinking about what she wanted to do with her life – and the kind of impact she wanted to create. “When I started asking for help, I think my world turned around, because everybody wanted to be there in their own way to help me.” COPING WITH UNCERTAINTIES  The hardest part of dealing with cancer, Ponde said, is “not knowing where the treatment is going”.  So far, her treatment regime has consisted of chemotherapy followed by hormonal therapy and back to chemotherapy again. She has tried two different chemotherapy drugs but both didn’t work well. “Each time we got our hopes up, when the drug started working, it stopped working and the cancer would come back,” said Ponde. She is now on a third chemotherapy drug called doxorubicin, which she started in August. Surgery is not an option for those who have Stage 4 cancer, her doctor had told her, as the cancer cells have already spread to other parts of the body.  “I don't know when I'm going to get better. I don't know when I'm going to be able to say that I'm in remission.” Ponde said she’s learnt to step out of her comfort zone to share her cancer journey with others.   While many choose to share their story only after they’ve completed their treatment (as cancer survivors), she told CNA Women that she wanted to share her experience while she's still in chemotherapy. “It's so difficult for me to even talk like this, you know, putting yourself out there. But I think that my discomfort is very insignificant if I can make a difference to anyone's life,” she said.  Every chemotherapy session, which she does once every three weeks, leaves her feeling unwell for a week. Out of which, she would have to rest in bed for about three to four days. Ponde said that her son Samar is her biggest motivation, inspiration – and distraction. “I want to be there when he goes to school, graduates, gets his first job and gets married. I want to be there for everything.” BECOMING A LIFE COACH   Earlier in February, five months after the breast cancer diagnosis, Ponde decided she wanted to become a career and life coach after some encouragement from her husband. “Don’t let life stop. What are you waiting for?” he told her, a statement that stuck, especially during moments where she felt overwhelmed.  Coaching made perfect sense to her, as it was not only something that she already had some knowledge of during her previous career in HR, but would also allow her to give back.  But even then, she never thought that she’d go into it full-time – she had all along seen it as something that would be useful in her career.  She then started a course in Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) in July and received her certificate in September. As part of her journey to become a qualified coach, she is now on her way to completing 100 coaching hours by December, as part of a requirement to become an Associate Certified Coach. This is a separate certification issued by the International Coaching Federation. “(Coaching is) another way I'm learning to give back, helping people figure their lives out,” said Ponde. During the weeks where the side effects of her chemotherapy are more muted, Ponde tries to squeeze in about four coaching sessions a week, clocking in four hours per session. The people she coaches range from women who need career advice on returning to work to those looking for personal growth.  Even on days where she’s coaching for seven to eight hours a day, she still feels energised, she said.  Through it all, Ponde is thankful that her family has adjusted to her “regime” – which includes going for chemotherapy, coaching and light exercises such as yoga and cycling. They've set themselves a schedule, she said, with her mother-in-law and helper stepping in to help take care of Samar, while her husband works through the day.   “My husband will always tell me that I need to focus on myself to heal and get better for the kind of future that I want to give Samar.” “So, I think I just learned to be kind to myself.” The Breast Cancer Foundation (BCF) provides resources, services and programmes for Singapore women fighting breast cancer, such as counselling, workshops related to mental health, the Young Women’s Support Group, wig loans and the volunteer befriender initiative.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/covid-19-vaccine-infect-transmission-rate-death-severe-illness-rules-dining-office-2275041,Commentary: Your unvaccinated friend is about 20 times more likely to infect you with COVID-19,"MELBOURNE: As lockdowns ease in New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory, and people return to work and socialising, many of us will be mixing more with others, even though a section of the community is still unvaccinated. Many vaccinated people are concerned about the prospect of mixing with unvaccinated people. This mixing might be travelling on trains or at the supermarket initially. But also at family gatherings, or, in NSW at least, at pubs and restaurants when restrictions ease further, slated for Dec 1. Some people are wondering, why would a vaccinated person care about the vaccine status of another person? Briefly, it’s because vaccines reduce the probability of getting infected, which reduces the probability of a vaccinated person infecting someone else. And, despite vaccination providing excellent protection against severe disease, a small proportion of vaccinated people still require ICU care. Therefore some vaccinated people may have a strong preference to mix primarily with other vaccinated people. But what exactly is the risk of catching COVID-19 from someone who’s unvaccinated? Recent reports from the Victorian Department of Health find that unvaccinated people are 10 times more likely to contract COVID-19 than vaccinated people. We also know that vaccinated people are less likely to transmit the disease even if they become infected. The Doherty modelling from August puts the reduction at around 65 per cent, although more recent research has suggested a lower estimate for AstraZeneca. Hence for this thought experiment, we’ll take a lower value of 50 per cent. As the prevalence of COVID-19 changes over time, it’s hard to estimate an absolute risk of exposure. So instead, we need to think about risks in a relative sense. If I were spending time with an unvaccinated person, then there’s some probability they’re infected and will infect me. However, if they were vaccinated, they’re ten times less likely to be infected and half as likely to infect me, following the numbers above. Hence we arrive at a 20-fold reduction in risk when hanging out with a vaccinated person compared to someone who’s not vaccinated. The exact number depends on a range of factors, including the type of vaccine and time since vaccination. But in Australia, we can expect a large risk reduction when mixing with fully vaccinated people. The calculation holds true whether you yourself are vaccinated or not. But being vaccinated provides a ten-fold reduction for yourself, which is on top of the risk reduction that comes from people you’re mixing with being vaccinated. So, dining in an all-vaccinated restaurant and working in an all-vaccinated workplace presents a much lower infection risk to us as individuals, whether we are vaccinated or not. The risk reduction is around 20-fold, but as individuals, we need to consider whether that’s meaningful for our own circumstances, and for the circumstances of those we visit. There are also added complexities, in that there are three vaccine brands available, and eligibility is still limited to those aged 12 and older. Although, we do know kids are less susceptible and less likely to show symptoms. However, as more information emerges, we can always update our estimates and think through the implications on the risk reduction. Some people haven’t been able to get vaccinated because they’re either too young or they have a medical exemption. Other people are immunocompromised and won’t get the same level of protection from two doses as the rest of the community. Increasing our coverage across the board will help protect those who aren’t fully protected by vaccination (whether that’s by eligibility, medical reasons or choice). Those at higher risk also enjoy the risk reduction if they’re able to mix primarily with vaccinated people. And other choices we make can help reduce the risk of transmission when vaccination is impossible, for example, wearing masks, washing hands carefully, and so on. Some people have proposed that frequent testing could be used to suppress COVID-19 spread for those who are unwilling to be vaccinated. Health minister Greg Hunt said Australians can buy rapid antigen tests from Nov 1, so they can test themselves at home or before entering certain venues. So how much does a rapid antigen test reduce risk to others? To answer that question, we need to consider test sensitivity. Test sensitivity is the probability a rapid test will return a positive result, if the person is infected. It’s challenging to get an accurate estimate. But rapid antigen tests are about 80 per cent as sensitive as a PCR test, which are the traditional COVID-19 tests we do that get sent off to a lab. The PCR tests themselves are about 80 per cent sensitive when it comes to identifying someone with COVID-19. So, if you did a rapid antigen test at home, it’s about 64 per cent likely to pick up that you’re positive, if you did have COVID-19. Therefore, rapid antigen tests can find about two-thirds of cases. If you’re going to a gathering where everyone has tested negative on a rapid antigen test, that’s a three-fold reduction in risk. Even though rapid tests provide a reduction in risk, they don’t replace vaccines. When used in conjunction with high levels of vaccination, rapid tests would provide improved protection for settings where we’re particularly keen to stop disease spread, such as hospitals and aged care facilities. Consequently, despite the high efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, there are still reasons a vaccinated person would prefer to mix with vaccinated people, and avoid mixing with unvaccinated people. This is particularly true for those at higher risk of severe disease, whether due to age or disability. Their baseline risk will be higher, so a 20-fold reduction in risk is more meaningful.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/unvaccinated-mother-four-covid-19-nuh-ecmo-machine-2275266,'I was going to die': Unvaccinated COVID-19 patient urges others to get jabbed after near-death experience,"SINGAPORE: When Mdm Lee Sock Lee tested positive for COVID-19 using a self-administered antigen rapid test (ART) kit on the morning of Sep 13, she had no idea that a near-death experience was looming.  Although she was unvaccinated, the 43-year-old was relatively young and had no pre-existing health conditions.  She tested herself for COVID-19 because she felt tired and fatigued for a few days. After a positive result from the ART kit, she walked to a nearby swab and send home clinic with her husband to take a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.  She thought she would only get mild symptoms from her bout with the disease.  ""Most people have mild symptoms. I know I'm not vaccinated, but I did follow through with all the precautions and stuff like that. I have no pre-existing medical conditions, so I didn't believe I would be so sick,"" she said, speaking to journalists on Thursday (Oct 28).  ""I wasn't aware I was so badly ill. I wasn't aware I was going to die.""  But less than 24 hours later, she was lying unconscious in the hospital on life support because her heart was failing.  Mdm Lee barely remembers anything after she was taken to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital in an ambulance from the clinic. One of her last memories on the way to hospital was calling her husband to settle some financial issues.  ""I (also) recall a conversation between the hospital nurse and the ambulance paramedic. After that it's kind of fuzzy, I was in and out,"" she added.  Doctors made the call to hook her up to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine, or ECMO machine, which eventually saved her life.  The machine removes blood from the patient, removes carbon dioxide and adds oxygen, and then pumps the blood back in. This is a form of life support used for patients with heart or lung failure that can function as an artificial lung or heart.  There are just two ECMO sites in Singapore for adult patients, and one resides with the team at the National University Hospital (NUH).  Mdm Lee was referred to the team for ECMO support after she reached the emergency department at Ng Teng Fong hospital, when she was ""on the verge of cardiovascular collapse"", doctors said.  ""She got worse clinically and had to be rushed to the intensive care unit (ICU). In the ICU, her condition worsened that she needed to be put on a ventilator,"" said Assistant Professor Ramanathan K R, senior consultant at the National University Heart Centre's department of cardiac thoracic and vascular surgery.   ""And despite being put on a ventilator, her heart function was so poor that she started accumulating acids in her blood, to the point that despite being on medications for her so-called heart failure, the heart wouldn't improve.""  On the verge of cardiac arrest, Mdm Lee's prognosis was bad, he added.  ""She would have otherwise died, had it not been for ECMO. I think that ECMO was life-saving in her instance,"" said Asst Prof Ramanathan.  A doctor on the team arrived at Ng Teng Fong hospital to put her on the ECMO machine soon after, and she was then transferred to NUH's ICU.  ""We figured out that the heart was barely contracting, essentially the heart was beating very poorly, and the ECMO support was helping her meet the oxygen requirements for her body's tissues,"" said Asst Prof Ramanathan.  After some tests, the team concluded that her heart problem was a result of the COVID-19 infection, which is ""quite rare"", he added.  The ECMO machine needs a team to manage it, including specially trained intensive care nurses and physicians, and surgeons to put the machine in and take it off, said Associate Professor Graeme MacLaren, director of cardiothoracic intensive care at the National University Heart Centre.  Mdm Lee remained on the ECMO machine for four days, as her heart started to recover.  The hospital continued to treat her for COVID-19, and she eventually regained consciousness on Sep 18; she stayed in hospital for a total of 22 days.  When she woke up, she coughed up a lot of blood in her phlegm. ""Tissue after tissue, you see a lot of blood,"" she said.  Staying in the ICU also took a toll on her motor skills and functions, and she was unable to move around and do things herself.  ""I can't really move and I had to relearn everything, even learning to swallow and eat,"" she said.  ""I remember I asked for water because my throat was very dry, and they tried to give me one small teaspoon, 5ml, and I couldn't even swallow.""  Mdm Lee, who is self-employed, also underwent speech therapy, physical therapy and occupational therapy to relearn how to eat, shower, walk, and do things like folding clothes, she recalled. No one mentioned her treatment with the ECMO machine until she was much better, and she was ""quite shocked"" to hear about what happened to her.  ""The nurses told me this is my second chance in life, especially those who witnessed how weak I was,"" said Mdm Lee.  ""It was quite scary to learn that I almost died. Because if I died, I will only have my husband to take care of my four kids, and they are still very young.  ""That was my immediate concern. If I had died, who would take care of my family? That was a very worrying and scary thought.""  When she regained consciousness, the nurses asked Mdm Lee if she wanted to do a video call with her family, but she rejected the idea because she was still surrounded by tubes.  ""I had phone calls with my husband before that, but I refused to do a video call with my children until I was left with maybe the feeding tube and the oxygen so it wouldn't scare them off,"" she added.  While she was in the hospital, her husband took care of their children as all five of them served out their isolation orders at home, supported by their families and neighbours.  They also did not tell their children about Mdm Lee's near-death experience in the hospital.  ""When I did the first video call with my husband, he was hiding it but I can tell he was so relieved - he was crying,"" she said.  Mdm Lee will be going for her follow-up appointment with a cardiologist in November.  Her heart will be scanned to see how it has recovered or whether the scarring is persisting, which will impact her long-term recovery, said Assistant Professor Lin Weiqin, a consultant with the cardiology department.  ""The heart can recover or it can remain weak. For Mdm Lee, she has recovered her heart function, that's very good,"" he added.  ""But let's say you have a scar in your heart that doesn't go away with time, there's always a chance in the future this scarring can give problems,"" said Asst Prof Lin, adding that this depends on the size of the scar.  At NUH, six COVID-19 patients have been put on the ECMO machine so far. All of them were unvaccinated, and one of them eventually died, the doctors said.  ""That's primarily because the vaccine is protecting patients from getting very sick,"" said Assistant Professor Somani Jyoti, senior consultant with the hospital's infectious diseases division.  ""We do have vaccinated patients in the ICU... but they are primarily older and their immunity has waned and they didn't have their boosters yet.  ""But generally, vaccines are protecting patients from getting sick enough to really get to the point where they need to go to the ICU and certainly not to the point where they need ECMO.""
She added: ""ECMO is really the last ditch effort just to keep a patient alive, if they qualify."" Mdm Lee is the first COVID-19 patient who needed the ECMO machine for heart failure in Singapore, noted Assoc Prof MacLaren.  ""I think it's something which is slightly worrying. You saw how fast she got sick. She woke up feeling fine, had a positive ART, and less than 24 hours later, she was on ECMO,"" he added.  ""That severity of illness can be somewhat frightening for everybody, including healthcare workers.""  Mdm Lee was initially hesitant to take the COVID-19 vaccine because she has severe seafood and drug allergies.  She had already booked her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine for Sep 10, but decided not to go in the end because she was not feeling well.  Aside from her ordeal, her husband and all four of their children, aged three to 13, all ended up testing positive for the virus.  Her oldest child is fully vaccinated, and her husband had taken one dose of the Pfizer vaccine the week before she was due to take hers.  All four of them had mild symptoms, like a slight fever and headaches. ""But other than that, they were fine,"" Mdm Lee recalled.  Urging others to get vaccinated, she said she was motivated to share her story to help others learn from something from her ordeal.  ""I would like to encourage everybody, if they can take the vaccine, please take the vaccine so they do not become seriously ill,"" Mdm Lee said.  ""If they're not seriously ill we do not have to burden our doctors and nurses who have to work 12 hours or even longer just to take care of us,"" she added, recounting seeing doctors and nurses urging each other to take their long-overdue toilet or meal breaks during her stay in the hospital.  Unvaccinated patients who recover from COVID-19 are recommended to take a booster shot three months later, said Asst Prof Jyoti. Mdm Lee will be taking her booster shot in January.  She also cautioned others against thinking that severe COVID-19 illness would never happen to them.  ""We really do not know how much our body can take the virus, and the virus from COVID is actually quite smart and quite interesting - there are a lot of variants,"" Mdm Lee said.  ""Really do not take the chance, I would rather encourage everybody to just take the vaccine. If it can help lessen your symptoms and make you less sick, I think that is good enough."" "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/angie-breast-cancer-whatsapp-chatbot-ncis-2271616,"Meet Angie, the WhatsApp chatbot for women at risk of hereditary breast cancer","If you think you might be at risk of breast cancer, there's now a WhatsApp chatbot powered by artificial intelligence that can help answer your questions.  Angie the chatbot is part of a project by the National University Cancer Institute, Singapore (NCIS) that aims to expand access to genetic counselling. Women who are suspected of having a genetic predisposition to or are at high risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) can use the chatbot to learn about the syndrome and how genetic testing can help, before they attend their first genetic counselling session at the NCIS Cancer Genetics Clinic. They can also use the chatbot to complete their family medical history for risk assessment at their convenience. Currently, those at risk of HBOC are referred directly to the clinic for a genetic counselling session to help them understand the pros and cons of genetic testing and discuss recommended preventive options with an expert. Prior to this visit, a counsellor will conduct a routine call to collect the patient's family medical history. This call can sometimes take up to an hour. ""During the initial counselling session, many patients may also feel overwhelmed by the amount of information provided and may not be able to make a decision to undergo genetic testing. ""Multiple consultations may be required, which is made more difficult by limitations due to the COVID-19 situation,"" said NCIS in its press release.  Angie the chatbot helps to ""improve this patient experience"" by automating the collecting of family medical records in the form of ""bite-sized modules"" delivered through WhatsApp.  Patients can choose to complete these modules at their own time and upon completion, the chatbot will send over more information about HBOC, cancer genetic testing, and the process of counselling, complemented with visual aids such as infographics and videos.   Angie has also been trained to respond to frequently asked questions across topics like causes of genetic inheritance of HBOC, screening, risk-reducing strategies and genetic testing cost.  NCIS said it hopes to extend the chatbot service, which was created in partnership with Singapore health tech AI startup Bot MD, to other countries in Asia to help more patients at risk of HBOC to better understand and manage their condition. “Genetic testing is increasingly recognised as an important consideration in the management of breast cancer patients and family members who are suspected to have HBOC. However, there is still a significant lack of awareness and misconceptions among the public which needs to be addressed by genetic counselling. ""Angie the NCIS ENGAGE chatbot allows us to reach out to patients early, and provide targeted education so that they come for their consultation better-informed and ready to decide on the next step,"" said Dr Samuel Ow, consultant at NCIS' Department of Haematology-Oncology.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/dengue-cases-clusters-stay-vigilant-year-end-rise-nea-2269302,‘Stay vigilant’ to prevent year-end rise in dengue cases: NEA,"SINGAPORE: Members of the public have been urged to “stay vigilant” in order to prevent a rise in dengue cases towards the end of the year. Continued vigilance is needed especially as the Aedes aegypti mosquito population in Singapore has increased, the National Environment Agency (NEA) said in an advisory on Tuesday (Oct 26). The Aedes mosquito population grew by 22 per cent in September this year, compared to the previous month, with the mosquito population particularly high in some areas of the country, said NEA.  These areas include Geylang Bahru, Jalan Berseh, Kelantan Lane, Kelantan Road, Jelapang Road and Woodlands Street 81.  More than 4,500 dengue cases have been reported in Singapore since the start of the year, and there are currently 12 active dengue clusters.  While recent weekly dengue cases have been lower than in the same period last year, the virus “remains a serious public health threat”, the agency said.  The proportion of dengue cases due to a less common strain of the virus has also increased.  The Dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV-3) has accounted for more than 50 per cent of the serotypes sampled since May this year, NEA said.  The strain has been detected in 121 of 254 dengue clusters where serotypes were identified this year, including the active 195-case cluster at Florence Road/Hougang Avenue 2.  The agency added that DENV-3 has now replaced DENV-2 as the dominant serotype in Singapore. Prior to 2020, DENV-3 had not been the dominant serotype during any major dengue outbreaks in Singapore over the past three decades, said NEA.  “Population immunity against DENV-3 is low, and more people are susceptible to infection with this serotype,"" it added.  The agency also noted that more people are staying in and working at home, which could translate to more “biting opportunities” for the day-biting Aedes aegypti mosquito, potentially increasing the risk of dengue transmission, it said.  “If left unchecked, the current high Aedes aegypti mosquito population, coupled with circulation of the previously uncommon DENV-3 and a sizeable proportion of people staying in and working from home, would add to the dengue risk this year-end,” said NEA.  The agency urged members of the public to take steps to prevent mosquito breeding. Examples include removing stagnant water by lifting and emptying flowerpot plates as well as overturning pails and wiping their rims.  NEA has conducted about 523,000 inspections for mosquito breeding habitats islandwide in the first nine months of this year.  About 14,300 such habitats were uncovered and actions were taken against 5,500 premise owners for mosquito breeding.  The agency said it continues to conduct targeted inspections at areas with higher mosquito populations and has stepped up operations at dengue clusters. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/mum-brain-forgetful-pregnancy-motherhood-coping-tips-2256521,'Mum brain' is real: Why mothers become forgetful after giving birth and what can help,"Call it whatever you want – mum brain, mummy brain, baby brain or even mum-nesia – but postpartum cognitive difficulties are real. If you’ve just given birth and can’t seem to remember the name of an actor from your favourite Korean drama or are struggling to manage your schedule, chances are you’re experiencing “mum brain”. However, giving birth doesn’t simply make you more forgetful – it’s a lot more than that, and much of it is actually meant to help you be a better parent, experts say.  WHAT IS “MUM BRAIN”? The “mum brain” phenomenon occurs in women who have recently delivered a baby and essentially describes their trouble with verbal recall, said Dr Charles Siow, a neurologist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital.  Verbal recall memory is, as its name suggests, memory associated with spoken information. This memory diminishes with pregnancy, said Dr Siow, and so women who have recently been pregnant may find it harder to recall names, words or stories.  According to Dr Cornelia Chee, who is the head of the National University Hospital’s Department of Psychological Medicine, there is “clear evidence” that a woman’s brain changes during pregnancy and after, with cognitive changes for the worse taking place during the same period. These particular changes “probably have a lot to do with the poor sleep that pregnant and postnatal women have”. Particularly in the third trimester, pregnant women “qualify as having a sleep disorder” due to multiple interruptions to their rest, such as discomfort, needing to go to the toilet at night and the foetus’ movements.  Postnatally, there is interruption from multiple night feeds and baby awakenings, said Dr Chee. As a result, you may experience worsening working memory, or memory related to more recent events, and may notice symptoms like poor concentration, feeling “fuzz” and slips of the tongue – all “extremely common” among pregnant and postnatal women, she added.  THERE ARE UPSIDES When you’re struggling to even make basic calculations in your head, it can be impossible to imagine that there may be upsides to this condition, but there are many. First, while the symptoms are real, your worries about them impacting performance – particularly at work – may not be.  “A recent review of 20 studies assessing more than 700 pregnant and 500 non-pregnant women concluded that general cognitive functioning, memory and executive functioning were significantly poorer in pregnant women. “However, the changes are likely to be noticeable only to the pregnant women and those close to them, and are less likely to affect job performance,” Dr Siow shared. Secondly, the skills you fear you might have lost are actually being replaced by others that could prove more useful to you as a parent.  The changes in the brain “support the behavioural tasks of motherhood”, said Dr Siow, promoting calm and focus during stressful situations, the ability to interpret what different newborn cries mean and vigilance around potential dangers.  These changes in the mother’s brain have also been associated with better attachment and more positive opinions about her babies, as well as more confidence in her parenting ability. Citing a recent study, Dr Siow said that changes in the brain can occur even two years after pregnancy, in regions involving social cognition or the ability to feel empathy for another.  “Mothers who showed the biggest drops in grey-matter volume reported the warmest relationships with their babies,” he said.  “In other words, some subtle aspects of memory are sacrificed to enhance other areas of cognition,” Dr Siow added. Research has also revealed long-term cognitive benefits associated with having more children.  “Elderly women with more children showed patterns of brain activity in the opposite direction to what we see in age-related decline,” said Dr Siow. So the more children you have, the “younger” your patterns of brain function, suggesting that motherhood protects your brain from ageing, he said.  HOW YOU CAN COPE WITH MUM BRAIN   Despite the purported benefits of changes in the brain after pregnancy, any negative impact they might have on daily functions cannot be minimised. According to Dr Nicole Chan, a general practitioner at DTAP Clinic, cognitive difficulties after giving birth can also be attributed to feelings of being overwhelmed, low mood, lack of sleep or rest, and hormonal changes. These difficulties can improve over the course of several months, although sometimes it can “persist for longer”, said Dr Siow. Regardless, there are steps you can take to cope. Here are our experts’ recommendations for reducing the negative impact of “mum brain”: Get enough rest: This could mean taking power naps or working out a plan for night feeds with your partner. “Sleep deficit is a huge contributing factor to forgetfulness and impaired cognitive function,” said Dr Chan.  Feed your mind: Dr Siow recommends consuming foods rich in antioxidants, such as berries, and to stimulate your brain with games like Sudoku.  Make lists and develop a routine: “These will help with creating predictability and structure, reducing the likelihood of forgetting something,” said Dr Chan, adding that setting alarms and reminders can also be useful. Find a community or outlet: It could be joining a forum or a group for new mums, chatting with friends and family, or even just watching videos or sharings from others online.  “This will help foster a sense of community and normalise your struggles so you know you are not alone,” said the DTAP Clinic doctor.  Be patient with yourself: Most importantly, new mums should try to cut themselves some slack, experts agreed.  “Focus on the big picture and the good that you have been doing and don’t blame yourself too much for lapses,” said Dr Chan. “No one is infallible, and your physical and mental health matter most. Don’t be afraid to ask for help from friends and family or medical professionals if things get too demanding.” CNA Women is a section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

The prudent use of emergency medical services and emergency departments is important as the country learns to live with COVID-19, the Health Ministry (MOH) and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said on Monday (Oct 25).   ""It will ensure that patients requiring emergency care are able to receive it in a timely and prompt manner,"" they said, adding that the 995 hotline caters to all patients who suffer from life-threatening and emergency conditions, not just those with COVID-19.  Life-threatening and emergency conditions include sudden onset of chest pain, breathlessness, drowsiness or confusion, sudden onset of limb or body weakness, difficulty in speech, or drooping of the face, severe bleeding from injuries, loss of consciousness, and unexplained jerking of the body or fits.  The authorities said the SCDF 995 Operations Centre received about 5,500 calls between Oct 15 and Oct 21, of which 20 per cent were from COVID-19 patients.   Of the COVID-19 patients that were taken to the emergency department, 47 per cent received only day treatment and did not need to be hospitalised, while 15 per cent were warded for two days or less, and mainly for observation, said MOH and SCDF.  MOH and SCDF advised COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms to seek medical attention elsewhere, depending on whether they tested positive via a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test or an antigen rapid test (ART).  Those with mild symptoms who are recovering under the Home Recovery Programme or waiting to be taken to a care or isolation facility should seek medical attention through a telemedicine provider. They can also contact their primary care provider or the Home Recovery Buddy hotline at 6874 4939.  Those who tested positive after an ART and are feeling unwell or experiencing symptoms such as fever or persistent cough should visit a Public Health Preparedness Clinic (PHPC) via private transport.   "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/breast-cancer-pregnant-egg-freezing-chemotherapy-2256111,She had chemotherapy while pregnant: A 37-year-old mother's fight against breast cancer,"When Nooridah Mohd Noor found out that she had breast cancer in October last year, she broke down at the corner of the hospital. Through her shock, she barely heard her doctor say she had second stage triple negative breast cancer – an aggressive type.   “When you hear about cancer, it depends on the stage you are at,” said the 37-year-old administrative manager, who goes by Idah.  “And if you are at the later stages, sometimes you may not be reacting as well to treatments. There are so many uncertainties.” Recalling that “very, very dark period” of her life, she told CNA Women that she also wasn’t sure to what extent the cancer had affected her other organs. It didn’t help that her son Aidan was only two years old then. “My biggest fear was if my doctor were to tell me ‘you only have one month to live’ or something like that,” said Idah.  ANGRY-LOOKING BREAST LUMPS  Aidan was born in August 2018 and like many new mums, Idah experienced breastfeeding issues like blocked milk ducts and breast engorgement every few days.  She recalled developing mastitis in October that year. This breast inflammation is common among breastfeeding women. To resolve the issues, she went for massages and took lecithin, a nutrient said to help lactating mums avoid blocked ducts. A month later, after she had made the decision to stop breastfeeding, Idah noticed two “angry-looking” lumps protruding from each breast. The lump on the left breast was the size of a 50-cent coin, “significantly larger” than the one on the right breast. In December, she went to see a general practitioner, who referred her to a breast surgeon. DEALING WITH BREAST ABSCESS A breast ultrasound revealed that she had developed breast abscess, pus-filled lumps that were causing her pain and discomfort.  Her doctor scheduled a fine-needle aspiration biopsy on both breasts in December to drain the pus.   The American Cancer Society describes it as a procedure where a doctor uses a thin needle attached to a syringe to withdraw a small amount of tissue or fluid from a suspicious area. It takes only 15 minutes. After the extraction, Idah’s biopsy sample was sent to the lab to determine the type of infection she had and the type of antibiotics needed to treat it. When the lab results were out two weeks later, Idah was called back for a second extraction to drain the remaining pus and prescribed antibiotics to clear up the infection. The doctor told her that the lump would “resolve on its own” after she had completed the medication. Idah said that while the lump on the right breast disappeared, the one on the left was reduced to the size of a 20-cent coin – it did not subside completely. Since the lump didn’t grow bigger and no longer looked red, she wasn't concerned. Her doctor had also advised that things should be fine if the lump didn’t get larger.  Everything seemed normal, and she didn’t visit the breast surgeon again. PINS AND NEEDLES AT THE LUMP It wasn't until two years later in June 2020, when Aidan was almost two years old, that she felt “pins and needles” where the lump on her left breast was located. She would experience the sensation about five to six times a day. “Because it was only a slight lump, I didn’t think much about it,” Idah said. Although she recounted having occasional “slight discomfort”, she didn’t think it was painful.    She would have ignored the sensations if not for a conversation with her mum that month, where she casually mentioned it. Idah’s mother persuaded her to get her breasts checked.  So in mid-September, Idah got a referral from a polyclinic for an ultrasound at a hospital, followed by a consultation with a breast surgeon.   “The breast surgeon said that (the lump) looked very suspicious and irregular, so she sent me for a biopsy.” Two weeks later, on Oct 6, Idah went with her husband to discuss the biopsy results.    “They told me it’s triple negative breast cancer, and explained that it’s an aggressive form of breast cancer,” said Idah. “Once I heard the words breast cancer, I totally shut down and couldn't hear what she had to say after.” “Furthermore, I don’t have a family history of cancer, so that would be the last thing on my mind. I wouldn’t even be thinking about it,” Idah recounted. “Everything was going so fast, and as it was an aggressive form (of breast cancer), my doctors wanted me to start treatment as soon as possible,” she added. Idah's doctor also mentioned that it wasn't the previous abscess which turned cancerous – as cancer is “totally a different thing”. “We went out of the (doctor’s) room, and that’s when I broke down.” EGG-FREEZING AND FINDING HERSELF PREGNANT Things moved quickly. In that same week, Idah underwent a series of tests, including a heart scan and mammogram, and her first chemotherapy session was planned for the following week. Idah also opted for egg-freezing, which, while banned in Singapore, is offered to women of reproductive age who are undergoing cancer treatment, to preserve their fertility.  Chemotherapy and radiation therapy work by killing the cancer cells in the body that are dividing quickly, affecting hormones needed for pregnancy and, at times causing a woman to have early menopause, said American Cancer Society on its website. The egg-freezing process involves retrieving the eggs from the ovaries and freezing them. The retrieved eggs can then be stored, warmed and fertilised with sperm when needed. Idah, who had been trying to conceive again, agreed immediately. So a week after the breast cancer diagnosis, she met with a gynaecologist at Sengkang General Hospital who would see her through the egg retrieval process.  This included administering at-home injections for two weeks to quicken the process of turning the egg follicles into mature eggs, after which, the eggs would be retrieved through a half-day surgical procedure.  To prepare for egg-freezing, Idah also had to take various blood tests to determine the size and quality of eggs needed for the process. “(My gynaecologist) told me that my hormone levels were high, but I didn’t think much about it,” she said. Idah had only started her injections for three days when she received a call from her gynaecologist.  “You have to stop the medications now, because you tested positive for pregnancy,” she heard her say. Idah was four weeks pregnant. “When I heard the news, I started crying,” said Idah.  But it wasn’t from the joy of getting pregnant, but her concerns about the scans she “should not be doing” while pregnant, including the mammogram and heart scans she did the week before.  “I was very worried about what (the scans) were doing to the foetus,” recounted Idah. “I was supposed to start cancer treatment, and now I am pregnant, so what’s going to happen?” Idah’s was a unique and unexpected case for her doctors, and they wanted to monitor her closely.   “I feel that I am gifted with such a unique situation, so whether the baby survives or not, I will still try to give birth and give my child a chance to live in this world,” said Idah.  Her surgeon and oncologist later told her that she should not worry about her previous exposure to the harmful radiation from the scans, as they had amounted to “almost negligible”. “(My breast surgeon) was worried that if anything happened to the foetus along the way, I would be even more devastated and depressed,” said Idah.  CHEMOTHERAPY WHILE PREGNANT  Idah started chemotherapy in December, two months after her diagnosis. She was then in her second trimester, which is deemed a safe period for pregnant mums to undergo cancer treatment. Calling it a blessing in disguise, Idah said she was thankful that the egg-freezing process gave her the “extra time” to find out that she was pregnant. “If I didn't go for the egg-freezing process, I'd have started on chemotherapy the very next week (while not knowing I was pregnant).” However, the one-month delay in beginning treatment saw the breast lump growing from 3cm to 4cm.  That aside, all seemed to be going according to plan. Idah’s chemotherapy would take six months, after which, she would give birth in June this year. Radiation therapy would begin after the baby was born, as well as breast surgery. Idah’s oncologist had sent her for a genetics test earlier to find out if she carried the BRCA1 (BReast CAncer gene one) and BRCA2. The results would determine if she needed a lumpectomy (to remove the lump) or mastectomy (which removes the entire breast). “There was a possibility of a mastectomy depending if I carried the BRCA genes. But the results came back negative, so I qualified for a lumpectomy,” Idah explained. That also meant that she would get to conserve most of her breast tissue.  Her body was responding well to chemotherapy as well. In the three months since she had started treatment, the 4cm lump had reduced significantly. By April, two months before she was due to give birth, she could no longer feel it.  A PREMATURE BIRTH  But while her breast cancer treatment was going well, her pregnancy took a worrying turn.  Idah delivered baby Noah prematurely in mid April, at 30 weeks, due to placenta abruption. The condition occurs when the placenta separates itself too early from the uterus, causing bleeding and danger to the foetus.  Even then, Idah said dealing with breast cancer is a “rollercoaster” of emotions. While some days are easy, she also lives with the worry that the cancer will come back.   “When you hear stories about cancer survivors, it’s always very positive, encouraging and inspirational. But behind those feelings, there are days that can get quite emotional.” It’s not always ups, there are downs as well, she added.  Coming to terms with the diagnosis, accepting it, moving forward and dealing with each issue and treatment you have to undertake – all while keeping a positive outlook – is important, Idah said. To do that, you need to find the positive in the tiniest of things, such as your family, husband or children. In January this year, she reached out to the Breast Cancer Foundation (BCF) in the hopes of finding other women who had gone through the same experience. When she was about to undergo radiation therapy, she relied on BCF’s Young Women’s Support Group for information and tips that might help her.  Idah recommends that women, especially younger ones, carry out daily breast self-examination – early detection would not only save lives but their breasts as well.  That’s also the reason why Idah chose to make her Instagram account public. She’s hoping to let others know that they are not alone in their despair and that “there’s always hope”. “A follower shared with me that she was pregnant and found out that she had a suspicious lump,” Idah shared.  After finding out that it was indeed breast cancer, she told Idah how thankful she was to have come across Idah’s story. It kept her going, and kept her believing she would pull through. “No matter how dark the place you are at is, or how lost you are, there’s always hope,” said Idah.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/optiq-lasik-eye-surgery-lao-hua-presbyopia-2252471,Worried about 'lao hua' later in life? You can now store eye tissues for the future,"Picture this: You've had laser surgery before where the eye doctor removed slivers of tissue from your corneas to fix your shortsightedness (it's not LASIK but hold your horses). And voila, everything's as clear as day again. But then, further down the road, as you approach your 40s, you've got another medical issue to worry about: Presbyopia or ""lao hua"" (the gradual loss of your eyes' ability to focus on nearby objects).  What if those eye tissues – medically known as corneal lenticules – that were taken out years ago (and thrown away) could actually be stored and used again to fix your future problem?  What sounds like something from a science-fiction movie is actually possible right now in Singapore, courtesy of a new technology and an actual place where you can ""bank"" those eye tissues.   The latter is a corneal lenticule banking service called OptiQ. Meanwhile, two doctors from the Singapore National Eye Centre's (SNEC) research arm Singapore Eye Research Institute, Professors Donald Tan and Jodhbir Mehta, have invented a technology to re-implant those bits of cornea back into the eyes to correct ""lao hua"".  Sounds like good news for this nation of myopics (82 per cent of 20-year-olds in Singapore suffer from myopia), who are pretty big fans of laser eye surgery, considering more than 500,000 LASIK procedures were done at the SNEC over the last 20 years. But how does this actually work? CNA Lifestyle finds out. WHAT DOES LASER EYE SURGERY NOW HAVE TO DO WITH 'LAO HUA' LATER? It has to do with the lens-shaped corneal tissue the doctor removes to re-contour the cornea and correct shortsightedness. (Again, this is not LASIK, which we'll explain in a bit.) These corneal lenticules can be re-implanted back into the eyes to correct not just presbyopia, but also hyperopia (farsightedness) and certain eye conditions such as keratoconus (the abnormal shaping of the cornea).  What's interesting is that the removed corneal tissue will be used like a corrective lens; for instance, if you have 300 degrees of myopia, the extracted lenticule will provide a corrective power of 300 degrees. It's like recycling bits of yourself. IT'LL BE YEARS UNTIL I HAVE AN ISSUE WITH PRESBYOPIA, SO WHERE DO MY EYE TISSUES GO? That's where OptiQ comes in. What they'll do is cryopreserve the corneal tissues at temperatures below -150 degrees Celsius. In other words, they're put in a freezer for future use. OptiQ was recently opened in March this year by Cordlife. The Ministry of Health-licensed service is from the same company that's been offering stem cell banking services in Singapore since 2001. In fact, OptiQ leverages on Cordlife’s biological tissue storage facilities. WHAT IF I'VE ALREADY HAD LASIK? You won't be eligible because the creation of a flap on the cornea during LASIK makes it unsuitable to later extract tissue from it, said Prof Mehta. A quick recap: The flap opens up the cornea and allows the laser to reshape the eye's contours. The flap is then closed back and stitched to hold it in place.  In the first place, LASIK doesn't involve any tissue extraction to correct myopia or astigmatism, so it isn't a suitable procedure if you're considering freezing your corneal tissues.  At the moment, the SMILE (short for Small Incision Lenticule Extraction) procedure is suitable and is offered at the SNEC. To correct myopia and astigmatism, it removes a bit of tissue through a small keyhole to reshape the cornea. (See the Instagram post below for illustration.)  A post shared by nordBLICK Augenklinik Bellevue (@nordblick_augenklinik_bellevue) To ascertain your eligibility for SMILE, you’ll have to undergo a refractive assessment and be screened, said Prof Mehta. “Those who aren’t eligible are those below the age of 21, those with unstable myopia or certain eye pathologies, pregnant women and people on certain oral medications,” he said.  At the moment, about 30 per cent of SMILE patients who are interested in lenticule banking opted for OptiQ, said Tan Poh Lan, the group CEO of Cordlife.   WHAT’S THE STORAGE COST AND FOR HOW LONG? There are two payment options to consider: Upfront and an annual plan. The former is available for S$4,500 and covers 20 years of storage. “If both the lenticules are utilised, the remaining cost of storage will be waived,” said Tan. The yearly plan consists of a one-off payment of S$1,800 along with an annual fee of S$180 for the next 19 years of storage. (That’s a total of S$5,220, if you do the math.) Although the duration is 20 years, you can choose to continue storing the corneal lenticules beyond the period since presbyopia’s onset is almost certain to hit around 40 years of age, said Tan. Moreover, there isn’t a use-by date for the lenticules.  Similar to laser eye surgeries (be it LASIK or SMILE), the storage cost is not covered by insurance or Medisave.  HOW DO THE EXTRACTED CORNEAL TISSUES CORRECT PRESBYOPIA? Each corneal tissue or lenticule is cut convex-shaped when it was first removed, so that when it is re-inserted like a patch, it flattens the central cornea. This changed shape, in turn, enhances near vision to correct presbyopia.  WHAT’S THE SUCCESS RATE OF PUTTING THE CORNEAL TISSUES BACK? The implantation is still being researched on but once it becomes standard therapy for presbyopia, it will provide those who have stored their corneal lenticules more treatment opportunities.  In the meantime, the SNEC has performed two implantations so far, said Prof Mehta, who cited COVID-19 restrictions as the reason for the low number of cases, although “we have people on the waiting list”.  “The success rate, based on our experience and that from medical literature, has been high, over 95 per cent,” he said, adding that the use of keyhole surgery, sterile techniques and topical antibiotics help to keep infection rates low.  These biological corneal inserts have another advantage: A lower risk of scarring, said Prof Mehta, which can be as high as 10 to 40 per cent when artificial ones are used instead.  The biological ones are also less likely to be rejected by your body and lead to complications such as corneal haze, which causes your cornea to turn cloudy or opaque.   Currently, only the SNEC is equipped and has the intellectual property rights to perform the implantation. CAN IT BE REVERSED? Should the implanted corneal tissue need to be removed, it can be done without causing lasting effects, said Prof Mehta. ""The main medical issue is to ensure that the donor has been properly screened for possible infectious diseases,"" he added. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/queenstown-new-health-district-residents-ageing-health-2256282,Queenstown to become new health district to support residents’ health through life stages,"SINGAPORE: Singapore’s first satellite town, Queenstown, will soon also become the country’s first Health District – aiming to support residents’ well-being across their life stages, through tools such as better design and community programmes. The goal is for the Queenstown pilot to be a “model of a healthy and active community for all ages”, whose successful strategies may also be extended to more towns in future, said National Development Minister Desmond Lee, who announced the initiative on Wednesday (Oct 20). Outlining the pilot’s areas of focus, he said one aspect would be encouraging preventive healthcare, such as chronic disease screening and vaccinations. At the same time, improving the planning and design of the HDB environment will also help residents make healthier choices, he said. Next, to encourage “purposeful longevity”, there will be opportunities for seniors to work, volunteer and participate in lifelong learning. Developing affordable and useable technology will also be a key aspect in helping residents better care for their health, added Mr Lee. The pilot, touted as a “first-of-its-kind collaboration”, involves the Housing & Development Board (HDB), the National University Health System (NUHS), the National University of Singapore (NUS), and stakeholders across the public, private and people sectors. Queenstown, first developed in the 1950s, was selected for the pilot as “its demographics closely mirror Singapore’s projected national demographics by year 2030”, said HDB, NUHS and NUS in a joint release. “The town currently has one of the oldest populations in Singapore, with almost one out of every four Singaporeans aged 65 and above. “Together with various upcoming development and rejuvenation plans for Queenstown, there are opportunities to pilot interventions for better well-being of residents, promote health-seeking behaviours, and encourage social connections,"" said the release. The health district at Queenstown is bounded by Tanglin Road and Alexandra Road to the east and Clementi Road to the west. The area covers numerous health institutions such as the National University Hospital (NUH), Alexandra Hospital and Queenstown Polyclinic. To improve access to preventive health services, on-site health screenings will be made available to residents where appropriate, while health talks will be conducted within the community. Residents are also encouraged to sign up for the My Health Map programme via the OneNUHS app, which recommends age appropriate health screenings. Care coordinators, working with partners such as Lions Befrienders Service Association, the Agency for Integrated Care and grassroots organisations will also help residents navigate the healthcare system. As for purposeful longevity, residents will first be invited to “share their perceptions of what and how they envision purposeful engagement to be” so that programmes can be developed, said the release. There will also be courses for residents on how to live a purposeful live, starting with NUS’ Designing for a 100-Year Life course that is scheduled to commence before the end of 2021. More integrated planning and design of Queenstown will be informed by scientific evidence, said the release. To improve physical well-being, HDB will “place greater emphasis on solutions that can encourage residents to lead active lifestyles”. One example is Queen's Arc, a recently-launched Build-To-Order (BTO) project in Queenstown, which features a jogging loop at the carpark rooftop garden, and a wellness trail and heritage walk in the area. It is also close to green lungs and healthcare institutions.  Existing neighbourhoods can also be enhanced through the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP), which could involve building fitness stations. As for social and mental well-being, spaces will be designed to promote interactions, while also creating tranquil places, said the release. For technology, the parties said: “We will partner with industry to test-bed and deploy relevant technology which allows people to remain independent, assists in disease prevention, and improves healthcare delivery.” As infrastructure projects and improvement of health outcomes take time, the pilot is “intended as a long-term project that will take many years to realise its full potential”, said the release. Mr Lee echoed this, adding that authorities “expect a lot of learning, experiments, and projects along the way"". “This will be an exciting platform for us to foster multi-disciplinary collective innovation, to improve the lives of our people together.” The Health District is overseen by the Minister of State for National Development, Tan Kiat How, Parliamentary Secretary for Health, Rahayu Mazam, and Parliamentary Secretary for Culture, Community and Youth, Eric Chua."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/osteoporosis-women-prevention-diet-exercise-tips-2251046,How to protect yourself against osteoporosis: From your teens to your 40s and older,"When you think about your physical wellness, how often does bone health occur to you? Not often, we imagine.  “Few women think of bone strength or mass until later in life or when they sustain fractures associated with low bone mass,” said Dr Lim Lian Arn, an orthopaedic surgeon at Gleneagles Hospital. “By that time, however, it is already, in a sense, late in the game,” he said. This condition of reduced bone mass and quality, leading to increased fracture risk, is what describes osteoporosis.  And it is more common in women. Over the next two decades, a staggering 319 million people above the age of 50 from the Asia-Pacific are projected to be at high risk of osteoporotic fracture, according to statistics cited by the Asia Pacific Consortium on Osteoporosis, which is launching what it describes as a ""world-first, interactive, educational healthcare"" resource for physicians to foster best practice osteoporosis care in the region.  More than 50 per cent of the world's hip fractures are expected to occur in the region by 2050, it said, adding that Singapore currently has one of the highest numbers of hip fractures globally. According to Dr Chew Chee Kian, an endocrinologist at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), incidence rates of hip fractures increased five-fold in Singapore women between the 1960s and 1990s, amid the country's ""rapidly ageing population"". Knowing the pattern of bone mass changes across a woman’s lifespan can influence the strategies women use to reduce their risk of osteoporosis, and these have to be put into action earlier, not later. “Osteoporosis can occur at any stage of a woman’s life, although it is more common in postmenopausal women,” said Dr Chew. To mark World Osteoporosis Day on Oct 20, we look at how bone mass changes in women at every stage of life and what lifestyle habits you can change or adopt for optimum bone health.   IN ADOLESCENCE AND YOUTH Optimal adult bone mass is genetically predetermined and for women, this is gained mostly between the ages of 12 and 20, said Dr Chew. “Adolescence represents a window of opportunity to maximise bone gain,” he said. What to eat: To promote rapid bone accrual, girls between the ages of 10 and 18 should consume 1,000mg of calcium a day, according to the Health Promotion Board (HPB). This can be obtained from dairy products such as milk, yoghurt and cheese, as well as dark green vegetables, soya products and calcium-fortified soya milk, said Dr Chew.  To promote better absorption of calcium, girls should also ensure adequate vitamin D intake. The HPB’s recommended daily absorption of vitamin D is 2.5mcg for those aged seven and above.  This can be obtained through adequate sun exposure – Dr Chew recommends being exposed to sunlight for about 10 minutes to 15 minutes daily between 10am to 3pm – or eating foods that are enriched with vitamin D, including oily fish like salmon and sardines, eggs and liver.  Girls should avoid caffeinated drinks, including colas and energy drinks, because caffeine increases urinary and faecal calcium losses, said TTSH dietitian Clarissa Tai. What to do: A 2016 report found that more than 80 per cent of girls aged between 11 and 17 were physically inactive, said Dr Lim. “We suspect that since that time, that percentage has not changed significantly and is something we need to keep an eye on.”  This period is crucial as a 10 per cent increase in peak bone mass in adolescents can reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures in adults by 50 per cent, said Dr Lim.   Hence, exercise and activity should be encouraged, in particular high-impact movement, because “the more you stress the bone, the more it responds to that stress by becoming stronger”, said Dr Lim.  Exercises that stress the bones and strengthen them include running, skipping and trampolining.  FROM YOUR 20S TO 40S Bone mass gain begins to slow down when a woman turns 20 and final peak bone mass is attained at the age of 30. After this, it remains largely stable, doctors told CNA Women.  During this period, women typically experience lifestyle changes and milestones that may impact the preservation of their bone mass, such as largely sedentary work and the adoption of habits such as alcohol drinking and smoking.  Many women will also experience pregnancy in this period. The mum’s calcium is transferred to the foetus for bone development mostly in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, said Dr Chew. Calcium is also excreted in breast milk during lactation.  “High calcium demand, coupled with hormonal changes during pregnancy and lactation, make women susceptible to bone loss and subsequent osteoporosis later in life. “After delivery and cessation of lactation, bone loss reverses and recovery occurs,” Dr Chew added. What to eat: Continue to consume foods rich in calcium during this time, with the recommended intake being 800mg a day. If you’re pregnant or lactating, the recommended intake for calcium is 1,000mg daily.  The recommended daily intake for vitamin D also increases due to this, to 10mcg. At this stage, you may also take calcium and vitamin D supplements but only if you’re unable to obtain the adequate amounts from your diet and sun exposure.  Protein is also essential for good muscle function and health, which helps strengthen the bone. Tai said adults below the age of 50 should consume 0.8g/kg of body weight per day. Be careful about consuming too much protein because this may cause calcium loss, Dr Chew warned.  During this period, cut down on salty foods as much as possible as salt can inhibit calcium absorption. Tai recommends limiting it to less than 2,000mg of sodium a day, or less than one teaspoon of salt a day.  To achieve this, start by comparing food labels and purchasing products with lower salt content. You can also reduce your intake of broths or soups and flavour foods with spices or pepper when cooking.  A diet high in refined sugars and processed food has also been associated with lower bone mineral density, said Tai. Opt for unsweetened or reduced sugar drinks, only consuming sugar-free sweets and replacing canned or dried fruit with fresh fruit.  Women should also limit alcoholic drinks to one a day as these can reduce bone formation and calcium absorption. Similarly, coffee, tea and soft drinks should be limited to three cups a day because the caffeine from these can cause calcium loss.  What to do: Compared to physical inactivity, regular weight-bearing exercises (or workouts that keep you on your feet, with your bones supporting your weight) have been shown to increase bone gain, said Dr Chew. At a minimum, women in this age group should commit to simple exercises like brisk walking, jogging and skipping.  Avoid smoking, doctors say, as it causes bone loss and reduces the production of oestrogen, which helps regulate bone turnover and maintain a healthy bone mass.  IN YOUR 50S AND ABOVE With the onset of menopause around the age of 50, bone loss accelerates due to a marked decrease in oestrogen levels, said Dr Chew.  By 10 years after menopause, at around 60 years, oestrogen-related bone loss slows down and age-related bone loss predominates, he said. The rate of loss of bone mass continues at that accelerated pace until the end of life, doctors said.  What to eat: Women older than 50 may begin consuming 1,200mg of calcium per day. This can come from a variety of foods including low-fat milk, fish with edible bones like sardines and mackerel, baked beans and beancurd. As vitamin D is needed for better calcium absorption, women in this age group should continue to ensure adequate sun exposure, around 30 minutes daily, said Tai.  Some groups of individuals, including the frail elderly as well as those who wear more veiled clothing or have a deeper skin tone may have minimal exposure to sunlight and may benefit from taking vitamin D supplements. This should not exceed 100mcg per day, said Tai, as excessive intake can lead to symptoms like diarrhoea, nausea, joint pain and headaches. During this period, women may begin to consume more protein, around 1.2g/kg body weight per day. However, you should consult your doctor first as these recommendations may need to be adjusted if you have certain medical conditions, such as chronic kidney disease.  Minerals such as magnesium and vitamin K may play important roles in bone health, said the dietitian. Low magnesium levels have been associated with increased fractures and lower bone mineral density, while vitamin K is required in the formation of bone proteins.  A diet high in vitamin K is associated with a lower risk of fracture and enhances bone mineral density in older people, she said. Consuming green leafy vegetables, nuts and seeds, wholegrains and yoghurt all help to ensure that one is getting adequate amounts of these nutrients, she added.  What to do: For older women, Dr Chew recommends exercises that strengthen the core and promote balance as these prevent falls. Such exercises include tai chi, qigong and yoga.  CNA Women is a section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/breast-cancer-women-30s-young-treatment-symptoms-2251251,'I didn't think it would happen to me': Women in their 30s facing breast cancer,"SINGAPORE: An avid cyclist who also runs and does yoga regularly, one 34-year-old, who only wanted to be known as Su Lin, was the picture of health when she first discovered a lump in her left breast in May. Young and healthy, cancer was the last thing on her mind. “I didn't think it was serious, because I knew of many friends who had cysts removed and it wasn’t serious. So I held it off for a while, until I was free enough to go and see a doctor,” said the primary school teacher. In late June, after numerous tests and scans, came a diagnosis she never expected to hear. She had stage 1 breast cancer. “I couldn't cry also because I was so shocked,” Su Lin said. “I didn't think that it would happen to me because I always thought that cancer was something that would only happen at an older age,” she said, adding that she has no family history of cancer. It took her nearly four days to fully process the news and tell her family, who are in Kuala Lumpur. “They were shocked but they were also being really strong for me,” she said. “Everything was done via phone or via video calls, and so there was no physical contact like hugs. But even though it was bad, I still felt strong support from them ... and so that’s when I felt like ‘I can do this’,” she said. With a renewed spirit of hope, Su Lin focused on getting treatment and recovering quickly. In July, she underwent lumpectomy surgery to remove the affected part of her breast and is currently going through chemotherapy. In telling her story, Su Lin hopes to raise awareness about breast cancer, and the importance of regular health screenings. “Regardless of age, never take things for granted. Even for myself, I didn’t do regular check-ups but it’s so important to pay attention to your body, because we only have one body and one life,” she said. “So we have to take care of it and be more mindful.” Su Lin was one of the patients highlighted by the National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS) in conjunction with Breast Cancer Awareness Month, an annual campaign held in October to raise awareness about the impact of breast cancer.  According to the Singapore Cancer Registry, 2,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year. Between 2013 and 2017, 16.3 per cent of female breast cancer patients were diagnosed below the age of 40. Doctors CNA spoke to said incidences of breast cancer in young women also appear to be increasing, which could be due to rising affluence and increasing levels of stress. Dr Radhika Lakshmanan, a consultant breast and general surgeon, said she has seen a larger percentage of young breast cancer patients over the last decade. Her clinic, which sees about 50 new breast cancer patients each year, has also observed a disproportionately higher number of women below the age of 40, who make up about 30 per cent of the clinic’s new cases. “One of the postulations is that women are having their firstborn at a later age,” she said. Studies suggest that women who become pregnant and have children at an early age have a decreased risk of developing breast cancer in later life. However, any pregnancy after age 35 may increase the risk of breast cancer. The treatment approach for young breast cancer patients may also be more complicated compared to older patients, said Dr Lakshmanan. This is because factors such as family planning must be taken into consideration when discussing or initiating the treatment regime, she said. “Chemotherapy affects fertility in a negative way so before commencing treatment, they will be advised to consult a gynaecologist to consider the options of cryopreservation or embryo preservation as their chance of conception may drop after the cancer treatment,” she said. Family planning was an important consideration for Ms Cindy Neo, who was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer in 2017. At the time, Ms Neo was only 30 years old and was a year into her relationship with her partner. “It was at the back of my mind (at the time), a topic that I had been discussing with my partner but we hadn’t quite decided whether or not we wanted children,” she said. “But we wanted it to be an option and so, protecting that option was important to us.” Another worry she had initially was the cost of treatments and surgery. Still early in her career, she was not financially stable and did not have a lot of savings, said Ms Neo. “It was a big worry for me because I kept thinking where's all this money going to come from ... how much money do I have to pay upfront and what happens if I’m not working ... so all these added to the mental stress I was facing at the time,” she said. Fortunately, her insurance covered most of her medical expenses, which came up to nearly S$50,000. As for Su Lin, who works as a primary school teacher, finding the time to go through chemotherapy proved to be a challenge. ""Having a full-time job, it's very hard to take time off on a weekly basis and my chemotherapy sessions are scheduled weekly every Friday,"" she said.  ""So I have to juggle work while juggling life at the same time."" While efforts such as the national breast cancer screening programme have helped to increase awareness of breast cancer over the years, a significant gap between knowledge and action remains. The national population health survey published last year found that between 85 and 99 per cent of women were aware of mammograms. Despite this, just 38.7 per cent of women in the 50 to 69 age group said they had gone for a mammogram within the last 2 years. It means more cases are detected at a later stage, said Associate Professor Veronique Tan, head and senior consultant of NCCS' breast surgery department. “If you look at the case spread in Singapore, what is really alarming is that 10 per cent of our breast cancers are diagnosed at stage four. And if you take stage three and four as advanced breast cancer, 25 per cent are diagnosed in that one stage, which is really very high,” she said. NCCS sees about 1,200 new breast cancer cases each year, Assoc Prof Veronique Tan said. In comparison, South Korea – which has a similar population proportion to Singapore – sees only 1 per cent of breast cancer diagnosed at stage four. Among common misconceptions about breast cancer is that it usually happens to those with a family history of cancer, said Dr Tan. “A lot of women think that they don’t need to go for scans because there’s no history of cancer in their family and they feel absolutely fine. But actually, 85 per cent of women who are newly diagnosed with breast cancer have no family history. “So having no family history doesn't mean that we're protected and conversely, having a family history doesn't mean you have to get breast cancer. The message is that everybody is at risk.” While cases of breast cancer in men are relatively rare, it is also important not to rule that out, said Dr Tan, adding that she sees one or two male patients a year. “A lot of older and younger men out there never consider that they can get breast cancer too,” she said. “And so, in a lot of cases, we see a delayed diagnosis because they don't think to present to the doctor.” Discussions are ongoing between NCCS, the Singapore Cancer Society and the Breast Cancer Foundation to form a support group for the male breast cancer patients here, Dr Tan said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/pawlyclinic-pet-veterinary-teleconsultation-2232421,Online vets for pets in Singapore: We tried out Pawlyclinic (get it?),"For many pet parents, a trip to the vet can be quite the event, especially for those with fussy and easily agitated furkids. The journey from home to clinic can be an ordeal for both, involving a bit of coaxing and bribing, and loads of patience to get them into a carrier and take that drive all the way to their appointment.  Alternatively, why not just book a slot with the vet from the comfort of your home? It was probably just a matter of time for the teleconsultation trend to extend to animals, which is what Pawlyclinic (polyclinic, get it?) is offering.  Launched on Sep 1, the online portal offers virtual appointments and medicine delivery services for pets – just like how us hoomans dial in for medical help.  It's a pretty stress-free way for everyone involved, and especially good for first-time visits. “Some owners may prefer to try teleconsultation first to assess if a trip is necessary,” said Dr Rachel Tong, a veterinary surgeon with Spring Veterinary Care and one of the vets you can book on Pawlyclinic.  “Teleconsultation can also be more accurate for us vets to assess the pet's condition as it isn’t scared or stressed,” she added.  It has even got pet parent and actress Zoe Tay's attention. Video calls are certainly useful for anxious owners who are unsure if their pets are having an emergency. For instance, is the 2am puking reason enough for an immediate trip or can it wait till the morning? “The vet can help owners assess the situation,” said Dr Tong, who is herself, the pet parent of a malamute-husky mix. It would also save you money if an emergency visit in the wee hours of the night isn’t necessary; in-clinic sessions can start from S$200 each (medicine not included) as they include surcharges like your post-midnight taxi fare.  WHERE ARE THE VETS FROM? The Pawlyclinic website currently lists vets from Amber Vet, Gaia Veterinary Centre, Point Veterinary Surgery, Spring Veterinary Care, The Pet Doctors and West Coast Vetcare. “Additionally, we have some individual vets who have joined us as well and we continue to engage with more,” said Dr Tong.  These vets aren’t only available online at Pawlyclinic; they can also be consulted in person at their respective clinics. So, if the vet advises that your pet’s condition isn’t suitable for teleconsultation after getting on the call with you, he or she can still see your pet physically in real life.  WHAT KINDS OF PETS CAN USE THE SERVICE? As long as the animal is legal to keep as a pet in Singapore, Pawlyclinic will see it. Exotic pets such as hedgehogs, ferrets and sugar gliders aren’t legal here but if they’re kept overseas and the owner is calling from abroad, there are plans to make the online portal available to them. You'll also have to be 18 years old and above to use the service, or you'll need to be accompanied by a parent during the teleconsultation – your own parent, not someone who owns a pet. HOW DO YOU GET STARTED? Register for a free account on the website, select the vet, date and time, and you’re set for a teleconsultation session. Don’t skip your pet’s details and home address as those are needed for the right medicine to reach you, reminded the website’s FAQ section.  To help the vet out, you could upload relevant pictures, videos or previous test reports onto Pawlyclinic before your scheduled consultation, suggested Dr Tong. It is also a good idea to prep a list of questions to ask the vet. And look for a spot at home with good lighting to conduct the video call, she advised.  But if you need a vet’s attention pronto, click on the Instant Care button, instead of scheduling a slot. The caveat: You can’t choose the vet. WHAT HEALTH CONDITIONS ARE SUITABLE FOR TELECONSULTATION? Mild skin problems are commonly brought up during these Zoom calls, said Dr Tong, as are eye problems and ear infections that don’t affect your pet’s behaviour much or cause it to show signs of discomfort.  Other suitable concerns include pain/lameness or issues that are dental, gastrointestinal, urinary, neurological, respiratory or parasitic in nature.  “This service is useful for pets that are on home or palliative care. Most of these pets have chronic or end-stage illnesses, so owners may need advice frequently on caring and managing their pets’ conditions,” she said. However, don’t arrange for a video call if your pet has a serious and urgent condition or injury, such as breathing difficulties, motor accident involvement, fallen from height or there is loss of consciousness, said Dr Tong. Take your pet to see a vet in person immediately.  REALLY, ANY TIME OF THE DAY AND NIGHT? The online availability of the vets will differ at any point in time, said Dr Tong. “But we will have vets from the Spring Veterinary Care clinics on standby on Pawlyclinic at any point in time. Currently, there are vets available till 2am daily but we are aiming to have vets available 24/7 soon.” After the video call, an email detailing the consultation and any medicines or tests required for your pet will be sent to you. You can pay via the link in the email. If the vet mentioned tests during the teleconsultation, they would already be included in your online bill. However, if further medicines or tests are needed when you’re at the clinic, you’ll be charged separately.  The medicine will be delivered on the same day as the video call if payment is made between 7am and 7.30pm; otherwise, it will reach you the next morning.  As for cancellations, you will be charged the full amount for cancelling less than 12 hours before the scheduled call.  WHAT’S THE COST? You can expect to pay between S$34 and S$60, according to Dr Tong. There is a range because the vets using the platform can set their own teleconsultation fees. “Think of Pawlyclinic like Deliveroo or Grab but for vets instead of restaurants,” she said.  This fee, however, does not include medications or diagnostic tests. Calls that take place between 9pm and 7am will carry a 50 per cent surcharge.  CNA LIFESTYLE PUTS IT TO THE TEST Is teleconsultation for pets as good as it sounds? CNA Lifestyle's resident video journalist Joyee Koo kindly volunteered her 13-year-old Jack Russell terrier, Jazzy, to find out.  There was no room for shyness. “Can you show me her bottom?” asked Dr Tong when Koo mentioned her dog’s tendency to drag her butt on the ground after her walks as if to scratch her derriere. Jazzy was held up Lion King-style, flipped onto her back, had her butt lifted up and her bits exposed for all to see. That wasn’t all. Be prepared to show the vet everything, said Dr Tong, including your living environment and even your pet’s stool, urine, vomit or anything relevant to his condition. For this purpose, she recommended using a smartphone or tablet as opposed to a laptop for better manoeuvrability.  Jazzy’s itchy backside (don’t laugh) could be caused by an allergic reaction to soil or grass, said Dr Tong. “Female dogs tend to lower themselves closer to the ground when they do their business and that’s when the exposure could happen. Or it could be her anal glands that need expressing.”  Her what? “Oh, they’re scent sacs found on both sides of the rectum,” explained Dr Tong. “They naturally express themselves when the dog defecates. But sometimes, the glands don’t work and the pressure builds, making it itchy or uncomfortable for the dog.” Peering at the screen, Dr Tong continued: “It is likely an allergic reaction. Try wiping her private area with a moistened towel or a gentle baby wipe after her business and see if that helps. If not, bring her in for a vet to take care of her glands”.  WEIGHT + DIET = BALD PATCHES Next, the bald spots on Jazzy's front elbows that she has been licking. “They’re like calluses on the hands of a weightlifter,” said Dr Tong. “Bald patches tend to happen in bigger dogs. Their weight causes them to rub these common pressure points against the floor when they lie down.”  Then, she said the words: “She looks a bit overweight actually. I was trying to cushion the blow when I mentioned ‘bigger’ dogs,” she laughed. Well, it is what it is and we do need to hear the truth for our pets’ sake.  “The weight gain happens frequently with senior dogs, even though they aren’t fed a lot of food,” continued Dr Tong. “Like us, their metabolic rate drops, too, as they get older, so we need to adjust their diet accordingly. What does Jazzy eat?” Rather than trying to recall dog food brands off the top of her head, Koo was able to show Dr Tong the actual product during the video call. A quick Google on the food’s nutritional makeup and Dr Tong could assess if it suited Jazzy’s dietary needs.   “There are some things for humans that can be used for your pet,” said Dr Tong, citing probiotics and fish oil. “Teleconsultation lets me see what’s in the owner’s bathroom or kitchen, so I can recommend what’s available at home for the pet.” For Jazzy’s bald spots, Dr Tong suggested applying aloe vera or even Vaseline to soothe them. “They are not toxic to dogs but if you’re concerned about her licking it off, apply when she’s asleep,” she advised.  The teleconsultation would have cost Koo S$40 during regular hours (no GST charged) compared to an in-clinic visit, which is S$38 before GST. ""That sounds cheaper to me since you don’t have to spend on transportation,"" said Koo. Another upside is, Koo didn't have to pay another fee (this excludes medicines and tests) if Dr Tong needed to see Jazzy in person – as long as she did so within 48 hours of the video call. This free pass also applies to another Pawlyclinic vet that Koo might take her dog to as long as it's within the same time frame. Would Koo be keen to use the teleconsultation service again? ""It was convenient and accessible, especially for situations when you need an instant opinion from a professional,"" she said. A major plus, she added, was that she could show the vet anything that might be helpful to identify the cause of her pet's discomfort. ""For example, what Jazzy's eating, my home environment or even the shampoo that she's using that might be causing the skin allergies."" As for Jazzy, she was relaxed enough after the teleconsultation to go right back to her pre-lunch nap. It's a dog's life.  As every pet is different, do not use the abovementioned advice on your pet without consulting your vet."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/sexual-dysfunction-women-singapore-kkh-study-2243776,"Nearly 60% of Singapore women have low sexual function, says KKH in new study","Nearly 60 per cent of the Singapore women surveyed in a first-of-its-kind study led by KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) experienced low sexual function – an indicator that they were at risk of developing sexual dysfunction. These women were also less likely to try to conceive and would take a longer time to get pregnant, the hospital said. The study, published in June this year, examined more than 500 women in Singapore who were in the reproductive age group – between 18 and 45 years – and were attempting to conceive within the year.  The women were instructed to rate their personal sexual experiences in six areas: Desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction and pain. Each question provided a score from zero to five, whose sum yielded a total score ranging from two to 30. 
The researchers said that those with total scores at or below the median value of 22 were determined to have low sexual function, and said to be at risk of sexual dysfunction – defined as having persistent recurrent problems during sex, including pain. As part of the study, the women were also interviewed on their personal details including age, ethnicity and marital status, pregnancy history and lifestyle habits, and had their physical activity and mental health assessed. They were then provided with home pregnancy tests and were followed up with for up to one year as they attempted to conceive. Results showed that 58.6 per cent of Asian women in Singapore displayed scores of less than 22, suggesting they’re at risk of female sexual dysfunction.  Among the six items of sexual disorders examined, low sexual desire and rarely reaching orgasm were more commonly reported in these women, the study revealed. The study also found that compared to women with high sexual function, those with low sexual function saw their chances of conceiving within the year drop by 27 per cent.   This drop can be attributed to these women having less sex due to “unpleasant sexual experience and difficulties with intimacy”, said researchers. Psychological distress can also trigger hormonal imbalance, interfering with ovulation and thus delaying pregnancy, they added. “A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM” The study came amid an increase in Singapore in the reported rate of female sexual dysfunction – a phenomenon that has also been observed globally. It affects many women in the reproductive age group, with more than 40 per cent suffering from it across the world, making it a “significant public health problem”, the study noted.  KKH said that in the last three years, the Sexual Health Clinic operated under its Women's Health and Wellness Centre has been managing an average of 90 new cases of the condition annually.  The most common form of female sexual dysfunction is vaginismus, said the hospital. Vaginismus is a condition in which the muscles in the vagina tighten involuntarily and prevent any objects from entering the vagina. This affects vaginal intercourse and vaginal medical examinations during gynaecology and fertility assessments and treatments.  Last year, even amid the COVID-19 pandemic and when hospital visits for non-life-threatening conditions were affected, the Sexual Health Clinic at KKH saw 100 new cases of vaginismus, a 60 per cent jump from the figure in 2017. The hospital said this could be because of increased awareness surrounding sexual dysfunction as well as where people could seek help for it. Other hospitals also reported a regular stream of patients struggling with vaginismus, as well as dyspareunia, which is the condition specific to painful penetration during sexual intercourse.  Dr Kelly Loi, an obstetrician and gynaecologist, and a medical director at the Mount Elizabeth Fertility Centre, said she sees around two to four couples weekly who are seeking fertility treatment as they are unable to have sex frequently due to dyspareunia. She sees two to four couples a month who are unable to achieve penetrative sex due to vaginismus.  “With dyspareunia, sex is possible but painful and uncomfortable. However, with vaginismus, penetrative sex is entirely not possible as there is a psychological fear of pain,” said Dr Loi.   The pain that results from vaginismus is “very distressing and in severe cases, can lead to non-consummation of marriages”, she said.  MORE FOCUS ON SEXUAL WELLNESS If unresolved, female sexual dysfunction affects the mental and physical health, relationship and quality of life for both the woman and her partner. It is also a key barrier to conception and procreation, said KKH. The study affirms that low sexual function among local women could play “a major part” in contributing to Singapore’s low fertility rate, said Dr Tan Tse Yeun, consultant at KKH’s Department of Reproductive Medicine.  Singapore’s fertility rate was 1.1 in 2019 – among the lowest in the world. Only Puerto Rico and South Korea reported a lower rate at 1.0 and 0.9 respectively. Hong Kong and Malta also reported a fertility rate of 1.1, according to figures published by The World Bank.  “If this problem persists, it could contribute towards the already declining national birth rate,” Dr Tan added. In view of this, more attention needs to be given to evaluating a woman’s sexual experience as part of preconception care programmes, the study suggested. This provides an opportunity to “intervene and resolve sexual dysfunction issues with women and their partners early”, resulting in better health and quality of life for women, with “potential beneficial effect on pregnancy outcomes”, researchers said. KKH has “recognised this unmet clinical need” for preconception care services, said its doctors, and are putting in place a comprehensive care package that aims to optimise women’s sexual health as well as overall health before conception.  “This approach seeks to optimise both fertility and pregnancy health for the best start in life for future generations of children,” said Dr Tan. Last week, KKH launched the SingHealth Duke-NUS Maternal and Child Health Research Institute, where it announced the care package called Healthy Early Life Moments in Singapore, or HELMS. KKH senior consultant Professor Jerry Chan described HELMS as a “new model of care” that applies to a woman’s metabolic, mental and sexual health. It will adopt a “life course approach in that the woman will be followed from preconception, through pregnancy and after the baby is born”.  More details about HELMS will be made available soon, he said. “Educating women about sexual wellbeing and sexuality issues, de-stigmatising and normalising these topics as well as encouraging more discussions and conversations will go a long way in encouraging better sexual experience in women,” said Caroline Chua, a senior principal physiotherapist at KKH.  KKH principal psychologist Cheong Xinyi agreed, adding that providing avenues as well as “clearer and more timely information” about where to seek help for sexual health issues would also be useful.  “To this end, healthcare professionals are encouraged to consider sexual health functioning as part of general wellbeing rather than a separate issue,” said Cheong.  Such efforts will encourage women with female sexual dysfunction to come forward and seek treatment early, thereby improving outcomes, the doctors said. The study can be found here.  Editor's note: The KKH study was conducted between 2015 and 2018, and published in June 2021.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/cut-out-salt-sodium-big-health-benefits-diet-2238241,"Cutting out even a little salt can have big health benefits, studies show","Sometimes, seemingly small changes in a health measurement can make a very large difference to people’s wellbeing. Such is the case with the effect on blood pressure of the essential nutrient sodium, the problematic half of the popular flavoring agent sodium chloride, commonly known as salt. The amount of salt that is safe for people to consume has been embroiled in controversy for a century, and the debate is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon. Scores of studies of varying quality linking sodium intake and health have swung the pendulum back and forth, stymieing regulations to limit sodium in most commercially prepared foods. Some people are especially sensitive to sodium’s ability to raise blood pressure, but given how common high blood pressure already is, and how difficult it is to avoid consuming too much salt, many experts maintain that the safest approach is an overall reduction in sodium levels in prepared and processed foods. More than 100 million Americans have high blood pressure, a disorder that increases their risk of heart attacks and strokes, and which, for many people, is made worse by consuming too much sodium. Just a four-millimeter rise in blood pressure – say, from 130mm to 134mm of mercury – can jeopardise the health of some people, and the blood pressure of those who are especially salt-sensitive can rise by 10 or more millimeters of mercury on a typical high-salt diet. In 2010, a Stanford University team estimated that cutting about 350mg of sodium a day (less than a sixth of a teaspoon) would lower systolic blood pressure by only 1.25mm of mercury yet avert about a million strokes and heart attacks. A new study conducted in 600 villages in rural China of 20,995 people known to face a high risk of stroke, demonstrated that substituting reduced-sodium salt for regular table salt significantly decreased the rate of cardiovascular events and associated deaths during an average follow-up of less than five years. The protection occurred in households that used modified table salt in which potassium chloride replaced 30 per cent of sodium chloride, even though there was no change in their use of other rich sources of sodium like soy sauce and MSG. Fifteen years earlier, a similar study among elderly veterans in Taiwan who used a potassium-enriched salt reduced cardiovascular mortality by 41 per cent in less than three years. TIPS FOR CUTTING DOWN ON SODIUM Companies have found that gradually lowering the sodium content of their products and making no fanfare about it, like not claiming they’re “low sodium"", actually fosters consumer acceptance. Most people don’t even notice the change. But you may not have to wait for companies to do the work. For example, you can reduce the salt in many canned foods, like beans, by rinsing them in a colander. Or try my trick of diluting the salt in canned soups by first filling the bowl or pot with fresh spinach and other quick-cooking or precooked veggies before adding the soup and heating it in the microwave or saucepan. If you hope to enhance your health by cutting down on sodium, one trick is to avoid going cold turkey. I and many others have found that it’s relatively easy to reduce one’s preference for high salt by gradually using and consuming less of it. As your taste buds adjust, high-salt foods you once enjoyed will probably taste unpleasantly salty and thus easy to resist. In cooking, rather than adding salt when preparing a recipe, try salting the finished product, which is likely to please your palate with considerably less salt. Seasoning foods with citrus juices, hot-pepper flakes or other pungent herbs and spices can go a long way to make up for reduced salt. You might also eat less bread; as a category, bread and other bakery products contribute more to Americans’ sodium intake than any other foodstuffs. But an even greater contribution most likely comes from restaurant-prepared foods, which Dr Jacobson calls a salt-laden minefield. I’ve noticed that the day after I dine in a restaurant, I weigh about two pounds more, not because I ate two extra pounds of food but because the excess salt in what I did eat retains that much water in my body. In lieu of government regulations to limit sodium, consumers might consider writing to producers of their favorite commercial products and asking that they consider lowering the amount of salt used. Currently, the amount of sodium in the typical American diet is more than one-third higher than the daily limit of 2,300mg recommended by the American Heart Association for otherwise healthy people, and it is more than double the amount – 1,500mg – the association considers ideal for people with elevated blood pressure. The actual physiological requirement for sodium is a mere 220mg a day, so these recommended amounts provide a huge safety margin. The human species evolved on a very low-sodium diet of 200mg to 600mg a day. In fact, our bodies are designed to conserve sodium and get rid of potassium, which explains why a high-sodium diet can be a problem. The body holds on to excess sodium, increasing the chances of ill effects. Before refrigeration, salt was prized for its ability to preserve foods, and was so highly valued it was used for currency. Now, however, salt has become the bête noir of physicians who treat heart disease, hypertension and kidney disease, among other deadly disorders. Though doctors have long argued that Americans should consume less salt, the wheels of regulatory action turn at a glacial pace, and modifying people’s taste buds is equally challenging. HOW THE FOOD INDUSTRY IS TACKLING SALT As far back as 1979, an advisory group commissioned by the Food and Drug Administration recommended that salt’s status as “generally recognised as safe” should be reconsidered. But the agency only asked the food industry to voluntarily reduce the amount of salt used in commercial foods. Now, at least, the amount of sodium in packaged foods has been added to nutrition labels, giving consumers a leg up if they take the time to compare brands before heading to the checkout counter. The ongoing problem with salt is thoroughly discussed in an excellent book published last year, Salt Wars, The Battle Over the Biggest Killer in the American Diet, by Michael F Jacobson, the former executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group based in Washington, DC. Without waiting for a regulatory hammer, Dr Jacobson told me, “some companies have made a real effort to lower the amount of sodium in their products. There are lots of tricks companies can use.” For example, in its canned tomato soup, Campbell’s replaced a quarter of regular salt with potassium chloride, lowering sodium from 760mg to 480mg per cup, with no adverse effect on consumer acceptance. Nabisco cut the sodium in Wheat Thins, my favorite snack cracker, from 370mg to 180mg an ounce, and General Mills reduced the sodium in Wheaties, the cereal my sons grew up on, from 370mg to 185mg an ounce. For those fond of crunchy chips, check out the Kale & Spinach Tortilla Chips from the CVS store brand Abound, which have only 75mg of sodium an ounce (about 11 chips).

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/coronavirus-covid19-what-future-holds-2238286,Here's what the future holds for the coronavirus and us,"On Jan 9, 2020, about a week after the world first learned of a mysterious cluster of pneumonia cases in central China, authorities announced that scientists had found the culprit: A novel coronavirus. It was a sobering announcement and an unnervingly familiar one. Nearly two decades earlier, a different coronavirus had hurdled over the species barrier and sped around the world, causing a lethal new disease called severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. The virus, which became known as SARS-CoV, killed 774 people before health officials contained it. But even as scientists worried that history might be repeating itself, there was one glimmer of hope. Although all viruses evolve, coronaviruses are known to be relatively stable, changing more slowly than the common flu. “There was, I think, a sense that would work in our favour and that the nightmare scenario of it being like influenza – constantly changing and needing updated vaccines all the time – would probably not be the case,” said Dr Adam Lauring, a virus expert and infectious disease physician at the University of Michigan. What many scientists had not counted on was unchecked global spread. During the following weeks, the new virus, SARS-CoV-2, skipped from Wuhan, China, to a cruise ship in Japan, a small town in northern Italy and a biotechnology conference in Boston. Country by country, global coronavirus trackers turned red. To date, more than 237 million people have been infected with the virus, and 4.8 million have died – 700,000 in the United States alone. With every infection come new opportunities for the virus to mutate. Now, nearly two years into the pandemic, we are working our way through an alphabet of new viral variants: fast-spreading alpha, immune-evading beta, and on through gamma, delta, lambda and, most recently, mu. “We just have uncontrolled infections in much of the world, and that’s going to lead to more chances for the virus to evolve,” Lauring said. Even for a virus, evolution is a long game, and our relationship with SARS-CoV-2 is still in its infancy. We are extremely unlikely to eradicate the virus, scientists say, and what the next few years – and decades – hold is difficult to predict. But the legacy of past epidemics, as well as some basic biological principles, provides clues to where we could be headed. THE GENETIC LOTTERY Viruses are replication machines, hijacking our cells to make copies of their own genomes. Sometimes they make small mistakes, akin to typos, as they replicate. Most of the time, these errors have no benefit for the virus; many are harmful and quickly disappear. But occasionally, a virus hits the genetic lottery: A mutation that confers an advantage. This fitter version of the virus can then outcompete its peers, giving rise to a new variant. The coronavirus could shift in countless ways, but there are three concerning possibilities: It could become more transmissible, it could become better at evading our immune system, or it could become more virulent, causing more serious disease. SARS-CoV-2 has already become more transmissible. “The virus is just better at transmitting from one person to another than it was in January of 2020,” said Jesse Bloom, an expert in viral evolution at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. “And this is due to a variety of mutations that the virus has acquired, some of which we understand, and some of which we don’t.” One of the first of these mutations had already emerged by late January 2020. The mutation, D614G, most likely stabilised the spike protein that the virus uses to latch onto human cells, making the virus more infectious. It quickly became widespread, displacing the original version of the virus. As the virus spread, more mutations sprang up, giving rise to even more transmissible variants. First came Alpha, which was about 50 per cent more infectious than the original virus, and soon Delta, which was, in turn, roughly 50 per cent more infectious than Alpha. “Now we’re basically in a Delta pandemic,” said Robert Garry, a virus expert at Tulane University. “So another surge, another spread of a slightly better variant.” Although some experts were surprised to see the hyperinfectious variant, which has more than a dozen notable mutations, emerge so quickly, the appearance of more transmissible variants is textbook viral evolution. “It’s hard to imagine that the virus is going to pop into a new species perfectly formed for that species,” said Andrew Read, an evolutionary microbiologist at Penn State University. “It’s bound to do some adaptation.” But scientists don’t expect this process to continue forever. There are likely to be some basic biological limits on just how infectious a particular virus can become, based on its intrinsic properties. Viruses that are well adapted to humans, such as measles and the seasonal influenza, are not constantly becoming more infectious, Bloom noted. It is not entirely clear what the constraints on transmissibility are, he added, but at the very least, the new coronavirus cannot replicate infinitely fast or travel infinitely far. “Transmission requires one person to somehow exhale or cough or breathe out the virus, and it to land in someone else’s airway and infect them,” Bloom said. “There are just limits to that process. It’s never going to be the case that I’m sitting here in my office, and I’m giving it to someone on the other side of Seattle, right?” He added: “Whether the Delta variant is already at that plateau, or whether there’s going to be further increases before it gets to that plateau, I can’t say. But I do think that plateau exists.” DODGING IMMUNITY In addition to becoming more transmissible, some variants have also acquired the ability to dodge some of our antibodies. Antibodies, which can prevent the virus from entering our cells, are engineered to latch onto specific molecules on the surface of the virus, snapping into place like puzzle pieces. But genetic mutations in the virus can change the shape of those binding sites. “If you change that shape, you can make it impossible for an antibody to do its job,” said Marion Pepper, an immunologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Delta appears to evade some antibodies, but there are other variants, particularly Beta, that are even better at dodging these defenses. For now, Delta is so infectious that it has managed to outcompete, and thus limit the spread of, these stealthier variants. But as more people acquire antibodies against the virus, mutations that allow the virus to slip past these antibodies will become even more advantageous. “The landscape of selection has changed,” said Jessica Metcalf, an evolutionary biologist at Princeton University. “From the point of view of the virus, it’s no longer, ‘I just bop around, and there’s a free host.’ ” The good news is that there are many different kinds of antibodies, and a variant with a few new mutations is unlikely to escape them all, experts said. “The immune system has also evolved to have plenty of tricks up its sleeve to counteract the evolution of the virus,” Pepper said. “Knowing that there is this complex level of diversity in the immune system allows me to sleep better at night.” Certain T cells, for instance, destroy virus-infected cells, helping to reduce the severity of disease. Together, our assortment of T cells can recognize at least 30 to 40 different pieces of SARS-CoV-2, researchers have found. “It’s a lot harder to evade T cell responses than antibody responses,” said Dr Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine. And then there are B cells, which generate our army of antibodies. Even after we clear the infection, the body keeps churning out B cells for a while, deliberately introducing small genetic mutations. The result is an enormously diverse collection of B cells producing an array of antibodies, some of which might be a good match for the next variant that comes along. “They’re actually a library of guesses that the immune system makes about what variants might look like in the future,” said Shane Crotty, a virus expert at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. So far, studies suggest that our antibody, T cell and B cell responses are all working as expected when it comes to SARS-CoV-2. “This virus is mostly playing by immunological rules we understand,” Crotty said. ""NO INTEREST IN KILLING US"" Whether the virus will become more virulent – that is, whether it will cause more serious disease – is the hardest to predict, scientists said. Unlike transmissibility or immune evasion, virulence has no inherent evolutionary advantage. “The virus has no interest in killing us,” Metcalf said. “Virulence only matters for the virus if it works for transmission.” Because people who are hospitalised may be less likely to spread the virus than those who are walking around with the sniffles, some have theorised that new viruses become milder over time. One commonly cited example is the myxoma virus, which Australian scientists released in 1950 in an attempt to reduce the population of invasive European rabbits. Initially, the myxoma virus proved to be “fantastically virulent"", one scientist wrote, killing more than 99 per cent of the rabbits it infected. After just a few years, however, several somewhat milder strains of the virus emerged and became dominant. But myxoma is not a simple story of a virus gradually becoming less virulent. “Early variants that were too nice were also discovered in the mid-1950s,” said Read, who has studied the virus. “They caused little disease but transmitted poorly, so never came to dominate.” The rabbits also evolved new immune defenses that allowed them to fight off infection more easily, and then the virus fired back, acquiring new tricks for depressing the rabbits’ immune systems. “Seventy years – it’s still going gangbusters,” Read said. It is too early to say whether SARS-CoV-2 will change in virulence over the long term. There could certainly be trade-offs between virulence and transmission; variants that make people too sick too quickly may not spread very far. Then again, this virus spreads before people become severely ill. As long as that remains true, the virus could become more virulent without sacrificing transmissibility. Moreover, the same thing that makes the virus more infectious – faster replication or tighter binding to our cells – could also make it more virulent. Indeed, some evidence suggests that Delta is more likely to result in hospitalisation than other variants. “I could actually keep this game of imagining going on for a long time,” Read said. “On my good days, I’m optimistic that the disease severity will go down through time. Because clearly, people being isolated does affect transmission. On my bad days, I worry about it going the other direction.” UNEASY EQUILIBRIUM Although many possible paths remain open to us, what is certain is that SARS-CoV-2 will not stop evolving – and that the arms race between the virus and us is just beginning. We lost the first few rounds, by allowing the virus to spread unchecked, but we still have powerful weapons to bring to the fight. The most notable are highly effective vaccines, developed at record speed. “I think there is hope in the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines at this point are more effective than flu vaccines have probably ever been,” Bloom said. Even the first-generation vaccines provide substantial protection against disease, and there is plenty of room to improve them by tinkering with the dosing and timing, tailoring them to new variants or developing new approaches, such as nasal sprays, that may be better at halting transmission. “I have great faith that we can sort any detrimental evolutionary trajectories out by improving our current or next generation vaccines,” Read said. The occasional breakthrough infection or booster could help top up our flagging immunity and teach our bodies to recognize new mutations, ultimately making us less vulnerable to the next variant that comes along. “Maybe you have a reinfection, but it’s relatively mild, which also boosts your immunity,” Gounder said. Meanwhile, as the number of completely vulnerable hosts dwindles, and transmission slows, the virus will have fewer opportunities to mutate. One recent paper, which has not yet been reviewed by experts, suggests that rising vaccination rates may already be suppressing new mutations. And the evolution rate could also slow down as the virus becomes better adapted to humans. “There’s low-hanging fruit,” Lauring said. “So there are certain ways it can evolve and make big improvements, but after a while there aren’t areas to improve – it’s figured out all the easy ways to improve.” Eventually, as viral evolution slows down and our immune systems catch up, we will reach an uneasy equilibrium with the virus, scientists predict. We will never extinguish it, but it will smolder rather than rage. What that equilibrium point looks like exactly – how much transmission there is and how much disease it causes – is uncertain. Some scientists predict that the virus will ultimately be much like the flu, which can still cause serious illness and death, especially during seasonal surges. Others are more optimistic. “My guess is that one day this is going to be another cause of the common cold,” said Jennie Lavine, who explored that possibility as an infectious disease researcher at Emory University. There are four other coronaviruses that have become endemic in human populations. We are exposed to them early and often, and all four mostly cause run-of-the-mill colds. COVID-19 might just be what it looks like when a novel coronavirus spreads through a population without any preexisting immunity. “This may not be such a different beast than everything else that we’re accustomed to,” Lavine said. “It’s just a bad moment.” Of course, plenty of uncertainties remain, scientists said, including how long it will take to reach equilibrium. With infections beginning to decline again in the United States, hopes are again rising that the worst of the pandemic is behind us. But much of the world remains unvaccinated, and this virus has already proved capable of surprising us. “We should be somewhat cautious and humble about trying to predict what it is capable of doing in the future,” Crotty said. While we can’t guard against every eventuality, we can tip the odds in our favor by expanding viral surveillance, speeding up global vaccine distribution and tamping down transmission until more people can be vaccinated, scientists said. The actions we take now will help determine what the coming years look like, said Dr Jonathan Quick, a global health expert at Duke University and the author of The End of Epidemics. The future, he said, “depends much, much more on what humans do than on what the virus does"". By Emily Anthes © The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/scdf-emergency-medical-services-ambulance-995-call-2246786,SCDF has ‘implemented various measures’ following 35% spike in emergency medical service calls,"SINGAPORE: The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) has seen a 35 per cent increase in the number of calls requiring emergency medical services in the past three weeks, it said on Friday.  This is an increase from an average of about 550 calls per day to about 750 calls per day.  Responding to CNA queries, an SCDF spokesperson said the COVID-19 situation had “put a tremendous strain” on the healthcare system, including the force’s emergency medical services.  “To ensure the safety of the patients we convey, we have introduced infection control measures for EMS (emergency medical services), including decontaminating our ambulances after conveying every COVID-19 patient.  “In addition, in the last three weeks, SCDF has seen about a 35 per cent increase in the number of calls requiring EMS, from an average of about 550 calls a day to about 750 calls a day.”  To address this, the SCDF has “implemented various measures” to ensure that it can continue to “respond swiftly” to life-threatening emergencies, said the spokesperson.  “SCDF would like to assure the public that we remain committed to attending to day-to-day medical emergencies, while helping the national effort to manage the COVID-19 situation,” the spokesperson said.  This comes after a Straits Times reader said she was told she would have to wait 30 to 40 minutes for an ambulance after making an emergency call. In a forum letter published on Oct 7, Ms Tan Kexin said, on Sep 29, she had called 995 after father collapsed in the toilet. “I was shocked when the call operator told me that all ambulances had been deployed because of COVID-19 cases and there would be a 30- to 40-minute wait for an ambulance to reach us,” Ms Tan wrote.  “The ambulance eventually took 30 minutes to arrive, even though it was a weekday afternoon with little traffic and my home is a five-minute drive to the nearest restructured hospital, which the ambulance took him to. “I understand that we are in the middle of a pandemic, but I find it strange to be told at the time I called that all ambulances had been deployed and capacity was strained because of COVID-19.” Ms Tan wrote: “Every second counts for patients who have suffered an emergency condition like cardiac arrest, stroke or a traffic accident, while the outcome is unlikely to be much different for a suspected COVID-19 case if he is taken to the hospital an hour later. “Is this the most effective way to triage? Are we inadvertently prioritising some lives over others in how we are handling this pandemic?” In its response, the SCDF thanked Ms Tan for her “feedback” and added that the team had since spoken to her about her concerns.  “We understand the anxiety of Ms Tan and her family, and agree that every second counts during critical medical emergencies such as cardiac arrest, stroke and trauma,” said the spokesperson.  The SCDF’s emergency medical service prioritises life-threatening emergencies, the spokesperson stressed.  “Since 2017, SCDF has put in place the 995 call triaging system to assess and differentiate medical cases based on their severity. The system helps us better manage our resources by dispatching the most appropriate resources for each case.”  Speaking in Parliament earlier in October, Senior Minister of State for Health Dr Janil Puthucheary said that the Health Ministry had set up a dedicated fleet of 95 additional ambulances to send COVID-19 patients to different healthcare facilities. Before mid-September, it took 12 hours to send patients above 70 who test positive for COVID-19 in a polymerase chain reaction test to the hospital, said Dr Puthucheary.  That figure had since risen to between 48 hours and 72 hours from the time such patients get their results, he added, citing this as an example of how the recent spike in COVID-19 cases had impacted Singapore’s healthcare capacity. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/jalan-tukang-migrant-workers-dormitory-riot-complaints-about-food-2245091,Sembcorp Marine has ‘taken note’ of feedback on hygiene and quality of food served to migrant workers in Jalan Tukang,"SINGAPORE: Sembcorp Marine has “taken note of the feedback” on the hygiene and quality of food served to the migrant workers employed by the company, it said on Thursday night (Oct 14).  Responding to CNA's queries about the Ministry of Manpower’s (MOM) investigation at the Westlite Jalan Tukang dormitory on Wednesday, the company said in a statement that it has issued reminders to the food caterer on “strict adherence” to hygiene standards.  “The company is cognisant of the diverse food preferences of migrant workers from different cultures and has been working closely with the caterer to continuously cater to the differing needs of the individuals,” the statement read.  On Wednesday, MOM sent its officers to investigate allegations about breaches of COVID-19 health protocols, a lack of access to medical support and the poor quality of catered food at the dormitory.  Police were also deployed, with dozens of police officers in protective gear, along with others wearing red berets.  When CNA arrived at the dormitory on Wednesday afternoon, there were four Special Operations Command vehicles and several other armoured police vehicles parked along the road outside.  The allegations were published in an online article on Weixin, the domestic version of WeChat used in China. In the article, disgruntled workers shared photos of insects and hair they found in their food.  Photos of long queues and workers being transported out of the dormitory also surfaced. Some workers quoted in the article said they slept outside their rooms after testing positive for COVID-19, to avoid infecting those they shared a room with.  Centurion Corporation, which operates the Westlite Jalan Tukang dormitory, confirmed on Thursday that the transfer of COVID-19 cases from the dormitory to recovery and healthcare facilities was delayed.  This was due to a “spike” in infections among SembCorp Marine workers, the dormitory operator said.  In its statement earlier on Thursday, the operator said it wanted to provide ""context and clarity"" to claims made in relation to SembCorp Marine workers living at the dormitory. The dormitory has a capacity of 3,400 beds, of which 40 per cent - about 1,400 beds - were occupied by SembCorp Marine workers, said Centurion on Thursday. ""Over the past week, there has been a spike in cases detected among SembCorp Marine workers. Due to the large numbers, there have been delays in conveyance to recovery facilities and healthcare facilities,"" the operator said in the statement.  Centurion has been working closely with MOM's Assurance, Care and Engagement (ACE) Group to ""overcome the logistical challenges posed by this recent increase"" in COVID-19 infections, it said.  All the cases have been taken to the appropriate care or recovery facilities, and the ACE Group has deployed a mobile medical team at the dormitory, said Centurion.  The dormitory operator is following the mandatory COVID-19 health testing and movement protocols, and it has been working closely with the relevant authorities, said Sembcorp Marine in its statement.  “The company is mindful that the current protocols in Singapore may not be apparent to the residents in the Tukang Dorm, and may differ from COVID-19 management measures from their home country,” the statement read.  “In this regard, the company, jointly with ACE and Westlite, have been on the ground providing clarifications and assurance to the residents on such measures.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/health-supplements-dos-and-donts-2215126,Taking vitamins on an empty stomach? 8 do's and don'ts of health supplements,"Remember the health trends of the 90s, when everything you read seemed to advocate fish oil for better heart health, gingko biloba was the talisman for warding off Alzheimer’s disease, and “antioxidants” was the catchphrase du jour? Health trends have certainly shifted. Instead of chlorella pills, people are now adding scoops of spirulina powder into their shakes. And it wasn’t that long ago when the health-conscious among us started adding prebiotic powders to their online purchases of probiotic capsules.   Whatever these health trends may be, it's obvious people are always looking to safeguard their health. That couldn’t have been more obvious than during this pandemic. When the DORSCON (Disease Outbreak Response System Condition) level was raised from yellow to orange in February 2020, the sale of vitamin C and multivitamins went up by three to five times in Singapore, according to an NTUC FairPrice spokesperson in a Nutra-Ingredients Asia article.  But while doctors would rather you spend your money on a balanced diet for your nutritional needs, that doesn’t stop people from buying supplements such as vitamin C, iron and calcium. In a July 2020 survey by Rakuten Insight, more than half of Singaporeans (53 per cent, to be exact) from ages 25 to 44 took dietary supplements.  If you belong to this portion of the population, you may have heard of some dos and don’ts such as certain supplement combos to avoid. CNA Lifestyle finds out from the Pharmaceutical Society of Singapore's (PSS) Community Chapter whether these hold water or not.  DON'T COMBINE FISH OIL AND VITAMIN E: FALSE You may have read this on some websites but is it accurate? “This statement most likely originated from unverifiable online sources claiming that taking fish oil and vitamin E together can result in excessive bleeding,” said Lee Yap Huat, a senior pharmacist.  “There are ongoing studies and some published ones to assess the effects of combining fish oil and vitamin E to relieve menstrual pain and to improve blood sugar levels in patients with coronary artery disease,” he told CNA Lifestyle.    In fact, certain supplements contain a combination of both. But if you are thinking of starting on a regime of fish oil or vitamin E supplements, check with your doctor first – especially if you are on medication or have medical conditions.  DON'T COMBINE CALCIUM AND IRON: TRUE There's truth to the fact that you shouldn't, according to Lee. “Studies have shown that the absorption of iron can be reduced if an iron supplement is combined with a calcium supplement and/or calcium-containing product such as milk.” If you have to take both iron and calcium tablets, space them at least two hours apart, he recommended. DON’T TAKE VITAMINS ON AN EMPTY STOMACH: IT DEPENDS It's about the type of vitamins you’re taking, said pharmacist Wang Hui. “Fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D, E and K are better absorbed when taken with food. This is because fatty foods trigger the release of bile, a digestive fluid, which is essential for the absorption of these vitamins.” Also, make sure you eat something first before you pop fish oil or iron supplements, especially when they are consumed in higher quantities, she said, as they can upset an empty stomach.  However, water-soluble vitamins, such as vitamins B and C, are better absorbed when taken on an empty stomach, Wang clarified.  DON’T MIX ZINC WITH ANTIBIOTICS: TRUE If you’re put on antibiotics such as tetracyclines and quinolones by your doctor, you’ll want to take your zinc tablets separately, advised Wang. “Zinc can bind to these types of antibiotics, which prevents the body from absorbing both zinc and the antibiotic,” she said.  Examples of these antibiotics include doxycycline (for acne) and ciprofloxacin (for lung, skin, urinary tract infections). “When in doubt, take the antibiotics at least two hours before or four to six hours after taking a zinc supplement,” advised Wang. DO PAIR VITAMIN C WITH IRON: TRUE This is a combo that works well together, said Wang. “Vitamin C and iron bind together to form a complex which makes it easier for the body to absorb iron.”  Just how much better is the absorption? When iron is consumed with 25mg to 100mg of vitamin C, the body’s absorption of iron increases by four times compared to just taking iron on its own, said Wang. FAT-SOLUBLE VITAMINS HAVE MORE STAYING POWER: TRUE This could be owing to the fact that fat-soluble vitamins are stored in the liver or fat tissue for later use, explained Carolyn Chan, a senior pharmacist.  “In comparison, water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water and are absorbed, but the excess is passed out from the body,” she said.  But that doesn’t mean you load up on the water-soluble nutrients. “Each vitamin has its own purpose and there is a recommended daily allowance for each vitamin,” said Chan. In fact, if you are consuming sufficient nutrients through your diet, you may not even need a supplement, she added. DON’T TAKE SUPPLEMENTS WITH TEA OR COFFEE: TRUE If you have the habit of chasing down your supplements, especially calcium or iron tablets, with your morning coffee, reconsider. “Tea and coffee contain caffeine which may reduce the absorption of certain minerals,” said pharmacist Lim Cinny.  “Caffeine is also a diuretic that increases urination. This may cause water-soluble vitamins such as vitamins B and C to be passed out of the body more quickly,” she said. To be safe, space your supplements at least two hours from your last sip of tea, coffee or cola. MISSED A DOSE? JUST TAKE IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE: TRUE Yes, you can, advised Chan. But skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. This will prevent you from double dosing, she said. Still, missing your supplements is not that big of a deal unless they are prescribed for treating a certain deficiency, said Chan. “Supplements are meant to fill the gaps in your diet and it takes times for them to build up in the blood and take effect. Thus, patients are unlikely to experience any immediate effects when they miss a single dose.”  Chan explained that this is unlike medicines for treating certain conditions, where missing a dose can result in patients experiencing immediate symptoms, such as an increased blood sugar level due to missing a dose of anti-diabetic medication."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/dr-raymond-yuen-death-covid-19-macpherson-hosanna-medical-centre-2238576,"GP who died from COVID-19 was ‘a different type of doctor’, patients say","SINGAPORE: Dr Raymond Yuen, the general practitioner (GP) who died on Saturday (Oct 9) after contracting COVID-19, had a reputation that preceded him. He once housed a cancer patient in his clinic while caring for him, said a former colleague who only wanted to be known as Mdm Ong. It was how she first heard of him, before meeting him years later when they volunteered at the 365 Cancer Prevention Society. Before he died, Dr Yuen was its honorary assistant secretary.  After meeting him, Mdm Ong said it struck her that “it (was) something that he would do”. “He was someone who will go all the way to help when he knows you need help,” said Mdm Ong, 50. A doctor with more than 30 years of experience, Dr Yuen completed his medical degree from the University of Hong Kong in 1987. He went on to pursue a masters degree at the National University of Singapore. Though Dr Yuen was a general practitioner, he was highly interested in cancer research, regularly organising free talks on cancer for the public, said Mdm Ong. And at his own clinic, Hosanna Medical Centre in MacPherson, he often charged low fees, she added. “He wasn’t going for money. You see his clinic, it’s a very simple set-up … He was a very simple person.” On Monday morning, Member of Parliament Tin Pei Ling (PAP- MacPherson) described him in a Facebook post as ""a caring GP"". Residents shared how the “affable” Dr Yuen made visits to the clinic less intimidating, she said, adding that they also enjoyed tips on ""leading a healthy and holistic lifestyle, which he was so passionate about"". She also said Dr Yuen had kept consultation charges low to encourage more vulnerable residents to seek medical care when they had to. “Many of us are moved by his benevolence to the community."" His death came as a shock to those CNA spoke to.  MacPherson resident Julia Tay said she had just seen the doctor two weeks ago. She added that he had always been healthy - even looking much younger than his 65 years of age. Her husband, who first started seeing Dr Yuen 18 years ago, would get medication from him every month. Recounting stories of his generosity, Mdm Tay said: “At one stage, our finances were really very bad. So sometimes, money (was) not enough, then he said: ‘Never mind, you owe me.’” On top of that, treatment was cheaper than at other clinics, said the 69-year-old. “We (had gone) to other doctors - the same medication, everything, the same injection, the whole thing, they can charge him S$400 to S$500 ... Over here, the doctor only charged me $100 or $140.” Dr Yuen would also often give them vitamins for free. “You can feel when you go to see him, you feel at ease … He just cares for your health, it’s not for the charges,” said Mdm Tay. Now, she is worried about the old folks in the neighbourhood. “People here are not rich. So with him not around, I think a lot of (the elderly) will be badly affected. Especially because he doesn’t charge them expensively - if he knows that you have no money, he just gives you (treatment for) free.” Ms Alyssa Christudason, who first visited Dr Yuen’s clinic about 10 years ago, recounted how his “holistic” approach had helped with her recurring infections. Before that, many other doctors had simply prescribed antibiotics and antifungal medication, she said. But at her first appointment, Dr Yuen sat with her “for a long time” to understand her situation, including her diet and mental health, and explained to her how these aspects could affect her overall condition.  “I think what many people would say is that he was a different type of doctor, very holistic. “He is not going to be giving you meds right off the cuff, (he would ask) you to go and do a few lifestyle changes, take your vitamin D,” said Ms Christudason, a phonics teacher.  He would eventually find out the cause of her infections - a dietary allergy. Another thing she will “never forget” is how there would always be many elderly patients at the clinic, Ms Christudason said.  “Sometimes they wouldn't really even be ill per se, they will just kind of go there because, I think maybe they must have felt safe, and they'll just have their checks with him and then they would go back,” she said, adding that she last saw him two years ago.  “He was a pretty special character. His kindness could be seen.” A 63-year-old former cancer patient, who only wanted to be known as Aaron, last met Dr Yuen during a catch-up session on Sep 10. Dr Yuen had mentioned then that he had received his first dose of the Sinopharm vaccine, said Aaron. Like Ms Christudason, Aaron said that Dr Yuen often took a holistic approach, and was “patient-oriented”. “As a person he is very kind, very gentle, he does show genuine care and concern,” he said. He added that Dr Yuen’s death will have a “significant impact” on patients who need his advice and treatment. “My concern is for them – I wonder who can take over his clinic and do what he does,” he said. “He (was) doing amazing work among the community and giving them hope.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/oral-cancer-mouth-how-do-self-check-2225031,"Check your mouths regularly, doctors urge, as oral cancer patients get younger","SINGAPORE: Mr Jesse Pangelinan saw a “perfect red circle” on his left inner cheek one day in August last year when he was brushing his teeth. He suspected it could be a sign of oral cancer. But instead of seeing a doctor, he decided to self-medicate. The ulcer, which was indeed a sign of oral cancer, eventually grew so big that surgery to remove it has left him without parts of his lip and his cheek. At the time, the 32-year-old was apart from his wife who was in Singapore and hid the problem from her. Mr Pangelinan was in the Northern Mariana Islands, a part of the United States where he would travel frequently to for his job as a lecturer in a community college. In January this year, when the Singapore permanent resident was still in the Marianas where he was born, he went for a free oral cancer screening and a biopsy confirmed that he had the disease. Oral cancer is common there as betel nut leaf chewing – one of the risk factors for the illness – is prevalent there, said Mr Pangelinan who had the habit growing up. It became harder for Mr Pangelinan to hide the problem – the tumour had grown so large that it could be seen when he was talking. “Whenever I talk, you can start to see like it was kind of growing already. You can see there’s something in my mouth,” he said. Although she could not see him physically, his wife, a Singaporean, noticed the growth over a video call. “My mouth was already starting to droop because the tumour had already grown … My wife thought I had a stroke,” he said. He could not fully close his mouth and was “constantly drooling”. “I always had to have something with me to wipe up the pus, and it was bleeding too … it was so nasty,” he said. Mr Pangelinan came to Singapore in February this year to seek treatment at the National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS). By then, his disease had reached an advanced stage – the growth had pierced the skin of his face and was protruding out of it. An operation to remove the tumour was successful, but parts of his cheek and lips had to be removed, along with the teeth on the left side of his mouth where the tumour was. While that has left a permanent scar on his face, Mr Pangelinan is able to speak and eat normally, although he can only take in smaller portions at a time as he is unable to open his mouth as wide as before.  Seeking treatment for oral cancer late can lead to issues with swallowing and speech, said Professor Gopal Iyer, a head and neck cancer surgeon. As the tumour progresses, the portions of the tongue or other parts of the oral cavity that need to be removed become more “extensive”, said Prof Iyer, who is head of the department of head and neck surgery at Singapore General Hospital and NCCS. Roof of mouth: Tilt your head back to inspect the hard palate and soft palate.
Lips: Look and feel inside your lips.
Tonsil area: Examine your tonsil area at the back of your mouth.
Cheeks: Look and feel inside your cheeks.
Tongue: Stick out your tongue and look at the top and under surface.
Floor of mouth: Inspect this area by lifting your tongue up.
Upper and lower jaw: Inspect your upper and lower jaw.   Source: National Cancer Centre Singapore The survival rate also drops in later stages of oral cancer, which is the most common head and neck cancer the centre sees, said Dr Iyer, who is also Mr Pangelinan’s doctor. Among those who seek treatment early, the survival rate is “upwards of” 85 to 90 per cent. However, among those who present late, this rate drops to 40 per cent, he said.  The cancer progresses fast as well. “(In) two to three months you can go from Stage 2 to Stage 4,” said Dr Iyer. Oral cancer patients make up an average of 100 patients out of about 800 new head and neck cancer patients annually at NCCS. This underscores the importance of people checking their mouths for early signs and symptoms, said Dr Iyer. “The oral cavity is so easy to examine, it's not something that needs anything beyond really good lighting, a mirror and awareness. “There's a disproportion between how easy it is to identify and diagnosis, versus those patients that do present late … we want to break that cycle.” People should look out for things like ulcers that do not heal within two weeks, red or white patches that “you cannot brush away”, and lumps with some blood, he said. Other signs to look out for are difficulty swallowing and soreness at a particular site, he added. “It's important to talk about this because we do see an increasing trend in oral cancers in younger patients,” Dr Iyer said. Oral cancer patients in Singapore used to be mostly in their 60s and 70s, but more are now in their 50s and 60s. Dr Iyer said NCCS sees some patients in their 20s and 30s – and even teens – although these cases are rare. “We see a much younger group of non-smokers, non-drinkers having oral cancers. The reasons are unknown,” he said. Risk factors for oral cancer include tobacco use, which includes smoking, second-hand smoking and chewing tobacco, excessive alcohol use and trauma to the mouth caused by sharp teeth or bad dentures. Dr Iyer said that dentists are the “best port of call” when patients are in doubt as they are trained to pick up signs of oral cancer. Dr Chelsia Sim, senior consultant in oral and maxillofacial surgery at the National Dental Centre Singapore, said that dentists are trained to examine the oral mucosa and teeth. “We are familiar with the normal structures in the oral cavity and hence can pick up on abnormalities which can be pre-cancerous changes,” she said. Dentists look out for white or red patches as well as persistent ulcers or sores in the mouth that do not heal after two to three weeks, she said. “We also check for swellings, lumps or bumps inside the mouth, either on the gums, tongue, lips, floor of mouth or the roof of the mouth,” she said. She echoed Dr Iyer’s view on the importance of checking the mouth for symptoms regularly for early detection of any pre-cancerous lesions. “People should perform self-checks to look for any irregularities and if they notice any changes in their mouth or find any of the above symptoms, they should see their dentist immediately to get a thorough oral examination,” she said. However, given that sometimes symptoms may be hard to spot or too small to see, she suggested seeing a doctor at least once a year for an oral examination. Dr Sim said that a lack of awareness can delay the diagnosis of oral cancer as most of the pre-cancerous symptoms are painless. “When they start to notice these changes when it becomes painful, it is highly likely that the cancer has spread deep and this will impact the outcome of treatment,” she said. For Mr Pangelinan, it was only after his surgery that reality sank in. “It hit me – it hit me I'm never going to be the same again.” His advice for others is to seek treatment early. “Please don't wait, man. Just go, it's easy,” he said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/experiences/trapeze-recreation-club-wellness-retreat-singapore-2230206,Need a pick-me-up? Consider Tanjong Pagar for your next wellness retreat,"Taking a deep breath, I step into the cold plunge pool quickly before my sense of self-preservation kicks in. But just standing calf deep in the 10ºC water, I find there is no way I can will myself to sit, so that my entire body is submerged in this freezing water. What unique form of torture is this, you wonder. Once a form of therapy that elite athletes like Olympians or marathoners used to aid muscle recovery and reduce inflammation, ice plunge baths have gained popularity among the fitness- and wellness-inclined. Which is why, there I was, at Trapeze Rec Club (TRC), one of the newest fitness and wellness clubs in town, gawking at the strange sensation of my legs going numb in mere seconds.
  Thankfully, the recreation club’s plunge pool is located on a private outdoor terrace, so there is no one around to witness my rather undignified clambering out of the icy water. I hotfoot it to the sauna cabin, just four steps from the pool and settle into the comforting heat with a sigh of relief. This is just one of the indulgent holistic facilities available at TRC, which bills itself as a one-stop destination that offers a diverse array of fitness and wellness options, ranging from fitness and yoga classes to reflexology massages and mental wellbeing therapy sessions with a clinical psychologist. Soon, a Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner will be added to the roster too. With so many activities to choose from, it is entirely possible to create a customised wellness retreat to sculpt your body and pamper your mind the next time you have leave to spare. In fact, this is exactly what a growing number of guests are doing, said founder GJ Wee, a health and fitness enthusiast who started Trapeze after noticing that there were few such destinations where one could enjoy a range of holistic treatments all under one roof. Inclusivity is a key consideration too – while members get to enjoy perks such as discounts and access to the thermal suite, most of the classes and activities are also open to drop-ins. “Besides yoga or gym sessions, people like spending up to half a day at Trapeze, where they can use the thermal suite, have a sports recovery massage and enjoy nourishing yet delicious food at the cafe,” said Wee, 27. Plus, with TRC conveniently located right on Tanjong Pagar Road, city dwellers do not have to travel deep into the woods to enjoy a respite from their manic lifestyles. Housed in a four-storey pre-war art deco shophouse, the light-filled space is predominantly clad in natural tones, with wooden floors and exposed cement and brick walls. To freshen up the vibe, there are splashes of lavender and sage green – the Club’s signature colours – as decorative motifs. Design elements such as custom-made wall light sconces, curved mirrors and a meditative mural by artist Dawn Ang aka Aeropalmics add to the visual interest of the space. True to TRC’s ethos, the level 2 cafe aka Canteen features a superfood centric menu of drinks, smoothies as well as yoghurt and acai bowls. Just about every item on the menu is liberally supercharged with nutrition-packed ingredients like bee pollen, moringa and reishi to dial up the feel-good factor. My personal favourite is the Golden Latte, a brew of turmeric, ashwagandha, cinnamon and even a dash of black pepper for an invigorating zing. Adventurous souls should try the Spicy Dan Dan yoghurt, which includes peanut butter, chilli oil and refreshing Japanese cucumber – it may sound weird but works surprisingly well, especially for those who like a kick to their nosh. Rejuvenated from the nourishment and also from the shock of dipping myself in very cold water, it is time for yoga with yoga manager Kristin Khor. The Ebb and Flow vinyasa practice, where you flow from one pose to another, is a great way to work up a sweat while stretching, bending and twisting into various pretzel shapes. Khor is also a whizz at giving verbal cues and careful hands-on adjustments, which can go a long way in elevating one’s yoga practice, whether you are a beginner or a more advanced yogi. TRC also offers a mix of fitness classes which focus on different goals such as strength training, endurance or mobility and movement. During the strength class I attended, we were led through a series of core, upper and lower body reps and sets under fitness manager Jarratt R’s watchful eye. He emphasises form and technique and takes time to work with each individual, even in a group setting to ensure we are maximising our gym time and getting our money’s worth out of the session. Then, it is off to my final stop of the day – my long-awaited foot reflexology session. As with the other practitioners at Trapeze, massage therapist Khoon Hai is a master at his trade. As he expertly kneads into the various pressure points on my feet to clear out the “energy blockages”, he peppers our conversation with interesting trivia about this Chinese massage technique and shares practical wellness tips, which serve as a good reminder that I ought to pay more attention to my health on a daily basis. Best of all, not only did I feel like I was walking on clouds after my foot massage therapy, the session also miraculously eased the tension in the rest of my body too. Before I left, I stole away to a tiny balcony to enjoy a moment to myself. As I looked down on bustling Tanjong Pagar, it struck me that the greatest luxury in being here is getting to arrive at the right headspace to enjoy this cocoon of calm, instead of worrying about the next ten items on my to-do list. The next challenge – to maintain this serenity as I get back to regular programming."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/maternal-child-health-research-institute-mchri-kk-hospital-2229526,"New maternal and child health research institute opens in Singapore, addressing 'unmet needs' of population","SINGAPORE: A new research institute focusing on maternal and child health was launched at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) on Friday (Oct 8), to fill ""unmet needs"" of the population by taking a ""life-course approach"" to its research.  The SingHealth Duke-NUS Maternal and Child Health Research Institute (MCHRI) aims to ""support the growth and development of every woman and child to their fullest potential"", according to a press release from KKH. ""As we move forward in 2021 and beyond, we want to take a life-course approach in (the institute) to improve the health of the mother, child and the family as a holistic entity (by) analysing and understanding their lives in the structural, social and cultural context,"" said Associate Professor Ng Kee Chong, director of MCHRI, at a media briefing on Thursday.  This holistic approach to maternal and child health starts from the womb, and designs the ""continuum of care"" from pregnancy to childbirth, infancy to childhood, and adolescence to adulthood, he said.  Speaking at the launch of the research institute, Second Minister for Health Masagos Zulkifli acknowledged the current research on how certain health risks in mothers can impact their child’s developmental outcomes. ""The Integrated Maternal and Child Wellness Hub at Punggol Polyclinic ... provides integrated primary care services for both mother and child. For example, during the child’s developmental screening, the mother too will be supported and screened for post-natal depression, if she exhibits certain signs during the visit. Because local research tells us that this is a risk factor for both mother and child,"" he said. He added that the new research institute would contribute to the local research and scientific landscape by driving ""clinical and translational research, innovation, and digital strategies to advance clinical care"". ""These efforts span critical domains in child and maternal health, such as in reproductive, metabolic, mental health, as well as neurocognitive development and treatments for cancers and more,"" he said. Assoc Prof Ng, who is also the chairman of the medical board at KKH, added that the research institute plans to ""address maternal and child health disparities in our system"", as well as ""improve and enhance maternal and child health literacy in our population"".  ""We want to gain insights into maternal and child health issues that face us as Singaporeans. We also want to implement interventions with practical, sustainable solutions to mitigate these risks and to improve maternal and child health. And we want to integrate into existing national policies and existing family care programmes,"" he said.  Despite Singapore's ""world class"" healthcare system, there are still ""gaps and unmet needs"" in maternal and child health, noted Assoc Prof Ng.  The first is the metabolic health of mothers and children.  ""We have various projects going on in the community. One of them is the Healthy Early Life Moments in Singapore (a series of practice-oriented webinars organised by KKH), where we want to influence the behaviour of women and children in their metabolic health. What a child eats and how the child is brought up in terms of their nutrition is very important,"" he said.  The second need to be addressed is the mental health of mothers and children amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  ""There's a lot of mental stress. As a pediatrician by training, I see a lot of children who are stressed. Adolescents, for example ... children are mentally quite stressed,"" he said.  ""For women ... we find that there is quite a lot of postnatal depression. In pregnant women also, there's a high incidence of diabetes and metabolic conditions.""  The research institute will also partner with Menarini Biomarkers Singapore, the diagnostics arm of Italy’s Menarini Group, to create a regional and international medical hub in Singapore for ""non-invasive diagnostics in prenatal and targeted therapies for better clinical outcomes"", stated the press release.  This non-invasive prenatal diagnosis carries ""minimal risks and discomfort"" to pregnant women.  ""With a needle prick and tiny amounts of blood from the mother, clinical teams can identify, isolate and analyse single cells with high precision. Using predictive biomarkers, doctors can isolate in real-time circulating fetal cells, and detect chromosome abnormalities in fetal cells circulating in the mother’s blood,"" the press release added. ""This is particularly beneficial for discovering genetic disorders in high-risk pregnancies. It will enable would-be parents and healthcare teams to make better decisions about the care for the child even before the child is born.""  However, while the research institute is an opportunity to involve medical and nursing students, as well as allied health partners, Assoc Prof Ng said the institute also hopes to work with partners beyond the health community.  ""Beyond the healthcare sector, we want to bring in the social system, partners from the Ministry of Social and Family Development, as well as our partners from education. Because to bring up a child, it takes a village,"" he said.  ""We don't want to medicalise health. We want to socialise health. ... I mean, as a doctor, it's very easy to say, just treat (health) as a medicine kind of thing. But it's not just medicine, it's also a social, educational and cultural setup that we need to address collectively for our women and children."" "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ntu-nus-detect-covid-19-viral-rna-air-2230126,"NUS, NTU scientists and doctors develop new way to detect COVID-19 viral RNA in the air","SINGAPORE: Scientists and doctors from the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University have developed a way to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the air in indoor settings.  SARS-CoV-2 RNA refers to the nucleic acid coding for the COVID-19 virus.  The team, comprising scientists and doctors from NTU’s Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering (SCELSE) and NUS’ Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, trialled the method in two inpatient wards at a hospital caring for active COVID-19 patients.  The study found that their air surveillance approach produced a “higher detection rate” of environmental virus RNA, compared to surface swab samples collected in the same area, said NUS and NTU in a joint news release on Friday (Oct 8).   The study demonstrated the detection of viral RNA in the air, which is the “strength” of the device and method, said Professor Paul Tambyah, deputy director of NUS Medicine’s Infectious Diseases Translational Research Programme.  “If we can put it in a place where we think that there's no COVID patients, then if you find viral RNA, then that’s like doing a swab PCR for 30 people. Instead of doing a swab PCR for 30 people you're doing it just through one filter. And then you can know what are the targeted precautions that you need to take,” he added.  Between February and May 2020, the team conducted the study in two hospital wards - a naturally ventilated open-cohort ward and a mechanically ventilated isolation ward.  After the COVID-19 outbreak across migrant worker dormitories last year, patients were moved to open cohort wards from single isolation rooms, and conducting the study in these wards was “much closer to what happens in the real world”, said Prof Tambyah.  “And so this was something like what we thought would happen, say if a family of infected people got on board an aeroplane, or a group of presymptomatic people walked into a conference hall for a meeting,” said Prof Tambyah, who is also President of Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection.  “The key was to find out if we could find live virus in the air. And even if we didn’t, to see whether these devices can be used to detect the virus in a public place, so that we wouldn't need to go on a blanket lockdown or travel ban or even potential quarantine,” he added.  Beyond identifying whether there was an infected person in the room or setting, the device can help to make the assessment if the level of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is too high and generates an infection risk, said Professor Stephan Schuster, deputy centre director of SCELSE.  “Of course what we want to create is ventilation situations where it is always too low for people to be at risk.” In the wards, air sampling devices were deployed in combination with an “ultra-low biomass analysis approach” developed by the team from NTU’s SCELSE.  This approach was necessary because in ventilated indoor settings with a large air change rate, it can be “difficult” to detect a viral agent in the air, said NUS and NTU in the press release.  Air change rate refers to how often the air in a room is replaced by outdoor air. For example, the air change rate in a hospital isolation ward can be up to 14 times an hour.  The device is heavy but “not terribly big”, and it can be discreetly placed in a variety of locations with or without airflow to take samples, said Associate Professor David Allen, who is also with the Infectious Diseases Translational Research Programme at NUS.  The RNA that was successfully extracted from the air samples was then subjected to real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain, which has the same sensitivity as the one used for standard COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test samples, the press release read.  “What we found was that ... the higher flow rate improved our detection, and that we could detect the virus, most certainly, particularly when we were closer to patients,” said Assoc Prof Allen, who is also an infectious diseases clinician with the National University Health System (NUHS). “The sampling of air was more successful than sampling of the surface. And there may be several explanations of that, but one certainly is that it's because it's more prevalent in the air than on surfaces.”  However, both air and surface samples found a high prevalence of the virus in areas that were visited by many of the patients, like the toilets, he added.  From the study’s findings, healthcare workers should continue to use personal protective equipment when in proximity to COVID-19 patients, especially earlier in their illness or just before they fall ill, when they have a higher likelihood of shedding the virus, said Assoc Prof Allen.  With further evaluation, this method could be a “useful adjunct” to real-time screening locations for the virus, he added.  “Currently our turnaround time for PCR can be a little delayed but there's a lot of more rapid diagnostics in evolution that may come to become more routinely useful that may give us an answer in 30 minutes whether there's RNA, or even shorter.” The number of devices needed for surveillance depends on the size of the space and ventilation rate, said Dr Irvan Luhung, SCELSE senior research fellow and co-lead author of the study.  For example, in a home environment with a regular air-conditioning unit, one device is probably enough. But highly ventilated settings like a hospital or bigger spaces like restaurants could need more, he added.  The study found that the furthest distance they could detect the virus at was up to 6m, said Dr Luhung. “So you can think of it as a radius of how many samplers you want to deploy in the space.”  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/tips-noodle-dishes-healthy-eating-nutrition-2189916,How unhealthy can your favourite noodle dish get? We break down the facts,"Everyone has his or her favourite noodle dish, whether it's bak chor me or mee siam, mee goreng or ramen.  And that goes for noodle preferences, too, whether it's mee pok, bee hoon, ban mian or soba noodles. Other than rice, noodles have to be the other most popular form of carbohydrates in this part of the world. But as much as we enjoy slurping them up, do we stop to think how they fare in the nutrition department?  Are some noodles healthier than others or are they all the same? Is opting for a soupy noodle dish really better than going for a dry one?  CNA Lifestyle finds out from the dietitians what you’re feeding your body each time you order noodles for breakfast, lunch or dinner – and tips on how to possibly eat healthier. WHAT’S IN YOUR NOODLES? To give you a better idea how the various types of noodles rank in terms of calories, carbohydrates, fat, sodium and fibre, below is a table of common cooked noodles and their respective nutrition values.  Do note that cooked noodles can be two to 2.5 times higher in weight than their uncooked versions, so the information can be different from the nutrition labels on the packaging. Also, the nutrition values may differ from brand to brand.  NOODLE TYPE (PER 100G; COOKED) CALORIES (KCAL) (Information: HealthifyMe; and Aptima Nutrition and Sports Consultants) WHICH FLOUR TYPE IS BEST? Whether it’s fried bee hoon or Korean ramyeon, noodles are either made with rice or wheat flour as the key ingredient. A few exceptions are tang hoon (based on mung bean flour), soba (primarily buckwheat flour) and shirataki noodles (made from the konjac root).  Other flour types, such as tapioca flour, potato flour, sago starch and corn starch, may also be added to create a thicker and chewier texture (think kway teow and mee tai mak). Sometimes, salt and oil are used as well.  Unfortunately, most of the noodles that you find on supermarket shelves and in your plate of char kway teow are made with refined flour, regardless of type. Which means you aren't getting much nutrients, save for starch. Even the seemingly healthy soba may contain more refined wheat flour than buckwheat flour. ""Every gram of starch contributes 4 calories and each gram of fat has 9 calories,"" said HealthifyMe’s senior dietitian Kong Pun Pun. In fact, she considered noodles more damaging than the broth or sauce they come with.  “Noodles usually have small amounts of fat but very little or no vitamins, minerals and fibre,” she said. By comparison, the broth or sauce can be “nutrient dense” when made with natural ingredients. But the one thing that puts rice flour above wheat flour is that it doesn't contain gluten and is friendly for those with digestive issues or gluten allergies. If you want healthier noodles, choose something with a shorter ingredient list when shopping at the supermarket. Whenever possible, opt for noodles made with brown rice flour or whole wheat flour instead of refined flour. Better yet, make your own noodles so you know what goes into them.  IS THERE COLOURING? Generally, noodles with a yellowish hue contain eggs, such as pasta (eggs and durum wheat flour) as well as ban mian, mee hoon kueh, mee pok and mee kia, which are made with varying ratios of wheat flour and eggs.  The exception is perhaps yellow noodles, which get their colour and springiness from food-grade lye water. Again, there's no saying for sure so check the ingredient list for artificial colouring.  What about those colourful noodles made with vegetable extracts such as beetroot, pumpkin or spinach? They are typically coloured with powdered vegetable extracts – but they do not deliver much “nutritive benefit”, according to Rachel Tay, a senior dietitian with Gleneagles Hospital’s Food, Nutrition and Beverages Department.  “They are lacking in vitamins and minerals that actual vegetables provide,” she said.  PRACTISE PORTION CONTROL Like other foods, portion control is key if you're keeping a lid on your blood sugar levels, said Jaclyn Reutens, a clinical and sports dietitian at Aptima Nutrition and Sports Consultants. “The portion size of carbs per meal is important.”  Generally, “carb exchange” is a way of counting carbohydrates. One carb exchange equals 15g of carbohydrates, and diabetics should be eating two to three carb exchanges per meal, said Reutens. ""Talk to your diabetic nurse or dietitian for a more personalised carb exchanges plan."" It is also important for diabetics to take note of the glycaemic index (GI) of the food they eat. “The lower the GI, the longer it would take for a rise in blood sugar levels when a particular food is consumed,” explained Tay.  But it isn’t that cut and dried. “Many factors can affect the GI of foods such as the presence of fat, fibre, and the processing and temperature of the food,” she said. Besides, ""there is no specific cap on the GI for diabetics"", said Tay.  If you're cautious about the GI, Reutens suggested keeping to foods with low to medium GIs (1 to 69). BROTH OR DRY? Order or cook the soupy version instead of those with thick sauces, advised Tay. “Sauces tend to contain more sugar, salt and fat than broths,” she said.  Even better, opt for a clear broth (for instance, laksa and chicken stock are both broths but the latter is definitely healthier) and ask for more vegetables to make the dish more nutrient packed, said Tay.  Of course, if you add chili oil or oil cooked down with blackened garlic over your ramen, you’re going to up the dish’s overall nutritional value (read: Fat content), too, said Kong. The same goes for the fragrant bits of fried shallots that you sprinkle on your noodles. You might want to hold those back a little.  But what if you prefer saucy noodles? “A sauce can be made from natural ingredients such as tomatoes, garlic, herbs, onions, spices, vinegar and vegetables, which can contain vitamins, minerals and antioxidant components, that have high nutritional value,” said Kong. For a more nutritionally balanced meal, pair your noodles with ingredients that are high in protein and fibre, suggested Reutens.  For instance, use lean minced meat, chye sim, sliced shitake or button mushrooms for a low-sodium vegetable broth, she recommended.  Or add prawns and/or squid, garlic, olive oil and parsley for a seafood aglio olio pasta.  For an easy stir-fried mee tai mak dish, Reutens suggested minced chicken, bean sprouts, xiao bai chye, spring onions, garlic, soy sauce and olive oil. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/health-tips-reduce-risk-cancer-2178911,How to keep cancer at bay: Everyday tips to help you reduce your risk,"When it comes to health, nothing jolts us out of our complacency as much as a cancer scare. A lump in the breast, unusual vaginal discharge, even changes in our menstrual cycles (heavier- or lighter-than-usual bleeding?) can send the most rational mind into a tailspin. The national statistics aren’t rosy either. Cancer cases among women are on the rise, according to the latest 2018 Singapore Cancer Registry Annual Report by the National Registry of Diseases Office (NRDO).  Between the two periods of 1968-1972 and 2014-2018, the incidence rate increased from 155.0 to 231.6 per 100,000 population.  One explanation for the increase is our longer life expectancy. As more individuals live past their 80s, when the age-specific incidence rate of cancer is at its highest, they add to the statistics, explained the NRDO.  For instance, the proportion of cancer diagnoses among those aged 70 years and above has risen from 17 per cent to 32.3 per cent over the same periods. Since we’re likely to live longer, it pays to make our years as cancer-free as possible. Here’s a look at the lifestyle changes you can make to lower your risk. GET SCREENED YEARLY We’d be remiss to skip health checks. After all, the adage “prevention is better than cure” couldn’t be truer for cancer.  “The early detection of pre-cancerous changes and early-stage cancers with yearly routine screening programmes has proven to save lives”, said Dr Sau Po Yi, the medical director of Nuffield Wellness, a clinic that provides wellness services for the body and mind.  For instance, breast cancer, which is the number one cancer in women, may only require a lumpectomy (removing only the affected part of the breast) when detected early compared to a mastectomy (removing the entire breast) as well as additional treatment such as chemotherapy when picked up at a late stage.  Setting aside the budget for these annual cancer checks – and they can increase as you age – is important. Here’s what the National Cancer Centre Singapore recommends you should include in your checks, according to your age: Breast cancer Cervical cancer Colorectal cancer Financially speaking, one tip is to look out for savings accounts that cover you as you save, such as the UOB Lady’s Savings Account. For instance, you’ll receive a complimentary enhanced health screening package worth up to S$660 when you top up your Lady’s Savings Account. It also provides coverage of up to S$200,000 for six female cancers, including breast, cervix, uterus, fallopian tube, vagina/vulva and ovary.  QUIT SMOKING Smokers probably hear this advice ad nauseum. But the truth of the matter is, tobacco is a major cancer risk factor, said Dr Sau.  Simply put, the poisons in cigarette smoke can weaken your immune system, making it harder for your body to kill the cancer cells. Without this “off” switch, the cancer keeps growing. And it’s not just lung cancer; quitting smoking can also lower the risk for other types of cancer, including of the mouth, throat, oesophagus, pancreas, bladder, stomach, colon, rectum, liver, cervix and kidney, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  You’ll have to stay on course but the rewards are motivating. For instance, your risk of lung cancer is halved within 10 to 15 years of quitting, noted the CDC. Within 20 years of not lighting up, your risk of cervical cancer drops by about half. STAY LEAN Body positivity may be an empowering movement but there comes a time when you need to assess how your weight impacts your health – especially when you have a family history of cancer and/or pre-existing medical conditions such as diabetes or hypertension.  But what’s the link between fat tissue and cancer cells? Several women cancers such as of the breast and endometrium are stimulated by oestrogen.  Fat tissue, in particular, produces an enzyme known as aromatase that can result “in the production of additional oestrogen” and “increase your risk for cancer”, explained Dr Sau.  And it’s not just a woman’s lifetime risk of developing breast cancer that obesity can increase, said Dr Sau; obesity can also boost your risk of uterine and endometrial cancer. EXAMINE YOUR DIET You already know that processed food that is high in fat, sodium and sugar but low in fibre, vitamins and minerals is a recipe for cancer.  But swinging to the other extreme of focusing only on supposedly cancer-fighting “superfoods” such as blueberries, broccoli and green tea isn't necessary either, according to Cancer Research UK. These claims aren’t backed by science; a better bet is to eat as varied and as colourful a range of food as possible.  Choosing food that is as close to its natural state as possible is another good move; for instance, chicken breast versus chicken nuggets.  But what if you’re finding the dietary changes difficult to swallow? “Yes, we are creatures of habit and making the initial change is tough,” said Dr Sau. “More often than not, we start only after certain alarms have gone off in our body system.” The good thing is, no step is too small or too late to make a positive change, she said. “You could start by cutting down the sugar in your drinks or limiting yourself to one bubble tea a week – reduced sugar, of course.” Cutting down on alcohol would also be beneficial, said Dr Sau.  CAN SUPPLEMENTS PROTECT US? As much as we would like a magic pill that can protect us from cancer, there really isn't one, said Dr Sau. “Scientific data have shown that vitamin and mineral supplements have not been able to reduce the risk of any cancers – reproductive ones or otherwise.” You are better off eating more fresh fruits and vegetables – nature’s own health supplements – to help yourself stay cancer-free, she said. For instance, the fibre from these foods can help reduce the risk of colon cancer, she added.  GET ACTIVE Exercise can help you to shed the extra kilos, which is an all-round booster from many perspectives. You feel more confident, more energetic, less moody and you’ll also be less likely to be panting from toting home your groceries.  But what’s just as crucial are the changes that you can’t physically see. According to the Cancer Research UK website, keeping a healthy weight reduces the risk of 13 cancer types.  “One of the reasons for this is that having less body fat can reduce inflammation levels around the body,” it noted. And if you recall from earlier, having less fat tissue also means less cancer-triggering hormones produced.  Being active can also give your immune system a boost and make it work more effectively, according to Cancer Research UK, as well as help move food through your bowel faster. “This means anything harmful in food waste spends less time in our bowel, which may help to prevent bowel cancer,” noted its website. Strive to get at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity, such as jogging, swimming or cycling, a week. As a general goal, include at least 30 minutes of physical activity in your daily routine, so if you're slumped in bed reading this, it's time to get off your butt.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/malaria-vaccine-africa-roll-out-2228536,African Union to start talks with WHO on malaria vaccine roll-out on continent,"NAIROBI: Africa will start talks with the World Health Organization (WHO) about getting the first approved malaria vaccine to the continent as soon as possible, the African Union's top health official said on Thursday (Oct 7), amid calls for funding for drugs beyond COVID-19. John Nkengasong spoke a day after the WHO said RTS,S - or Mosquirix - developed by British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline should be widely given to children in Africa. Experts said the recommendation was potentially a major advance against a disease that kills a quarter of a million African children each year. ""We will be engaging with GAVI (the vaccine alliance) and WHO in the coming days to understand first of all the availability of this vaccine,"" Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), told an online news conference. He urged donors not to play a zero-sum game ""where we fund COVID vaccines and neglect malaria vaccines"". He said it was unclear when the vaccine will be accessible to the many African countries where malaria is endemic because the cost per dose is not known and it is not clear how quickly production can be scaled up. GSK has to date committed to produce 15 million doses of Mosquirix annually up to 2028 at a cost of production plus no more than 5 per cent margin. A global market study led by the WHO this year projected demand for a malaria vaccine would be 50 million to 110 million doses per year by 2030 if it is deployed in areas with moderate to high transmission of the disease. Nkengasong said the WHO's decision to recommend wide use of the malaria vaccine should be celebrated, calling malaria a major killer in Africa. He noted that by the end of 2021, malaria will likely have killed many more people in Africa, especially children, than COVID-19 has this year on the continent. Mosquirix has been 30 years in the making. A WHO-coordinated pilot programme in three African countries has already administered 2.3 million doses of the vaccine since 2019. GAVI will consider in December whether and how to finance the vaccination programme."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/breast-cancer-women-mutated-genes-2201421,How likely are women to carry a mutated gene that can lead to breast cancer?,"When it comes to mutations in humans, they are less fantastical in real life than in the movies. Experts have yet to detect gene mutations that confer X-Men level optic-blasting abilities – although other mutations have turned out to be helpful, such as a lower prevalence of coronary heart disease and practically unbreakable bones.   The likeliest reality (and biggest concern) most people have about gene mutation is the dreaded C-word: Cancer. You don't have to read medical journals to know that DNA changes can increase your risk of developing cancer, including breast cancer for women; the association has become as synonymous as cancer and chemotherapy. But here's where you may have more questions about gene mutations: Can they definitely give you cancer? Should you consider genetic testing? And what do you do if you're found to be a carrier of a mutated gene? CNA Lifestyle finds out from the experts.  WHAT EXACTLY IS A GENE MUTATION? It all happens in one's DNA, which is often depicted in medical illustrations as two strands wound together in a double helix. (Interesting fact: If you could stretch out your DNA found in just one cell, it would be about 2m long.)  Connecting the strands are rods that look like rungs in a ladder. Each “rung” is made up of two components and it is their joining that holds the two twisted strands together. These so-called rungs are known as base pairs in genetics speak, and there are approximately 3 billion base pairs in every single cell in one's body.   What about genes then? A gene is a segment of DNA that gives rise to specific traits such as height and hair colour. There are an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 genes in each person’s complete set of genes known as the genome. Interestingly, not every DNA change is considered a gene mutation, unless it is pathogenic and leads to cancer. In fact, genetics experts have replaced “mutation” with the more neutral-sounding “variant” when discussing non-pathogenic changes.  There are several ways genes can go awry, said Dr Wong Nan Soon, a senior consultant and medical oncologist with OncoCare. When a single base pair is altered, it is known as a point mutation, he explained. Changes can also take place in a single gene or a large segment of the genome, he added.  “Mutations can lead to the silencing of cancer suppressor genes, causing cancer formation. They can also be activating mutations which can drive cancer growth and survival,” said Dr Wong.  WHAT ARE THE GENE MUTATIONS THAT LEAD TO BREAST CANCER? When it comes to breast cancer, there are two pertinent genes that are of concern: BRCA1 (BReast CAncer gene one) and BRCA2. The former was discovered in 1994 and the latter, a year later. But you may not have known about BRCA1 if not for actress Angelina Jolie’s 2013 announcement that she carries a mutation in that gene.  And those aren’t the only gene mutations, although “mutations in BRCA1/2 account for 80 per cent, while mutations in other genes account for the rest of identifiable mutations”, said Professor Lee Soo Chin, a senior consultant and the head of National University Cancer Institute, Singapore’s Department of Haematology-Oncology.  “And there are at least 10 other breast cancer predisposition genes outside of BRCA1/2 that can increase the risk of breast cancer,"" she said. Of these, PALB2, PTEN and TP53 gene mutations top the high-risk list, according to the US-based Breastcancer.org. The PALB2 mutation, for instance, is responsible for increasing the risk of breast cancer from 14 per cent by age 50 to 35 per cent by age 70.  Meanwhile, an abnormality of the cell-regulating PTEN gene can cause Cowden syndrome, a rare disorder that increases the risk of both benign and malignant breast tumours. Women with this mutation have an estimated lifetime breast cancer risk of 25 per cent to 50 per cent; some studies reported a higher risk, at 77 per cent to 85 per cent, according to the website.   TP53 is a gene that suppresses tumour growth but a mutation of the gene can lead to a rare genetic condition known as Li-Fraumeni syndrome, which carries a 54 per cent risk of developing breast cancer by age 70.  HOW COMMON ARE THESE GENE MUTATIONS? Gene mutations in BRCA1/2 occur in about one in 300 to 500 individuals; and about 3 per cent to 5 per cent of breast cancer patients, according to Prof Lee.  As for the possibility for anyone to possess mutations in both BRCA1/2 genes, it is a very infrequent occurrence, said Dr Anthony Tang, a specialist breast cancer surgeon from The Breast Clinic. “From the current available information, the risk seems to be associated with BRCA1 mutation, which is around 85 per cent.” Just to be clear, it’s not just women who carry the BRCA1/2 genes; everyone has them. “However, female mutation carriers are much more likely to develop cancer than male mutation carriers. The lifetime cancer risk in female carriers is more than 80 per cent, while that of male mutation carriers is only about 15 per cent to 20 per cent,” said Prof Lee. As for the other gene mutations mentioned earlier, they are very rare. PALB2, for instance, accounts for only 1 per cent to 2 per cent of inherited breast cancers. For Li-Fraumeni syndrome, it is thought to be as frequent as 1 in 5,000 families to 1 in 20,000 families worldwide.   IF I HAVE THE MUTATED GENE, DOES THAT MEAN I WILL GET BREAST CANCER? Let’s bring it back to the local context. About 10 per cent of women in an Asian population like Singapore have a lifetime risk of developing breast cancer, said Dr Tang.  “By contrast, someone who has the BRCA1 gene mutation has up to an 85 per cent risk of developing breast cancer, and those with a BRCA2 mutation have up to 70 per cent risk,” he said.  Dr Tang added: “These genes also increase the risk of breast cancer in the other breast once a person develops breast cancer. It also increases the risk of males developing breast cancer”. ARE MUTATED GENES INHERITED? CAN THEY SKIP A GENERATION? Yes, they can be inherited. More specifically, if a parent carries the mutated gene, 50 per cent of the children will inherit it, said Dr Wong. The odds are up to 100 per cent, if both parents have the mutated gene. This risk decreases to 25 per cent for second-degree relatives and so on, he said. As for mutated genes skipping generations, that’s not likely, said Prof Lee. “For example, if a person’s maternal grandmother carries a BRCA mutation but did not pass it on to the person’s mother, then the mother cannot pass on the mutation to any of her children.”  OTHER THAN BREAST CANCER, WHAT OTHER CANCER CAN THESE MUTATED GENES CAUSE? “For women, the most alarming increase in risk is that of ovarian cancer, from 1 per cent to 2 per cent without the genes to 40 per cent for those with the mutation,” said Dr Tang. The men aren’t off the hook either as there is an increased risk of prostate cancer if they carry the mutated gene, said Dr Tang. “There is also a small increase in risk of pancreatic cancer for both men and women.” Rarer occurrences include laryngeal cancer and melanomas. WHO SHOULD GET GENETICALLY TESTED FOR BREAST CANCER? Genetic testing is conventionally recommended only to patients who are suspected to have a hereditary cancer predisposition, said Prof Lee. The common scenarios include: The minimum age to test for BRCA1/2 mutations (and for most breast cancer predisposition genes) is above the age of 21, said Prof Lee, as the risk of cancers is low before the age of 21. “This age limit also allows the individual to make an autonomous decision about genetic testing rather than for the parents to decide on his or her behalf,” she said.  Dr Wong added that newly diagnosed breast cancer patients may also be offered genetic testing and they include those with a high clinical risk of recurrence, regardless of age.  Suitable patients are those with “Stage IIIA or higher early-stage breast cancer, triple negative breast cancers which have spread to lymph nodes, and early-stage breast cancers that have not responded well to pre-operative chemotherapy”, he said. IS GENETIC TESTING A PART OF BREAST CANCER PREVENTION EFFORTS? Clinical genetic testing administered by a healthcare provider is considered a standard part of breast cancer prevention efforts, said Dr Tira Tan, a consultant with National Cancer Centre Singapore's Division of Medical Oncology. In fact, it should be done by healthcare professionals at clinical genetic services, she said. ""These units comprise of healthcare professionals, including doctors and genetic counsellors, who provide information to patients and their families on the rationale for genetic testing and also help to interpret the implications of test results."" HOW EFFECTIVE ARE THOSE ONLINE DNA TESTS? Complex changes are involved in genetic mutations. To detect them accurately, Dr Wong explained that the direct sequencing of the entire gene is required to detect areas of deletion or duplication that cause faulty genes to be reproduced, he said. Dr Tan also agreed that ""these tests have limitations and have not been clinically validated"". According to Dr Wong, some direct-to-consumer genetic tests use a different technology. Instead of covering whole regions of genes, they only “detect variations in single DNA base pairs scattered throughout the genome to flag the presence of mutations”.  “For example, some BRCA testings can detect only three types of BRCA mutations commonly found in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish decent. Because there are more than 1,000 possible variants in the BRCA genes, a negative test result from this test does not confirm that an individual does not have a BRCA mutation, especially if the individual is not of Ashkenazi Jewish decent,” said Dr Wong. Furthermore, such direct-to-consumer tests can only detect DNA changes to assess the inheritance or susceptibility to certain illnesses but cannot be used to guide the doctor’s choice of cancer therapy, he said. HOW HAS GENETIC TESTING CHANGED THE WAY CANCER IS TREATED? Genetic testing can help to shed light on the treatment needed, especially with regards to advanced breast cancer. There are two main categories of genetic tests for this purpose, according to Dr Wong. First, somatic mutation testing to detect mutations within the tumour.  ""A common mutation found in hormone receptor positive advanced breast cancer is the PIK3CA mutation, which can be targeted with PI3K inhibitors to prolong the effect of hormonal therapy,"" he said. Conversely, if ESR1 mutations are detected, treatments using tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitor therapy may not be effective, said Dr Wong. The second is germline mutation testing specifically for BRCA1/2 mutations that can be inherited. Tumour cells with a mutated BRCA gene have difficulty repairing damaged DNA, explained Dr Tang. ""PARP inhibitors make it even more difficult by blocking another repair mechanism, leading to the death of these cancer cells."" Perhaps the most known ""treatment"" is Jolie's preemptive strike against cancer after knowing that she carries the mutated gene. Without any cancer diagnosis, she opted to have both her breasts removed in 2013 or what Dr Tang called prophylactic mastectomy. She later had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed as well.  I CARRY THE BREAST CANCER GENE MUTATION. HOW DOES THAT AFFECT MY CANCER PREVENTION EFFORTS? In addition to annual mammograms, Dr Tan also recommended yearly MRI for the breasts for carriers of BRCA1/2 from ages 30 to 70. The MRI screening can begin from age 25 if there is a family history of young onset breast cancer, she added. On a case-by-case basis, there may be discussions with your doctor from age 40 on risk-reduction surgery such as the ones Jolie underwent to remove her breasts, ovaries and fallopian tubes. These procedures serve to reduce your risk of breast cancer as well as ovarian cancer, said Dr Tan. ""For certain patients, there is an additional option to discuss risk-reducing medications such as tamoxifen or raloxifene."" BRCA2 carriers may also consider surveillance for pancreatic cancer through endoscopic ultrasound or an MRI scan, recommended Dr Tan."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-mental-health-startups-singapore-mindfi-intellect-2203336,Pandemic blues drive demand for mental health apps in Singapore,"SINGAPORE: Offering guided meditations, wellness workshops and even training opportunities for staff to become certified care providers are some of the ways foodpanda is building up its mental health support for employees. The food delivery platform said the initiatives have been well-received, and with mental health and well-being becoming a priority amid a prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, it is looking to do more. Starting this month, foodpanda is providing its employees across 12 markets free access to a one-stop mental health support platform. The platform – an app powered by Singapore-based mental health start-up Intellect – provides a range of self-guided tools, from five-minute long “rescue sessions” for stress to weeks-long self-care programmes. Users can also book one-on-one online consultations with licensed counsellors and behavioural coaches. This follows a three-month trial in its Singapore office earlier in April, which yielded “overwhelmingly positive” results. Ninety-eight per cent of employees surveyed asked for the app to be included as part of the company’s mental health benefits, the company said. Since then, more than 250 employees based in Singapore have signed up for the app. It was extended to employees in other markets on Oct 1. “With the Intellect app, we can provide personalised support for employees working in different countries, which is especially important when COVID-19 has prevented in-person meetings and travels,” said foodpanda’s head of people Ingo Laubender. “The app can be a friend that employees lean on, especially when they need immediate mental health support. It also destigmatises the notion of speaking to a licensed professional.” Foodpanda is not the only company providing employees with mental health-related support. Virtual platforms centred on mental health and wellness, such as Intellect, said they have seen a surge in demand for their services since the pandemic erupted and brought about new ways of life, such as remote working and physical distancing. “The pandemic has blurred work-life balance and reduced social interactions, leaving employees feeling isolated and disengaged at work,” said Intellect’s co-founder and chief executive Theodoric Chew. “However, we also see greater mental health awareness as companies are recognising that their employees’ workplace satisfaction and productivity are directly linked to their mental well-being.” Intellect, which launched its services in April last year, told CNA that its enterprise platform now serves 20,000 employees from more than 20 multinational companies and start-ups. Apart from corporate clients, the start-up also has a free consumer app offering self-guided digital therapy programmes for individuals. It said it now has more than 2.5 million users in total. “For an app … to grow past a million or two in one year is something that we see (as) a very clear indicator that Asia or the world needs something like this, and we are in the right place to address this,” said Mr Chew. MindFi is another Singapore-based start-up that has seen a boom in demand, as COVID-19 drew greater attention to mental health issues and also spurred the digitisation of healthcare. “The pandemic has really helped to drive this space forward and I could never have predicted that,” founder Bjorn Lee said. MindFi started out as a consumer app in 2017 but given the swell in corporate demand last year, it has since switched to focus on providing digital mental health and wellness solutions for businesses. It now has over 30 enterprise clients across Asia, serving more than 100,000 employees. “Before the pandemic, we had no corporate clients at all. In fact when we approached businesses in the past, (they) would go cold or ghost on us. But the reverse is now happening,” said Mr Lee, adding that businesses are noticing heightened stress and anxiety levels among their workforce. “And people are deciding to quit when they realise this doesn’t align with their meaning and purpose in life. I think that’s what alarms the C-suite … and has caused people to sit up and change things.” MindFi said its technology dishes out personalised recommendations based on a user’s psychometric profile. It also provides guided self-care programmes and matches users with coaches and therapists. Its most popular programmes include one-minute breathing exercises where users are guided to inhale and exhale according to the vibrations of their phones. There is also a “focus mode” that allows one to set a time required to finish up a task. “During that time, you’re not allowed to check your phone or navigate to other apps. And at the end of that timer, you are recommended a meditation track to help reset your mind before moving on to another task,” Mr Lee said. The start-up said its unique selling point is in offering “bite-sized” mental health support that is easy to integrate into daily routines. “For example, the one-minute breathing exercise is usually done by users at the start of a meeting,” added Mr Lee. “So our app is actually very effective in helping people to take breaks during the day.” Both start-ups said they rely on clinically validated measures for their products and have been investing in research and expertise to support their therapies. They also place strong emphasis on privacy. For instance, MindFi anonymises employee data and aggregates them to generate team-level analytics reports for companies. The National University Health System (NUHS) has tapped on MindFi to help its healthcare workers build mindful practices both at work and at home. Apart from free access to the MindFi platform, NUHS also partnered the start-up to launch a 100-day mental wellness awareness programme in October last year. This was to help healthcare workers deal with the many new challenges in patient care amid the pandemic, said NUHS Mind Science Centre’s director John Wong. “Every effort was made to explore increasing the capacity of emotional support for frontline healthcare workers, as well as those working from home to ensure that the healthcare cluster continues to function optimally,” he told CNA. NUHS also had a year-long pilot partnership with mental health chatbot WYSA to provide staff with more digital self-care and monitoring tools. Other initiatives are on the way, said Associate Professor Wong. “We are planning to introduce programmes such as mindline.sg. We will also be implementing the Emotional Literacy and First Aid e-training for employees at end of 2021 to help build mental health literacy.” At American customer service software firm Zendesk, employees get free access to meditation apps like Calm, and other forms of mental health support such as therapy sessions with San Francisco-based mental health and wellness platform Modern Health. This is on top of other company-wide initiatives like ""Recharge Fridays"" where employees get a day off. “When COVID-19 hit, we responded quickly to the urgent need to support (our employees) and implemented a number of initiatives,” said Zendesk’s chief operating officer for Asia-Pacific Wendy Johnstone. Through regular surveys, the company has garnered “overwhelming feedback” on the need for flexibility to balance life and work as the pandemic wears on. “As such, we have introduced a series of well-being programmes that give our employees worldwide the flexibility to choose what works for them,” said Ms Johnstone. Online clothing retailer Zalora announced last month that it will be giving all full-time employees mental health benefits, such as free access to a meditation app and an online mental health platform for confidential counselling sessions with psychologists. The company said it took “particular care” to review and compare multiple platforms to ensure that they met its requirements, such as privacy protections and the ability to offer customised solutions for its multicultural teams in various markets from Hong Kong to Indonesia.  Explaining the company’s decision, general counsel and chief people officer Louise Pender said the shift to a hybrid work model has seen employees juggling work with responsibilities at home, while the rise of video conferencing apps like Zoom has resulted in “screen fatigue”. “Importantly, these initiatives are aimed at safeguarding our employees’ mental health and enhancing their personal well-being, not only during the extended and ever-evolving pandemic situation, but also moving into the future,” she said. Such demand has thus far spurred a surge in venture funding into mental health start-ups, not just in Singapore but across the world. Funding in this nascent space globally reached a record US$852 million in the first quarter of this year, nearly twice the amount raised during the same period in 2020, according to research firm CB Insights. Both Intellect and MindFi closed out funding rounds in August. The former secured US$2.2 million in pre-series A funding, while the latter raised US$750,000 in pre-seed funding. The start-ups said these funds will come in handy in enabling them to expand into new markets and ramp up product offerings, as demand for virtual mental health solutions will be here to stay beyond the pandemic. “There are many great United States and Europe-based players but they are more focused on self-care and mindfulness. What we are building is a full mental health system,” said Intellect’s Mr Chew. “We are also localised to our markets, from languages to the professionals we work with … which is important because there are nuances in each market,” he added.  Mr Chew acknowledged that digital platforms may fall short for those who prefer face-to-face support, but technology has its benefits such as being able to expand the reach and accessibility of much-needed mental health support in conservative societies. His start-up also hopes to “shift the narrative from something more clinically perceived to something more proactive and part of daily life”. “What we are trying to do is create access and make (seeking of mental health support) less stigmatised,” said the young start-up founder. Intellect said ongoing clinical studies done with local and overseas universities and institutions are showing that the use of its programmes over four weeks can help reduce anxiety and stress levels by 20 and 10 per cent, respectively. Over at MindFi, Mr Lee said its app is due to unveil a major update that will make it “a lot more relevant to the current work-from-home lifestyles”. Describing it as “a smart assistant”, the app will suggest customised recommendations based on user habits and time of the day. “The pandora’s box, in terms of the importance of mental health, has been opened. Companies are increasingly looking at this; governments are also putting out advisories and the media is talking about it, which is great,” said Mr Lee, citing a recent article by CNA Insider which shed light on the danger of work burn-out among teachers in Singapore. “As the pandemic evolves and becomes endemic and so on, people are going to expect a different kind of health package from their companies and also from their insurers. This is unlikely to go back into the box now that we have kicked the door down.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/corticosteroids-mainstay-treatment-covid-19-severe-singapore-antibody-2225021,Corticosteroids 'mainstay' for treatment of severe COVID-19 in Singapore; new antibody therapy to be used soon,"SINGAPORE: Corticosteroids such as dexamethasone are the ""mainstay"" for the treatment of severe COVID-19 in Singapore, while an antibody therapy will also soon be used to treat patients with mild to moderate symptoms. Dr Shawn Vasoo, clinical director at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), told CNA on Wednesday (Oct 6) that steroids exert an anti-inflammatory effect, and it is this inflammation that is the ""main driver of disease"" in cases of severe COVID-19.  Corticosteroids are normally used to treat a range of allergic reactions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or asthma. A landmark trial found a ""significantly lower"" mortality rate in COVID-19 patients given dexamethasone if they were receiving oxygen or were on a ventilator. There was an overall relative risk reduction of death by about 11 per cent, at 28 days after the patient acquired COVID-19, said Dr Vasoo. As of noon on Tuesday, 1,512 COVID-19 cases in Singapore were warded in hospital, with 247 cases requiring oxygen supplementation. There were 34 COVID-19 cases in the intensive care unit. Two antibody therapies have been recently granted interim authorisation under the Pandemic Special Access Route by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) to treat those with mild to moderate COVID-19.  ""One of the antibodies we have started to use is a drug called sotrovimab, and casirivimab-imdevimab is another one which will come into clinical use soon in Singapore,"" said Dr Vasoo. Casirivimab-imdevimab, made by Roche-Regeneron, was given interim authorisation on Sep 21.  ""This will allow infectious diseases specialists to use the combination monoclonal antibodies therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 patients aged 18 years and older, who do not require oxygen supplementation and are at risk for progression to severe COVID‐19,"" said HSA. HSA said clinical data from a Phase 3 study showed that casirivimab-imdevimab demonstrated a 70 per cent reduction in the ""relative risk for progression to requiring acute treatment in hospital or death due to COVID-19"".  Sotrovimab was granted interim authorisation on Jun 30. HSA said trial clinical data showed the drug demonstrated a 79 per cent reduction in the relative risk of progression to requiring acute treatment in hospital or death from COVID-19. Last year, an antiviral drug remdesivir - created originally to tackle Ebola - was conditionally approved for treating COVID-19 patients in Singapore. Dr Vasoo told CNA that some high-risk patients, for example those with pneumonia or are a risk of progression to pneumonia and severe disease, may receive remdesivir. ""For patients with severe COVID-19 (ie who need oxygen support), remdesivir can still be considered, but as an antiviral, its utility is greater earlier in the disease course,"" the clinical director said. HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir - among the first drugs used to treat some COVID-19 patients in Singapore - are not administered by the NCID because “they have not shown efficacy in randomised controlled trials to date”, Dr Vasoo said.  ""The major definitive trials which have informed practice have been completed. It is unlikely that any further new, groundbreaking trials will be attempted,"" he added. Pharmaceutical company MSD announced on Wednesday morning that it has entered a supply and purchase agreement with Singapore to provide molnupiravir, an investigational antiviral drug to treat COVID-19, if it is authorised or approved. The drug, which is being developed in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, is being evaluated in two Phase 3 clinical trials, said MSD, which is known as Merck in the United States and Canada. The company said last Friday that molnupiravir has been shown during trials to reduce the risk of hospitalisation or death by about 50 per cent for patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.  It has also been shown to be active against the most common variants of the COVID-19 virus, including the highly infectious Delta variant.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/covid-19-coronavirus-smell-loss-change-symptom-long-food-pleasure-2219891,Commentary: COVID-19 can affect your smell and rob you of life’s simple pleasures,"NEWCASTLE, United Kingdom: It took a while to be officially recognised, but smell loss eventually became known to be one of the defining features of COVID-19. It’s now widely acknowledged that COVID-19 has a unique effect on smell receptors, and about 10 per cent of those who lose their smell are still reporting problems with smell and taste six months later. The effects of this can be profound. To document what it was like to live with long-term smell and taste problems, we worked with the smell-loss charity AbScent, which has an online support group for people with post-COVID smell problems. By speaking to people in this group, we were able to build a picture of the wider impacts of disrupted smell following COVID-19. At the time of conducting our research, over 9,000 people had joined the group, with new accounts every day of the devastating effect of sensory change. The response to our questions was overwhelming. People really wanted their experiences to be heard. ""It’s been hard for people even close to me to understand the severity of the loss and how it’s affected my life,"" one person in the study said. Anosmia is total loss of smell. Parosmia is where normal smells are distorted, usually unpleasantly. Taste is what is picked up by the receptors on the tongue. Flavour is the total sensory experience of food, to which smell is the major contributor, but the other senses are also involved. This means that even if your taste (tongue) is fine, loss of smell will seriously affect flavour. The first thing that struck us was how unpredictable and disorientating the sensory loss experience could be. For some, the effects were absolute. Another respondent said: ""It was like a light switch: from 100 per cent to 0 per cent in a couple of hours… No distorted smells, no whiffs, nothing. It’s like my nose switched off."" For others, things were more fluid. Anosmia could mutate into parosmia. Food that was fine one day could become disgusting the next.  This “chaos narrative” – as sociologists call it – meant that smell loss was very difficult to live with, let alone manage. A condition over which there was no control. The effect on appetite was also unpredictable. As might be expected, people had trouble eating – particularly when normal smells were distorted. Some were really struggling, reporting malnutrition and severe weight loss. Less obviously, some people reported weight gain. These were usually people with anosmia, who were “chasing flavour” after losing their sense of smell.  You can understand this if you realise the distinction between wanting and liking in what psychologists call the pleasure cycle. Wanting is where you are chasing the thing you are going to consume. Liking is when you have got it and you are savouring it.  In anosmia, that savouring part is no longer there, but this doesn’t stop the wanting. One person dealing with smell loss said: ""Food satisfaction is lacking and I see myself eating more to try to get that satisfied feeling … I am gaining weight due to a constant urge to satisfy what can never be satisfied."" But it wasn’t all about food. Until you lose it, you don’t realise how essential eating is to everyday joys, especially social pleasures. ""I am grieving for my lost senses. No more wine and cheese tasting nights or gin cocktails with my girls,"" said another affected individual. Even more heartbreaking was the effect of sensory changes on intimate relationships. There were a lot of posts where people described the loneliness of no longer being able to smell their partner or their children. Again, until it is gone, you don’t realise how important smell is to intimacy and connection. Even worse was the effect of parosmia. ""His natural odour used to make me want him; now it makes me vomit,"" one woman described. How do you tell your lover that? Some people’s relationships with themselves and the world had also changed. Some with no sense of smell reported feeling detached from themselves and the world. With parosmia, it could be more disturbing yet, with disgusting smells being triggered by everyday scents, making the world feel like a dangerous and confusing place. For some these sensory changes were, fortunately, temporary. However, months down the line, many are stuck with profound sensory changes, with all the distress that brings. While there is evidence that smell training helps sensory recovery in other conditions, we are still at the early stages of understanding and developing treatments for what amounts to a pandemic of altered sensing.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/mole-mapping-skin-cancer-melanoma-dermatologist-checkup-2196441,"Getting a 'mole checkup' may help prevent skin cancer (yes, it’s now a thing)","Do you usually think nothing about sun exposure, beyond whether you’ll develop dark spots on your skin because you’ve been lazy about applying sunscreen? Exposing the skin to UVA and UVB rays leads to premature ageing and wrinkles. The resulting tan you see is the skin’s way of protecting itself. Sometimes, those tans turn into hyperpigmentation or dark spots.  While these are fairly easy to treat with a course of laser treatments at the dermatologist or aesthetics physician’s clinic, you should be aware that constant UV exposure accumulates – and causes cell damage.  While the body can repair some of those cells, over time the damage builds up beyond repair.  One of the consequences of sun exposure is skin cancer. In Singapore, our exposure to the sun is higher than most because of our climate and our location near the equator.  AN ANNUAL MOLE CHECKUP One clinic hopes to make looking after your skin health a lot easier with a regular scan called mole mapping. The Dermatology & Surgery Clinic has a specialised machine which spots and maps your body’s moles and monitors them over time.  A 45-minute scan begins with a consultation with a dermatologist about your health history, regular habits and with the doctor examining your body for obvious spots. After the consultation, the scan with the machine begins and the machine photographs parts of your body. Thereafter, the dermatologist reviews your scan and marks out specific areas of concern. Closeup scans are taken for a better look. A mole mapping scan and consultation at Dermatology & Surgery Clinic costs from S$250 and the session lasts about an hour. The scan device uses non-invasive 3D digital imaging to capture pictures of the skin’s surface in macro quality resolution. This form of dermoscopy detects skin lesions, spots or unusual moles. It allows the dermatologist to differentiate the cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign) spots. The scans also serve as your annual skin medical report, to monitor the skin's overall health.  Dr Sue-Ann Ho, a dermatologist and surgeon at the clinic, said: “Skin cancer is on the rise in Singapore, with data showing an increase in incidence rates from 1968 to 2016.” While not as high as breast cancer in women and colon cancer in men, skin cancer still ranks within the top 10 cancers in Singapore. Dr Ho added: “The Singapore Cancer Registry in 2018 showed that skin cancer was ranked within the top 10 for cancer cases amongst men (sixth) and women (seventh).” This is a cause for concern. With our year-round exposure to the sun’s UV rays, it does put skin cancer in the spotlight.  Excess UV exposure leads to two common types of skin cancers – basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). These are non-melanoma cancers. These are the most common cancers but they are by no means the only ones. Merkel cell cancer is a rare and aggressive form of cancer that starts in the hormone-producing cells under the skin and hair follicles. It usually forms in the head and neck. Melanoma is the most serious form of skin cancer. It happens when healthy melanocytes (pigment-producing cells) change and grow out of control, forming a cancerous tumour. Sometimes, melanoma develops from a mole which may present via changes in shape, size, colour and evolve over time. As cancers like SCC and melanoma can metastasise and spread to other organs in the body, keeping an eye on irregular moles and spots is important. Dermatologist Dr Teo Wan Lin of TWL Specialist Skin & Laser Centre said: “Skin cancer can happen in anyone who has excess UV radiation. Both genders are equally at risk of developing skin cancers like melanoma but things like our environment and genetic factors play a big role as well.” BENEFITS OF ANNUAL MOLE MAPPING Like your annual health check, the Pap smear and mammogram, mole mapping allows you to collect accurate information to address any arising issues. Dr Ho added: “Coupled with a physical examination with the dermatologist, it can pick up abnormal spots and lesions which were previously ignored or thought to be normal."" Anyone can do it but in general, Dr Ho advised people who are at higher risk for melanoma to start mole mapping at least once a year. People with fair skin, who burn easily and have a family history of melanoma, should consider having a scan. Also, if you have over 50 moles on the body with some unusually shaped ones or moles that have enlarged, it’s time to consider having a thorough scan for the sake of your skin health.  SIGNS OF SKIN CANCER Some of the usual signs include new and unusual spots, especially if it is changing in shape, size, and colour. Doctors use a very simple acronym as a guide for monitoring for skin cancers – ABCDE. A for Asymmetry, whether one half of the spot or mole matches the other half. B for Border and refers to the edges of the mole, whether they are regular or jagged and blurred. C for Colour, considering whether they are even all over, or in different shades of brown, black or with splotches of other colours like pink or red. D for Diameter. This is to track for its size and notably, if it is 6mm or more across. E for Evolving which monitors whether the mole or spot has changed in recent weeks and months. You can detect changes to moles and spots using the above guide. Sometimes, it presents as one or includes two or more of the above factors. That would be a sure sign for you to visit the dermatologist. In Singapore, skin cancer awareness is on the rise, but the incidence is far lower than other forms of cancer.  Ethnicity and age are contributing factors. Said Dr Joyce Lim, dermatologist at Joyce Lim Skin & Laser Clinic: “I see one to two Caucasians who have incidences of skin cancer monthly but for Asians, I get the same number but every six months. And this is usually found in older patients.” WAYS TO PROTECT AGAINST UV RADIATION Even if you don’t present any of the symptoms, it is always important to ensure you use enough sun protection against the harsh UV rays we get day-in, day-out.  Here’s a quick guide: Whatever you choose as part of your sun protection, Dr Ho says: “It’s important to be sun-sensible and protect our skin from UV exposure where possible.” An annual mole mapping scan with a solid skincare regime with adequate UV protection may be the answer. UVA: Think A for ageing. These light rays cause wrinkles and loss of skin elasticity. Ninety-five per cent of the UV rays we’re exposed to are UVA. UVB: Think B for burns (and tans). UVB makes up the remaining 5 per cent of light rays that reach the Earth and are what allow the skin to produce Vitamin D. But its shorter wavelength means it can cause sunburn and skin darkening. Physical sunblock vs chemical sunscreen: A physical sunblock sits on the skin and deflects UV rays. Its key ingredients include mineral-based zinc oxide and titanium dioxide.   Chemical sunscreens, such as those that contain oxybenzone, absorb UV rays, then scatter them as heat energy. But because they contain chemical compounds, may cause irritation to the skin. Oxybenzone is also toxic to coral reefs. Whichever you choose, find one with broad-spectrum protection. This provides cover from both UVA and UVB rays. SPF and PA+: Sun Protection Factor or SPF protects the skin from UVB rays. SPF ratings provide the maximum length of time one receives protection. This means if you normally burn after 10 minutes in the sun, an SPF30 sunscreen would theoretically provide 30 times more protection than if you did not apply any sun protection – 300 minutes.  However, sun protection is also dependent on the amount of exposure and what time of the day it is.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/people/fitness-cru68-founders-ding-siblings-singapore-2214861,Meet the three siblings building Singapore’s own fitness empire,"The disco lights are flashing and thumping music is blasting from the speakers. All around, lithe young things clad in form-fitting lycra outfits are grooving in sync to the music. Wait a minute, this is not Zouk or Marquee – nightlife establishments have not been allowed to operate since 2020 due to COVID-19. Instead, this is a high-octane spin class at CruCycle, the homegrown cycling studio that played a key role in popularising the concept of rhythm indoor spinning in Singapore. In this strange, pandemic-riddled world we live in, a sweat-soaked workout session done to the beat of club music might just be the closest thing that music (and fitness) lovers have to experiencing the thrill and camaraderie of a concert or music festival. Even better, spin classes are not the only type of exercise that the CRU68 group offers. Founded by siblings Valerie, Calvin and Bebe Ding, the trio also launched CruBox’s rhythm-based boxing classes in 2019. But there’s still more. Their fourth Singapore studio, the 5,500 sq ft CRU Orchard, which opened on Sep 25, boasts a brand new line-up of yoga and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) class concepts. So, will these classes also be infused with the Cru difference, such as the unbeatable playlist and hugely motivational instructors who have no qualms sweating it out with everyone else as well? It is a unanimous yes, said the dynamic trio. “Over the many years that we’ve been running, we’ve become synonymous with rhythm-based workouts that are like a rhythmic musical experience. This makes it different from basically all the other studios in Singapore,” said youngest sister Bebe, 30, who is the group’s master trainer. More accurately, the Cru difference is the Ding difference, simply because their ever-growing fitness and lifestyle empire has always been very much shaped by their personalities and experiences. “A lot of our inspiration has to do with our experience living in Los Angeles,” said Valerie, 34, the eldest. Indeed, at the behind-the-scenes preview of their gleaming new studio at Claymore Connect, we spotted captions like “I got my peaches out in Georgia” printed on the mirrors that references American culture and also their style of cheeky irreverence. A post shared by CRU68 Official (@cru68official) They spent much of their childhood in California and had always loved the fitness-driven vibe of the city of angels. CruCycle, which they launched in 2014, was their first concept inspired by American-style spin classes. Their next studio, CruBox, was developed by Valerie and Bebe when they noticed how boxing was experiencing a resurgence in the United States. Then, there is the company’s howling wolf mascot, which is derived from the Dings’ pet huskies. Much to the delight of those attending classes, the good-natured dogs are often spotted hanging out at the studio and ever-ready to pose for selfies. By extension, the Cru community is called the Wolfpack too.
 
“We’ve always lived together, we take care of each other and our friends have always been around us, so that is what our brand is about too. It is all about our friends bringing friends and joining the pack,” explained Valerie, who is in charge of brand development and marketing. Their greatest achievement thus far, they say, has been launching CRU TV, their virtual fitness platform and their own CRU TV bike. Consider it a proudly homegrown version of Peloton, the American bike and fitness streaming company. This foray into streaming, they say, has been key to the company’s survival over the past year, when many gyms and studios have struggled due to various lockdown regulations. Just like every other aspect of the business, everything is developed in-house from training the instructors to adapt to this new medium to filming the classes. Even the bike, which features a large 21.5-inch touchscreen display that rotates 180 degrees so that the user can easily hop off the bike and start another mat-based workout, was built to their specifications. “CRU TV has been on the drawing board for a long time as we’ve always thought this is the next big thing, especially with the rise of tech. But we never really got down to it because we were so tied up with our physical studios,” said Calvin, 33, who is in charge of operations. “But the first circuit breaker gave us time to take a step back to think about all this.” Launched last August, the CRU TV classes are quite possibly among the best being produced in Singapore. Slickly filmed with excellent sound effects and editing, the videos feature well-versed instructors who are as comfortable talking to a camera as they are to a studio full of students. So it is hard to imagine that the first classes were actually a humble two-man show – when last year’s circuit breaker restrictions eased, Bebe would conduct the class in the empty CruBox studio and Calvin would film it. Valerie, who was under lockdown in Los Angeles at that time, would test the classes out and provide feedback. She also conducted research by comparing and “dissecting” the various exercise bikes available in the US to come up with a definitive list of what they wanted out of their own bike. This included an in-app function to track and store the rider’s stats including distance, cadence and power output, which are a boon to today’s stat-obsessed fitness enthusiasts as these go above and beyond what can be found on an Apple Watch or Fitbit. And for technical types, the bike, which comes with a top-of-the-line Stages power meter and runs on magnetic resistance modulation, purrs silently and runs ultra-smoothly when used. For the fitness junkie of 2021 who has had to weather a series of gym closures since the pandemic hit, it seems almost inevitable that the industry would arrive at this point of offering a blend of home workouts and studio classes. But the siblings say they had their fair share of detractors when they first embarked on this enterprise. “Some didn't see the point when it seemed we were going back to normal but how many lockdowns have we had to this day? Fortunately, we kept pushing and this has brought about the evolution of the brand,” said Valerie. Interestingly, the fitness platform and bike, which can be shipped globally, has in fact accelerated their expansion plans which they were working on pre-pandemic. “It can be a little slower to grow a brand with bricks-and-mortar studios,” said Bebe. “So with tech, it is exciting that we can reach an audience that is bigger than we imagined. We were pretty surprised when we looked at the CRU TV stats and realised we have viewers from Australia, South Africa and England.” In time, Bebe said, there may be Cru retreats in Bali. Perhaps even a Cru branded tequila, she quips – a nod to the sibling’s party days of their youth, the energy of which they clearly bring to their fitness studios. One thing is for sure, their ambitions are not limited to the fitness sphere. For instance, they currently run side hustles such as the Pups by Cru dog treats and helped their mother launch Dingamombakes, a boulangerie business. What’s next in their quest for world domination? Anything that organically strikes their interest, really, they say. But more than that, they are enjoying building all of this together. Calvin said, “Not only has the pandemic kept us on our toes so we could evolve, it has brought us closer. We used to be spread out around the world doing our own thing but now we are all back working on the same goal and seeing other people enjoy what we enjoy.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/had-broken-bone-previously-you-may-be-risk-another-2205926,Had a broken bone previously? You may be at risk of another,"Let’s say you’re a woman in your mid-50s, or perhaps a man in your early 70s, and you break a leg or a hip after falling from a 1.8m ladder. That would be distressing, to be sure, but neither you nor your doctor would likely be surprised by the severity of your injury given the nature of the accident. And, chances are, your doctor would not likely warn you after your fall that weakened bones may have contributed to your break, or that you might be at risk of breaking another bone next time from a minor mishap, like tripping over the dog. And so, after the break is immobilised in a cast or surgically repaired, your doctor would likely do nothing more to head off the possibility of a future fracture. Physicians are trained to think that only bones that break after minimal or no trauma are a sign of fragile bones. And that such breaks are the only ones that warrant an evaluation of the patient’s bone health, as well as treatment and counseling to prevent another broken bone. Furthermore, professional recommendations reinforce this thinking, and prompt doctors to discharge patients after a high-trauma fracture is repaired. Yet, there is now mounting evidence that for women past menopause and men in their retirement years, a broken bone from any kind of trauma – whether it’s severe (car accident) or not (fall at home) – fragile bones are likely the culprit. In a commentary published in JAMA Internal Medicine in June, Dr Anne Schafer and Dr Dolores Shoback of the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Health Care System suggested that fractures following either serious or minimal trauma represent “a distinction without a difference” for middle-aged and older people. No matter how the accident occurred, current evidence indicates, when an older person breaks a bone, further evaluation of that person’s overall bone health and advice on how to maintain it should follow as an integral part of treatment. In a column I published in November, I cited an important finding that only 9 per cent of patients who sustained a hip or spinal fracture were tested for bone loss and offered treatment to head off a future fracture. Within three years, 20 per cent of them were afflicted with another fracture. I probably don’t need to tell you that “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure”, yet doctors are often reluctant (and patients are often resistant) to go beyond patching up the initial injury. WHY OLDER WOMEN WHO’VE BROKEN A BONE NEED A BONE TEST The JAMA Internal Medicine commentary was a response to a major new study published in the same issue of the journal. The study catalogued the incidence of subsequent fractures among 7,142 postmenopausal women, many in their 50s and 60s, who had sustained a first fracture, and compared their risk of having a second fracture to 66,874 of their peers who had not had an initial fracture. The researchers followed the women for an average of about eight years. Among the women who sustained an initial fracture from minimal trauma, which is considered a hallmark of weakened bones, their risk of having another fracture was increased by 52 per cent. Among the women whose first fracture followed a traumatic accident, like falling off a ladder, the risk of a second fracture was 25 per cent greater than would have been expected based on women who had no initial fracture. The study’s authors concluded from their statistical analysis that both “non-traumatic and traumatic initial fractures” were “similarly associated with risk of subsequent fracture”. Contrary to current guidelines, the authors wrote, “our study’s results are clinically important because, in contrast to a non-traumatic fracture, a fracture that is considered traumatic often does not trigger further evaluation for osteoporosis or counseling regarding increased subsequent fracture risk”. However, they added, “high-trauma and low-trauma fractures show similar associations with low bone mineral density”. Even younger postmenopausal women, who have sustained a serious fracture, studies have found, are at higher risk of having osteoporosis, said Dr Sundeep Khosla, a bone expert at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester. “The evidence is pretty compelling that postmenopausal women who fracture, regardless of the level of trauma, should have their bone density evaluated,” he told me. “A fracture suffered in a fall from a standing height confers almost as high a risk of a second fracture as if the first fracture resulted from falling down the stairs.” OLDER MEN ARE ALSO AT HIGH RISK OF SECOND FRACTURES Men also face an often ignored risk of second fractures, especially because their first fractures are more likely to result from a traumatic event like a car accident and are not recognised as a harbinger of future fractures, Dr Schafer said in an interview. Dr Carolyn Crandall, an internal medicine physician at UCLA’s David Geffen School of Medicine, who led the JAMA Internal Medicine study, said that recent studies have documented that older men who suffered a high-trauma fracture were often as likely to have low-bone densities as men with a low-trauma fracture and were also at risk of a future fracture. “Older men may be at a particular disadvantage if we brush off their high-trauma fractures,” Dr Schafer said. “Men do lose bone with age and develop osteoporosis, though generally later in life than women. They’ve been overlooked. Men who have fractured bones in the past should not be brushed off.” HOW TO TEST FOR AND TREAT FRAGILE BONES What, then, is the message for older men and middle-aged and older women and for their physicians? For starters, the question doctors usually ask, “How did this break occur?” is not relevant. What counts, Dr Khosla said, is the health of the patient’s bones, and that is determined by a bone density test that measures the mineral content of bones in the spine, hips and sometimes, the forearm. The test is painless, non-invasive and brief, and its results are best interpreted by a specialist in osteoporosis. If the test shows abnormally weakened bones, doctors usually prescribe medication to slow, stop or reverse the process. Treatment should also include lifestyle counselling on diet and exercise, Dr Khosla said. “Being physically active helps to maintain strength, balance and agility, and decreases the chances of falling and breaking a bone.” Weight-bearing and strength-building exercises are important throughout life. Equally important: Eat a well-balanced diet rich in vegetables, fruits and whole grains, as well as calcium and Vitamin D. Avoid smoking and limit your alcohol and caffeine consumption. Finally, check your home and surroundings for trip hazards and eliminate them. Rugs, shoes and other articles left in mid-floor, lack of handrails, poor lighting, especially on stairs – all are bone-shattering falls waiting to happen.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/individuals-should-not-be-too-anxious-or-fearful-about-rising-daily-covid-19-numbers-lawrence-wong-2217196,Individuals should not be ‘too anxious or fearful’ about rising daily COVID-19 numbers: Lawrence Wong,"SINGAPORE: Singapore should not “get too carried away” or be “too anxious or fearful” about daily COVID-19 case numbers, said co-chair of the multi-ministry task force Lawrence Wong, as he asked the public for patience amid the pandemic.  Speaking at a multi-ministry task force press conference on Saturday (Oct 2), Mr Wong addressed the two different reactions emerging as the number of daily cases spike.  “Of course, when we see such surge of cases during these few days, several thousand a day, I know it can be quite worrying and you have two sort of very sharp reactions from different people,” he noted.  “One group says ‘Look, it's so high, let's quickly lock down and bring cases down'. Another group says, ‘Well, this is completely to be expected, after all we talked about living with COVID, so move forward'.”  Responding to the first group calling for restrictions to be tightened further, Mr Wong noted that Singapore has “gone beyond that point”.  “We’ve already said, because of our high vaccination rate, we are no longer focusing solely on headline numbers. Our focus is on the people who are seriously ill and to make sure that our healthcare system is able to take care of them,” he added.  “So let's not get too carried away by the headline numbers or too anxious or fearful about those numbers.”  For the second group of people calling for more reopening measures, Mr Wong urged them to be patient.  “Our overall strategy to reopening has not changed. But this is the first time we are experiencing such a big wave, and it is causing tremendous stresses on our healthcare system, and our healthcare workers,” he added.  Procedures and protocols have to be changed and adjusted, and capacity has to be added into the system, said Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister.  “All this takes a little bit of time and that's why we are putting in place these measures in the stabilisation phase so that we can get all these things ready,” he added.  Singapore should also be prepared that this will not be the last COVID-19 wave it experiences, said Mr Wong.  “We are riding one major, one big wave now, but we should be mentally prepared that there will be subsequent waves to follow,” he added.  “It's because we are one of the most COVID-naive populations in the world, unlike, for example, many other European countries.”  A COVID-19 naive person is someone who has not been exposed to antigens from the virus and has not formed the antibodies to fight it.  The number of infections in Singapore has been kept low “for a very long time”, unlike many European countries that experienced large waves in 2020, before they had the chance to vaccinate their population, Mr Wong noted.  “And many countries ended up paying a high price, suffering high fatalities because of the waves that they experienced last year.  “But now they have a much higher level of natural immunity, and together with the vaccination programmes that they have introduced, many of these countries have reached the new COVID-stable situation where they are able to resume activities and they have not seen any resurgence of cases.”  Singapore is in a “different position”, said Mr Wong.  “In many ways we are fortunate because we are facing this wave now with a much more highly vaccinated population,” he added, noting that this means the vast majority of people in Singapore will be protected against serious illness.  This also means Singapore can get through this wave and subsequent waves with fewer casualties than the European countries, said Mr Wong.  “Eventually, with high vaccinations and with a higher level of natural immunity, we too will eventually reach a point perhaps months later, where we are more similar to the European countries, and the COVID situation stabilises, and we are able to reopen more confidently without seeing a new wave of cases.”  Singapore will continue to monitor the situation over the next few days to see the impact of the new measures on slowing down the rate of transmission, said Mr Wong.  “To be clear, as we have stated before, we do not expect the new measures to help to bring down the total number of daily cases,” he added.  “Rather the new measures are aimed at slowing the rate of increase of transmission and that’s to give us the time to stabilise all the healthcare protocols we talked about and to strengthen and enhance capacity in our hospital system.”  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-daily-number-cases-rise-5000-gan-kim-yong-2217106,"Daily number of COVID-19 cases in Singapore may rise to more than 5,000 next week: Gan Kim Yong","SINGAPORE: The daily number of COVID-19 cases in Singapore may rise to more than 5,000 next week, with the number of community cases now doubling every 10 days, said co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force Gan Kim Yong on Saturday (Oct 2).  Speaking at a task force press conference, Mr Gan said: “The daily number of cases has continued to rise. Based on the current trajectory, cases in the community are now doubling about every 10 days.  “And depending on how the trajectory will develop, we may start to see the number of daily infections rise to more than 5,000 next week. The vast majority, however, will be asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms and can recover swiftly at home.”  Although the daily number of cases has continued to rise, the rate of increase “appears to have slowed down slightly”, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a press release.  “The time taken for the doubling of community cases has lengthened from about eight days to about 10 days,” MOH said. Singapore needs to streamline its healthcare protocols, said Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung.  “The testing and isolation protocols from QO (quarantine order), HRW (health risk warning), HRA (health risk alert), RRT (rostered routine testing) - quite a bit of alphabet soup - they were designed during a time when we were trying to snuff out every cluster that we discovered and detected,” he said. ""We are in a totally different position now, as we try to ride safely through this transmission wave to emerge more resilient on the other side, and able to live with COVID-19."" The protocols are ""many and complex to the man in the street"", Mr Ong said, and that to them it is ""confusing and even frustrating"". ""Few people truly understand or remember it. This issue needs to be addressed because if people don’t understand, they can’t do their part to exercise personal responsibility, much less help others,"" he added. ""It also contributes to an overall apprehension that COVID-19 is a very serious disease when actually for vaccinated people it has become a mild disease.”  The task force is reviewing the protocols ""holistically"" and will present them soon, said Mr Ong, adding that they want to make the protocols simple and easy to remember. The percentage of patients who require intensive care ""remains low"", at about 0.2 per cent, said the Health Ministry. But with the higher number of cases, this can translate to a ""larger absolute number"", said MOH. Currently, 34 ICU beds are occupied but the Health Ministry said it expects this number to rise. There remains “strong evidence” that vaccination protects people against severe disease, added MOH. The proportion of fully vaccinated cases who needed intensive care or died is about 14 times less than that for the unvaccinated, the ministry noted. “We are most concerned for the elderly, and in particular those who are unvaccinated. Older persons are at higher risk of severe illness, and most of them tend to have co-morbidities, which then increases the risk further,” said MOH.  The proportion of cases who are seniors aged 60 and above has “remained stable” at about 27 per cent to 32 per cent in the past 28 days, it added. “We urge all seniors, especially the minority of unvaccinated seniors, to take extra precautions and avoid crowded places during this period,"" said MOH. Singapore has not seen the ""full effect"" of the latest tightening measures, as it usually takes a week or more before the impact from any tightening can be observed, said the Health Ministry.  “Therefore, it is important that we continue to optimise our healthcare resources and preserve our hospital beds for those who truly need them. At the same time, all of us can help by reducing our social activities,” said Mr Gan, who is also Minister for Trade and Industry. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-treatment-facilities-more-beds-home-recovery-programme-2217161,"More COVID-19 treatment facilities to be set up, with about 3,700 beds by end-October","SINGAPORE: More COVID-19 treatment facilities (CTF) will be set up in the coming weeks to reduce the strain on acute hospitals, as Singapore sees a spike in local infections.  There will be nine COVID-19 treatment facilities with an overall capacity of about 3,700 beds by the end of October, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Saturday (Oct 2). It noted that four of these facilities were set up over the past week, with a capacity of 580 beds. They will be used to care for higher-risk patients who require close observation but do not need to be hospitalised. Such patients include seniors with co-morbidities who are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms.  COVID-19 treatment facilities were known as community treatment facilities. MOH said they have been renamed ""to better reflect the higher level of medical care provided to COVID-19 patients"". The facilities are meant to ""augment and complement"" hospital capacity, said the ministry in a media release. ""This is an important step towards right-siting care and reducing the strain on our acute hospitals which should be preserved for those who require immediate acute hospital care, both COVID-19 as well as non-COVID patients,"" it added. Speaking at a press conference by the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force on Saturday, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said that Singapore faces the ""biggest crunch"" at its hospitals. “The reason why we are facing the biggest crunch is because ... our hospitals are admitting many patients for close observation, even though their conditions do not require acute hospital care,” he said. “And that is why we need to set up CTFs, increase the capacity of CTFs, and CTFs have the medical capabilities and resources, including oxygen supplementation, to safely manage such patients who have a potentially higher risk of developing severe illnesses,"" he added.  ""If we can do that, we can decant and place patients away from hospital settings into the CTFs and therefore ameliorate the crunch at the hospital end.” Giving further details about the COVID-19 treatment facilities, Mr Ong said 700 beds will be set up at Singapore Expo and another 200 at Sengkang General Hospital. By the end of October, such beds will also be set up at Yishun and Ren Ci community hospitals.  The Health Ministry also stressed that it is safe for vaccinated people to recover from COVID-19 at home, adding that local and overseas data has consistently shown that vaccination is highly protective against severe illness. Home recovery is Singapore's default mode of care management for the majority of COVID-19 patients, provided certain criteria is met. These include vaccinated people with mild or no symptoms who are able to self-isolate in a room, preferably with an attached bathroom, according to MOH guidelines.  To be eligible for home recovery, their household members must not include elderly people who are more than 80 years old or those in vulnerable groups such as pregnant women. For those whose home conditions are not quite suitable, MOH said they will be assessed on a case-by-case basis and allow some to recover at a community care facility. Mr Ong said that the situation with the home recovery programme has “improved” due to the “great help” of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). “A lot of work, a lot of resources, commitment have been devoted to resolve all the teething issues that were encountered. So we can now on board, almost all new cases every day quite smoothly,” said Mr Ong. “There are the occasional delays for some, mostly because of lack of information, or the information like contact numbers were not accurate. Other than that, every day, they can quite smoothly on board everyone on the home recovery programme.” On Saturday, MOH also said healthcare and frontline workers will likely be offered COVID-19 booster jabs, adding that the expert committee on COVID-19 vaccination will release its recommendations on the matter when it is ready. ""MOH will await the formal recommendations of (the committee), but we stand fully ready to support this extension,"" said the ministry.  ""All eligible persons are encouraged to receive the booster vaccination when it is offered to them, and those who have yet to be vaccinated are strongly urged to do so."" Booster jabs have been offered to people aged 50 and above who completed both doses of the vaccine at least six months ago. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/can-low-carb-diet-help-your-heart-health-2214131,Can a low-carb diet help your heart health?,"Going on a low-carb diet has long been a popular weight loss strategy. But some doctors and nutrition experts have advised against doing so over fears that it could increase the risk of heart disease, since such diets typically involve eating lots of saturated fats, the kind found in red meat and butter. But a new study, one of the largest and most rigorous trials of the subject to date, suggests that eating a diet low in carbohydrates and higher in fats may be beneficial for your cardiovascular health if you are overweight. The new study, which was published in the American Journal Of Clinical Nutrition, found that overweight and obese people who increased their fat intake and lowered the amount of refined carbohydrates in their diet – while still eating fibre-rich foods like fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans and lentils – had greater improvements in their cardiovascular disease risk factors than those who followed a similar diet that was lower in fat and higher in carbs. Even people who replaced “healthy” whole grain carbs like brown rice and whole wheat bread with foods higher in fat showed striking improvements in a variety of metabolic disease risk factors. The study suggests that eating fewer processed carbs while eating more fat can be good for your heart health, said Dr Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University, who was not involved with the research. “I think this is an important study,” he said. “Most Americans still believe that low-fat foods are healthier for them, and this trial shows that at least for these outcomes, the high-fat, low-carb group did better.” Still, Dr Mozaffarian stressed, the types and balance of fats you eat also appear to be important. People on the low-carb diet consumed foods like butter, red meat and whole milk, which are rich in saturated fats. But most of the fat in their diets – about two thirds – was unsaturated, which is the kind of fat that is predominantly found in olive oil, avocados, nuts, seeds and fish. “It’s a well controlled trial that shows that eating lower carb and more saturated fat is actually good for you, as long as you have plenty of unsaturated fats and you’re mostly eating a Mediterranean-type diet,” Dr Mozaffarian added. Many doctors recommend a traditional Mediterranean style diet, rich in fruits and vegetables, fish and heart-healthy fats like nuts and olive oil, for cardiovascular health. Other rigorous studies have found that following a Mediterranean diet can help to ward off heart attacks and strokes. The new study included 164 overweight and obese adults, mostly women, and took part in two phases. First, the participants were put on strict, low-calorie diets that lowered their body weights by about 12 per cent. Then, they were each assigned to follow one of three diets in which 20 per cent, 40 per cent or 60 per cent of their calories came from carbohydrates. Protein was kept steady at 20 per cent of calories in each diet, with the remaining calories coming from fat. The participants were fed just enough calories to keep their weights stable. The participants followed the eating plans for five months, with all of their meals provided to ensure that they stuck to their diets. The average American gets about 50 per cent of his or her daily calories from carbs, most of them in the form of highly processed starchy foods like pastries, bread and doughnuts and sugary foods and beverages. In the new study, the low-carb group ate significantly fewer carbs than the average American. But they were not on a super-low-carb ketogenic diet, which severely restricts carbs to less than 10 per cent of daily calories and forces the body to burn fat rather than carbohydrates. Nor did they eat unlimited amounts of foods high in saturated fats like bacon, butter and steak. Instead, the researchers designed what they considered practical and relatively healthy diets for each group. All of the participants ate meals like vegetable omelettes, chicken burritos with black beans, seasoned London broil, vegetarian chili, cauliflower soup, toasted lentil salads and grilled salmon. But the high-carb group also ate foods like whole wheat bread, brown rice, multigrain English muffins, strawberry jam, pasta, skim milk and vanilla yoghurt. The low-carb group skipped the bread, rice and fruit spreads and sugary yoghurts. Instead, their meals contained more high-fat ingredients such as whole milk, cream, butter, guacamole, olive oil, almonds, peanuts, pecans and macadamia nuts, and soft cheeses. After five months, people on the low-carb diet did not experience any detrimental changes in their cholesterol levels, despite getting 21 per cent of their daily calories from saturated fat. That amount is more than double what the federal government’s dietary guidelines recommend. Their LDL cholesterol, the so-called bad kind, for example, stayed about the same as those who followed the high-carb diet, who got just 7 per cent of their daily calories from saturated fat. Tests also showed that the low-carb group had a roughly 15 per cent reduction in their levels of lipoprotein(a), a fatty particle in the blood that is strongly linked to the development of heart disease and strokes. The low-carb group also saw improvements in metabolic measures linked to the development of Type 2 diabetes. The researchers assessed their lipoprotein insulin resistance scores, or LPIR, a measure of insulin resistance that looks at the size and concentration of cholesterol-carrying molecules in the blood. Large studies have found that people with high LPIR scores are more likely to develop diabetes. In the new study, people on the low-carb diet saw their LPIR scores drop by 15 per cent – reducing their diabetes risk – while those on the high-carb diet saw their scores rise by 10 per cent. People on the moderate carb diet had no change in their LPIR scores. The low-carb group had other improvements as well. They had a drop in their triglycerides, a type of fat in the blood that is linked to heart attacks and strokes. And they had increases in their levels of adiponectin, a hormone that helps to lower inflammation and make cells more sensitive to insulin, which is a good thing. High levels of body-wide inflammation are linked to a range of age-related illnesses, including heart disease and diabetes. The low-carb diet that was used in the study largely eliminated highly processed and sugary foods while still leaving room for “high quality” carbs from whole fruits and vegetables, beans, legumes and other plants, said Dr David Ludwig, an author of the study and an endocrinologist at Harvard Medical School. “It’s mainly focused on eliminating the processed carbs, which many people are now recognising are among the least healthful aspects of our food supply,” said Dr Ludwig, who is co-director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Children’s Hospital. Dr Ludwig stressed that the findings do not apply to the very-low carb levels typical of ketogenic diets, which have been shown to cause sharp elevations in LDL cholesterol in some people. But he said the study does show that people can gain metabolic and cardiovascular benefits by replacing the processed carbs in their diets with fat, including saturated fat, without worsening their cholesterol levels. The new study cost US$12 million and was largely funded by the Nutrition Science Initiative, a non-profit research group. It was also supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, the New Balance Foundation and others. Linda Van Horn, a nutrition expert who served on the federal government’s dietary guidelines advisory committee and who was not involved with the new study, noted that the low-carb group consumed large amounts of unsaturated fat and fibre-rich vegetables – both of which are known to have beneficial effects on cholesterol and cardiovascular risk markers. The low-carb group, for example, consumed an average of 22g of fibre per day, which is more than the average American consumes, she said. “While the study is valuable and carefully designed, as always in nutrition research, there are many dietary factors that influence cardiometabolic risk factors that can help to explain the results,” said Dr Van Horn, who is also chief of nutrition in the department of preventive medicine at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Dr Mozaffarian said his take home message for people is to adopt what he calls a high-fat Mediterranean style diet. It entails eating fewer highly-processed carbs and sugary foods and focusing on fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, fish, cheese, olive oil and fermented dairy products like yogurt and kefir. “That’s the diet that America should be focusing on. It’s where all the science is converging,” he said. By Anahad O’Connor © The New York Times This article originally appeared on The New York Times."

""An optometrist may be able to detect early signs of eye infections and common eye diseases such as cataracts, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration,"" said Associate Professor Marcus Ang, a senior consultant with Singapore National Eye Centre's (SNEC) Corneal and External Eye Disease Department.  This is important as ""many eye conditions such as glaucoma or myopia-related degeneration may be insidious with subtle or few symptoms before permanent visual impairment"", said Assoc Prof Ang, who is also the clinical director of SNEC's Myopia Centre. ""The optometrist can then refer such patients to other healthcare practitioners such as the ophthalmologist for further management if any eye abnormalities or diseases are detected."" These checks are especially crucial if you have risk factors such as high myopia or a family history of myopia-related complications, he added. MORE THAN JUST SPECTACLES AND CONTACT LENSES Another reason to pop into an optical shop yearly (that is if you’re healthy and have no pre-existing health problems or medical history): The eye examination costs from just S$20 (up to S$80 in shops offering more specialised checks), less than what a protein bowl and soy latte in the CBD might set you back.  In most cases, the fee can be reduced – or waived – with purchases of glasses or contact lenses.  So why aren’t people making use of these services at optical shops? First, there is the misconception that optical shops only sell spectacles, sunglasses and contact lenses, which then leads customers into expecting nothing beyond eyewear from such shops. For instance, OWNDAYS’s senior manager in business development and marketing, Rain Wong, shared that what the majority of its customers wants are eyewear products, not eye checks. “We believe the common sentiment among consumers is that primary eyecare is provided at medical centres and eye clinics.” The eye examinations that the chain provides at its selected outlets are “additional value-added services”, “instead of being the core service”, she said.  Indeed, many people associate eye examinations with ophthalmologists – and an expensive medical bill, said optician Shawn Au from EMME Visioncare. “But because of the high cost, many people wouldn’t want to make their way to an eye doctor. “So, we’re the first gate for them to come through and detect signs of eye conditions, if any. Sadly, eyecare is not prioritised; it is not even as prioritised as dental care or any other medical care,” he added. Secondly, there is confusion as to what an optician, optometrist or ophthalmologist does. (You can find out if your optician or optometrist is registered here.) “Most of the public sees us as just spectacle makers,” said optometrist Dr Alex Ong from Ong’s Optics. “The main issue boils down to poor public education and awareness of what optometrists are capable of, which includes providing eye examinations. “Many, whom I have encountered, say that they don’t need eye examinations from optometrists as we are not medical doctors. But this thinking can reduce the chances of picking up any eye disorders and delay the treatment that can be provided,” said Dr Ong. WORKING WITH DOCTORS Indeed, your neighbourhood optical shop can help to screen out a range of eye-related problems, from serious glaucoma and cataract symptoms to lifestyle-induced problems such as eye infections from contact lens misuse, eye strain and dry eyes brought on by long WFH hours.  “Just this weekend, we had a customer whose doctor couldn’t clear his health screening without him getting new glasses,” recalled Jack Lok, an optometrist from Chew’s Optics.  “He couldn’t even read the big numbers when we tested him and when we took a photo of the back of his eye to check, we realised that he had something quite serious, a vein occlusion (an eye stroke). We advised him to see a doctor immediately,” said Lok. He added: “Usually, we’ll advise our customers to go to the polyclinic for a hospital referral. If they want, they can also go straight to a private hospital or specialist clinic. It depends on their financial situation."" There are other scenarios where you may be referred to an ophthalmologist, too. According to Dr Ong, optometrists aren’t allowed to use medication, even eye drops to dilate the pupil for a better look at the back of the eye. ""If there is a condition that I suspect requires examination but I am unable to get a good result, I will refer the customer to a doctor.""  Essentially, said Au, any assessment that requires medication would require an ophthalmologist's attention, even antibiotic eye drops for contact lens complications. SO WHAT CAN OPTICAL SHOPS DO? Many people regard the eye check (known professionally as the refraction test) as only for assessing the “power” or “degree” of their lens prescription. And they’d be right as it is indeed “just for checking the refractive error and not a full eye examination”, said Dr Ong.  This is why most optical shops would offer it along with the slit lamp examination – making these two tests the most common and basic that most optical shops would have, said Au. Contact lens wearers may further undergo a lens fitting assessment “to determine if contact lens wear is suitable for them”, said Wong.  Some optical shops go beyond those checks by offering more specialised services such as assessing children's suitability for orthokeratology (contact lenses for cornea reshaping) to treat myopia; fundus photographs for customers to take to their doctors for further medical assessment; and checking the tear film for symptoms of dry eyes.   Assessing your myopia (near-sighted), hyperopia (far-sighted) or presbyopia (inability to focus due to ageing) is one of the key checks that every optical shop can and will perform before prescribing you your new lenses.  This is usually done with the refraction test, where you are asked to read letters of varying sizes on a wall chart in one of these two ways: 1) wearing special glasses that allow the optometrist to change the lenses; or 2) using the phoropter, an eye mask-like instrument with flip-able lenses.  This is the machine where you put your head on a chin rest while the optometrist directs a light toward your eye to check your cornea, said Au. The slit lamp microscope does more than detect cornea issues such as those created by prolonged contact lens use.  It also lets the optometrist check the health of your eye’s lens (for cataracts), the back of the eye or retina (for AMD) as well as the optic nerve (for glaucoma).  Similar to the slit lamp exam, you prop your head on a chin rest in front of a specialised digital camera. The equipment then flashes and snaps a series of images.  The result of which are photographs of your retina taken through each pupil using microscopic flash photography. They typically look like red lines (blood vessels) zigzagging across an orange background (the interior of your eyeball).  “These photographs let us see if there are any changes to the optic nerve and can screen for normal tension glaucoma,” said Lok.  ""The photos are also helpful if the customer chooses to go to an eye doctor as they are records of changes captured."" The tonometer measures the intraocular pressure (IOP) or pressure within your eye. This is crucial as a pressure that is too high can damage the optic nerve, leading to glaucoma.  “We will refer the customer to the eye doctor for better glaucoma screening for any pressure above 21 mmHG,” said Lok.  There are a few methods to test the eye pressure: Gently pressing a probe against the surface of the eye; using air pressure to slightly flatten the cornea; or blowing a brief puff of air at the cornea.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/pregnancy-weight-loss-postpartum-tips-experts-2198616,Why it’s so hard to lose weight after pregnancy – and tips on how to succeed,"Do you worry about getting “back in shape” after giving birth? You’re not alone. Returning to pre-pregnancy weight is a common and persistent cause of anxiety, but all is not lost.  The keys to successful postpartum weight loss, according to experts, are to understand the basics, begin with the end in mind, commit to a slow and steady exercise plan, and maintain mental resilience. We break these down and share tips on how you can set yourself up for success throughout the process.  THE BASICS Pregnancy weight gain is a natural and necessary phenomenon, said one expert, contributed to by the growing baby, the placenta and amniotic fluid.  Weight gain is also due to the changes a woman’s body makes to support the pregnancy, such as increased blood supply, uterus growth, increased breast tissue and fat stores, said Dr Ho Xin Yi, an associate consultant at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital’s (KKH) obstetrics and gynaecology department.  During pregnancy, women may increase their daily caloric intake to support the baby’s growth, which causes weight gain as well, she added.  If you’re thinking about resisting weight gain, don’t – it’s a crucial aspect of delivering a healthy baby.  “Gaining the appropriate amount of weight in pregnancy ensures that your baby is of good birth-weight and also means that you do not have too much extra weight to shed after delivery,” said Dr Ho. And how much weight gain is appropriate?  That depends on various factors including how much you weighed before the pregnancy, your health status and whether you’re carrying a single baby, twins or triplets. The recommended weight gain for women of normal body mass index (BMI), who are carrying one baby, is 11kg to 16kg throughout the pregnancy, with the bulk of it taking place in the second and third trimesters, said Dr Ho.  “If you have a higher BMI, you are recommended to gain less pregnancy weight,” she added.  And once the baby has been delivered safely, it is “critical” that the woman try to return to her pre-pregnancy weight, unless she is underweight, Dr Ho said.  According to Caroline Chua, a senior principal physiotherapist at KKH, the target weight loss after delivery should be 1kg to 2kg a month. “Many studies show that if the excess weight is not lost from six to 12 months after delivery, it may stay with the woman for a long time. The weight gained from each and every subsequent pregnancy may accumulate, causing obesity, which poses various health risks such as heart disease and diabetes.  “Going into a future pregnancy at a higher weight is more likely to put the mother and baby at risk of medical complications such as diabetes or high blood pressure in pregnancy,” she said.  Today, one in four women retain more than 5kg of their pregnancy weight a year after delivery, she added. Why is pregnancy weight loss such a challenge for so many women? These are the most common struggles, experts said, while sharing the best way to overcome them.  STRUGGLE #1: EARLY, EXCESSIVE WEIGHT GAIN One of the main reasons losing weight is a challenge for many women is excessive weight gain during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester. This makes it essential for a woman to enter her pregnancy with the ideal outcome in mind, that is, healthy weight loss postpartum.  “It is important to understand that very little to no additional calories are required during the first trimester,” said Dr Ho, adding that many women struggle with this, especially those who cope with nausea by snacking, or overeat when they are fatigued.   It is crucial at this stage for expectant mothers to focus on eating nutrient-dense foods, and avoid empty calories and desserts, she said.  STRUGGLE #2: INCONSISTENT EXERCISE   The second reason, according to Dr Ho, is a lack of self-care for the mum in the form of exercise.  “Having a baby is nothing short of miraculous and joyous but it is also stressful. With such a big change in one’s life, certain other priorities may be ranked less essential, especially for a new mother,” said Dr Ho.  Still, women should keep in mind that they need to prioritise their own health and to stay fit so they will be able to cope with new challenges physically, mentally and emotionally, she said.  However, women should not attempt to jump straight into a strict exercise regimen after giving birth.  Resuming pre-pregnancy exercise should be “gradual and varied according to the individual”, said Chua. “Losing weight and returning to pre-pregnancy fitness and shape too much or too fast may delay your recovery,” she said, adding that excessive weight loss may also lead to a decrease in milk production.  Chua said women can exercise at least three times a week for the first six weeks, but each session should be limited to five to 10 minutes. Only after six weeks can they begin to slowly work their way to 30 minutes per session.  Those who have had a caesarean delivery or have co-morbidity issues – which can include medical conditions like asthma and diabetes – should check with their doctor before starting their exercise routine, Chua said.  Mothers who breastfeed should also do so before exercise to avoid the build-up of lactic acid in the breast milk and to prevent discomfort during exercise due to breast engorgement.  These are the types of exercise you can do during the first six weeks, according to the physiotherapist: Recommended types of exercise after six weeks: Recommended types of exercise after four months: You could say that such exercises seem basic, even for those who did not have a workout routine before their pregnancy. But women still struggle.  Aqilah Norazman, a fitness and nutrition coach with nearly a decade's worth of experience working with women postpartum, said the most common struggle among her clients is their inability to stick to an exercise routine or adhere to nutrition habits.  They “constantly look back and compare (themselves) to how they used to be pre-pregnancy,” said Aqilah, who runs fitness studio 1-Habit Coaching.  Such “constant comparison can lead to a lot of mental blocks that stop them from adhering to the tasks they need to carry out to achieve their goals”, she said.  For those who struggle with committing to a disciplined diet and exercise routine, coaches like Aqilah can be helpful.  Clients will be put through an in-depth assessment and consultation, during which they can “share stories from their pregnancy” and have an “open chat” about their nutrition habits and struggles.  “It is important for me as a coach to remember that every pregnancy is different and all of these women would’ve gone through a very different experience pre-, during and post-pregnancy, so the (session) is so important to establish what they’ve been through and where they want to go postpartum,” said Aqilah.  Depending on their goals, clients may then begin strength training to help rebuild their neuromuscular system, build strength and lean muscle, and increase metabolism, said the trainer.  This guided training may be paired with cardio sessions, customised by the coach, that they can do at their own time.  “I also recommend recovery work like yoga, stretch mobility and Pilates to help them regain confidence moving in their own skin and help them be in tune with their natural movements,” said Aqilah.  STRUGGLE #3: POOR DIETARY HABITS According to Aqilah, these are the nutrition guidelines that most postpartum women can observe to promote weight loss:  STRUGGLE #4: UNABLE TO BREASTFEED “If there is no medical contraindication, breastfeed!” said Dr Ho. It helps mothers lose weight quicker because the body burns approximately 500 more calories daily to produce breast milk, helping your body achieve the calorie deficit needed for weight loss.  Breastfeeding also produces the hormone oxytocin, which helps the womb contract, reducing the risk of postpartum haemorrhage.It is also well known, according to Dr Ho, that breast cancer and ovarian cancer are less common in women who have breastfed, and that the protective effect increases the longer you breastfeed.   Despite its benefits, many women do not breastfeed or do so for a short period only because of difficulties such as being unable to get the baby to latch properly and trouble maintaining supply. In such situations, they are advised to speak to their doctor or get help from a lactation consultant, said Dr Ho.  Ultimately, Dr Ho said, a woman should be able to return to her pre-pregnancy weight if she is diligent about weight loss by maintaining an exercise regime and sticking to a healthy balanced diet, and if she has good support from family and friends.  However, there remain many barriers that may influence a woman to act otherwise.  “Should the weight gain persist, she should consult a weight management specialist that can help provide medical insight and come up with an intervention plan. “In some instances, there could be an underlying medical condition that is resulting in the weight gain, for example, thyroid conditions,” said Dr Ho.  CNA Women is a section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/china-reduce-abortions-non-medical-health-pregnancy-2204121,China says it will clamp down on abortions for 'non-medical purposes',"BEIJING: China will reduce the number of abortions performed for ""non-medical purposes"", the country's Cabinet said in new guidelines issued on Monday (Sep 27) that it said were aimed at improving women's reproductive health. China has already enacted strict measures aimed at preventing sex-selective abortions, and health authorities also warned in 2018 that the use of abortion to end unwanted pregnancies was harmful to women's bodies and risks causing infertility. The State Council said the new guidelines would also aim to improve women's overall access to pre-pregnancy healthcare services. National Health Commission data showed that between 2014 and 2018, there had been an average of 9.7 million abortions per year, rising about 51 per cent from the 2009 to 2013 average despite a relaxation of family planning policies in 2015. The data did not specify how many abortions were for medical reasons. It was not immediately clear whether Monday's new measures were designed at addressing China's declining birth rate, which think-tanks and policy researchers have identified as one of its major social policy challenges in the coming decades. Although China remains the world's most populous nation, the latest census showed population growth from 2011 to 2020 was the slowest since the 1950s, and was expected to slow even more within a few years. After years of trying to limit population growth, Beijing is now promising new policies aimed at encouraging families to have more children. It said in June that it would now allow all couples to have three children instead of two. New policies designed to reduce the financial burden of raising children are also being introduced."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/wondaleaf-unisex-condom-adhesive-twin-catalyst-malaysia-2189466,Malaysian startup reveals 'world's first' adhesive unisex condom,"A Malaysian startup has launched the Wondaleaf, said to be the world's first adhesive condom that can be worn by both men and women.  The Wondaleaf unisex condom's default configuration is an internal condom but the pouch can be inverted to become an external condom to be worn by the man, said the manufacturer, Twin Catalyst, on its website.  According to an instructional video on the Twin Catalyst YouTube page, once the condom is taken out of the packet and unfolded, users will need to look for indicators identifying the front and back portions of the condom. The exposed barrier film section, which holds the retention unit, is then inserted all the way into the vagina before the external layers of the condom are peeled off so the rest of the barrier film can be stuck on the front and back of the woman's abdomen, ensuring ""no direct skin-to-skin contact"" during intercourse. After intercourse, Wondaleaf can be removed by slowly peeling the film off the skin from back to front, according to the tutorial.  The company said its invention is an improvement from other condoms available on the market because it is adhesive, which means it can be put on early and will not disrupt intimacy, and will not slip off during the process, making it a safer contraceptive.  The condom is also made of polyurethane, which means ""we can make it really thin"" at approximately 0.03mm, said Twin Catalyst. For reference, the thinnest condom sold by one brand commonly stocked at Singapore retailers measures about 0.045mm in thickness.  Twin Catalyst was founded in 2013 to develop and manufacture novel medical devices, according to its website. Its founder, gynaecologist Dr John Tang, said he believes that a lack of access to female condoms could be a factor contributing to the issues of sexually transmitted disease and unwanted pregnancies.  ""Men may feel like a condom is restricting, resorting to 'stealthing', which is a form of sexual violence wherein a sexual partner removes a condom during penetration without the receiving partner's knowledge,"" said the company in a press release.  The Wondaleaf unisex condom was announced earlier this month, ahead of World Contraception Day on Sep 26. It is available for sale online for RM14.99 (S$4.85). Each order contains two condoms, two packets of water-based lubricant and two pieces of ""retention gauze"".  CNA Women is a section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/dry-eyes-afflict-many-us-heres-what-do-about-it-2198756,Dry eyes afflict many of us. Here's what to do about it.,"I didn’t have to wait until my ninth decade to appreciate how annoying dry eyes can be. And I was flummoxed by the plethora of products on pharmacy shelves that promise relief for a problem that affects about one in five adults. Perhaps you, like me, are among the many who have tried various over-the-counter remedies that didn’t help or sometimes made matters worse. Dry eye problems increase with age. But since my mid-30s, I’ve been coping with a mild form of this condition and, despite intermittent visits to health professionals, have gotten only limited relief. With all the “extra” time I had to read for pleasure during the pandemic, the gritty feeling in my chronically dry eyes rendered this diversion anything but pleasant. Other common complaints linked to dry eyes include itching and undue sensitivity to sun and bright lights, all of which I suffer from. In an online survey published in January, two-thirds of respondents reported having symptoms of dry eye, and of those, more than a quarter said their symptoms were made worse by wearing a face mask. But Dr Ira Udell, a professor of ophthalmology at the Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, said that while masks may indeed cause ocular discomfort, an association between mask-wearing and dry eye per se is unlikely, given that exhaled moisture when wearing a mask fogs glasses and, if anything, the increased humidity would raise moisture levels around the eyes. A more likely explanation of those findings is an association between dry eyes and pandemic-related stress. In two studies of veterans, researchers found strong links between dry eye syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. WHAT CAUSES DRY EYES? I’ve recently learned just how complicated it can be to keep my eyes moist and free of irritating dryness, a need made more challenging by an ever-greater reliance on screens for work and play. When people stare at computer screens for hours on end, they blink less often, resulting in tired, distressed and dry eyes. Inadequate lubrication of the ocular surface can also result in blurry vision, a symptom that has repeatedly prompted me to get my vision checked, only to find that my current prescription hasn’t changed even though words on a page are less clear.
  Although dry eye problems are most common in people over 50, they’re also increasing among young adults, which experts attribute to smartphones and computers. Younger people are also more likely to wear contact lenses, prolonged wearing of which may also cause dry eye. Dry eye is a hallmark symptom of Sjogren’s syndrome and other autoimmune disorders that impair the body’s lubricating tissues. Dry eye also commonly occurs temporarily following cataract surgery; Lasik eye surgery, which reshapes the cornea to improve vision; and blepharoplasty, an operation to correct drooping eyelids. Some people develop chronically dry eyes because their lids don’t close completely during sleep. If you suspect this may be your problem and you live alone, you might have someone check your eyes when you’re asleep, Dr. Udell said. A photo would be useful to show to your doctor. HOW DOES THE EYE STAY LUBRICATED? Think of the tear film that coats and lubricates the eye as a three-layer sandwich. The meibomian glands in the upper and lower eyelids create an oily outer layer that stabilises the film. If the film breaks up too quickly, blurry vision is the likely result. Next are two sets of lacrimal glands that supply the watery tears. Innermost is the mucin layer that attracts water and helps to spread the tear film over the surface of the cornea. Even if the tear supply is adequate, a mucin deficiency can impede wetting of the cornea and damage its surface. Both the meibomian and lacrimal glands have receptors for the sex hormones, androgen and estrogen, and a decrease in hormone levels likely explains why dry eye problems increase in women at menopause and in men who are treated with anti-androgen therapy for prostate cancer. Indeed, the most common cause of dry eye is evaporation of moisture from the eyes from dysfunction of the meibomian glands that results in instability of the tear film. Sometimes the attempted solution, like using multiple-use eye drops that contain preservatives, can actually make eye irritation worse. While single-dose eye drops are only approved for a one-time use, Dr Udell said that it’s usually safe to use them for up to two days if you want to cut down on cost and waste, as long as the tip isn’t touched and is covered after each use. Medications that treat other conditions can interfere with adequate tear production. Common culprits include antihistamines, beta blockers, oral contraceptives, diuretics and drugs used to treat Parkinson’s disease, anxiety disorders, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and abnormal heart rhythms. WHAT CAN YOU DO TO RELIEVE DRY EYES? Environmental conditions that can exacerbate dry eye problems include smoky or excessively dry air. Long before the pandemic, I began wearing eyeglasses when outdoors, especially on windy days and always when riding my bicycle, to protect my eyes from dryness and grit. If you swim, be sure to wear goggles to prevent salty or chemically treated water from irritating your eyes. Another practical measure that Dr Udell emphasised is applying warm compresses to the eyelids morning and night to assist meibomian gland function. I gently wash my eyelids from the nose outward with a warm washcloth every night. Repeat the washcloth cleanse if you wake up in the morning with “sleep in your eyes,” then apply artificial tears. Use of artificial tears several times a day is essential for most cases of dry eye. Although no product precisely mimics the composition of natural tears, many are helpful if used regularly, Dr Udell said. He suggested trying various products one at a time to find one that is most effective for you. You could start with a low-cost generic product and, if that doesn’t help, try the brand name version, he said. However, if over-the-counter remedies and the practical measures described above fail to bring adequate relief, consult an eye specialist. There are prescription products and special glasses that create a high-humidity moisture chamber around the eyes, among other remedies, for severe cases of dry eye.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/how-much-water-do-you-actually-need-drink-day-2198771,How much water do you actually need to drink a day?,"If you’ve spent any time on social media or visited an athletic event lately, you’ve surely been bombarded with encouragements to drink more water. Celebrity influencers lug around gallon-sized water bottles as the hot new accessory. Twitter bots constantly remind us to make more time to hydrate. Some reusable water bottles even come emblazoned with motivational phrases – “Remember your goal,” “Keep drinking,” “Almost finished” – to encourage more drinking throughout the day. The purported benefits of excess water consumption are seemingly endless, from improved memory and mental health to increased energy to better complexion. “Stay hydrated” has become a new version of the old salutation, “Stay well.” But what, exactly, does “stay hydrated” mean? “When lay people discuss dehydration, they mean loss of any fluids,” said Dr Joel Topf, a nephrologist and assistant clinical professor of medicine at Oakland University in Michigan. But that interpretation “has been completely blown out of proportion,” said Kelly Anne Hyndman, a kidney function researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Staying hydrated is definitely important, she said, but the idea that the simple act of drinking more water will make people healthier isn’t true. Nor is it correct that most people are walking around chronically dehydrated or that we should be drinking water all day long. From a medical standpoint, Dr Topf added, the most important measure of hydration is the balance between electrolytes like sodium and water in the body. And you don’t need to chug glass after glass of water throughout the day to maintain it.
  HOW MUCH WATER DO I REALLY NEED TO DRINK? We’ve all been taught that eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day is the magic number for everyone, but that notion is a myth, said Tamara Hew-Butler, an exercise and sports scientist at Wayne State University. Unique factors like body size, outdoor temperature and how hard you’re breathing and sweating will determine how much you need, she said. A 200-pound person who just hiked 10 miles in the heat will obviously need to drink more water than a 120-pound office manager who spent the day in a temperature-controlled building. The amount of water you need in a day will also depend on your health. Someone with a medical condition like heart failure or kidney stones may require a different amount than someone taking diuretic drugs, for example. Or you may need to alter your intake if you’ve been ill, with vomiting or diarrhoea. For most young, healthy people, the best way to stay hydrated is simply to drink when you’re thirsty, Dr Topf said. (Those who are older, in their 70s and 80s, may need to pay more attention to getting sufficient fluids because the thirst sensation can decrease with age.) And despite popular belief, don’t rely on urine colour to accurately indicate your hydration status, Dr Hew-Butler said. Yes, it’s possible that dark yellow or amber urine could mean that you’re dehydrated, but there’s no solid science to suggest that the colour, alone, should prompt a drink. DO I HAVE TO DRINK WATER TO STAY HYDRATED? Not necessarily. From a purely nutritional standpoint, water is a better choice than less healthy options like sugary sodas or fruit juices. But when it comes to hydration, any beverage can add water to your system, Dr Hew-Butler said. One popular notion is that drinking beverages with caffeine or alcohol will dehydrate you, but if that’s true, the effect is negligible, Dr Topf said. A 2016 randomised controlled trial of 72 men, for instance, concluded that the hydrating effects of water, lager, coffee and tea were nearly identical. You can also get water from what you eat. Fluid-rich foods and meals like fruits, vegetables, soups and sauces all contribute to water intake. Additionally, the chemical process of metabolising food produces water as a byproduct, which adds to your intake too, Dr Topf said. DO I NEED TO WORRY ABOUT ELECTROLYTES? Some sports drink ads might have you think you need to constantly be replenishing electrolytes to keep their levels in check, but there’s no scientific reason for most healthy people to drink beverages with electrolytes added, Dr Hew-Butler said. Electrolytes like sodium, potassium, chloride and magnesium are electrically charged minerals that are present in the body’s fluids (like the blood and urine) and are important for balancing the water in your body. They’re also essential for proper functioning of the nerves, muscles, brain and heart. When you become dehydrated, the concentration of electrolytes in your blood rises, and the body signals the release of the hormone vasopressin, which ultimately reduces the amount of water that’s released into the urine so that you can reabsorb it back into your body and get that balance back in check, Dr Hyndman said. Unless you’re in an unusual circumstance – doing very intense exercise in the heat or losing lots of fluids from vomiting or diarrhoea – you don’t need to replenish electrolytes with sports drinks or other products loaded with them. Most people get enough electrolytes from food, Dr Hew-Butler said. BUT DRINKING MORE WATER, EVEN WHEN I’M NOT THIRSTY, WILL IMPROVE MY HEALTH, RIGHT? No. Of course, people with certain conditions, like kidney stones or the more rare autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, may benefit from making an effort to drink a little more water than their thirst would tell them to, Dr Topf said. But in reality, most healthy people who blame feeling ill on being dehydrated may actually be feeling off because they’re drinking too much water, Dr Hyndman speculated. “Maybe they’ll get a headache or they’ll feel bad, they’re thinking, ‘Oh, I’m dehydrated I need to drink more,’ and they keep drinking more and more and more water, and they keep feeling worse and worse and worse.” If you drink at a rate beyond what your kidneys can excrete, the electrolytes in your blood can become too diluted and, in the mildest case, it could make you feel “off.” In the most extreme case, drinking an excessive amount of water in a short period of time could lead to a condition called hyponatremia, or “water intoxication.” “This is very scary and bad,” Dr Hyndman said. If the sodium levels in your blood get too low, it can cause brain swelling and neurological issues like seizures, coma or even death. In 2007, a 28-year old woman died of hyponatremia after reportedly drinking nearly two gallons of water over three hours while taking part in a radio station’s “Hold Your Wee for a Wii” contest, which challenged participants to drink water and then go as long as possible without urinating. In 2014, a 17-year-old high school football player in Georgia died from the condition after reportedly drinking two gallons of water and two gallons of Gatorade. The condition has become common enough among exercisers that when someone collapses during a race, responders are trained to consider hyponatremia, Dr Topf said. Though developing severe hyponatremia is rare for most healthy people. HOW DO I KNOW IF I’M HYDRATED ENOUGH? Your body will tell you. The notion that staying hydrated requires complex calculations and instantaneous adjusting to avoid dire health consequences is just bunk, the experts said.

Fully vaccinated people aged 50 to 59 who finished their vaccination regimen at least six months ago will be invited to take their booster shots from Oct 4, the task force announced.  Speaking at a press conference, Mr Gan noted that Singapore has seen a sharp increase in the number of local cases since two weeks ago, almost reaching 1,600 cases a day.  “If the trend continues, the number of cases is likely to double to 3,200 a day by next week, and may even increase beyond that,” he added.  Singapore is also keeping a close watch on the number of serious COVID-19 cases, said Mr Gan.  While the number of serious cases is “still manageable” now, it takes about a week to 10 days or more for positive cases to show complications, he added.  “If positive cases continue to rise rapidly, we will expect to see the number of serious cases rise also. In fact, we are already starting to see a rise in the number of persons requiring oxygen, admission into ICU and deaths, mostly from cases infected some weeks ago,” said Mr Gan, who is also the Trade and Industry Minister.  “While we watch ICU cases, the rapidly increasing number of new cases is also of concern, as it is creating a serious strain on our hospital resources, despite the shift to community and home care. To ensure our healthcare system can continue to cope with these cases, we will need to take action to slow the rise in cases to protect our hospital system.”  The large majority, or 98 per cent of cases, are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a separate press release.  This is due to Singapore’s high vaccination coverage, with 82 per cent of the population fully vaccinated, it said.  Of the 254 cases with severe illness in the past two weeks, a “disproportionate” 48 per cent were unvaccinated, and the remainder were vaccinated individuals with co-morbidities.  ""This ratio needs to be understood in the context of more than 80 per cent of our population being fully vaccinated,"" said the Health Ministry. The numbers indicate a vaccine efficacy against severe illnesses that is still around 80 to 90 per cent. The elderly and those with co-morbidities among the vaccinated make up the 10 to 20 per cent who remain susceptible despite vaccination, it added.  As of Thursday evening, 23 beds in the ICU were occupied, and Singapore can set up almost 300 beds “at short notice”, said Health Minister and task force co-chair Ong Ye Kung.  “As of now the situation remains stable, but we need to watch it very closely. ICU numbers lag infection numbers by 10 days, 14 days, so we will expect ICU numbers to rise in the coming days,” he added.  “And some of them, especially if they are unvaccinated, elderly or with underlying illness, will unfortunately succumb.” Responding to a reporter's question about how many cases Singapore's healthcare system can take before it fails, the Health Minister said that currently, it can handle 2,500 to 3,000 cases if the home recovery programme is implemented smoothly.  ""At the same time, we need to dig very deep to prepare ourselves for 5,000 cases. These are the parameters that we are working on now. On one hand is the capacity, on the other hand, (the) last resort is always tapping on the brakes like we have to do now.""  Singapore entered the preparatory stage of its transition to living with COVID-19 as endemic on Aug 19. Home recovery for COVID-19 patients who are younger or vaccinated and are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms has also been introduced.  “While we have been advising individuals with mild COVID-19 symptoms that it is appropriate to recover at home, we understand the anxiety of some individuals to want to seek medical attention at hospitals,” said the Health Ministry in its press release.  MOH also acknowledged that the protocols and processes for home recovery are new and there have been ""service lapses"" as numbers increased.  “We are ironing out the teething issues with the home recovery programme, and in the coming few weeks, will further ramp up our care facilities to handle more cases.”  Without the home recovery programme, the system would already have been overwhelmed, said Mr Ong.  Home recovery is still the “most appropriate” care protocol for most cases that show mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, said the Health Ministry.  ""But if the overall number of cases continues to rise rapidly, we are also likely to see a growing number of infected persons, especially among the elderly, who do need hospital care. Hence, there is a need to slow down community transmission."" Mr Ong stressed that those on home recovery were ""not left on (their) own to recover"", adding that the health ministry's hotline operator team will be expanded and telemedicine services were available for support. Private sector primary care providers have also been roped in to help with such services.  ""The high number of cases these past couple of weeks struck us before we can fully put them in place. So I fully acknowledge that the past few days have been frustrating for you if you are undergoing home recovery,"" he added.  The Singapore Armed Forces will also be supporting with operations, which Mr Ong said had significantly ""augmented"" resources and capabilities. He also urged the public to allow the ministry to ""progressively clear the backlog that has accumulated over the past few days"".  MOH has joined Telegram groups where people on home recovery are providing support to each other, said Mr Ong.  ""We are joining so that we are able to answer your queries, and also at the same time pick out many of these common queries and confusion.""  In a Facebook post on Friday night after the press conference, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that the new measures would ""give us more time to deliver booster shots to people, and vaccinate those still not vaccinated"". Singapore is also expanding its hospital capacity, said Mr Lee. ""This will ensure that our healthcare system is not overwhelmed and can continue to take good care of all those who need medical care, whether for COVID-19 or other conditions,"" he said. ""We have to adapt our response to COVID-19 as the pandemic develops. I know the changes can be confusing and unsettling, but please bear with us. We will work closely with you to protect all our families.""  Acknowledging that Singaporeans may be disappointed by the new restrictions, co-chair of the task force Lawrence Wong said: “We had all hoped that we could put these restrictions behind us, especially with our high vaccination rates and with our plans to move forward to a COVID-resilient nation. “But the reality is that with the current infection trajectory, our healthcare system and our healthcare workers are facing many pressures. And that’s why we had to make this very difficult decision to apply some brakes and to slow down the rate of transmission.”  Singapore is still committed to its reopening plans, said Mr Wong, noting that the task force has left “many other parameters untouched”.  For example, mask-on vaccinated events can continue. The vaccinated travel lanes with Germany and Brunei have been rolled out, as well as plans for dormitory workers to re-enter the community, he added.  “After this wave crests, and it certainly will at some point in time, the daily numbers will come down. But they will stabilise at a new level which is likely to be much higher than what we have been used to before,” said Mr Wong.  “In other words, we are not going back to a scenario of low daily cases anymore. It’s not going to be possible, because we are moving forward to learn to live with the virus and we are continuing with our reopening plans. “That’s part of the adjustment we all have to make to prepare ourselves for the time when COVID becomes an endemic disease and learn to live with more daily cases.” "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/health-insurance-planning-women-2184231,Why Singapore women should set aside money for health insurance – and how to do it smartly,"Since turning 40, I've found myself thinking a lot more about my health and mortality. When I go for my annual health screening, I’m reminded that I’m of the age when I should start including certain screenings like mammograms as I’m now at higher risk of breast cancer. It is also at this age that I see more elderly loved ones and relatives pass away or be diagnosed with major ailments. The uncertainties in life feel even more pronounced over the past year as I’m inundated almost daily by news of COVID-19. Amid these sobering thoughts, I count myself lucky that I have not had any major health scares and have the peace of mind that should I be struck by any misfortune health-wise, my husband would not be financially burdened with caring for me or our children.  I bought my first health insurance policy once I started working – and made sure to review my policies with major life changes, like when my first child came along. However, this is not the case for everyone.  Even as more women in Singapore are placing a priority on growing their savings, more than one in four women are still not sufficiently protecting their savings with insurance, in the event of a critical illness. This is according to a 2017 survey conducted by United Overseas Bank (UOB) and Prudential Singapore of more than 800 women in Singapore.   Regardless of the life stage we are in, it is important to ensure we have the right insurance in place to see us through health crises and higher healthcare-related expenses as we age.  CNA Women asked industry experts for useful tips on how women can use health insurance to safeguard their health and well-being. KNOW WHAT IS AVAILABLE Health insurance is what would help you pay for your healthcare costs in the event of an injury, illness or disability.  There are five main types of health insurance, one of which is hospital and surgical insurance. Singaporeans and Permanent Residents are automatically covered under MediShield Life, regardless of age and health condition.  Administered by the Central Provident Fund Board, the basic hospital and surgical insurance plan helps to pay for large hospital bills and selected costly outpatient treatments, such as dialysis and chemotherapy.  MediShield Life covers the basics, like hospitalisation in B2 and C wards in public hospitals. But if you prefer to be admitted to a better type ward or private hospital, you can get additional coverage by upgrading to an Integrated Shield Plan provided by private insurance companies. Other health insurance includes critical illness insurance, which gives you a lump sum to help with expenses if you are diagnosed with a major illness like cancer, and hospital cash insurance, which gives you a fixed amount of cash for each day you are hospitalised. Health insurance also includes disability income insurance – this replaces your income when you are disabled and unable to work – and long-term care or severe disability insurance like ElderShield, which will pay for the care you need if you are severely disabled. START AS SOON AS POSSIBLE Topics like cancer and death may not feel like pressing issues when you are young. But financial experts recommend getting health insurance as soon as you can afford to and when you are in good health. If you wish to buy private health insurance, you should do so before you develop medical problems, otherwise the insurer may exclude coverage of those conditions in your policy, said R Sivanithy, Master Trainer at Institute for Financial Literacy (IFL), a collaboration between Singapore’s national financial education programme MoneySense, and Singapore Polytechnic Enterprise. “There are certain types of illnesses or conditions such as breast, ovarian and cervical cancers that can afflict women at any stage of their adult life. So, it would be advisable to ensure you have proper critical illness cover, which can replace any lost income due to inability to work for a period of time,” he said.  Eugenia Tan, Head of Emerging Affluent and Mass Segments at Prudential Singapore, said: “Everyone should have basic health insurance in place right from birth. As we grow older and our needs change, we should add on coverage accordingly.”  For instance, when you’re planning to have children, you can consider maternity insurance that provides coverage in the event of complications during the pregnancy and after birth, she said.  “Regardless of the life stage you are at, hospitalisation should be taken care of first. This is especially if you prefer staying in a private hospital or in A, B1, B2 and C wards,” said Chung Shaw Bee, Head of Deposits and Wealth Management at UOB. “If you are currently earning an income, start looking into critical illnesses and disability coverage.”  CONSIDER THE COVERAGE YOU NEED The 2017 Protection Gap Study by the Life Insurance Association Singapore (LIA) noted that while each individual needs an estimated S$317,000 in critical illness protection needs, the average Singaporean only has around S$60,000 in coverage, leaving a critical illness protection gap of around S$257,000.  The critical illness protection gap is the shortfall in the amount of money needed to meet one’s financial needs before one is able to return to work.   Financial experts also advise maintaining a savings balance of at least six months of your monthly expenses as emergency funds.  The amount you need for a rainy day may be even higher if you have dependants and have to factor in their daily needs if you are unable to provide income for them over an extended period of time.  And as every woman has her own specific needs and expectations of care, industry experts said it is important to work with a qualified financial consultant or adviser to figure out how much coverage you require. To save on premium costs, you can take advantage of bank perks, such as complimentary female-related cancer insurance coverage from the UOB Lady’s Savings Account. It provides free coverage of up to S$200,000 from Prudential for six female cancers and also gives you other medical, dental and wellness benefits.  BALANCE PROTECTION WITH AFFORDABILITY  While you want to be adequately protected from unforeseen circumstances, the insurance premiums should also be affordable over the long-term – health insurance premiums do increase with age and should not compromise other important life goals, such as saving for retirement. “When deciding on the amount of health insurance to buy, you should consider balancing your hospital or ward class preference and the level of income protection that you would want should you fall ill or become disabled, against the long-term affordability of supplementary plans,” said IFL’s Sivanithy.  He noted that about 70 per cent of Singapore residents have Integrated Shield Plans, where some cover for a higher-type ward (A or B1) in a public hospital, while others cover admission into a private hospital.  However, two-thirds of all patients choose B2 or C subsidised wards when they are admitted to hospitals, such that they may not have fully enjoyed the benefits of the plans, he said. “You should always aim to save before you spend every month,” he added. “You don’t want to be insurance-rich but cash-poor.” Though this can vary among individuals, he recommended a minimum savings of at least 10 per cent of your net pay, and not spending more than 10 per cent of your annual income on insurance premiums, as a guideline.  BUY WHAT MEETS YOUR NEEDS You should also only buy what you need by taking into account your family health history, financial situation, assets, liabilities and dependants’ needs. Over-insuring happens when your coverage is more than your current liabilities and your family’s potential loss of income, said Leaf Tan, a personal wealth manager with 25 years of experience in managing insurance and retirement portfolios. “To prevent that, you have to know what your liabilities and potential financial impact to you and your family are, should adversity strike. The purpose of insurance is to ensure minimal financial impact to you and your family in such a situation,” she said, while recommending allocating 10-15 per cent of your monthly income to health insurance. Prudential’s Tan noted it is quite rare to see customers over-insure.  In fact, the LIA study showed that other than having a critical illness protection gap, a working adult in Singapore also has an average mortality protection gap of around S$170,000. The mortality protection gap is the shortfall in the amount of money needed to meet a family’s financial needs in the event of one’s death.  “The key point to be mindful of, is to purchase insurance that meets one’s unique needs and to avoid duplication of coverage,” she said. So cultivate a habit of reviewing your insurance portfolio at least once a year with a financial adviser representative, to ensure you’re rightly insured.    You might also want to do so with with every life milestone, like when you start a family, while staying up-to-date with any major changes in premiums, benefits or policy rules to ensure your coverage remains relevant. BE AWARE THAT NOT EVERYTHING IS COVERED It is also important to understand the features of your policies and their exclusions. While MediShield Life covers pre-existing conditions, most private insurance policies do not do so.  Typically, outpatient treatments, other than for dialysis and chemotherapy, overseas medical treatment, medically unnecessary procedures such as cosmetic treatments, certain elective surgeries, costs of unapproved prescription drugs and co-payment, are not covered. The co-payment or co-insurance is the cost you have to split with the insurer after you pay your hospital bill’s deductible, which is the initial amount you have to pay before your insurer makes a pay-out. For example, if your policy has a co-insurance of 10 per cent, you will pay 10 per cent of the cost after the deductible. To minimise co-payment costs, you can opt to buy a co-payment rider with your Integrated Shield Plan. Since April this year, there is a mandatory co-payment of 5 per cent for Integrated Shield Plan riders but some insurers have co-payment riders that can help cap the out-of-pocket expense to as low as $3,000. GET YOUR OWN EVEN IF YOU HAVE COMPANY COVERAGE Even if you have company insurance, it is best to purchase your own health insurance. A company’s insurance coverage ceases once you leave or retire from the company.  When that happens, you may not be healthy enough to get your own health insurance, and a company also has the right to change its corporate insurance coverage, said Leaf Tan. “Comparatively, personal health insurance usually has a higher claim limit, which helps to cover against long-term, costly medical bills. This is essential for treatment of critical illnesses such as cancer, which can cost up to thousands of dollars,” said Prudential’s Tan.  “The amount and type of insurance provided by employers also varies from organisation to organisation and may not meet the full spectrum of one’s needs.” For more great ideas for you and your money, visit www.uob.com.sg/women.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/what-to-do-have-covid-19-symptoms-ART-test-positive-diy-2191716,FAQ: What to do if you have COVID-19 symptoms or your antigen rapid test is positive,"SINGAPORE: Local COVID-19 infection numbers have swelled in recent weeks, with cases growing “faster than expected”, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung last Friday (Sep 17). Authorities continue to emphasise the importance of testing extensively – and are urging people to self-test regularly as a matter of “social responsibility”. To that end, such do-it-yourself antigen rapid test (ART) kits have been distributed to households and students. Vending machines have also been set up islandwide to dispense the test kits to those who receive health risk warnings or alerts. Here are some guidelines from the Ministry of Health (MOH), as of Sep 22, on what you should do if you display symptoms of COVID-19 or test positive on an ART. Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to acute respiratory infection symptoms – such as fever, cough, runny nose or loss of taste or smell. If you have any such symptoms, skip the self-test.  Instead, consult a general practitioner at a Swab and Send Home (SASH) clinic, says MOH. You can find a list of these clinics here. If you have mild symptoms, you should also avoid seeking treatment at a hospital, added the ministry. Going to a SASH doctor – who can assess the severity of one's symptoms and perform COVID-19 tests – will help preserve hospital capacity “for those who truly need hospital care”, it said. You can also check your symptoms on this site developed by healthcare institutions.  You can use the ART even if you are well, as a person could be infected even if he has no symptoms, says MOH. Testing will provide certainty, especially if you have come into contact with an active cluster, it said. People are encouraged to self-test regularly, including those who are fully vaccinated, especially if they are taking part in large-scale events. Frequent swabbing has not been proven to be harmful, says MOH. ART swabs are inserted at around 2cm into the nostril, which are shallower and less intrusive than the nasopharyngeal swabs taken for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. However, if you have had recent facial surgery or frequent nose bleeds, you are advised to visit a licensed ART provider to have a professional perform the test for you. If your ART shows a positive result but you are asymptomatic, you should: 1. Stop going to work, cancel your social activities This is to protect others from possibly being infected with COVID-19. 2. Do not rush to a hospital to get tested Doing so may expose you to more risk because there may be other infected people there, said MOH’s director of medical services Kenneth Mak last Friday. If you are concerned about the ART test result, visit a nearby SASH clinic. The doctor will assess you and decide if a PCR test is needed. 3. Self-isolate for at least 72 hours You are encouraged to stay at home and self-isolate for at least 72 hours. This will allow you to safely recover, monitor your health and avoid spreading the virus further. If you start to feel unwell during isolation, visit a GP as soon as possible to be assessed. The doctor will decide if a PCR test is needed and will also advise on your next steps. 4. At the end of the 72 hours, do another ART test If the result is negative, you can have “peace of mind” knowing you have recovered, said Assoc Prof Mak. You can then “progressively” resume your normal activities, he said. 5. If your test result is still positive after the period of self-isolation, consult a GP Take a photo of your ART test result next to your identification card. Have this photo and your identification card with you when you go to the doctor. 6. If you are then given a PCR test, self-isolate while waiting You should head home via private transport and self-isolate while awaiting the results of your PCR test. Keep your mask on. Your doctor will inform you of your results generally within 24 to 48 hours, according to MOH. You may also check your results via HealthHub. Continue to self-isolate in a well-ventilated room. Do not have contact with your household members. MOH will contact you on the next course of action.  Home recovery is the default care management model for those who fulfil these criteria: - Fully vaccinated - Aged 12 to 69 years old - No or mild symptoms - No severe comorbidities or illness - Household members do not include elderly who are more than 80 years old or people in the vulnerable group such as pregnant women or those with weakened immune response or multiple comorbidities - Able to self-isolate in a room, preferably with an attached bathroom. You can expect to receive an SMS within 24 hours, with a link to provide your details, to start your home recovery. If you're unsuitable for home recovery, MOH will make the arrangements for you to recover at a community care facility or hospital. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/who-air-quality-guidelines-pollution-death-2195046,"WHO says air pollution kills 7 million a year, toughens guidelines","GENEVA: The World Health Organization strengthened its air quality guidelines on Wednesday (Sep 22), saying air pollution was now one of the biggest environmental threats to human health, causing seven million premature deaths a year. Urgent action is needed to reduce exposure to air pollution, said the UN body, ranking its burden of disease on a par with smoking and unhealthy eating. ""WHO has adjusted almost all the air quality guideline levels downwards, warning that exceeding the new ... levels is associated with significant risks to health,"" it said. ""Adhering to them could save millions of lives."" The guidelines aim to protect people from the adverse effects of air pollution and are used by governments as a reference for legally binding standards. The UN health agency last issued air quality guidelines, or AQGs, in 2005, which had a significant impact on pollution abatement policies worldwide. In the 16 years since however, the WHO said more evidence had emerged showing that air pollution effected health at lower concentrations than previously understood. ""The accumulated evidence is sufficient to justify actions to reduce population exposure to key air pollutants, not only in particular countries or regions but on a global scale,"" the organisation said. The new guidelines come just in time for the COP26 global climate summit held in Glasgow from Oct 31 to Nov 12. The WHO said that alongside climate change, air pollution was one of the biggest environmental threats to human health. Its climate change chief Maria Neira said the WHO was preparing a major report to present in Glasgow to stress the ""enormous health benefits"" of reducing air pollution through mitigating climate change. ""You can imagine the incredible number of lives we will save,"" she told journalists. The new WHO guidelines recommend lower air quality levels for six pollutants, including ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide. The other two are PM10 and PM2.5 - particulate matter equal or smaller than 10 and 2.5 microns in diameter. Both can penetrate deep into the lungs but researchers say PM2.5 can even enter the bloodstream, causing mainly cardiovascular and respiratory problems, but also affecting other organs, said the WHO. In response, the PM2.5 guideline level has been halved. In 2019, more than 90 per cent of the world's population lived in areas where concentrations exceeded the 2005 AQG for long-term PM2.5 exposure, with southeast Asia the worst-affected region. ""Almost everyone around the world is exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution,"" said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. ""Inhaling dirty air increases the risk of respiratory diseases like pneumonia, asthma ... and increases the risk of severe Covid-19."" Air quality markedly improved since the 1990s in high-income countries, the WHO noted. But the global toll in deaths and lost years of healthy life barely declined because air quality deteriorated in most other countries, in line with their economic development. ""Every year, exposure to air pollution is estimated to cause seven million premature deaths and result in the loss of millions more healthy years of life,"" the WHO said. In children, this could mean reduced lung growth and function, respiratory infections and aggravated asthma. In adults, ischaemic heart disease - also called coronary heart disease - and strokes are the most common causes of premature death attributable to outdoor air pollution. The evidence since 2005 showed how air pollution affected ""all parts of the body, from the brain to a growing baby in a mother's womb"", said Tedros. Evidence is also emerging of other effects such as diabetes and neurodegenerative conditions, said the organisation. Professor Alastair Lewis, of Britain's National Centre for Atmospheric Science, said the guidelines ""dramatically increase the scale of challenge to society"" in cutting air pollution. But he said the PM2.5 guidelines were ""the most contentious"" as they come from natural sources too - even from cooking - and can stay airborne for weeks. ""PM2.5 is, to an extent, also an inevitable and unavoidable consequence of living a 21st-century life,"" said Lewis."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/back-pain-women-chiropractic-physiotherapy-osteopathy-treatments-2184976,"Back pain in women: How chiropractic, osteopathy or physiotherapy can help","Have you tried doing your own spinal “cracks” at home, applying a pain relief cream or even changing your pillows to alleviate your back pain?  If you have, you are not alone – prolonged sitting from working at home has created an increasing demand for back pain solutions. When you take away your regular commute to the office or going out on your lunch break, you’ve effectively reduced incidental exercise, said Johnathan Wilson, an osteopath at Orchard Health Clinic, which offers chiropractic, osteopathy and physiotherapy care. Women, on top of prolonged sitting at their desks, are also more prone to back pain due to changes during pregnancy or menopause.  Pregnancy-related conditions such as sacroiliac joint (SIJ) dysfunction, which occurs when the pelvis adapts to the growing baby, is a common cause of lower back pain, said Aman Bancil, an osteopath and co-founder of Edge Healthcare, an osteopathy and physiotherapy clinic. Additionally, women going through menopause are more prone to osteoporotic compression fracture, which refers to small cracks that can occur in the vertebrae due to osteoporosis, he added. ""Postmenopausal women experience hormonal changes (including oestrogen reduction) that decreases their bone mineral density, making them more prone to these fractures than men,"" explained Bancil.  So the question is: What are possible ways for women to treat back pain?   The first thing you need to do is get to the root of the problem, said Dr Matt Kan, founder and chief executive of Chiropractic First. It’s not enough to simply change your work chair or go for a massage, he added. Chiropractor Dr Benjamin Tan, the founder of Chirogenesis, said that while using an ergonomic chair is beneficial to support your back, it is not able to treat your back pain. LOWER BACK PAIN IN WOMEN There are no back conditions that are exclusive to women, said Edge Healthcare’s Bancil, although women may be more prone to them, due to postural and hormonal changes during pregnancy, as well as structural anatomical differences in the hips and pelvis. Here’s a closer look at what could be causing your back pain.  To find out more, CNA Women delved into how a chiropractor, osteopath or physiotherapist can help alleviate back pain. All these are non-invasive treatments. CHIROPRACTIC Chiropractic aims to keep your spine and nervous system healthy. According to the Chiropractic First website, when the bones in the spine (called the vertebrae) are out of alignment due to poor posture, stress, trauma, childbirth and other reasons, it causes what’s called subluxations. “Chiropractic adjustments (to correct these subluxations) have been proven to be highly effective to help reduce and alleviate the pain,” said the clinic’s Dr Kan.  To better explain what chiropractic is, Dr Tan from Chirogenesis said that everything in your body is directly (or indirectly) controlled by your spine and nerves – including the shedding of the uterus lining during menstruation.  Think of a chiropractor as a ""doctor of the nervous system"" more than just a spinal doctor, said Dr Tan. Put in layman terms, if your spine and nervous system are healthy, the rest of your body would be too since everything is inter-connected. Chiropractors say that one would subsequently not need to depend on drugs, medication or surgery. Some benefits you can enjoy from chiropractic care over a period of time include a realigned, stabilised spine, being able to return to full function and enjoying physical activities freely, said Dr Kan. Chiropractic may also be helpful in pregnancy, where more frequent maintenance of the spine is required due to the additional weight from the abdomen, he added. The extra weight “puts a lot of pressure on the lower back, causing persistent, intense and unbearable pain”.  Chiropractic care can also help with old injuries or treat complications from an epidural, he added. A US clinical paper studying the benefits of chiropractic care in 950 women during pregnancy and labour in 2007, suggested that chiropractic was the third most common form of treatment after yoga and massage.  The same study also highlighted that women who seek chiropractic care throughout their pregnancy have, on average, 31 per cent shorter labour times. This rings true for 42-year-old mumpreneur Nichol Ng, who started chiropractic sessions in 2016, when she was pregnant with her third child. “I believe it contributed to a swifter birth experience without any epidural or painkillers,” she added.   Ng continued with her chiropractic sessions during her confinement and throughout her fourth pregnancy as well.  OSTEOPATHY Osteopaths focus on the musculoskeletal system, which includes the bones, muscles, tendons, ligaments and soft tissues. To help with back pain, they use soft tissue techniques, deep tissue manipulation, articulations and mobilisations, explained osteopath Wilson.  During pregnancy, said Bancil, an osteopath would work on gently releasing the tissue around the hips and spine, help with joint mobility and postural strengthening, and give exercise advice. As with chiropractic, these measures are used to mitigate the impact of the added weight the body has to adapt to during pregnancy. “This alone can put stress on the lower back, but it also changes the centre of gravity, which then has secondary consequences on other parts of the spine,"" said Wilson. In postpartum back pain, it is the abdominal wall that’s largely affected, especially if you’ve had a Caesarean delivery. “An exercise programme to help build up the core muscles again would be key,” Bancil said.   There’s some crossover between osteopathy, physiotherapy and chiropractic. Osteopaths and physiotherapists also “administer adjustments to the spine and other parts of the body when necessary”, said osteopath Wilson. And while historically, osteopaths would use a more manual approach while physiotherapists utilised exercise rehabilitation, both now tap on both approaches, said Bancil. PHYSIOTHERAPY  One of the biggest misconceptions of physiotherapists is that they don’t treat back problems because they don't typically “crack” backs, said Bancil of Edge Healthcare. “Physiotherapists are movement experts and utilise multiple other ways to improve back pain through soft tissue techniques, exercise prescription, as well as education and advice,” he added. Although their titles differ, both physiotherapists and osteopaths can assist in the recovery and rehabilitation of back pain, said Wilson of Orchard Health Clinic.  And both types of therapists are trained to diagnose and treat a wide array of musculoskeletal issues and injuries, added Bancil, whether it’s conditions related to the joints or muscle-related pain, sports injuries or postural problems. “As a result, they are able to treat anything from an elderly person’s knee complaint to a high-level athlete’s shoulder pain,” he added.  YOU CAN GO FOR MORE THAN ONE TYPE OF TREATMENT  It’s worth noting that a therapist in one field may also refer a patient to one in another field, depending on what treatment is needed.   For example, Chirogenesis’ Dr Tan said it’s not uncommon for him to recommend that a patient with a sports injury visit a physiotherapist as well.  This pairing isn’t unusual. Dr Kan explained that in countries like Australia, and increasingly in Malaysia, physiotherapists work with chiropractors. “Chiropractors work on the biomechanical function of the spine whereas physiotherapists help with soft tissue rehabilitation, muscle stretching and mobility.” A session with a chiropractor, osteopath or physiotherapist varies among different clinics in Singapore. For instance, Chirogenesis charges S$110 for a 20- to 30-minute session, while at Edge Healthcare, patients pay S$160 for a 40-minute session. Meanwhile, each session at Orchard Health Clinic costs S$214 for an hour.  Most clinics offer packages, too, although some claim that they do not actively sell them. “We try to get people as independent as quickly as possible,” said Edge Healthcare’s Bancil, whose clinic offers a package of S$1,400 for 10 sessions. Chirogenesis charges S$288 for three sessions.  WHEN TO SEEK HELP FOR YOUR PAIN Whether you choose to see a chiropractor, osteopath or physiotherapist, the best time to seek help is before the pain surfaces, in what’s called preventative wellness care, said Dr Kan.  “Having a general check-up to ascertain how to best manage your musculoskeletal well-being during any stage of life can be beneficial to prevent future injury,” advised Wilson from Orchard Health Clinic.   Obviously, if you’re already in pain, you shouldn’t ignore it.  Citing an example, Dr Kan said: “When a patient tells me that he felt a little numbness on his finger that started recently, the problem has been there for a long time. The nerve is compressed and badly damaged even before the patient even feels it.” According to osteopath Bancil, you should consult a physiotherapist or osteopath if: Said Orchard Health Clinic’s Wilson: “(With osteopathy), we aim to not only treat but educate and empower the patient on how to manage their overall musculoskeletal health.” Will the pain return? It’s possible, said chiropractor Dr Tan, which is why education and changing perceptions are equally important in these sessions.  Just like a toothache, if the problem is detected early, it can be corrected and reversed very quickly, said chiropractor Dr Kan. But if the problem has been there for a long time, it would take longer.  As a rough indication, if you went to an osteopath to treat a minor joint irritation, it could take up to two weeks to resolve. In contrast, “a slipped disc can take about six months”, said Edge Healthcare’s Bancil. CNA Women is a section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/doctorless-clinic-singapore-tanjong-pagar-2179181,Need a medical test but too shy? There’s a doctorless clinic in Singapore,"If you’ve always felt uncomfortable about having a stranger (even if it’s a doctor) poke and swab you in your intimate areas, there's a clinic that can make the experience less daunting for you – because there won't be any doctors there. Known as DTAP Express, the self-testing clinic located in Tanjong Pagar lets patients do their own swabbing without having to interact with a doctor – well, at least not in person.  Started in August last year to offer self-tests for sexual health, the clinic recently expanded its services in July this year to include self-administered tests for general health, men’s health and women’s health – making it a total of seven self-tests available.  In addition to self-tests for HIV and sexually transmitted diseases, there are also those that test for cholesterol, diabetes, function of the liver, kidney and thyroid, cancer markers as well as nutritional deficiencies, said Dr Julian Hong from DTAP. For men’s and women’s health, the tests can pick up hormonal and reproductive health issues, he added, which are pertinent to couples planning to start families.  “The majority of these tests are blood tests taken by our onsite phlebotomist,” said Dr Hong.  “For sexual health tests, the only additions are urine tests and self-swabs for orifices involved in sexual intercourse. These self-swabs are taken by the patient with clear, illustrated instructions given prior,” he said.  If the patient is still unsure, he or she can ask a doctor through telecommunication in the self-testing room. Patients will have to make an appointment either online or in person at the clinic. After registering, answering a questionnaire to determine the test needed and paying, the appropriate test kit will be handed over. Once completed, patients simply drop their samples off with the receptionist and leave. To date, more than 700 tests have been done with “100 per cent success and accuracy of results”, said Dr Hong, who explained that the encrypted results are either emailed or sent over WhatsApp to patients in 72 hours. For full tests that require lab work, the results will be ready in five to seven days.  The individual tests cost from S$59 while packages for essential health start at S$129. The most expensive tests are the comprehensive sexual health tests, which can go up to S$348. DTAP Express is located at Icon Village, 12 Gopeng St, #01-70, Singapore 078877. More details here. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/how-age-gracefully-80-year-old-wellness-expert-2176001,How do you age gracefully? An 80-year-old wellness expert weighs in,"The day after my 80th birthday, which overflowed with good wishes, surprises and COVID-safe celebrations, I awoke feeling fulfilled and thinking that whatever happens going forward, I’m okay with it. My life has been rewarding, my bucket list is empty, my family is thriving, and if everything ends tomorrow, so be it. Not that I expect to do anything to hasten my demise. I will continue to exercise regularly, eat healthfully and strive to minimise stress. But I’m also now taking stock of the many common hallmarks of aging and deciding what I need to reconsider. I found considerable inspiration and guidance in a new book, Stupid Things I Won’t Do When I Get Old, by Steven Petrow, written with Roseann Foley Henry. Petrow, who is also a columnist but is nearly two decades younger than I, began thinking ahead after watching the missteps of his ageing parents, like waiting too long to get hearing aids. I took a similar inventory of my life and started at the top, with my hair. I’d been colouring it for decades, lighter and lighter as I got older. But I noticed that during the pandemic, many people (men as well as women of all ages) had stopped covering their grey. And they looked just fine, sometimes better than they did with hair dyed dark above a wrinkled facade. Today, I too am grey and loving it, although I can no longer blame my dog for the white hairs on the couch. I’ve also resisted the common temptation to cover up other cosmetic issues. I now rarely use makeup, and my usual summer costume remains short-shorts and tank tops. Wrinkles be damned. I’m proud to have them. But I will continue to be irritated by bad grammar, like the sentence recently in this newspaper that ended … “to we mortals,” and correct misuse of the language whenever I can. And I will stubbornly resist altering my habits to avert potential tragedies that others foresee. I walk my dog in the woods over slippery rocks, roots and fallen logs so I can enjoy his fearless energy and athleticism and improve my own balance and self-confidence. The doctor who monitors my bone health ends every consult with an order, “Do not fall,” and the treacherous woods walk is part of my response. As Petrow emphasised, fear of falling “can actually lead to more falls” by making you unduly anxious, hesitant and focused on your feet instead of what’s in front of you. My kitchen was built for a five-foot-tall cook who, thanks to scoliosis and shrinkage, is now several inches shorter. That means I often climb to reach items that I can’t store on a lower shelf. But I always use a sturdy step stool, unlike a 78-year-old friend who foolishly climbed on a chair (a big no-no), fell and injured his back. When I asked a woman my age how she was feeling, she said, “I have issues,” and I said, “We all have issues. The secret to successful ageing is to recognise one’s issues and adapt accordingly.” I’m constantly learning what I can and can’t do and asking or paying for help when needed. Sooner or later, we all must recognise what is no longer possible and find alternatives. Years ago, body mechanics forced me to give up tennis and ice skating and now strenuous gardening. I continue to do 10-mile bike rides several times a week in good weather, but two-week cycling trips up and down hills are now history. A dear friend in her 90s is my role model and serves as a reality check. When I asked if she’d accompany me on a trip abroad, she said, “Thanks, but I’m no longer up to the level of activity it involves.” I’ve vowed to stop talking to whoever will listen about my aches, pains and ailments, what Petrow called the “organ recital.” It doesn’t provide relief – in fact, it might even make the pain worse. Rather than instill empathy, the “organ recital” likely turns most people off, especially young ones. And I do cherish my young friends who keep me youthful in spirit and focused on issues important to my children and grandchildren and the world they will inherit. They, in turn, say they value the information and wisdom I can offer. I also strive to say something flattering or cheerful to a stranger every day. It brightens both of our lives and helps me focus on the beauty around me. But my most valuable advice: Live each day as if it’s your last, with an eye on the future in case it’s not, a lesson I learned as a teen when my mother died of cancer at 49. Her death inured me to catastrophic loss, which I handle better than little ones. The stickiest wicket going forward will be driving. When I was in my mid-70s, my sons started urging me to stop driving simply based on my age. I hadn’t had any accidents or even almost-accidents or gotten a ticket for a moving violation. Still, they upped my liability insurance (okay, I said, if it makes you feel better). And, to get them off my back, I gave up my 10-year-old minivan and I replaced it with one of the safest cars on the road, a Subaru Outback. Like many other cars now on the market, the Subaru has several protective bells and whistles that compensate for the declining senses and slower reactions that accompany ageing. It warns me when there’s a car, bicycle or pedestrian approaching when I’m backing out of a parking spot. It stops dead when anything suddenly appears or stops in front of me. If I should turn my head to see something, it flashes “Keep Eyes on Road.” I’m also beginning to tackle another burdensome issue especially common among those who have lived long in one place: Clutter. I have a latent fear of “running out” of things and so I chronically buy and save more than enough of everything. My late husband called our house an air raid shelter that could sustain us for a year. I’m also terrible at parting with objects that may one day be useful. He told me I reminded him of an elderly woman he knew who kept pieces of string “too small to use.” I’m taking his advice to heart. Wish me luck.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/suicide-mental-health-singapore-depression-help-sos-imh-2182036,"Mental health awareness, not dismissing concerns the first steps in helping loved ones with suicidal thoughts","SINGAPORE: Awareness of the warning signs and not dismissing concerns are the first steps in helping someone who might have suicidal thoughts, experts have told CNA. “There is much guilt and shame when talking about one’s own suicidal thoughts, and this often deters those who are experiencing them from talking about it and seeking help,” said Dr Ganesh Kudva, associate consultant at the department of psychosis at the Institute of Mental Health. Everyone has a role to play, he added, but there is a need to be more aware about mental illness and suicide. The comments come after figures released by the IMH earlier this month showed that one in 13 adults in Singapore has thought about suicide. The study on suicidality – a term encompassing suicide thoughts, plans and attempts – is part of the second Singapore Mental Health Study. Last year, 452 people in Singapore killed themselves. A total of 2,795 suicide attempts in Singapore were recorded in 2020, according to a written parliamentary answer by Health Minister Ong Ye Kung in July. Mr Gasper Tan, chief executive of the Samaritans of Singapore, said: “It is important for more in the community to be equipped with the literacy of identifying signs of distress or crisis to be able to intervene early.” CNA spoke to experts about looking out for the warning signs, what you can do, and why talking about the issue has benefits: Suicide is very complex and often involves various factors, said Dr Mythily Subramaniam, assistant chairman medical board, research at IMH. “Suicidal ideation can vary from fleeting and unwanted thoughts to a preoccupation with death,” she added. The first step is identification of the “symptoms”, said Dr Kudva. It is important not to brush off mental health distress and suicidal ideation as being a symptom of weakness or a matter of choice. Identifying these symptoms as being genuine expressions of problems is a “key step” to helping someone in distress. These symptoms, if unaddressed, can lead to serious consequences, such as suicide, he explained. While the warning signs can vary from person to person, “in essence” it tends to be a “marked deviation” from the person’s usual behaviour, said Dr Kudva. Some of these signs include a person becoming withdrawn, appearing sad and tearful, or describing themselves of being devoid of hope or being a burden. They might be “preparing for an impending demise and saying farewell to family and friends”, or they might speak of death or express a desire to die. In some instances, people self harm. There might also be sudden changes in moods, emotional outbursts, and a loss of interest in their usual day to day activities, explained Mr Tan. Some risk factors of suicide include prior attempts, a mental health condition, or social isolation, he added. “When dealing with suicidal thoughts, one often faces a lot of psychological pain. Prolonged and intensified sense of pain can contribute to feelings of hopelessness and helplessness,” said Mr Tan. “By reaching out and doing regular check-ins on the people we care about, lending them a listening ear, and encouraging them to seek help and prompt interventions, where necessary, we can help to alleviate stress and reduce suicidality,” Dr Kudva added. When support is provided early, recovery can be less challenging, and escalation may be prevented, said Mr Tan. This includes building a safety plan and having a good support network. “If someone displays warning signs or shares about their thoughts of suicide, we may get startled or react emotionally,” he explained. During that time, it is important to remain non-judgemental and show genuine concern. It can also mean providing support, such as a listening ear. Provide them with a safe space to share their thoughts and feelings, Mr Tan said. “To know whether they are suicidal, ask directly if they are experiencing any suicidal thoughts and thinking of ending their life,” added Mr Tan. “Often people worry that asking such sensitive questions may make them feel worse. On the contrary, research shows that asking directly can reassure the person in distress that you are ready to have the difficult conversation with them and may be able to provide the much-needed support.” Dr Kudva added: “Psychological first aid, which assists those during an emotional crisis, can be administered to someone who is distressed and potentially suicidal, to calm them down, while getting them to a place of health.” Periodically checking for suicide thoughts among those with mental and certain physical illnesses may also mitigate against this risk. Dr Kudva urged people to be aware about the avenues of help that can be sought. These include mental health hotlines, the nearest A&E department for immediate medical attention, as well as family service centres and primary care doctors who are trained to manage mental health conditions. “It is … hoped that early identification of suicidal ideation, safeguarding the person’s physical (by reducing access to means) and psychological (by psychological first aid and through mental health hotlines) state, and getting a person who has suicidal ideation promptly to a place of help, will aid in reducing the risk of suicide,” he added. Samaritans of Singapore's hotline: 1800 221 4444 Institute of Mental Health’s helpline: 6389 2222 Singapore Association for Mental Health helpline: 1800 283 7019 You can also find a list of international helplines here. If someone you know is at immediate risk, call 24-hour emergency medical services. This is a belief that talking about suicide increases a person’s risk of suicide, but studies have shown that this is not true, said Dr Kudva. It is key to work to “dispel the myths that surround suicide” – by acknowledging that it is not a rare occurrence, and that talking about it does not lead to someone becoming suicidal, he added. “Sharing stories of those who once had suicidal thoughts, who sought help and are now better, is crucial to instilling hope among those who are presently suffering from such thoughts,” he explained. “This is especially important as hopelessness is viewed as an important risk factor for suicide. The key message is that suicidal ideation is common, it is not something to be ashamed about, it is transient, and that help is available.” Figures from the study showed that suicide ideation was 3.6 times more likely among people in the 18 to 34 age group compared to people aged 65 and above. This “association of suicidality” with younger age is “notable”, said Dr Kudva, adding that suicide is the leading cause of death among those aged 10 to 29 in Singapore. There must be an acknowledgement “at the societal level” that mental health issues are common and that it is not a taboo subject, he noted. Both Dr Kudva and Mr Tan agree that mental health education in schools is important, as are community campaigns. “Mental health literacy will improve once we start having an open conversation about mental health, and I believe that we are beginning to have this conversation is Singapore. This is certainly a step in the right direction,” Dr Kudva said. Mr Tan said that while that has been increased understanding on mental health related topics, there are still many who have “inaccurate beliefs about mental health” or judge those who have a mental health condition. “Conversations need to start by first debunking myths as well as starting to talk about suicide openly,” he added. The study on suicidality was derived from the second Singapore Mental Health Survey. It involved face-to-face interviews, conducted between 2016 and 2018, with 6,126 participants aged 18 years and above. “To establish the prevalence of suicidality, the study used the ‘Suicidality’ module of the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview,” explained IMH. Participants were asked a series of questions to determine if they had ever seriously thought about suicide, made a plan or attempted suicide. Data on their physical health conditions, including hypertension, cardiovascular disorders, chronic pain, cancer and diabetes, their mental disorders, including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and alcohol use disorder, as well as socio-demographic information were also collected. The results showed there are socio-demographic reasons and illness-related risk factors for suicidality. “While in general and in our study, the majority of individuals with suicidal ideation do not go on to make suicide attempts, it is nevertheless a risk factor for suicide attempts,” said Dr Mythily. “We also know that previous suicide attempts are an important risk factor for suicides, and may result in subsequent attempts and even death, if not addressed adequately. “The identification of risk factors of suicidality thus provides an opportunity to intervene early thereby lowering the risk of suicides in the population.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/style-beauty/balding-men-hair-transplants-2175951,When balding men bid comb-overs farewell and got hair transplants during the pandemic,"Joining the pandemic boom in cosmetic tuneups, many follicularly challenged men have used their time away from the office to embark on a fresh new look of their own: A hair transplant. To some, a recarpeted scalp is a way of turning back the clock to a glorious youth. To others, it’s a business move, a way to burnish their image so as to rearm themselves for a return to the corporate trenches. But to many, it’s … well, a little awkward. Wait, weren’t you the guy with the comb-over? “Always, the dilemma is, what are people going to say?” said Robert Golden, 51, a tax adviser in Los Angeles who sprang for a hair transplant last winter while working remotely. “Do you tell anybody you’ve done it?” Men often feel sheepish about undergoing a hair transplant, at least at first, said Fabien Beretta, executive director of the Beverly Hills Hair Group in Beverly Hills, California, where Golden went for his transplant. “Men are a little more iffy about getting anything cosmetic,” he said. “Women talk about it openly. Guys want to hide it.” There is nothing objectively embarrassing about a hair transplant. Even so, stigmas linger. The internet is filled with articles like Why You Shouldn’t Be Ashamed of Getting a Hair Transplant. New hair in general, particularly toupees, have long served as gag material in movies and television shows. “Why don’t you get a pair of white shoes, move down to Miami Beach and get the whole thing over with,” Jerry teased George in the Seinfeld episode where the latter bought a new rug. This may explain why celebrities like Tom Hanks, Jude Law and Matthew McConaughey who appear, uh, “less bald than they used to be,” as BuzzFeed once put it, tend to remain mum about their bushy new manes, leaving tabloids to play the guessing game. “It’s like one of those old ’80s rom-coms, where the geek suddenly gets this flashy makeover and shows up at the club,” said Mitchell Virzi, 29, one-third of the Los Angeles comedy team called the Virzi Triplets, identical brothers who all got hair transplants in recent months. “For a lot of guys, it can feel awkward, like you’re trying on a new personality.” Then there are the perception problems of springing for a “luxury” like cosmetic surgery, particularly during troubled times. Transplants are not cheap, averaging around US$7,000 (S$9,400) but often rising to US$20,000 or more, depending on geography, the type of procedure and the amount of work that needs to be done, said Dr Akash Chandawarkar, a former plastic surgery chief resident at Johns Hopkins University who is now in New York. To some guys, that can seem a little, well, vain. “There’s still that old stigma, where guys aren’t supposed to worry about how they look and spend a lot of money on their appearance,” said Alex Virzi, another of the newly coifed triplets. That doesn’t seem to be dissuading many balding men. “It’s the largest demand I have ever seen,” said Dr Marc Dauer, a hair restoration surgeon who practices in Los Angeles and New York City and has seen about a 30 per cent surge in hair transplant procedures, and a 50 per cent increase in transplant consultations, during the pandemic. The Beverly Hills Hair Group has also seen a 25 per cent spike in inquiries in recent months, and other cosmetic surgeons interviewed reported a similar surge. Some of this apparent boom seems attributable to the pandemic itself. Extended time away from the office gave men the cover they needed to slip away for the procedure, then recover away from prying eyes of co-workers. There is also “Zoom dysmorphia,” in which people feel the need to “fix” perceived “flaws” in their appearance spotted during endless hours of video conference calls. “On FaceTime, Skype or Zoom, people are looking at themselves more than anyone they’re talking to,” Beretta said. “It’s like they’re sitting at home all day looking in the mirror.” Then there is the emotional drain of the past 18 months, which is enough for even people with the fullest heads of hair to find their shower drains clogging with hair. Intense stress, as well as post-viral inflammation from COVID-19, can also cause temporary hair loss known as telogen effluvium. Whatever the traditional hesitations, the old shame over new hair may be fading, especially in this age of oversharing. It helps that the post-surgery results are not as stark as they once were. A popular method of hair transplants these days – follicular unit extraction, in which surgeons plant individual follicles from the back of the head onto the top of the head – can take months to start filling in. (“It’s like a Chia Pet,” Mitchell Virzi said.) For Golden, the tax adviser, his initial trepidations dissolved quickly once he saw how much his new hair boosted his confidence among friends and even with his wife, he said. And when he finally returned to the glassy high-rise office a month ago and displayed his new tresses to colleagues, the real shock was how little people cared, or even noticed. “To be honest, it wasn’t like I walked in and people said, ‘Oh, you got a hair transplant,’ ” Golden said. “It was done so well that people didn’t even really notice. They were like, ‘Did you get a haircut? You look younger.’ ” By Alex Williams © The New York Times  This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/how-much-exercise-do-we-need-live-longer-2184336,How much exercise do we need to live longer? And how much is too much?,"To increase our chances for a long life, we probably should take at least 7,000 steps a day or play sports such as tennis, cycling, swimming, jogging or badminton for more than 2.5 hours per week, according to two large-scale new studies of the relationship between physical activity and longevity. The two studies, which together followed more than 10,000 men and women for decades, show that the right types and amounts of physical activity reduce the risk of premature death by as much as 70 per cent. But they also suggest that there can be an upper limit to the longevity benefits of being active, and pushing beyond that ceiling is unlikely to add years to our life spans and, in extreme cases, might be detrimental. Plenty of research already suggests that people who are active outlive those who seldom move. A 2018 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for instance, concluded that about 10 per cent of all deaths among Americans 40 to 70 years old are a result of too little exercise. A 2019 European study found that two decades of inactivity doubled Norwegian people’s risk of dying young. But scientists have not yet pinned down precisely how much – or little – movement might be most strongly associated with greater longevity. Nor is it clear whether we can overdo exercise, potentially contributing to a shorter life. Those issues lie at the heart of the two new studies, which look at the links between activity and longevity from distinct but intersecting angles. The first of the studies, published this month in JAMA Network Open, centered on steps. Most of us are familiar with daily step counts as an activity goal, since our phones, smart watches and other activity trackers typically prompt us to take a certain number of steps every day, often 10,000. But as I have written before, current science does not show that we require 10,000 steps for health or longevity. Researchers from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, the C.D.C. and other institutions wondered if, instead, smaller step totals might be related to longer lives. So, they turned to data gathered in recent years for a large, ongoing study of health and heart disease in middle-aged men and women. Most of the participants had joined the study about 10 years earlier, when they were in their 40s. At the time, they completed medical tests and wore an activity tracker to count their steps every day for a week. Now, the researchers pulled records for 2,110 of the participants and checked their names against death registries. They found that 72 participants had died in the intervening decade, a relatively small number but not surprising given the people’s relative youth. But the scientists also noticed a strong association with step counts and mortality. Those men and women accumulating at least 7,000 daily steps when they joined the study were about 50 percent less likely to have died since than those who took fewer than 7,000 steps, and the mortality risks continued to drop as people’s step totals rose, reaching as high as 70 percent less chance of early death among those taking more than 9,000 steps. But at 10,000 steps, the benefits leveled off. “There was a point of diminishing returns,” said Amanda Paluch, an assistant professor of kinesiology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who led the new study. People taking more than 10,000 steps per day, even plenty more, rarely outlived those taking at least 7,000. Helpfully, the second study, which was published in August in Mayo Clinic Proceedings, settled on broadly similar activity levels as best bets for long life. This study involved data from the decades-long Copenhagen City Heart Study, which has recruited tens of thousands of Danish adults since the 1970s and asked them how many hours each week they play sports or exercise, including cycling (wildly popular in Copenhagen), tennis, jogging, swimming, handball, weight lifting, badminton, soccer and others. The researchers focused on 8,697 of the study’s Danes, who had joined in the 1990s, noted their activity habits then and checked their names against death records. In the 25 years or so since most had joined, about half had died. But those who reported exercising, in some way, between 2.6 and 4.5 hours per week when they joined were 40 per cent or so less likely to have died in the interim than less active people. Translating those hours of exercise into step counts is not an exact science, but the researchers estimate that people exercising for 2.6 hours a week, or about 30 minutes most days, likely would accumulate around 7,000 to 8,000 steps most days, between their exercise and daily life, while those working out for 4.5 hours a week probably would be approaching the 10,000-steps threshold most days. And at that point, as in the first study, benefits plateaued. But in this study, they then surprisingly declined among the relatively few people who worked out for 10 hours or more per week, or about 90 minutes or so most days. “The very active group, people doing 10-plus hours of activity a week, lost about a third of the mortality benefits,” compared to people exercising for 2.6 to 4.5 hours a week, said Dr James O’Keefe, a professor of medicine at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and director of preventive cardiology at the St Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute, who was an author on the study. Both studies are associational, though, meaning they show that physical activity is linked to life span but not that being more active directly causes life spans to lengthen. Together, however, they provide useful takeaways for all of us hoping to live long and well: ■ Both studies pinpoint the sweet spot for activity and longevity at somewhere around 7,000 to 8,000 daily steps or about 30 to 45 minutes of exercise most days. Doing more may marginally improve your odds of a long life, Dr O’Keefe said, but not by much, and doing far more might, at some point, be counterproductive. ■ Accumulate and measure your activities “in whatever way works for you,” said Dr Paluch. “Step counting may work well for someone who does not have the time to fit in a longer bout of exercise. But if a single bout of exercise fits best with your lifestyle and motivations, that is great as well. The idea is just to move more.” By Gretchen Reynolds © The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/fruit-plant-based-diets-unhealthy-high-sugar-2184746,Commentary: Eating mainly fruit can do more harm than good to your body,"BIRMINGHAM, United Kingdom: Plant-based diets have become increasingly popular in recent years, both for health and ethical reasons. One extreme form of plant-based diet is fruitarianism, a diet based largely on consumption of raw fruit.  At first glance, this may sound healthy, but what effect will this type of restrictive diet have on the body? And is it a healthy diet choice? There is solid evidence that plant-based diets are good for the body.  Plant-based diets may reduce the risk of heart disease by 40 per cent and stroke by 29 per cent. They have also been shown to be a useful strategy for helping people lose weight. While plant-based diets have clear benefits for health and environmental sustainability, fruitarianism is one of the most restrictive diet choices available and has almost no evidence to support health benefits. There is no definitive description of what a fruitarian diet should consist of, although one commonly cited “rule” is that between 55 per cent and 75 per cent of the diet should comprise raw fruit. Beyond this, there is some variability; some fruitarians eat grains, some also eat nuts and oils. Apple co-founder, Steve Jobs, experimented with a fruitarian diet, supplementing it with nuts, seeds and grains. Some adherents of fruitarianism stick to an 80-10-10 rule: 80 per cent of calories coming from fresh fruit and vegetables, 10 per cent coming from protein and 10 per cent from fat.  This rule is mistakenly based on the belief that humans are not omnivores, but frugivores - animals that prefer to eat raw fruit. Proponents of this belief state that the human digestive system is physiologically designed to digest fruit and raw vegetables.  While this may have once been true, the human body has evolved. Some fruitarians claim that “going raw” has had marked benefits including curing cancer and eliminating bloating and body odour. There is no robust evidence to back up these claims. The idea of consuming a fruit-only (or fruit-heavy) diet might appear a healthy option at first glance, but there are potentially many problems with this form of restrictive eating. There are clear and significant physical health issues to consider when the human body is provided with a largely fruit-based diet. Following this eating pattern excludes essential food groups and nutrients that the body needs to maintain normal health. While most fruit is considered to be healthy and nutritious, a diet that almost solely relies on fruits will be deficient in nutrients, including protein, iron, calcium, vitamin B (including vitamin B12) and D, zinc and omega-3 fatty acids.  Deficiency in these nutrients can have significant health implications including rickets and osteomalacia (a softening of the bones), anaemia and issues with bones, muscles and skin. Put simply, fruit does not contain all the nutrients the body needs. In addition to what is missing in a fruitarian diet, the high levels of fructose have to be considered. Fructose is a simple sugar, like glucose, but the human body processes it very differently. Fructose is metabolised solely in the liver.  Excess fructose consumption can cause fat buildup in the liver, leading to insulin resistance in the liver and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.  While there is controversy as to whether fructose from fruit is as bad as fructose syrup, which is added to foods to sweeten them, experiments in rats fed a high fructose diet showed similarities to human fatty liver disease. Beyond the potential physical effects of fruitarianism, restrictive diets are also often associated with an eating disorder known as orthorexia nervosa, or an unhealthy obsession with eating “pure” food only. This means that what can start off as a healthy move towards eating more fruit and vegetables and less junk food can lead to an eating disorder, depression and anxiety. Worryingly, isolated cases of death or significant disease have been reported when a fruitarian style diet has been followed. Examples include a nine-month-old girl dying after being fed a fruit-only diet. The girl died vastly underweight and malnourished.  Additionally, a 49-year-old man was recently reported to have developed reversible dementia after subsisting on a fruit-only diet. With little evidence of the benefits of such a restrictive diet, it is clear that people who follow this restrictive diet are potentially putting their health at serious risk. Supplementation with foods that provide the missing nutrients may help, but may be rejected by some with orthodox views on fruitarianism.  Before changing a diet, especially if the change is going to be extreme, it is always wise to speak to your doctor first.  Incorporating more fruit and vegetables as part of a balanced diet is a far safer, healthier way to approach fruit consumption.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/vending-machines-covid-19-art-self-test-kits-health-risk-warning-alert-2185486,100 vending machines to be set up for collection of COVID-19 self-test kits,"SINGAPORE: People who received a COVID-19 health risk warning or health risk alert via SMS will be able to collect antigen rapid test (ART) kits at 100 vending machines across Singapore from Saturday (Sep 18). The test kits will be available for collection round the clock at 56 locations at housing estates islandwide, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Friday. A health risk warning is issued to people who were identified as close contacts of a COVID-19 case. They are required by law to get a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at selected clinics and self isolate until they receive a negative result.  They must also swab themselves using the ART self-test kits on the third, fifth and seventh day from the date of last exposure to the COVID-19 case they were close contacts with. Another PCR test at a clinic is required on or after the eighth day. If all these are complied with, their health risk warning period will end on the 10th day of exposure. The cost of all swab tests will be borne by the Government, said the Health Ministry.  A health risk alert, on the other hand, is issued to people whose SafeEntry records overlap with that of a COVID-19 case. Considered to be at lower risk compared to people issued with a health risk warning, they are required to conduct ART tests on the third and fifth day from the last date of exposure. From Sep 18, individuals who received the SMS can scan their IDs to collect a pack of three ART self-test kits at a vending machine and use them for the required tests, said MOH. The full list of collection points and the steps for collection of the ART self-test kits are available at gowhere.gov.sg/art. People who have received health risk warnings have been “extremely cooperative”, with “well over” 90 per cent of them taking the necessary tests and isolating, which is “very encouraging”, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung on Friday.  “I think right now, nothing beats our own personal responsibility. I think we continue to count on that as we plan the curve and ride through this wave.”  Singapore's vaccination rate has prevented many cases of severe illness, said Mr Ong.  He stressed, however, that vaccination alone will not allow Singapore to live with COVID-19, noting other factors like treatment, mask-wearing and testing regimes.  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/indonesia-jakarta-air-pollution-appeal-verdict-2184861,Indonesian environment ministry to appeal air pollution verdict,"JAKARTA: Indonesia's environment ministry said on Friday (Sep 17) it would appeal a Jakarta court ruling that found President Joko Widodo, several ministries and top local officials guilty of environmental negligence over chronic air pollution. Ruling on a citizen lawsuit on Thursday, judges found senior officials were culpable in failing to prevent, monitor and control unhealthy pollution levels in and around the capital. Jakarta and its surrounds, a sprawling metropolis of more than 30 million people, is Southeast Asia's most polluted city, according to a 2020 report by air quality monitor IQAir Dasrul Chaniago, the environment ministry's director for air pollution management, confirmed to Reuters an appeal would be made against the decision. He said the court ordered the ministry to monitor air quality and emissions, actions that he said had been undertaken since 2011 in Jakarta and other cities such as Banten and Bandung. Fadjroel Rahman, a spokesman for the president, said his office would defer to the environment ministry on whether to appeal. The health and home affairs ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for the 32 plaintiffs had argued that authorities had failed to protect citizens, pointing to scientific research that air pollution could cause asthma and heart disease and lower life expectancy. Rapid urbanisation and chronic congestion in Jakarta, plus nearby coal-fired power plants, have contributed to the poor air quality, according to the Center on Energy and Clean Air. The verdict was welcomed by Jakarta authorities. ""We understand the lawsuit is part of citizens' rights to a healthy environment and part of collaborative action to work together for better air quality,"" said Irvan Pulungan, climate change adviser to Governor Anies Baswedan. ""We honour the verdict and will continue working on our efforts and working with the plaintiff and all stakeholders."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/best-dna-test-kits-singapore-genetic-testing-2160876,"How a saliva swab test can help you detect diet fails, disease risk and more","It’s a story you may already be familiar with – the time actress and filmmaker Angelina Jolie opted to have her breasts, fallopian tubes and ovaries surgically removed, after a genetic test revealed that she had a high risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Her mother died from breast and ovarian cancer at the age of 56, and her grandmother and aunt lost their lives to breast cancer.  “I wanted to write this to tell other women that the decision to have a mastectomy was not easy. But it is one I am very happy that I made,” she said in an opinion piece for The New York Times in 2013. “I can tell my children that they don’t need to fear they will lose me to breast cancer.” This bold yet extreme move led to a growing demand among women for genetic tests, in what’s now called the Angelina Effect. A 2016 Harvard Medical School study found that there was a 64 per cent spike in genetic testing for breast cancer in the two weeks after Jolie’s public testimony. While Jolie had hers done through a blood sample, these days, a DNA test can be easily done at home via a simple saliva (or a cheek) swab.  Knowing your DNA profile gives you the knowledge to make better health and life choices, said Dr Wong Mun Yew, Founder and Managing Director of Imagene Labs, a Singapore genetic analysis platform that started in 2016. Such tests can give you a variety of insights, from your ancestry to detecting your risk of cancer and heart disease, and even how your skin is likely to age. It can also tell you what your tolerance for fat, salt and alcohol in your diet is, as well as reveal your body’s response to certain drugs and medications, and exercise.  “You might find that taking multivitamins may overload you with certain vitamins that you do not need or cannot metabolise well,” Dr Wong said. “Or that running several kilometres may not be the most effective exercise for your body and health goals, as compared to a lower intensity sport.” DNA TESTING IS FOR EVERYONE  One of the reasons genetic testing appeals to people is it allows them to have more control over their health.  DNA testing is not meant to diagnose or treat certain diseases. It’s simply a screening option you might put on your radar, especially if you are looking for ways to improve your health and lifestyle, and identify potential future health risks.  Being equipped with that knowledge allows you to make appropriate lifestyle changes to reduce certain risks, including eating better (or differently), adding the right supplements to your diet, and so on.  There isn’t a specific age limit to taking a DNA test, said Dr Wong, but the sooner the better since it’ll allow for earlier intervention.  A post shared by Ori by Imagene Labs (@ori.dna) You can run DNA tests for your children, too. Ori, developed by Imagene Labs, offers focused test kits for kids, to give parents insights into a child’s genetic tendencies for traits such as empathy and sociability, as well as potential musical or sporting talent.   You only need to do a DNA test once in your life, as your genes will never change, said Anna Melman, co-founder of Anake, which claims to be Singapore’s first DNA-based skincare experience. According to its website, the DNA report, which focuses on your skin, allows you to determine the best course of action to combat any unfavourable genetic outcomes. Combating an unfavourable genetic outcome was 28-year-old Fita Paulin's reason for taking a DNA test this year. The marketing specialist in the biotechnology industry wanted to find out about her risk of developing cardiovascular disease, after her father suffered a heart attack earlier this year and needed urgent coronary bypass surgery to clear his blocked arteries. She turned to CircleDNA for a cheek swab, which costs S$899 for a Premium DNA Test from the Hong Kong-based genetic testing provider. “I didn’t want to look back and regret why I did not do anything about a (possible diagnosis of heart disease) or others,” shared Paulin. According to the CircleDNA website, a gene is like a book and you need to read the whole book to know the story of that gene. That’s how DNA samples are processed in the lab – the company claims to use the “most advanced technology” to attain a 99.9 per cent accuracy in detecting your health risks.   The test did indeed detect that Paulin had a risk of developing cardiovascular disease, and she also found that she had an “elevated risk” for intestinal ulcers.  THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF DNA TESTS In addition to CircleDNA, Imagene Labs’ OriLIFE+ Package (S$370) test kit, launched in January 2017, gives 55 insights into your “genetic tendencies”, such as sensitivities to caffeine and salt; mineral deficiencies such as iron, magnesium and calcium; and diet management issues such as glucose balance and the effect of eating a Mediterranean diet.  “Singapore women can understand their genetic predisposition in preventive health traits including potential for certain vitamin deficiencies like Vitamin D, folate and iron, which are essential for health, especially in pregnancy,” said Dr Wong of Imagene Labs.  In addition, you can also find ONI Global's DNA test kit at supplements retailer GNC Singapore, which has sold the brand's DNA-Me test kit (S$350) in their stores and online since 2019. ENTERING THE BEAUTY MARKET  DNA testing has made its foray into the world of beauty and skin health as well.  In Singapore, Anake opened its Wisma Atria flagship store in 2020 to help people understand their skin, from firmness, to wrinkles and sun damage. A post shared by Anake (@anakeofficial) Another skin ageing issue that Singaporeans may want to find out about is free radical damage, Melman said, as it leads to accelerated ageing and increases the risk of developing chronic diseases. You can buy Anake’s DNA sampling kit (S$299) on their website, or visit the store if you prefer step-by-step guidance.  Ori, too, has a DNA test catered for skin and beauty (S$305) that gives you insights into issues such as antioxidant deficiency, premature collagen breakdown and skin dryness.  WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT FROM A DNA TEST DNA testing works in a similar way as other self-test home sampling kits and telehealth services: It involves you doing a saliva swab at home and having that collected by the lab for analysis.   In the case of Anake, your sample will be delivered to Australia, where their partner SkinDNA, a biotechnology company, is located. The results of your genetic analysis takes about two weeks. A post shared by Anake (@anakeofficial) Depending on the providers, you will receive your reports a couple of days or weeks later. For instance, test kits by CircleDNA allow you to easily access your reports in a mobile app or to download them in a PDF format for easier reference. A post shared by CircleDNA (@circledna) Recalling her experience to CNA Women, Paulin said she was able to access her results in 18 days. After which, she got two calls from different experts based in Hong Kong: The first was a genetic consultation that looked at the risk of illness in your unborn children (if you are planning for kids) and possible treatment plans. The second call focused on nutrition where she was advised to adopt a Mediterranean diet and reduce her carbohydrate intake to reduce the risk of heart disease. Some of these brands, including Ori and Anake, will also suggest follow-up products you may want to use.  For example, Anake recommends their 24K Cocoage Lifting treatment to increase skin elasticity and combat premature ageing. And if you buy a test kit from Ori, it comes with a one-month supply of customised supplements or skin serums tailored to your DNA results. While most personal consultations happen through a call, Anake has a different consultation process. After you receive your DNA skin analysis report, you can head down to their store for a more detailed analysis by a beauty expert.  During the consultation, your skin will be analysed using UV spectrum imaging technology and artificial intelligence to detect skin conditions based on 15 genetic markers, including UV repair, wrinkle factor and pollution. Based on your consultation, and along with the DNA report, you will receive advice on suitable treatments and skincare products specific to your needs. Post-consultation, you can either repeat certain customised orders – or walk away knowing that some minerals or vitamins, for example, may (or may not) work for you.  CNA Women is a section on CNA Lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/vaginal-laxity-causes-treatment-pregnancy-childbirth-2130616,Feeling 'loose' after childbirth? The truth about postpartum vaginal laxity,"If you’ve been experiencing urine leaks and unsatisfactory sex, and getting the feeling that you’ve become somewhat lax ""down there"" after giving birth, you may be suffering from post-pregnancy vaginal laxity. Vaginal laxity or vaginal relaxation syndrome occurs when the vagina loses moisture and elasticity – a condition that is aggravated by childbirth and hormonal changes, according to Orchard Clinic, which specialises in postpartum recovery. Co-founder Cheryl Han said hundreds of women visit Orchard Clinic each month with conditions such as urinary incontinence and dissatisfaction with intimacy, with the root cause being vaginal laxity. How is vaginal laxity treated? First it needs to be determined, experts said. “When women come to me saying ‘oh I’ve just had a baby and now I have laxity in my vagina’, I ask, ‘do you really?’,” said Laura O’Byrne, a specialist senior physiotherapist and co-founder at Health2U. “Because the first thing we need to address is, what is your vagina? Most women refer to everything down there as their vagina when actually that’s not the case,” she added. “Many women will tell you they don’t know what their vulva looks like because they’ve never really properly looked. It’s a part of them they never really see. We should be encouraging a healthy form of self-examination.” A post shared by Pre/Postnatal Health Experts (@health2mama) To prove her point, during a Zoom call with CNA Women, O’Byrne took out a model of a woman’s anatomy and pointed out the parts that typically cause problems for a woman after childbirth. The first is the vulva, the outer part of a female’s genitals – what O’Byrne described as “everything on the outside”. The vagina, she said, is a tube inside the body that connects the vulva to the uterus. All these organs are contained in the pelvic area and are supported by muscles that sit on the pelvic floor. Another way is to look at the vagina as “simply a column, a canal”, said Dr Jessherin Sidhu, a general practitioner who specialises in women’s sexual health. “That canal is supported by structures around it, like the scaffolding that holds up a building. That scaffolding is the pelvic floor.” WHAT IS VAGINAL LAXITY? For postpartum women, the walls of the vagina may become lax due to the trauma that pregnancy places on the pelvic floor or the excessive stretching of vaginal tissue through vaginal birth, said Orchard Clinic’s Han. Women who have never given birth may also experience vaginal laxity.  Post-menopausal women may suffer from vaginal laxity due to hormonal changes associated with ageing, said Han. Even younger women may experience vaginal laxity if they have a weak pelvic floor.  “You can have pelvic floor issues at any stage. You can have it not after having a baby, you have it at a young age, at an old age … You can have pelvic floor issues as a man as well. There’s no discrimination here,” said O’Byrne. “Changes in the pelvic floor can cause appreciation of laxity. As the support structures start to wear away, that column feels like it’s not held up properly, not closed in properly,” said Dr Sidhu, who runs InSync Medical clinic. Vaginal laxity typically causes problems such as urinary incontinence and unsatisfactory sex, which may manifest as a loss of sensation during intercourse or painful penetration due to dryness, experts said. “Normally when women come through it starts with dissatisfaction with penetration,” said Dr Sidhu. “We often hear this classic statement: ‘I feel very loose, like I can’t tighten. Whenever I have intercourse, I feel like I have to purposely grip around my husband’s penis.’” Others may complain of urine leakage whenever they laugh or cough, or when they are engaged in high-impact activities such as jogging, she added. “Sometimes they’ll tell me it’s dry when they’re walking, like tissues are rubbing against each other,” said Dr Sidhu. According to Dr Sidhu, sometimes women don’t complain about a direct symptom of laxity, but an indirect one such as frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs). “When you’re perpetually dry, you’ve lost this defence barrier … And dry tissues allow bugs to get in quicker, thus increasing the risk of infections. “Typically, when women are getting more UTIs and you probe further, they might tell you they’re not satisfied with penetration too. Often dryness can be painful so they don’t even commit to a full penetration. And if penetration can happen painlessly, they’ve lost sensation,” she said. It is worth noting that postpartum problems share common symptoms and so, what you may think is vaginal laxity could easily be something else. A good rule of thumb is that a simple problem of vaginal laxity “should only present certain inconveniences such as irritation or abrasion” when you’re going about your day-to-day activities or even during sex, said Orchard Clinic’s Han. WHEN IS IT NOT VAGINAL LAXITY?  If your concern is how lax or saggy it looks around your vaginal opening, the problem you’re looking to solve may not be vaginal laxity, but laxity of the labia, which comprises the folds of skin (or lips) on your vulva. “Typically, when women come to me after giving birth, they think it’s the vagina they’re concerned about, but it’s actually the vulva that has changed,” said O’Byrne, who was formerly a physiotherapist with Jurong Health. “If you look down and your labia is stretched out, then it’s a labia laxity issue,” she added. O’Byrne classifies labia laxity as an aesthetic issue – something that physiotherapists typically do not deal with. Women who have this concern may seek the help of plastic surgeons specialising in procedures such as labiaplasty. If you’re feeling a sense of heaviness or pressure internally, it could be the sign of a prolapse, said Han. A prolapse occurs when the pelvic floor is so weakened, often due to the strain of vaginal birth, that it can no longer support internal organs such as the bladder or the uterus. These may then slip out of their normal position and cause persistent discomfort. In severe cases, they may protrude into the vagina and even slip out the vulva.  DIAGNOSING THE CONDITION Experts shared that for women who suspect they may have vaginal laxity, it is best to see a pelvic floor physiotherapist or a women’s health specialist. “You wouldn’t go to a pelvic floor physiotherapist if you were giving birth to a baby, so don’t go to a gynaecologist to rehab your pelvic floor – that’s not what their specialty is,” said O’Byrne. If you do consult a gynaecologist, chances are you will be referred to a physiotherapist for rehab. “Hospitals like KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital do have a department of women’s health physiotherapists … They’re not your regular physiotherapists, focusing on sports medicine. They really focus entirely on pelvic floor muscles. It’s a sub-specialty,” said Dr Sidhu. A post shared by Pre/Postnatal Health Experts (@health2mama) A consultation with a specialist GP or physiotherapist will typically begin with questions about a client’s lifestyle: The conversation may then move towards those pertaining to bodily functions: There may also be physical examinations. Dr Sidhu said she would first conduct an external check, and not exclusively to the lower region. “We look for elements of things like dryness elsewhere because women with menopause will complain of irritability and dryness in other areas. When we do focus on (the lower) area of the body, we look for dryness in the vulva,” she said. “We also look for shrinkage of tissues. Sometimes, that area in a younger person is supposed to look very supple – there are nice folds and ridges here and there – and there’s a level of hydration. “But when you look at someone who’s suffered tissue ageing in the vulva, you see that the tissues are really quite dry in appearance. They might have red dots there and they might not have the elasticity,” she added. An internal check might involve a speculum, a tool also used in Pap smears. “Again, on the inside, you might see similar things like a loss of these nice little folds. They seem more flattened out, the tissues are thicker and there’s a lack of hydration. You’re not looking for how much liquid there is in the canal – that’s not hydration. Hydration is what the tissues look like, the walls,” Dr Sidhu added. Doctors may also use modalities like ultrasound scans to gauge the strength of a patient’s pelvic floor. “When you breathe in, the dynamics of your muscles change – your diaphragm moves up and down. At different times of your breathing, they look at how this ring of muscles around your vagina moves. “Sometimes you see a lack of movement in this ring and you may go ‘ah, the muscles there are a little weak – they’re not moving and contracting the way they should’. From here you can deduce that the muscles are weak or very tight,” she said. WHAT CAN BE DONE? “Unfortunately, for a long time we’ve just told women ‘oh, you’ve had a baby, it’s normal to leak’. That’s not the case at all. We should not be saying ‘oh it’s normal, you’re okay’. We should be saying ‘no, we need to address that’. There’s lots of things we can do about (your condition), we can address it appropriately,” she said. “A good and strong pelvic floor is something we should all have.” Physiotherapists like O’Byrne will typically recommend a rehabilitation programme. “In France, after giving birth, women expect to see a pelvic floor therapist 10 times. As far as they are concerned, we need to rehab and fix everything that just went through all the trauma of giving birth. It’s a full contact sport - no one comes out unscathed,” she said. Through a rehabilitation programme overseen by a physiotherapist, a woman can correctly understand her anatomy, identify the cause of the laxity and obtain guidance in restoring the functions related to the condition, O’Byrne explained. If a patient is diagnosed with weak pelvic muscles, a therapist may recommend kegel exercises. The pelvic muscle-strengthening exercise popularised by American gynaecologist Arnold Kegel must be properly prescribed and taught. “When you tell someone to do 300 kegels, first of all, some women don’t know what that is. Also, telling someone to just go and do 300 kegels is a waste of the person’s life. You need to make treatment specific to the person. “For example, you need to first check that her muscles are weak and not overactive. Because if they are overactive, she should stop doing pelvic floor squeezes and instead relax them down first,” said O’Byrne. Relaxing an overactive pelvic floor involves “down training”, a muscle relaxation method that may include diaphragmatic breathing and body scanning. “This is where we get the muscles to ‘learn to relax and let go’,” said O’Byrne. “It’s usually more challenging than strengthening someone up as it’s usually easier to learn to contract a muscle than it is to relax it.” So how long does it take before you get results from rehab? O’Byrne said it depends on the severity of your issues. “With some women it can be as simple as one or two sessions for a straightforward issue like minor pelvic floor weakness, which can be corrected with exercise. With more complex cases such as fourth-degree tears and pain, there is usually some improvement after a few sessions but it can take a few months to see significant change,” she said. A pelvic floor assessment with a physiotherapist costs around S$190 at the Health2U clinic, and clients typically come for a session once a week or every two weeks, said O’Byrne. A rehab package, which includes five face-to-face consultations and access to the clinic's eight-week online programme comprising workout videos and a private Facebook group, can set you back around S$650. Many clinics, such as Orchard Clinic, supplement muscle rehabilitation with electromagnetic or radiofrequency therapy. “Radiofrequency works to tighten the inner walls of the vaginal canal and improve skin texture of the labia or outer lips of the vagina, while electromagnetic therapy works to strengthen the pelvic floor,” said Han, adding that such treatments can range between S$300 and S$1,200. A post shared by Orchard Clinic (@orchard.clinic) One treatment uses what is called the Emsella HIFEM technology to relieve issues such as urinary incontinence caused by weak pelvic floor muscles. Patients sit in a chair during the session and it harnesses electromagnetic energy to simulate thousands of muscle contractions, hence ""re-educating the muscles and creating greater muscle memory"", according to the clinic. About 70 per cent of Orchard Clinic’s clients see positive results by the first month and 90 per cent experience results by the sixth, said Han. Positive results include increased vaginal tightening, improved urinary incontinence and intimate satisfaction. A post shared by Insync Medical (@insyncmedical.sg) InSync Medical’s laser therapy treatment, FemiLift, involves a probe being inserted into the vaginal canal and made to spin around. The vapouriser inflicts “micro injuries” on the vaginal wall, signalling to the body that it needs to heal the tissue that has been scarred, said Dr Sidhu. “When you ablate tissues like that, you’re giving your body an accelerated signal, telling it to go and heal the tissue properly. You force healing on that part of the vagina that otherwise would not happen,” she said. FemiLift is also said to promote collagen production, which in turn boosts hydration in the vaginal walls and leads to tightening of the canal. This helps to solve a host of postpartum issues including dryness, recurrent infection, urinary incontinence and “looseness”. Laser therapy is, however, still an invasive procedure, but Dr Sidhu assured it is “quite safe in the right hands”. “Heat therapy forces and promotes tissue growth and tissue healing, so we’re accelerating that process by applying controlled micro injury to that area of the vagina. This is something that’s been done on the face all the time. “What you need is a professional that knows about the settings and which modalities to use on you … As it is a minimally invasive procedure, there is a small amount of risk. And how do you know that the risk is appropriate for you? Find a physician trained in this department, someone who has used lasers a lot,” she said. FemiLift takes 10 minutes per session, with InSync Medical requiring clients to attend at least three sessions a month. A package of three sessions as well as a follow-up session 12 months after the procedure costs S$4,500.

Singapore tracks the number and causes of all deaths every year, and month-to-month fluctuations in the number of deaths have been observed over the years, said MOH in response to CNA's queries.  According to statistics from the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA), there were 11,391 deaths from January to June this year.  There were 1,868 deaths and 1,763 deaths in January and February this year respectively, according to ICA’s quarterly bulletins.  March, April, May and June saw the number of deaths go above the 1,900 mark, with the highest at 1,972 deaths in May.  In total, there were 11,292 deaths in the same period - January to June - in 2020, and 10,582 deaths in the same period in 2019.  There were “similar spikes” in 2017, with 1,902 deaths in May and 1,925 deaths in June that year, the Health Ministry said in a statement.  “As our population is also ageing, the total number of deaths will continue to drift upwards over the years,” it said. “However, after removing the ageing effect, the age-standardised death rates have remained stable over the last five years.”  According to the Singapore Department of Statistics, the age-standardised death rate is defined as the number of deaths in a given age group, per 1,000 population in the same age group. ""In fact, there was a slight decrease in 2020 and 2021, the years where we were hit by COVID-19,"" added MOH. Earlier this month, the ministry responded to claims from Facebook user Iris Koh, who claimed to know people who died after they took the COVID-19 vaccine.  In her post, she had said ""someone from hardware zone"" had created a set of statistics showing the current death rates in Singapore. She called on authorities to ""explain"" the ""sudden spike in death numbers"". The ministry said on Sep 4 that it was not in the interest of MOH or the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) to hide adverse events arising from COVID-19 vaccinations. ""As a responsible healthcare regulatory authority, it is imperative to assess whether all reported (adverse events) or deaths are linked to vaccination since the vaccines are still only provisionally approved by HSA,"" said MOH at the time.  ""That said, to date, there have not been any deaths found to be directly linked to vaccination. There have been deaths that were due to concurrent medical conditions unrelated to vaccination."" The ministry added that when a death occurs, it will defer to the coroner, who adjudicates and determines the cause of death. "

But caffeine is also a drug, which means that it can affect each of us differently, depending on our consumption habits and our genes. “The paradox of caffeine is that in the short term, it helps with attention and alertness. It helps with some cognitive tasks, and it helps with energy levels,” said Mark Stein, a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Sciences at the University of Washington, who has studied the impact of caffeine on people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  “But the cumulative effect – or the long-term impact – has the opposite effect.” THE CAFFEINE PARADOX Part of the paradoxical effects of caffeine results from its effects on what researchers refer to as “sleep pressure”, which fuels how sleepy we become as the day wears on. From the moment we wake up, our bodies have a biological clock that drives us to go back to sleep later in the day. Seth Blackshaw, a neuroscientist at Johns Hopkins University who studies sleep, said that researchers are still learning about how sleep pressure builds up in the body, but that over the course of the day, our cells and tissues use and burn energy in the form of a molecule called adenosine triphosphate, or ATP.  As that ATP gets expended – as we think, exercise, run errands or sit on conference calls – our cells generate a chemical called adenosine as a byproduct. That adenosine goes on to bind to receptors in the brain, making us more sleepy. Chemically, caffeine looks similar enough to adenosine on the molecular level that it occupies those binding sites, preventing adenosine from binding to those brain receptors.  As a result, caffeine works to temporarily suppress sleep pressure, making us feel more awake. Meanwhile, adenosine continues to build up in the body. WHEN THE SLEEP PRESSURE BUILDS UP “Once caffeine wears off, you get a very high level of sleep pressure, and you have to pay it back,” Dr Blackshaw said. In fact, the only way to relieve and reset an elevated level of sleep pressure is with sleep. Compounding the issue is that the more we drink caffeine, the more we build up our body’s tolerance to it.  Our liver adapts by making proteins that break down caffeine faster, and the adenosine receptors in our brain multiply, so that they can continue to be sensitive to adenosine levels to regulate our sleep cycle. Ultimately, continued or increased caffeine consumption negatively affects sleep, which will also make us feel more tired, said Dr Stein. “If you’re sleeping less and you’re stressed, and you rely on caffeine to improve it, it’s just a perfect storm for a short-term solution that’s going to make things much worse in the long term,” he said. “You’re going to be adding more shots to your espresso, but the negative impact on your sleep is going to continue, and that is cumulative.” Caffeine may also cause spikes in blood sugar or lead to dehydration – both of which can make us feel more tired, said Christina Pierpaoli Parker, a clinical researcher studying sleep at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. DEALING WITH THAT COFFEE SLUMP If you’re feeling an afternoon slump even after a cup of coffee, the solution may be to consume less of it, scientists say.  Don’t drink it every day, or go cold turkey for a few days so that your body can clear any caffeine in your system, and then gradually add it back to your routine. Ideally, drinking coffee “should be fun and useful, and really give you a boost when you need it,” Dr. Blackshaw said. In the meantime, if you feel like caffeine is no longer giving you an energy spurt, experts recommend taking a nap, getting some exercise or sitting outside and getting some exposure to natural light, which can add a boost of energy – naturally. “Monitor your sleep and make sure you’re sleeping well,” Dr. Stein said. “Adequate sleep and physical activity are the first-line interventions for attention problems and sleepiness. Caffeine is a useful adjunct, but you don’t want to become dependent on it.” By Wudan Yan © The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times.  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/best-tips-insomnia-sleeping-disorders-2166056,Often wide awake at 3am? Helpful tips to get back to sleep,"Most sleep experts offer standard advice to people who occasionally wake up at 3am and can’t fall back to sleep after 20 minutes or so: Ignore the clock, get out of bed and do a calming activity. Then, return to bed when you start to feel sleepy again. As rates of insomnia skyrocketed this past year during the pandemic, many people struggled to overcome their sleepless nights. Our readers were no exception. We spoke to many of them to find out what techniques work for them when they find themselves awake in the middle of the night. Here’s what they had to say. COUNT SHEEP … OR WHATEVER When Maria De Angelo, a teacher in Los Angeles who also renovates houses, has trouble getting back to sleep at 3am, she closes her eyes and thinks of a complicated electrical wiring scheme in a kitchen she once renovated. The mental exercise induces boredom, much like counting sheep, which helps her drift back to sleep. On other nights, to mix things up, De Angelo shuts her eyes and recites the names of every state in America in alphabetical order. “I haven’t yet made it past ‘N,’” she said. “Either method – or both – will work 95 per cent of the time.” TAKE A TRIP Jerry Schulz in Milwaukee developed a ritual of his own to overcome insomnia. When he has trouble falling back to sleep late at night, he takes a mental journey to another city. To make himself sleepy, he thinks about the trip in painstaking detail. He visualises himself packing his luggage, walking down his steps, loading his car, pulling out of his driveway and driving along familiar highways to get to Seattle, Portland or San Francisco. “Part of the trick is you want to make an itinerary that is going to take awhile to play out,” he said. “But oddly, to make this work, you don’t actually want to get to your final destination – you want to fall asleep along the way. This is the one time when falling asleep at the wheel is a good thing.” CONSIDER UNDERLYING MEDICAL CAUSES For most people, occasional bouts of insomnia are normal. But when sleeplessness occurs at least three nights a week for three months or longer, sleep experts refer to it as chronic insomnia. When that happens, it might help to see a sleep doctor to find out if you have an underlying health issue. Some people experience insomnia because of medical conditions like sleep apnea, which causes intermittent pauses in breathing throughout the night. Others have restless legs syndrome, which causes an irresistible urge to move the limbs. Many women going through menopause have difficulty sleeping because of hot flashes, night sweats and hormonal fluctuations. A sleep doctor can help to diagnose these and other issues and provide medical treatments, medications or psychological interventions like cognitive behavioural therapy. A number of people who were plagued by insomnia told us that their sleep only improved after they discovered they had an underlying condition. Among them was Julie Zuckman in Massachusetts, who for years would wake up at 3am multiple nights a week and struggle to fall back to sleep. Then she went to a sleep doctor and learned she had moderate sleep apnea, which she now treats with a CPAP machine that improves her breathing while she sleeps. Zuckman now gets roughly six to eight hours of uninterrupted sleep most nights. “As a side benefit for my husband, I also no longer snore,” she said. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine maintains a directory of sleep centers on its website, which can help you find a local clinic if you suspect you have a sleep disorder. TAME THE ANXIETY For many people who wrestle with occasional insomnia, the cause of their sleep woes is often psychological: They wake up at night and their minds start racing. They look at the clock and worry that they won’t fall back to sleep. Or they start thinking about work, relationships, their finances or other things that cause them anxiety. This activates the body’s fight-or-flight response, causing a surge of adrenaline that prevents them from becoming relaxed enough to fall back to sleep. Not surprisingly, the strategies people use to quash their insomnia often work by shifting their attention from stressful thoughts to pleasant ones. Hilary Collins in Philadelphia told us that she alleviates her insomnia by reminiscing about her childhood, which focuses her mind on soothing memories. “In my mind, I take a tour of my childhood home and I quickly fall asleep,” she said. Others told us they conjure up similarly nostalgic memories: They picture themselves in a former school or library they used to frequent and visualise small details such as the wallpaper, a stack of books or a collection of framed photographs. If you find yourself routinely kept awake by anxiety, one potential solution is cognitive behavioural therapy, a form of treatment that helps address the underlying thoughts and behaviours that can cause insomnia. Any sleep clinic can connect you to a cognitive behavioural therapist. You can also download a free app developed by the federal government, called CBT-i Coach, that will teach you psychological strategies to alleviate your insomnia. “Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia helped me immensely,” said a reader named Matteo in Chicago. LULL YOURSELF TO SLEEP Others told us that they make themselves sleepy by listening to audiobooks, Gregorian chants, BBC Radio, sleep apps like Calm, or the tranquil, underwater sounds of whales. “Whales talking at low volume seems to do the trick for me,” one reader told us. Another said he prefers classical music. “If I lay awake, at least I get a little taste of culture,” he said. You can also try breathing exercises to help you get relaxed. One popular exercise is the 3-4-5 technique. It involves breathing in for three seconds, holding your breath for four seconds, and then slowly exhaling to the count of five. Another suggestion: Make sure your bedroom isn’t too warm. Keeping your space fairly cool, ideally between 60 and 68 degrees Fahrenheit, can promote better sleep. BORE YOURSELF TO SLEEP For some of our readers, the most effective sleep aid at 3am is a boring book or pleasant sound. Several told us that these distractions stop them from thinking about the state of the world and getting agitated. Karen Sandness in Minneapolis said that anytime she wakes up in the middle of the night she grabs a nonfiction book, “preferably a difficult and detailed one.” With the right book, she said, “there’s none of the ‘I can’t wait to see what happens next’ problem. The book will fall out of my hands and onto my face after a couple of pages.” DON’T ALWAYS LISTEN TO SLEEP EXPERTS A few of the methods we heard about might raise some eyebrows among sleep experts. Susan L Paul, a retired nurse in Asheville, NC, told us that when she finds herself awake in the middle of the night, she brings her laptop into bed and watches the “Great British Baking Show” on Netflix. Sleep doctors typically urge people not to use computer screens in bed because they emit sleep-disrupting blue light. But Paul likes to bake, and she finds that watching her favourite baking show has a calming effect that quickly sends her back to sleep. “It helps if you have seen it all at least a few times and remember the bakers as old friends,” she said. “It’s very relaxing, and I’m usually asleep again before the dough has a chance to rise a second time.” THE BISCUIT CURE Food is something that many people told us they rely on. Juliet Jones in Memphis said that over the years she has tried various strategies to combat her occasional insomnia. She has counted sheep, taken melatonin, listened to calming music and used pleasant scents like lavender oil. But the only thing that seems to work for her is getting out of bed, going down to her kitchen and having a small glass of warm milk with a digestive biscuit, which she learned about as a child growing up in Britain. Jones speculated that it works for her because she eats early dinners and tends to get hungry at night. Indeed, studies have shown that certain foods can affect how you sleep, including carbohydrates, which tend to help people fall asleep faster. “A little something bland in the stomach seems to do the trick,” she said. “This is what my father used to do, and now at age 70 so do I.” IS YOUR NIGHTCAP THE CAUSE OF YOUR INSOMNIA? In the food and drink department, a number of readers who grappled with insomnia told us that their sleep rapidly improved after they quit drinking alcohol. If you drink most nights of the week, it could be undermining your sleep. A nightcap or two might help you fall asleep faster. But it can also lead to more late-night awakenings. If you tend to drink in the evenings, try cutting back on alcohol for three to five days to see if it has an impact on the quality of your sleep. “For years I would wake up in the middle of the night and stay awake for at least an hour, usually more,” said Brett Loomis in North Carolina. “Then I finally quit drinking all alcohol. It was the cause of my problem and I sleep much better now. So, if you’re reluctant to give up alcohol as I was, just try it for three days and see if it makes a difference. You might be surprised.” By Anahad O’Connor © The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times.  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/vision-loss-glasses-brain-health-study-2163266,How correcting poor vision can maintain a healthy brain,"Medical practice tends to divide its clients – you and me – into specialties defined by body parts: ophthalmology, neurology, gastroenterology, psychiatry and the like. But in fact, the human body doesn’t function in silos. Rather, it works as an integrated whole, and what goes awry in one part of the body can affect several others. I’ve written about the potential harm of hearing loss to brain health, as well as to the health of our bones, hearts and emotional well-being. Untreated hearing loss can increase the risk of dementia. Even those with slightly less than perfect hearing can have measurable cognitive deficits. Now, a growing body of research is demonstrating that vision loss can affect the brain’s function, too. As with hearing, if the brain has to work extra hard to make sense of what our eyes see, it can take a toll on cognitive function. The latest study, published in JAMA Network Open in July, followed 1,202 men and women aged 60 to 94 for an average of nearly seven years. All were part of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Ageing, and had vision and cognition tests every one to four years between 2003 and 2019. The researchers found that those who scored poorly on initial tests of visual acuity – how well, for example, they could see the letters on an eye chart from a given distance – were more likely to have cognitive decline over time, including deficits in language, memory, attention and the ability to identify and locate objects in space. Other vision issues, like with depth perception and the ability to see contrasts, also had deleterious effects on cognitive ability. The lead researcher, Bonnielin Swenor, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute, said that the new study “adds to mounting longitudinal data showing that vision impairment can lead to cognitive decline in older adults”. CORRECTING POOR VISION IS GOOD FOR THE BRAIN Lest you think that the relationship is reversed – that cognitive decline impairs vision – another study that Dr Swenor participated in showed that when both functions were considered, vision impairment was two times more likely to affect cognitive decline than the other way around. This study, published in 2018 in JAMA Ophthalmology and led by Diane Zheng from the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, included 2,520 community-dwelling adults aged 65 to 84, whose vision and cognitive function were periodically tested. She and her co-authors concluded that maintaining good vision as one ages may be an effective way to minimise the decline in cognitive function in older adults. “When people have vision loss, they change the way they live their lives. They decrease their physical activity and they decrease their social activity, both of which are so important for maintaining a healthy brain,” Dr Swenor said. “It puts them on a fast track to cognitive decline.” But identifying and correcting vision loss early on can help, Dr Zheng said. She suggested regular eye checkups – at least once every two years, and more often if you have diabetes, glaucoma or other conditions that may damage vision. “Make sure you can see well through your glasses,” she urged. WHEN GLASSES ALONE AREN’T ENOUGH There are “vision impairments that glasses won’t fix,” Dr Swenor said, like age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma. Retinal disease began to compromise Dr Swenor’s vision in her mid-20s. Those with problems like hers can benefit from something called low vision rehabilitation, a sort of physical therapy for the eyes that helps visually impaired people adapt to common situations and help them function better in society. Dr Swenor, for instance, can see objects in a high-contrast situation, like a black cat against a white fence, but has trouble seeing the difference between similar colours. She can’t pour white milk into a white mug without spilling it, for example. Her solution: Use a dark-coloured mug. Finding such accommodations is an ongoing task, but it enables her to continue to function well professionally and socially. Society, too, needs to help people with visual impairment function safely outside the home. Most things in hospitals are white, for example, which creates safety hazards for people with diminished contrast sensitivity. As a driver of 50 years, I’ve noticed that road barriers that used to be the same colour as the road surface are now more often rendered in high contrast colours like orange or yellow, which undoubtedly reduces crashes even for people who can see perfectly. “We need to create a more inclusive society that accommodates people with vision impairment,” Dr Swenor said. HOME IMPROVEMENTS MAY FOSTER BRAIN HEALTH People who have trouble with depth perception can also incorporate helpful design features into the home. Placing coloured strips on stair risers, varying textures of furniture and colour-coding objects can all improve the ability to navigate safely. People who can no longer read books may also listen to audiobooks, podcasts or music instead, Dr Swenor said. The link between visual impairment and cognitive impairment “is not a doomsday message,” she added. “There are many ways to foster brain health for people with vision loss.” Step one may be getting a Medicare extension bill through congress, which in turn might prompt private insurers to also cover vision care and rehabilitation. The Democrats’ current proposal to extend Medicare benefits to cover vision care would more than pay for itself in the long run by diminishing already-covered medical costs for cognitive and physical decline. Case in point: The cost of a single hip replacement resulting from a vision-impaired fall would exceed the cost of many hundreds of eye exams and needed vision corrections. By Jane E.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/sedentary-lifestyle-diabetes-metabolic-disorder-2166021,"Move for 3 minutes every half hour, to counter the ill effects of sitting","Sitting for hours at a desk can play havoc with our metabolic health, contributing over time to high blood sugar and high cholesterol, even in people who otherwise seem mostly healthy. But a practical though small new study shows that standing up and moving every 30 minutes for about three minutes may lessen the health impacts of over-sitting.  The study found that climbing several flights of stairs, bopping through some jumping jacks or squats, or even taking as few as 15 steps during these mini-breaks improved aspects of blood sugar control among office workers, without noticeably interrupting their work flow. But the study, which involved 16 middle-aged, white-collar workers at high risk for Type 2 diabetes, also indicates that these semi-hourly, three-minute breaks likely represent the minimum amount of movement needed to protect metabolic health.  While 15 steps twice an hour may be a good start, they should not be the only steps we take toward reducing how much we sit. THE CURSE OF NON-STOP SITTING For most of us, sitting is not just commonplace but constant. According to epidemiological studies, adults in the United States typically sit for about six and a half hours a day, with most of that time uninterrupted by standing or strolling.  This postural lassitude likely accelerated during the pandemic. Preliminary data suggests that many of us are more inactive now than in 2019, especially if we have children and jobs. Such relentless sitting squashes metabolic health. Or, as the new study’s authors write, “Every waking hour spent in sedentary postures (that is, sitting or lying) increases risk for metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes.”  Blame flaccid muscles.  When we sit, the muscles in our legs, which are the largest in our body and are usually active and hungry, barely contract, so, require minimal fuel and slurp little sugar from our bloodstreams.  They also do not release biochemical substances that would normally help break down fatty acids in the blood. So, when we hunch over our desks, blood sugar and cholesterol build up in our bloodstreams. STUDYING THE EFFECT OF SMALL MOVEMENT BREAKS Helpfully, frequent breaks from sitting improve blood sugar control and cholesterol levels, past studies show. But much of that research took place in university labs and lasted only a day or two, conditions that do not reflect real life. So, for the new study, which was published last month in The American Journal of Physiology: Endocrinology and Metabolism, an international consortium of scientists, led by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, decided to see what would happen if office workers agreed to break up their sitting time, over three weeks, in their normal workplace. They began by recruiting 16 middle-aged men and women in Stockholm with sedentary desk jobs and a history of obesity, putting them at high risk for metabolic problems like diabetes. They checked the volunteers’ current metabolic health and asked them to wear activity monitors for a week, to get baseline numbers. Then, half of the volunteers continued with their normal lives, as a control, and the rest downloaded a smartphone app that alerted them every 30 minutes during the workday to rise and be active for three minutes.  They ambled halls, strolled stairs, marched in place, squatted, hopped or otherwise moseyed about in whatever way they found convenient, tolerable and not overly distracting or amusing to their co-workers. But they had to take a minimum of 15 steps before the app recorded their movement as an activity break. The experiment continued for three weeks, after which everyone returned to the lab for another round of metabolic tests.  WHAT THE STUDY FOUND The researchers found that the two groups’ results subtly diverged. The control group displayed ongoing problems with insulin resistance, blood sugar control and cholesterol levels.  But the other volunteers, who had stood and moved while at work, showed lower fasting blood sugar levels in the morning, meaning their bodies better controlled blood sugar during the night, a potentially important indicator of metabolic health.  Their blood sugar also stabilised during the day, with fewer spikes and dips than in the control group, and the amount of beneficial HDL cholesterol in their bloodstreams rose.  These improvements were slight, but might mean the difference, over time, between progressing to full-blown Type 2 diabetes or not. Interestingly, the gains also ranged, depending on how often and how rigorously workers complied with their app alerts.  Those who rose regularly and were the most active – generally managing 75 steps or more during the three minutes – improved their metabolisms the most. Others, accumulating fewer steps, or frequently ignoring their beeping alerts, benefited less. But their metabolic health did improve somewhat, said Dr Erik Naslund, a professor at the Karolinska Institute who oversaw the new study.  WHAT THE RESULTS MEAN FOR YOU The findings suggest that aiming to get up twice an hour is worthwhile, even if we do not always succeed. He offered two pieces of advice to anyone concerned about over-sitting and their metabolic health. By Gretchen Reynolds © The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/lung-cancer-drug-amgen-sotorasib-2168016,Lung cancer patients in England to receive Amgen drug that targets a gene mutation,"LONDON: Lung cancer patients in England will become the first in Europe to receive a drug made by US biotech firm Amgen that targets a specific gene mutation, the country's health service said on Friday (Sep 10). NHS England said it was fast-tracking lung cancer drug sotorasib after it was shown in clinical trials to stop lung cancer progression for seven months. The drug, taken as a tablet, will be used on patients with the KRAS G12C mutation that occurs in about 13 per cent of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), the most common type of lung cancer. The early-access deal will see 600 patients a year receive sotorasib in England through the state-run National Health Service (NHS). ""This revolutionary treatment has taken decades of research to reach the clinic, and now that it is here this new targeted drug will be available for eligible people with lung cancer as quickly as possible thanks to this agreement,"" said Peter Johnson, NHS clinical director for cancer. Charles Swanton, chief clinician at charity Cancer Research UK, said the drug was ""one of the most exciting breakthroughs in lung cancer treatment in 20 years, targeting a cancer gene that was previously untargetable"". The use of sotorasib in Britain follows its accelerated approval in May in the United States for lung cancer patients with the KRAS G12C mutation whose disease has worsened after treatment with chemotherapy or other medicines. It is sold in the United States under the brand name Lumakras. Britain's medicine regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, has authorised the drug under a partnership with US and Australian counterparts designed to speed up approval for promising cancer treatments, called Orbis."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/covid-vaccine-immunity-infection-recovered-reinfection-delta-variant-2163336,Commentary: Waiting for COVID-19 infection to gain immunity just to skip vaccination makes little sense,"STOCKHOLM: Israel was way ahead of the rest of the world when it came to COVID-19 vaccination, so it is not surprising that data from this corner of the Mediterranean causes a lot of excitement. It is a glimpse into the future. Indeed, this happened recently when researchers at Maccabi Healthcare Services in Tel Aviv released a preprint, a study that is yet to be reviewed by other experts, suggesting people who had been infected with COVID-19 had greater protection than vaccinated people against becoming reinfected with the Delta variant.  Unfortunately, some took this to mean that getting COVID-19 is a better idea than getting vaccinated. First, the possibility that a COVID-19 infection leads to longer-lived immunity than vaccination is not far-fetched.  Infection exposes our immune system to several viral proteins, whereas the most commonly used COVID-19 vaccines introduce a single antigen, the spike protein. This results in a more directed but also a more restricted immune response than after infection. Although people who have had COVID-19 can get reinfected, naturally acquired immunity continues to evolve over time and antibodies remain detectable for longer than was first anticipated. New evidence suggests that immunity following both severe and mild infection protects against both symptomatic and asymptomatic reinfection. However, apart from the danger of drawing conclusions from data that other scientists have not yet reviewed, it is also crucial to put the data in the right context.  Although the study draws attention to the potency of naturally acquired immunity, it does not consider the risks involved in achieving natural immunity through infection. Nor does it cast a shadow on vaccine-generated immunity. In fact, the benefit of vaccination is not even addressed in the study since unvaccinated people without prior infection were not included for comparison.  The low rate of COVID-19-related hospitalisations among vaccinated participants, eight out of 16,000, would probably be strikingly lower than among non-vaccinated people without prior infection, but this group was not included in the analyses. A common reason to remain unvaccinated is the misconception that waiting for natural immunity by choosing infection over vaccination is an option. But infection-acquired immunity may come at a heavy cost. Indeed, apart from the overt risks of severe illness or death, several recent studies show that otherwise healthy people who have recovered from COVID-19 have a substantially increased risk of longer-term serious health problems, including myocarditis or inflammation of the heart muscle, blood clots and stroke, compared to vaccinated people.  And the most rigorous safety monitoring in United States history has shown that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. With cases surging globally and deaths driven by the Delta variant, waiting for infection - and risking long-term health problems, severe illness and death - to achieve immunity to the very same infection is as fruitless as it is dangerous. The Israeli preprint does, however, shed light on our increasing understanding of the potent immunity induced by getting the vaccine after having COVID-19, so-called hybrid immunity.  Several studies show a substantial boost in both antibody and T-cell responses to vaccine in people with previous COVID-19 infection.  A recent report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that people who had recovered from COVID-19 and were later vaccinated had half the risk of reinfection compared with unvaccinated people who had previously had COVID-19.  So it is still worth getting the vaccine, even if you have previously had COVID-19. The effective immune booster following the combination of natural immunity and a single subsequent vaccine jab also raises the question of whether one dose is enough for people who have had COVID-19. Several studies report that immune responses to a single dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca vaccine exceed those after two doses in people without prior infection. Several countries, such as France, Italy and Germany, therefore now recommend a single dose for people with a previous COVID-19 infection. And infection without vaccination is recognised as immunity for the current Israeli green pass rules. Although directing boosters to people who have not been infected may make the most of limited vaccine supplies, personalised schedules and exemptions from vaccine mandates may be logistically tricky in the midst of a pandemic. Antibody screening before vaccination is time-consuming and expensive, and it introduces practical challenges in identifying those who have or have not previously had COVID-19. These exemptions could slow vaccine rollout rather than speed it up. As unprecedented research efforts deliver knowledge about our immune responses to COVID-19 infection and vaccination on a daily basis, we must critically view the data together with all the facts that relate to it. We are far from bringing the pandemic to an end, and the potential risks of being infected are unquestionable.  Our priority should be to slow transmission and get vaccines to those who remain unvaccinated and need them the most. To avoid vaccination, waiting for infection and hoping for natural immunity makes little sense. Dr Charlotte Thalin is a researcher in immunology at the Karolinska Institute, Sweden.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/diabetes-limb-amputation-singapore-2132676,Why limb amputation is the dark side of diabetes many people don’t consider,"When it comes to diabetes, most people would know that managing the disease involves diet restrictions and insulin shots.  Not many, though, would think of something as drastic as limb amputation as being a part of the equation.  However, the grim procedure required to treat diabetes-related lower extremity complications or DRLEC is found to be high among Singaporeans, according to research by National University of Singapore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health (SSHSPH).  The study, based on data on more than 156,500 patients with Type 2 diabetes between 2007 and 2017, found that 20,744 patients developed DRLEC.  Of this group, 1,208 eventually underwent limb amputation. The findings were published in the July issue of Diabetologia. It’s not only elderly grandfathers (men have a higher incidence than women) who were likely to develop DRLEC; 13 per cent of diabetics who developed the complications were below age 50, said SSHSPH’s Associate Professor Kavita Venkataraman, citing the study’s findings.  In fact, for patients below age 50, Assoc Prof Venkataraman said that the time it took for diabetes to progress to DRLEC is about 27 months. This is shorter than the average of about 31 months seen in older patients.   In patients under age 50, it was about nine months on average between the onset of DRLEC to amputation, according to the study. In older patients, the average duration is shortened to about two months.  Furthermore, one quarter of those who underwent amputation already had DRLEC at their first diabetes consultation.  WHY THE FUSS? The findings underscored what the government highlighted: The lack of awareness and control of diabetes. The latest statistics in 2016 showed that 400,000 live with the disease in Singapore.  Of these, one in three is not aware that he or she has it. Those who are aware of their condition, one in three has poor control over it.  And we haven’t even considered those who are pre-diabetic, which according to this study, an estimated 430,000 Singaporeans aged 18 to 19 are.  Pre-diabetes is a state where the blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes.  If left unchecked, nearly one million people in Singapore will have diabetes by 2050 – and by extension, a potential rise in DRLEC.  Limb loss aside, it also hurts the patient’s pocket when it comes to managing DRLEC.  The amount is “healthcare system-dependent” here, said Associate Professor Andrew Choong, a consultant with the Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Surgery at National University Heart Centre, Singapore.  A foot or leg amputation can cost between US$30,000 (S$40,670) and US$60,000 in initial hospital costs, he said, citing the Journal Of The American Podiatric Medical Association.  Then, it’s another US$43,000 to US$60,000 for follow-up care over the next three years.  “This is a huge impact to any healthcare system,” he said. HOW DO YOU TELL IF YOU HAVE DRLEC? DRLEC may be missed because many patients may not have any symptoms, said Assoc Prof Venkataraman. The initial signs may include: The numbness or pain is more likely to occur in the toes and feet as the “nerve damage due to diabetes is length dependent”, she explained. So, the “longer the nerve, the more likely it will get affected”.  Another factor that leads to DRLEC is the reduced sensation in the feet due to the nerve damage.  These patients are likely to get small cuts or injuries on the toes or feet without realising it, said Assoc Prof Venkataraman.  “When they also have poorer blood flow, such cuts and ulcers will not heal easily, and they may get infected.“ WHAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO DRLEC? The risk factors for DRLEC include having other chronic conditions at the time of diabetes diagnosis, poor control of diabetes, a high body mass index, smoking and age, said Assoc Prof Venkataraman.  Smoking, for instance, contributes to DRLEC by damaging the blood vessels in the lower limbs, she said.  A greater propensity for smoking aside, men are also predisposed to DRLEC by virtue of their hormones.  Assoc Prof Venkataraman said that some studies suggest men may lack the hormonal factors that protect women from nerve and blood vessel damage in the lower limbs.  As for age, growing older can stiffen blood vessels and render them less elastic. “This affects the amount of blood flow and increases the risk of other damage to these vessels,” she said.  Assoc Prof Choong added that it is important for diabetics to “undergo regular foot screening and surveillance as part of their treatment”.  “Closed-toe, well-fitting shoes are a must and daily foot checks are encouraged,” he said. DOES DRLEC ALWAYS END WITH AMPUTATION? Thankfully, not every case of DRLEC will require the procedure, said Assoc Prof Venkataraman.  In general, amputation is only required when the ulcer is not healing well, there is a risk of the infection spreading to the rest of the body, or if the affected toe or foot area is dying due to the lack of blood supply, she said.  In fact, amputation should not be taken lightly, said Assoc Prof Choong. “The amputation of a limb, in most cases, is a bereavement.  ""There is often a significant grief reaction associated which can lead to anxiety, depression and guilt. This is oftentimes amplified when our patients see their amputated limb or when they realise that they have lost function and cannot resume the activities they used to do.” Assoc Prof Choong said that generally, the higher the amputation and the more joints lost, the harder it is for patients to return to their pre-amputation function.  “It is very patient dependent. There are some patients who are unable to recover their full function and worry that they become a burden to their caregivers and families.  “As such, prevention and early surveillance are far better than having to manage limb amputation in the first place,” he said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/tooth-pain-chipped-cracked-teeth-problems-2134901,"Chipped, cracked teeth: How to ease the pain and why braces could help","When it comes to teeth, we want them whiter, straighter and without cavities, please.  But not many would think about taking steps to prevent chips and cracks, which probably explains the times we’ve resorted to tearing open potato chip packets with our teeth without a second thought. Or chomping down on hard shells with our molars during a crab feast.  Sometimes, an unfortunate fall or impact from playing sports can also lead to these dental misadventures, as can bruxism or teeth grinding during sleep.  No matter the cause, a chipped front tooth or cracked molar should not be taken lightly, even when there is little or infrequent pain, or pain only brought on by chewing or eating hot or cold food.  Such issues increase the risk of bacterial infection through the exposed damaged area, said Dr Yvonne Tan, a dental surgeon and senior staff with SingHealth Polyclinics.  This makes the affected tooth “weaker and at risk of further damage if left unattended”.   WHAT CAUSES CHIPPING OR CRACKING? The shiny, smooth enamel that covers each tooth is 96 per cent mineral, rendering it damage-resistant even after tens of thousands of years as seen in archaeological finds.  However, teeth aren’t indestructible. “A tooth would chip when the enamel weakens or erodes due to cavities or tooth decay,” said Dr Tan.  The culprits? Alcohol aside, these also include seemingly innocuous food and drinks that contain acid such as coffee, fruit juices and spicy food, said Dr Tan.  The “heavy and continuous consumption” of these food and drinks “will break down or wear off the enamel on the surface of your tooth, leaving it exposed and fragile”, she explained. Of course, age also plays a role in the dental weakening. The older you are, the more exposed your teeth are to these eroding agents. “Individuals above the age of 50 are at a higher risk of chipped teeth,” said Dr Tan. But lest you think upping your calcium intake might strengthen the enamel or reverse the erosion, it doesn’t, she said.  HOW BRACES MAY HELP A beautiful smile is one of the biggest motivators for getting one’s teeth straightened with braces.  But here’s another reason to add to your list if you’re considering them: Crooked teeth or a bad bite (also known as malocclusion) can lead to chipped or cracked teeth, said Dr Tan. “When the upper teeth and the lower teeth do not properly fit together, it will negatively affect certain parts of the teeth. Over time, these teeth will begin to weaken, sometimes making them much more susceptible to chips,” she said. About 2 to 3 per cent of the patients at Singhealth Polyclinics are treated for malocclusions. It's a small percentage but Dr Tan noted that this could be due to the lack of awareness regarding the issue.  The causes of malocclusions are varied. They could be due to habits such as bottle feeding, mouth breathing, thumb sucking, tongue thrusting or lip sucking.  The misalignment could also be genetically linked, such as inheriting large teeth and a small jaw from either of your parents.  Generally, the different types of malocclusions can be as follows, said Dr Tan: A post shared by John Sparrow (@mewingchannel) When the upper front teeth overlap or cover part of the lower front teeth.  It is sometimes referred to as an anterior crossbite, where the lower jaw juts out further than the upper jaw. The upper and lower teeth do not overlap or touch in some cases, and there is a gap between the teeth. A posterior open bite is when the upper and lower teeth meet, but not the back teeth. The upper teeth fit inside the lower teeth, causing misalignment to the teeth, bone or both. (See Instagram post below.) A post shared by Dr. Adèle Jardine (BDS UK) (@invisaligntrinidadandtobago) The biting edges of the upper front teeth bite directly onto the lower front teeth. There is not enough space in your mouth for teeth to emerge properly. CR-AAACK! WHAT NOW? Make an appointment with your dentist pronto. In the meantime, take an over-the-counter (OTC) painkiller to reduce the pain and inflammation, advised Dr Tan.  If you can’t see your dentist soon enough, use dental wax (which you can find at pharmacies) to coat the jagged edge of the tooth to prevent irritation to your tongue and gums.  When chewing, avoid putting pressure on the affected tooth and stick to soft food, said Dr Tan.  How the tooth is repaired depends on the extent of the damage. “For small chips, your dentist may file or polish it to smoothen the rough edges,” said Dr Tan, adding that composite resins may also be used to fill uncomplicated chips or even rebuild the tooth. “For a more severe chip, your dentist may restore the tooth with a crown, onlay or veneer to protect the tooth from infection,” she said.  If the tooth’s pulp, which is the living part consisting of blood vessels and nerves, is affected, the dentist may have to perform a root canal treatment before placing a crown over the tooth, said Dr Tan. Sometimes, you may have to lose the tooth if the damage is extreme.  Meanwhile, prevention is better than cure, said Dr Tan. That means doing what your dentist has always advised: Brush at least twice a day, floss daily and make at least yearly dental appointments.  “Avoid acidic and sugary food and drinks as much as possible as they can erode enamel and increase the risks of developing chipped teeth. Yes, that means cutting back on that bubble tea that you love,” she said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid19-singapore-cases-rise-quick-action-testing-moh-2159366,"Singapore facing increasing likelihood of 'exponential rise' in COVID-19 cases, quick action needed: MOH","SINGAPORE: Singapore needs to “take quick action” to dampen the increasing likelihood of an ""exponential rise"" in COVID-19 cases, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (Sep 6). Speaking to reporters, Mr Lawrence Wong, co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force, said the transmission rate of COVID-19 has to be slowed down.  Singapore will attempt to do so without going into another phase of heightened alert, he said.  “What is of concern to us is not just the absolute number of cases, but the rate at which the virus is spreading. And that’s the reproduction rate, or R.  “Currently, the R is more than one. Cases are doubling every week. And if we continue on this trajectory of infection, it means we could have 1,000 (daily) cases in two weeks, or possibly 2,000 (daily) cases in a month.”  From the experience of other countries, when cases rise “so sharply” there will be many more cases in the ICU and more people succumbing to the virus, said Mr Wong, who is also the Finance Minister.  “It’s not just the unvaccinated seniors. Because even for vaccinated persons, there will be a small proportion of them falling severely ill, and if you have a very high infection caseload, the small proportion will translate to a sizable number of ICU cases and eventually fatalities,” he added. “So we have to slow down the transmission rate and bring R down. We will attempt to do so without going back to another heightened alert. And in particular, we will go for aggressive contact tracing and ringfencing of cases and clusters, and push for more pervasive testing.”  The number of new COVID-19 cases in the community has almost doubled to more than 1,200 in the past week, up from about 600 in the week before, said MOH in a separate press release.  Unvaccinated people are still susceptible to severe illness and death from COVID-19. Over the last 28 days, 6.7 per cent of unvaccinated cases fell severely ill or died, MOH noted.  “If the infection continues at this trajectory, we will see a doubling of cases every week. This means that we can expect to see more individuals suffer serious consequences due to COVID-19 infection,” the ministry said.  “We need to take quick action now to dampen the increasing likelihood of an exponential increase in cases. This will also buy us time to get more people, in particular seniors, vaccinated as soon as possible, and also to roll out our booster programme to those aged 60 and above.”  The frequency of the mandatory fast and easy test rostered routine testing regime will be stepped up from once every two weeks to once a week from next Monday, said Mr Wong.  The enhanced frequency will allow cases to be detected and ringfenced more quickly, said MOH.  “This is particularly important given the infectiousness of the Delta variant, as observed locally where there have been shorter periods between each generation of infection,” it said. The testing regime is currently in place for higher-risk settings like F&B, personal care services and gym and fitness studios.  It will be extended to more settings with “frequent community interactions”, said MOH in the press release. This includes workers in retail, malls, supermarkets as well as delivery personnel and transport workers, said Mr Wong.  These tests will continue to be administered primarily through the Employer Supervised SelfSwab. The Government will subsidise the costs of all tests under this enhanced surveillance regime for both vaccinated and unvaccinated people until the end of 2021.  Regular testing for employees working onsite beyond these settings will also be stepped up, said Mr Wong.  Antigen rapid test kits will be distributed to companies that are not already subject to mandatory rostered routine testing so that they can administer weekly tests for their staff over the next two months.  Each company will receive eight kits per onsite employee for weekly testing of their staff over a two-month period, said MOH.  All companies are expected to initiate weekly testing for their onsite staff, and the tests can be administered by the individuals by themselves at home or at the work premises.  Employers should put in place a process to ensure that the tests are done properly and report the results to the respective government agencies, said MOH.  “We hope that the distribution of ART kits to both households and companies will help to instil a culture of responsibility in administering regular self-tests. This will become an important tool in the new normal, so that we can dampen the impact of COVID-19 without having to impose heightened alerts,” the ministry said.  The Government will also send out health risk warnings and health risk alerts to people when a cluster of cases is identified, on top of quarantining close contacts.  This will “cast a wide net” around the cases and contain the clusters quickly, MOH said, adding that with more cases in the community, more people will also be issued these warnings and alerts. These are not quarantine alerts, but those who receive a health risk warning will be required by law to get a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and self-isolate until they receive a negative result from their first test, the ministry said.  After that, they will need to continue to take antigen rapid tests, and then another PCR test on the 14th day, said MOH.  People who receive a health risk alert are not subject to the same measures, but are “strongly encouraged” to go for a PCR test as soon as possible. Those who receive either alerts should also reduce their social interactions for 14 days.  ""With all of these measures, we hope that we can help to slow down transmission, without having to go back to the heightened alert, or the circuit breaker ... these are last resort measures that we will try our best to refrain from using them,"" said Mr Wong. ""But we should not rule them out entirely."" Urging people to scale back on non-essential social interactions, Mr Wong added: “You don’t have to have the mindset that you are maximising to the limit, your ability to go out. Because yes, you can go out to dine, but scale back during this period because every effort counts.  “And if all of us do our part by getting tested regularly by scaling back interactions we will be able to slow down the transmission.”  All announced activities, programmes and pilots will continue, including the vaccinated travel lanes with Germany and Brunei, Mr Wong said.  “We are not stopping any of the things that have been announced. We are not going back to a heightened alert. We are not tightening up restrictions. We are not doing that.  “What we are trying to do is to try our best to refrain from having to adopt a tightened posture, but still be able to slow down transmission as much as we can through more aggressive contact tracing, more widespread testing and finally by everyone doing their part in exercising social responsibility.”  This is a “reflection of our new phase” with a much higher level of vaccination coverage and protection, which is why Singapore does not have to go back to tightened measures, Mr Wong added.  “If, despite our best efforts, we find that the number of serious cases needing oxygen and ICU care goes up sharply, then we may have no choice but to tighten our overall posture, so we should not rule that out,"" said the minister.Editor's note: An earlier version of this story said all companies will receive eight test kits per employee. MOH has clarified that this excludes firms already under the rostered routine testing scheme. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/singapore-most-fatigued-country-world-we-are-tired-2156406,Singapore is 'most fatigued' country in the world – and we’re tired of it,"Singaporeans are a sleep-deprived lot to say the least. From the minute we wake to the minute we lay our heads down in bed, we have to be hyper-connected, hyper-updated and on hyper alert – especially with the pandemic situation. No wonder we are so tired. And it’s not just the number of hours of sleep we have (or rather, have not) been getting that is causing the so-called power shortage. It’s also the duration we spend at work and on the Internet, at least according to an article posted by UK bedding manufacturer Sleepseeker.  In fact, of the world’s 15 most fatigued countries, Singapore tops the list. In it, we’ve even outdone China and Japan, the only two other Asian countries included.  FATIGUE SCORE (OUT OF 10) The “fatigue score” out of 10 that each country received was gleaned from data such as Statista (the average hours and minutes below the recommended eight hours of sleep in each country); Wikipedia (the average number of hours worked in each country per year); and BusinessFibre.co.uk (the daily amount of screen time that people in different countries recorded).  The fourth data source was Google Keyword Planner, which tracked the number of sleep-related search terms in each country. To better represent locations such as China, where the number of Google users is very low compared to its population, they used rate per 100,000 instead of each country's population.  But back to the situation in Singapore. It is no surprise that we're perpetually moaning ""so tired"" when you look at the number of hours we worked per year in the table below: COUNTRIES THAT WORK THE MOST HOURS PER YEAR We accumulate 2,238 hours each year on average – longer than China’s 2,174 hours and even surpassing Japan’s workaholic culture that gave it 1,723 hours.  But the article’s interesting find was Mexico’s top position. Its workers accumulate 2,255 hours per annum – the longest work hours in the world – and perhaps an indication that its “growing economy is impacting the work-life balance of its working population”.  COUNTRIES THAT SPEND THE MOST TIME ON THE INTERNET DAILY Work aside, the time spent online is also robbing Singaporeans of much-needed R&R – 7 hours and 2 minutes, to be exact, according to the article. But not as much as Brazil (9 hours and 29 minutes) and Mexico (8 hours and 1 minute).  If you're thinking the long work hours might have accounted for the extensive time spent online, the article did not make the connection.  However, Mexico and Singapore (the two countries with the longest working hours each year) did place in the second and third positions respectively for countries that spent the most time daily on the Internet."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/mammogram-breast-cancer-screening-singapore-fundraising-campaign-2151476,Find out how you can support more than 500 women who need mammograms,"Among the routine tests women should do when they turn 40 are mammograms, which are crucial in screening for breast cancer.  Breast cancer is the number one cancer affecting women in Singapore, with over 2,000 women diagnosed each year – and approximately 280 die from the disease, according to the Singapore Cancer Registry Annual Report 2018. While breast cancer is highly treatable when detected early, women from low-income families may not have easy access to mammograms, resulting in late diagnosis and poor outcomes, said 365 Cancer Prevention Society and Icon Cancer Centre in a recent joint press release. In a phone interview, Andrew Soh, the head of Fundraising, Marketing and Volunteer Management at 365 Cancer Prevention Society (365CPS), a non-profit organisation providing social support, told CNA Women that these women may not be aware of the need for breast cancer screening, and may also worry about the added financial cost of going for a mammogram. “The cost of a mammogram may mean a whole week of living expenses that are meant for food and other essentials. And if there are abnormalities in the result, seeing a doctor would cost at least another S$50 to S$60,” said Soh.  Currently, only Singapore women aged 50 and above qualify for subsidised mammograms, which are available at selected centres under the Health Promotion Board’s Screen for Life programme. It costs from S$50 (Singaporeans) to S$75 (Permanent Residents), but excludes the cost of pre- and post-consultations. National screening guidelines recommend that a woman get her first mammogram once she turns 40, and one of the few subsidies available for women aged 40 to 49 is funding assistance provided by the Singapore Cancer Society, available in April, May, October and November every year. If you are eligible, you can enjoy S$25 off the usual cost.    “We know early detection saves lives. By providing greater access to screening for women who often cannot normally afford this vital care due to other financial priorities, we hope to contribute to improving health disparities while minimising cancer treatment and ultimately saving lives,” said Serena Wee, the Chief Executive Officer of Icon Cancer Centre Singapore, an end-to-end cancer care provider that includes screening, diagnosis, treatment and beyond. HOW YOU CAN HELP THESE WOMEN The campaign, called #My1stMammo, is seeking to raise S$80,000 to fund the cost of the mammograms for the women who need it. But first, they would need to register their interest; the breast cancer screenings will take place from October to December. “We hope to garner at least 500 beneficiaries from 365CPS and community partners to come forward to receive their first mammogram via this campaign,” said Soh.  Until Oct 30, the public can donate any amount from S$10 to sponsor the mammograms. The organisers are hoping to raise the full amount before that date.   The beneficiaries will have access to a free mammogram, complete with pre- and post-consultation with a general practitioner, at any of seven SATA clinics islandwide.  Any excess in the total amount will support other cancer prevention initiatives by 365CPS.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/indonesia-covid-19-vaccines-remote-villages-geographical-challenges-insufficient-supply-2146366,Long quest for COVID-19 vaccines in remote Indonesia as insufficient supply hampers efforts,"JAKARTA: Indonesian Hatimene Hura, 24, has yet to be vaccinated against COVID-19, seven months after Indonesia’s inoculation programme kicked off. The farmer living in Sisobahili Iranohura village on Nias island in North Sumatra knew how dangerous COVID-19 can be and he wanted to get vaccinated. He went to the local health clinic in Idanogawo district last month to inquire about vaccination and was told it was only accepting people who needed to get their second jab. Mr Hura’s friends told him that he could try his luck at another walk-in vaccination centre. Hence he decided to travel 40km on his motorbike to Gunungsitoli, the biggest town on the island. “I live at the foot of a mountain. I needed to pass some damaged roads, which are steep and winding,” he recounted to CNA. But after a one-and-a-half-hour ride, he was disappointed as the vaccination centre also catered only to people who already had their first jab. Indonesia has set the target to inoculate about 208 million people of its 270 million population by early next year. To meet that goal, President Joko Widodo had initially set the target of 2 million doses to be administered daily in August. However, due to the country’s geographical vastness as well as limited vaccine supply, not everyone can be jabbed quickly. Living in a remote area further dampens the chance of getting vaccinated. A survey released in mid-August by political think-tank Charta Politika showed that 72.4 per cent of Indonesians wished to be vaccinated. Nationally, only 65 million people have been jabbed with the first dose. This works out to be around 24 per cent of the total population. Dr Siti Nadia Tarmizi, the central government’s spokeswoman for COVID-19 handling and vaccination, said the daily vaccination rate in August was about 1.2 million to 1.4 million. This fell short of the initial 2 million daily target. The government later added a new target and stated that 100 million doses of vaccines must be administered by the end of last month. This goal has been achieved. Dr Tarmizi said that the government is now aiming to hit the 2 million target this month. For some Indonesians, finding a vaccination centre near them and securing a slot are no easy tasks. Dion Alpandy, 18, had to ride his motorcycle to a centre 20km away from his hometown to get his first shot, and then another 30km away for his second shot. The university student and two of his friends in Rantepao, North Toraja regency in South Sulawesi province had to resort to this because the only vaccination centre near their homes was full. Despite heading to the nearby regency for their first vaccination appointment before 7am, a large crowd had already gathered at the centre when they arrived. They finally got vaccinated at 1pm and rode home soaking wet as it was raining. They went back to the same centre for the second appointment last month, riding their motorbikes through the same damaged asphalt roads. “We woke up early again and rode there again but when we arrived we were told that there were no vaccines,” he said, adding that the centre was closed. They headed home to search for another vaccination centre online. They found another centre further away and rode 30km there the next day. Despite the obstacles, Mr Alpandy said it was important to get vaccinated as the vaccine certificate is a requirement for various activities these days. He would need the certificate to return to his university in South Sulawesi’s capital Makassar when in-class learning resumes one day. Jenifer May Ata Mbaru, 17, also experienced first-hand that getting vaccinated is not as easy as she thought it would be. She was excited when Mr Widodo announced at the end of June that teenagers aged 12 to 17 could be vaccinated, and she subsequently received a WhatsApp message informing her that her first appointment would be on Jul 12 at the regency capital of Waingapu in East Sumba, East Nusa Tenggara province, about 15km from her village Kiritana. However, when she arrived at the venue, she was rejected as her name was not on the vaccination list. The centre was also not accepting walk-ins since it had limited supply, she said. She was disappointed, but she has decided to reapply and is hoping for better luck next time.  Head of East Sumba parliament Ali Oemar Fadaq said that the vaccine supply in his region has been limited and vaccinators only work two days a week. By the third day, they would run out of stock, he said. Out of 200,000 eligible people in the regency, only 42,000 have received their first dose and 17,000 their second. He expressed regret at the situation, as East Sumba is one of the three regencies in East Nusa Tenggara province that have been classified as a red zone. This is defined by the government as an area with a high number of COVID-19 cases. “Mr Jokowi himself warned that East Nusa Tenggara must be careful,” Mr Fadaq told CNA, adding that East Sumba only has one hospital with a capacity of 100 patients. He does not know the reason for the limited supply but revealed that the vaccines come in small batches, such as 100 vials for 500 to 1,000 people. “The local government has done its best (to contain COVID-19), but there are many limitations,” said Mr Fadaq, who contracted COVID-19 in July. “Here in villages, people have to go tens or hundreds of kilometres to a health centre which is located in the regency’s capital. Some people ride a horse because the roads are not connected,” he said. As of Friday (Sep 3), about 802,419 people in the East Nusa Tenggara province or 20.9 per cent of the provincial target have received their first dose. It is far behind capital Jakarta, which has achieved its initial target of 7.5 million doses in July. A total of 9.7 million people have received their first dose as of Sep 3.  Dr Tarmizi, the central government’s COVID-19 vaccination spokeswoman, acknowledged that there have been cases where people had to travel far to get vaccinated. This was despite the government mobilising the military and police to do door-to-door vaccination in many areas, especially the outermost islands, she said.  “There are definitely such cases because there are only 160 million vaccine doses when 426 million vaccine doses are needed. How to distribute the vaccines well?  “We can’t distribute the vaccines to all villages because then one village will only get one vial. So we ask people who haven't had the chance to be vaccinated to be patient,"" Dr Tarmizi told CNA in August. As of Friday, Indonesia has received about 190 million doses of vaccines, which is 44 per cent of the supply needed to inoculate 208 million people.  Among the vaccines approved to be used in Indonesia are Sinovac, AstraZeneca, Sinopharm, Moderna and Pfizer. The vaccines were firstly prioritised for medical and other essential workers as well as senior citizens. Regions such as Jakarta, Java and Bali which had the highest numbers of COVID-19 cases were also given priority over other areas. When more vaccines became available, they were sent to capital provinces, and from there, disseminated to other regencies, districts and towns. Mr Bambang Heriyanto, secretary and spokesman of Bio Farma, the country’s state-owned vaccine producer and distributor of the COVID-19 vaccines, said it encountered limited storage and distribution capacity on the ground. The existing vaccine distribution channels have to accommodate routine non-COVID-19 vaccines as well as large numbers of COVID-19 vaccines, he said in a press conference on Aug 24.  “That is why we collaborate with many parties including local governments regarding storage facilities and vaccine distribution. We hope that every part of Indonesia will soon get enough vaccines,” said Mr Heriyanto. Health Minister Budi Gunadi also said on Aug 24 that about 80.7 million doses of vaccines would arrive in September. “Therefore, people of Indonesia, local governments do not have to worry, we will definitely send enough (vaccines) to the regions,'' he said in a press conference. Despite the long wait, Mr Hura, the farmer in Nias, said he would continue searching for vaccination opportunities. He said he was willing to go the extra mile, especially since he wanted to fly to the provincial capital Medan in October to apply for a job. Current requirements only allow people who have received their first dose to fly.  “I beg the authorities to add more vaccines and inform the people about the vaccination schedule in a timely manner because we do want to get vaccinated.” "

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/sex-toys-popular-conservative-singapore-2146421,Women’s sex toys are buzzing right now – and Singapore is ready for it,"Bedroom toys are stepping out of speciality shops and hitting mainstream shelves, a sign of a momentous shift in mindset when it comes to sex.  But exactly what’s shifted and why now? And how are brands keeping the market turned on?  OUT IN THE OPEN Today, sex toys are no longer confined to traditional sex shops, but are taking pride of place on the shelves of mainstream retailers.  Sex toy makers Wow Tech said Singapore was the first market within the Asia-Pacific region where the company saw “strong responses” from conventional retailers. Its brands, Arcwave, We-Vibe and Womanizer, are now available in different retailers across eight countries in Asia, including various Guardian outlets in Singapore, said the company’s Asia-Pacific consumer marketing manager Ruben Rodriguez.  Smile Makers, a Swedish brand based in Singapore, has been distributing to physical retailers since 2015 and counts Guardian and Watsons pharmacies, as well as stores like Cotton On, Love, Bonito and Motherswork as partners. It is also stocked at department store Isetan Scotts, which launched an entire sexual wellness boutique last year, carrying internationally popular brands like Fun Factory, Lelo and Tenga. Just last month, Essentials Pharmacy, which is located in Chinatown, announced it now stocks four products from American brand SVAKOM. Smile Makers has seen a “dramatic increase” in mainstream retail sales across the world, including in Asia, said brand director Cecile Gasnault. “We have been growing at a rate of 70 per cent for the past three years,” she told CNA Women. Going mainstream in Singapore was a natural decision for the brand, whose strategy has always been to never be distributed at speciality sex stores.  “The stigma is lifting. Women now expect to see vibrators in beauty retailers and mainstream retail,” said Gasnault, adding that a 2020 survey commissioned by the company found 62 per cent of Singaporean women wanted to find vibrators in beauty stores and not in sex shops. BOOM IN ONLINE SALES Online sales of sex toys are also booming, a trend said to be riding on the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.   Good Vibes, an online shop that opened in November last year, saw sales increasing five-fold during the COVID-19 Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), when dining-in was suspended and gathering limits reduced to two people. “This industry is inversely related to COVID-19 and when we had a (partial) lockdown in May, everything peaked – traffic surged,” said founder Meryl Lim.  Said Gasnault: “The first lockdowns triggered dramatic peaks in sales, with sales doubling or tripling depending on the market or retailer … What we have observed is that for retailers selling both offline and online, our sales have grown significantly on their online channels."" Smile Makers’ sales have since stabilised, but remain at levels higher than before the start of the pandemic last year as awareness of the sexual wellness category grows, with two out of three shoppers on the Smile Makers website being first-time users, she added. But experts agreed that the pandemic was simply a catalyst, not the trigger, for the market’s growth. “It has taken a long time, but many countries in Asia are experiencing a very high interest in pleasure wellness. The Asia-Pacific represents an increasing portion of our business year after year. “These consumer behaviour changes find their root in a heightened awareness regarding all things sexual wellness,” said Wow Tech’s Rodriguez, adding that an increasing number of key opinion figures in the region are turning to global conversations and movements regarding sex positivity, and “finding their own ways of speaking about the topic from their viewpoint as Asian people”.  “Many of them are bringing to light a mismatch between how ‘taboo’ the topic is perceived in society and how great they feel after using toys, helping them in their life,” he said. This trend was “boosted” by the pandemic, said Rodriguez, as many experienced “mentally straining situations” such as being separated from their loved ones due to lockdowns. “Due to the fact that orgasms do improve our mental wellness and bridge our intimate relationship impediments during the pandemic, the curiosity about pleasure products is increasing at a fast pace,” he said.  NORMALISING SEX TALK  Experts were unanimous when it came to the winning strategy for selling sex toys in the modern age – education. Launch the Instagram page of any of the brands mentioned in this story and you will see anything from pieces of poetry and colourful illustrations to educational carousels and influencer quotes or interviews. A post shared by Womanizer | The Original (@womanizerglobal) A post shared by good vibes 🇸🇬 (@goodvibesonlysg) “Education is a big part of forming the basis of one’s outlook in life,” said The Hedonist co-founder Sabrina Angela Meier, adding that the Singapore-based retailer works to “emphasise that health and happiness go hand in hand with pleasure”.  The Hedonist, established in 2019, sells candles, lubricant and other pleasure accessories alongside sex toys. “We need to educate the public about positive values in order to unlearn the false information that we were fed as children. People tend to think that pleasure is a luxury, but really, it’s an essential ingredient for happiness,” she told CNA Women. One of the ways its founders, which include Jacqueline Kee and Jade Amar, hope to normalise conversations around sex is by putting themselves out there. The trio occasionally fronts videos on social media demonstrating use of their products.  A post shared by Hedonist Tribe (@hedonisttribe) “We are one of the first sex-positive pleasure brands in Singapore to put our faces to the brand. We want to normalise sex and pleasure as it is our birthright and what makes us human,” said Meier. As part of their efforts to educate customers, some brands have quizzes on their website to help women discover and explore their sexual needs, helping them to decide which toy is best suited to them. It’s often surprising how differently customers choose when they are more aware of their pleasure preferences. When asked which Smile Makers toys are the most popular, Gasnault said: “Interestingly, it depends on how much guidance is provided to the consumer … Without guidance (from the quiz), they favour internal products, but once we invite them to reflect on their own experience, external products become much more popular.”  For example, customers who do not complete the quiz tend to purchase The Billionaire vibrator, which has a “very classic shape with an elegant design and subtle lavender colour”, said Gasnault. It is an example of a sex toy that can be used both internally – to promote vaginal orgasms – and externally, to stimulate the clitoris. But with the quiz, The Firefighter – which is used externally – “proves a very popular choice”, she added. Smile Makers has also seen a “growing interest from the public to talk more about female sexuality in Asia”. In the last two years alone, it has led workshops with students at the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University, partnered with Action for Aids and guested on local sex podcast Something Private. Something Private is one of a growing number of media platforms normalising conversations around sex in Singapore. The podcast was established in 2019 and to date boasts listeners in 60 countries, 80,000 unique downloads and more than 6,000 followers on Instagram.  On the podcast, host Nicole Lim talks to personalities like Minister of State for Education Sun Xueling, Workers’ Party Member of Parliament Raeesah Khan and comedian Preeti Nair on a wide range of topics, from vulva health to motherhood. Nair, better known as her online moniker Preetipls, is herself an influencer in this space, with her 40,000-strong Instagram audience enjoying content around the topics of women’s sexual and reproductive health. Another platform, the Shy And Curious website run by writer Noorindah Iskandar, has nearly 1,000 followers on Instagram despite having been established less than a year ago.  After the sudden death of her mother, who had kept her breast cancer a secret “until it was too late”, Noorindah said she wanted to create a “safe space to break the silence on taboo topics, where women could gather to share, gain advice and insight from each other’s stories”. A post shared by Shy & Curious (@shyandcurious_com) A post shared by Shy & Curious (@shyandcurious_com) Popular posts on the Shy and Curious Instagram page include IGTV videos showing Noorindah unboxing sex toys and educational carousels addressing questions she has received, including why some people feel sad after sex and what to expect when undergoing HIV testing. The response has been “promising”, said Noorindah, with more readers engaging with her posts and sending her messages asking for recommendations on sex toys.  Andrea Tan, a certified sex, love and relationship coach whose work involves educating women on self-pleasure, sexual wellness and sexual healing, has begun to see her clients displaying “more ownership and confidence” in their “sexual exploration”, showing more acceptance of their bodies and embracing the benefits of self-pleasure. She has also seen an uptick of online education and conversation around the use of sex toys in the pandemic, “possibly supported by the fact that when we can’t connect in person, many people turn to online platforms”.  SPEAKING RESPECTFULLY TO WOMEN A key strategy that brands have adopted to grow their consumer base is to address women directly and respectfully. That meant bridging the gap between what women actually needed and what was available in the market.  “Sexual dysfunction is a common occurrence that leads not only to health issues for the individual experiencing it, but also wider issues in marriage and society, most visibly a rise in divorce rates,” said Smile Makers’ Asia brand manager Ariel Chen. “However, while products to treat or cure men’s dysfunction have since long been available in mainstream retail, products for women have largely been absent. This has led to the perception of society placing a skewed importance on men’s sexual wellness as compared to women,” said Chen. Even if products for women were available, the shopping environment, product design and quality were “alarmingly unappealing the world over”, said Gasnault. “No brand was speaking respectfully to women.” The first thing to think about was, naturally, the design of the product.  Said Wow Tech’s Rodriguez: “In the last five to 10 years, the whole industry has radically changed its image. “Ten years ago, our category was speaking about sex toys catered to a very adult audience with product designs that resembled private body parts. Now the industry speaks about the wellness benefits of self-pleasure (and) creates products that look nothing like body parts.” Smile Makers products are designed to be “anatomically relevant and unintimidating”, said Gasnault, with “friendly” names, colours and packaging.  “We also use humour a lot. Sex is a natural and enjoyable part of life, and should be treated as such. Our choice to talk about female sexuality in a clear, joyful and humorous way, using colourful design and relatable names like the French Lover, Tennis Pro and Surfer has proven efficient in… getting people to feel safe and comfortable,” she said. New kid on the block Good Vibes not only recognises the importance of marketing directly to women, but also in providing the most comfortable buying experience, especially to those new to sex toys. The brand conducted surveys and focus groups, speaking to about 150 people in Singapore, and found that many of the women who owned sex toys had bought them with their partner.  “We were struggling in terms of the marketing angle. Now that we know the men were buying for their partners, should we be speaking to the man? In the end, we were like, forget the man. We want to empower women, instead of men empowering women,” said Lim. Good Vibes’ research also showed that many of the women who had not yet experienced sex toys were open to trying them.  “It was very clear based on the survey that I needed to serve the beginners, which is why I only have three toys. A lot of my competitors are distributors and they have many global brands and thousands of toys in their shops,” said Lim. Like Smile Makers, Good Vibes sought to make their toys look as appealing as possible to women in their 20s and 30s, giving them discreet names like The Pebble, The Koi and The Bamboo.  But ready as they are to try out sex toys, some may not be comfortable with putting their toys on display on their dresser, especially those who live with their family. Because of this, Good Vibes provides a satin pouch with every purchase. “With international brands, like Maude, the concept is to get toys from under your sheets onto the dressing table. Why do we have to hide them when we can put them on the toilet shelf? The way Maude designs it, it’s almost decor. It looks beautiful and is part of the interior design. “I really like that empowerment message … but in Asia, we’re a few steps behind,” Lim said. In an effort to luxuriate the process of women buying sex toys for themselves, Good Vibes scents its packaging with orange blossom, and handwrites customers’ names on its boxes and thank-you notes to “create the mood”.  “Why can’t we make the whole experience of buying a sex toy like how you buy a gift for yourself, like buying a candle or a nice cookie?” said Lim.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/experiences/luxury-ultra-marathon-highland-kings-2153956,"S$29,000 to join a four-day, 200km ultra-marathon? Here’s what you get","From the eastern edge of Glen Coe, one of Scotland’s most iconic valleys, we head south along the West Highland Way, climbing quickly along a stony track. The majestic Rannoch Moor spreads out in front of us. The grass and heather, reflecting the warm July sun, are the brightest of greens. White bog cotton flutters in the light breeze. Once you give up the heavy hiking boots and hulking backpack, it is surprising how quickly you can move through the mountains. In no time we reach the top of the rise and the rocky route unfurls ahead. We run down, across the moorland, letting gravity do the work. A river slows, forming a small lake. The still water reflects the clouds overhead. After months of coronavirus travel restrictions and regular lockdowns, running through the Scottish highlands, just a few hours after taking off from London’s sleepy City airport, provides a thrilling, unfamiliar sense of freedom. The day’s route is short, about seven miles, but the scenery is stunning. The steep-sided Glen turns into open, undulating grassland, and then to thick pine forest on the edge of Loch Tulla, before we tumble out onto a remote road next to a quaint lodge house. Our running, for today at least, is finished. In contrast, next April, when former army sergeant major Matt Smith hopes 40 runners will be barrelling down the same track, they will still have around 20 miles to the end of stage one and more than 110 miles to the end of the four-day race. And while I am a guest of Smith’s Primal Adventures, in Scotland to sample his plans for next year’s Highland Kings Ultra, those competitors, he hopes, will pay £15,499 (S$28,800) for the privilege – an amount sure to raise eyebrows among some devotees of a traditionally down-to-earth, no-frills sport. “There are thousands of ultra-races around the world and not one of them is like this,” Smith explained to me earlier in the day as we snaked along the edge of Loch Lomond in a sparkling Land Rover, fresh off the forecourt in Glasgow. “People want to do something that no one else is doing, or no one else can do.” Participation in the sport of ultra-running – classified as any foot race longer than a traditional marathon – has exploded in the last decade. While running (or shuffling) 26 miles (42km) may have been sufficient to win the respect of friends and peers 20 years ago, today more people are seeking out tougher challenges, and often running further and further. In 2018, at least 611,098 people worldwide participated in an ultra-marathon, up 345 per cent in 10 years, according to a May study that claimed to cover more than 85 per cent of ultra-running events worldwide. The races vary in length, duration and format, and range from the extremely difficult to the seemingly insane. In Colorado’s elite Hardrock, 100 athletes run 100 miles in a single push, climbing 10,000m, while at an average altitude of more than 11,000 feet (3,350m). In more provincial surroundings, John Stocker from Oxfordshire, England, ran a record 337 miles in 81 hours at the Suffolk Backyard Ultra in June, completing a 4.167 mile lap of the county’s Knettishall Heath every hour until he gave up. The physical feat aside, such races are often a logistical challenge for participants too. At the six-day, 155-mile Marathon des Sables in the Sahara desert that I completed in 2019, we carried our own food and equipment and slept on the rock-strewn desert in open-sided Berber tents. At the Ring O’Fire – a three-day, 135-mile race around the Welsh island of Anglesey – competitors spend the first night on the cold floor of a leisure centre and the second in a village hall. Purists might argue this hardship is all part of the “ultra experience” but this is where Smith’s race differs. The 40 participants in the Highland Kings will recuperate each night in an opulent race camp, rest weary legs in hydrotherapy pools, enjoy “world-class” sports massage, and sleep on memory-foam-topped king-size beds in individual, butler-serviced bell tents, all while being fed by a chef from a Michelin-starred restaurant. “Race like a warrior, recover like a king,” said Smith, who’s been planning the event for four years and bills it as “the world’s first premium ultra”. But this is not luxury for luxury’s sake, he insists. Rather, the event is intended to “create the best conditions to get the best out of yourself”. To achieve, in his words, “optimum human performance”. “Throughout my military career I wanted to push myself physically to be the best that I could be,” said Smith. “So when I create these events, I want the events to be the best, so I need the best people, I need the best equipment, I need the best logistics.” With performance in mind, participants’ race experience will begin, not on the start line in April, but seven months earlier in the Porsche Human Performance Centre at the UK’s Silverstone racetrack for a full cardiopulmonary exercise test. Smith claims nothing has been overlooked. Dorset-headquartered Precision Hydration will use sweat composition assessments to give the runners bespoke hydration supplements. Personalised watches will be provided by Garmin and race clothing by ThruDark. And world-class ultra-runners Anna-Marie Watson and Jonathan Albon will deliver coaching and review participants’ monthly training plans throughout the build-up. “It’s not just how much you can run, it’s how much you can recover,” explained Watson, who placed second at the Marathon des Sables in 2015 and has a series of other victories and fastest-known times to her name. As one of several women currently setting records in ultra-running, Watson hopes the Highland Kings can attract equal numbers of men and women. She swears by the value of cross-training and running at night when “you can have the world to yourself”. Albon, who is the reigning trail running world champion and two-time winner of the Skyrunning World series, says he first uses training to build “as big an engine as possible” through long, slower runs. Around 10 weeks before race day he starts to “tune the engine” by tailoring his training to mirror the speed and conditions of the event. Two weeks out he “fills it with fuel” by resting. “Build the engine, train the engine, fuel the engine,” he says. It all sounds simple enough. The next morning, the engine possibly over-fuelled with a Scottish cooked breakfast, we set out to explore the race’s second stage: 32 miles from the village of Dalmally on the Strath of Orchy, through hilly, wooded terrain to the picturesque Loch Fyne. We run a fast downhill section along a curving forest road. The ground falls away to our right and the view stretches into the distance across towering tree tops.
With the promised chef booked only for the event itself, we settle instead for lunch at the original Loch Fyne restaurant, which has been selling oysters on the water’s edge since 1978 and has spawned 21 outposts across the UK. I decide wine probably doesn’t fit with the afternoon run planned on the rugged Isle of Arran, but the whole brown crab is fresh and delicious. I ask Smith whether he thinks fine dining and drams of single malt whisky are really compatible with ultra-running. He insists they can be. Wealthy thrillseekers have for decades combined extreme skiing in remote mountains with luxurious lodgings, so why not running, he says.
The last decade has seen road cycling in the UK go from a niche sport to what some have dubbed “the new golf” – beloved by competitive corporate high-flyers with money to spend on the latest kit. Smith’s bet is that ultra-running is next.
From Loch Fyne, the Highland Kings runners will head south on day three covering 34 miles of mostly coastal path to the smart marina of Portavadie, before crossing the Firth of Clyde by speedboat to the Isle of Arran.
When we inch out of the harbour the sea is almost completely flat. The engines on the jet black Stormforce Rib roar as the helmsman pushes down the throttle and soon we are skimming across the water. Arran is stunningly beautiful. As we dock at the pier the distinctive warble of Scottish bagpipes, there to greet us, echoes around the picturesque waterfront. The island is often described as Scotland-in-miniature. Otters and seals like to hunt along its rugged coastline; golden eagles can be spotted soaring over its dramatic mountains. At the water’s edge the empty Lochranza Castle, built in the late 1200s by the son of the Scottish lord Sven “the Red”, marks the start of what will be the final stage of the race: 28 miles with 6,000 feet of ascent, across Goatfell, the island’s highest peak.
Over the next day we sample two parts of that route: A heart-pumping run from the village of Brodick up the breathtaking Glen Rosa and a fast descent through the Dougarie Estate, built as a sporting lodge for the 11th Duke of Hamilton around 1865, to the finish line on Arran’s west coast. The final day will be the real test, says Smith, adding that the prospect of a banquet on the last night hosted by Sir Ranulph Fiennes, the celebrated explorer, should help get the runners over the line. “Fight the weak voice in your head at all times – that is the secret,” Fiennes, now 77, tells me one morning when we chat on the phone to discuss his involvement. Fiennes knows a thing or two about motivation. During one unsupported trek across Antarctica, he shed 25kg in 90 days, while hauling a 220kg sledge of food and equipment. He was eating 7,000 calories a day, he says, but the superhuman effort meant the pounds still fell off him. To keep himself moving on polar expeditions he would often imagine that the two people he respects most, his father and grandfather, both of whom died before he was born, were watching him as he travelled across the ice. “I don’t want to be the first in the group to give up but I am wanting to,” he said. “So in the tent every night . . . I am looking around at the other people in the group hoping that one of them will give up so I won’t be the first.” Whether Fiennes, a lover of the truly unbeaten track, would have signed up to run the Highland Kings if he were a decade or so younger, I am not certain. But for those who combine Fiennes’ sense of adventure with an appreciation for the finer things in life, Smith’s race promises a unique experience and possibly a taste of the next big trend in adventure travel.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/sustainability/air-quality-improved-covid-19-lockdowns-wmo-2155331,"Air quality improved briefly in 2020 during COVID-19 lockdowns, UN agency says","GENEVA: Key air pollutants temporarily plunged by unprecedented levels during COVID-19 lockdowns last year, with fine particle pollution falling by more than a third across parts of Asia, a United Nations agency said on Friday (Sep 3). Particulate matter (PM 2.5) fell by up to 40 per cent across Africa, South America and southern Asia and by smaller amounts in parts of Europe and North America, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said in its inaugural Air Quality and Climate Bulletin. It said COVID-19 lockdowns and travel restrictions led to a ""dramatic short-lived fall in emissions"" of key air pollutants, especially in urban areas. ""During episodes when there were lockdown measures the air quality in many parts of the world has substantially improved and the improvement was largely on the side of particles,"" said Oksana Tarasova, head of the organisation's atmospheric environment research division. The WMO bulletin, which compared 2020 air quality with 2015 to 2019 readings, showed that levels of harmful nitrogen dioxide emitted from the burning of fuel fell nearly everywhere and by as much as 70 per cent. Air pollution is the single greatest environmental risk factor for premature deaths globally. It is likely to reduce the life expectancy of about 40 per cent of Indians by more than nine years, a report showed this week. The decline in pollutants last year was too short-lived to have an impact on health, Tarasova said. She cited events such as wildfires in Australia, smoke from biomass burning in Siberia and the United States, and the ""Godzilla effect"" of sand and dust drifting from the Sahara Desert across the Atlantic to North America as adversely impacting air quality. The WMO bulletin also showed that ozone concentrations which can damage and inflame airways actually increased in some places last year. Tarasova said this was linked to lower nitrogen oxide levels which usually destroy the harmful gases."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/doctor-antibiotics-antifungal-medication-children-autism-singapore-smc-2155246,"Doctor ordered to temporarily stop prescribing antibiotics, antifungal medication to children after specialists complain","SINGAPORE: A doctor has been ordered to not “recommend, prescribe or administer” an antibiotic and an antifungal medication for the next 18 months to children aged seven or under, after complaints from four hospital specialists. Dr Erwin Kay Aih Boon, a general practitioner in private practice at Healthwerkz Medical Centre, had prescribed antibiotic Vancomycin and antifungal medication Fluconazole – trade name Diflucan – to children with autism. The Singapore Medical Council (SMC) said these were “strong” medications, which are potentially dangerous and harmful if prescribed “without scientific basis”. According to the grounds of decision published on Thursday (Sep 2), the Interim Orders Committee has ordered Dr Kay to temporarily stop prescribing the two medications to children. It comes after four paediatricians in a hospital, which was unnamed in the grounds, complained to the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) about Dr Kay’s management of children with autism. They said his management of the children were “not based on evidence”, the grounds read. “Hospital A’s paediatricians were of the view the use of antibiotics and antifungal agents for the treatment of children with (autism spectrum disorders) was unnecessary and had the potential for harm,” said the committee in its grounds. The paediatricians requested SMC to investigate Dr Kay’s practices further, and stated that he “may not be adhering to the current recommended clinical practice guidelines for the investigation and treatment of children with autism spectrum disorders”. They said there was “no evidence” to support treatment with antibiotics or other alternative therapies. A complaints committee found that at least three children with autism or suspected autism who were treated by Dr Kay had been prescribed antibiotics and antifungal medications. Two children – aged three and five – were prescribed both medications, while the third, who was three, was given five bottles of the antibiotic. Dr Kay, who has been a general practitioner for 25 years, defended his actions and said the committee did not need to make such an order. He said both medications are “therapeutic products locally registered” with the Health Sciences Authority, and that both are safe and approved for use in children. He added that he did not treat these patients’ autism spectrum disorder as they were already being seen at Hospital A for that condition. The general practitioner told the committee he had treated their “co-occurring medical conditions” associated with autism spectrum disorder. That included prescribing antibiotics and antifungal agents to treat the bacterial overgrowth or infections, and yeast or fungal overgrowth or infections respectively. SMC said according to the clinical practice guidelines, antibiotics and anti-yeast medications are “complementary alternative therapies” that are not recommended in pre-school children with autism spectrum disorder because of insufficient evidence for efficacy and potential harm or adverse effects. Evidence on the antibiotic’s efficacy in children with autism was “inconclusive”, said the council, adding that there are “serious adverse effects” associated with the “indiscriminate use of antibiotics”. This includes the emergence of antibiotics-resistant bacteria. “Chronic use of anti-fungal therapy is associated with hepatotoxicity and exfoliative dermatitis,” said the SMC, according to the grounds. Two of the three patients were children on follow up in Hospital A for autism spectrum disorders. Hospital A assesses and manages children from birth to seven years of age with a range of learning, behavioural and developmental needs, including autism. When they were seen by a paediatrician there, the two patients were ordered to stop taking the medications. “Hospital A’s paediatricians’ allegations are serious and if true, that is that Dr Kay is prescribing antibiotic and antifungal medications unnecessarily without scientific basis, would mean that Dr Kay is needlessly subjecting young children with (autism spectrum disorders) to the harm that the consumption of Vancomycin and/or Fluconazole may cause,” said the SMC. “Given the vulnerability of these children, the consequences of the risk materialising would be severe.” The SMC asked for an interim order to stop Dr Kay from prescribing the medications for 18 months, as the complaint was still pending before the complaints committee. The complaints committee has yet to determine if the case should be referred for formal inquiry by a disciplinary tribunal. The SMC said that it is not up to interim orders committee to determine if harm was caused by the prescription of Vancomycin and Fluconazole, but it has to consider the risk and the nature of the harm to the public. Dr Kay maintained that he did not treat the patients’ autism spectrum disorders, but he did treat their other medical conditions. He said his prescription of the medications to the children was “clinically indicated” and that it was “supported by scientific evidence and safe”, according to the grounds. He said there were “clear medical grounds”, arrived at through sufficient clinical information, “obtained through history-taking, clinical findings, and relevant investigations”. The general practitioner detailed the patients’ cases. In the case of the two-year-old child, who was diagnosed with severe autism, his mother told Dr Kay he had eczema, poor immune status, constipation and behavioural issues, such as hyperactivity, irritability and frequent meltdowns. “Dr Kay suspected a gastrointestinal issue given its prevalence in children with autism spectrum disorders,” said the grounds. “Patient B was also noted to exhibit inappropriate laughing, giggling, inattention, high pitched squealing, sugar cravings and skin rashes, which were symptoms suggestive of a yeast infection. These are generally accepted signs and symptoms of yeast overgrowth and consistent with observations.” He said he had explained the risks of both medications to the child’s parents, and that they understood the risk and benefits. The boy was given the antibiotics and antifungal medication, and his health condition “improved notably”, said the grounds. Another patient who has autism had aberrant eating behaviour, hyperactivity, and sleeping problems. The patient’s mother reported acutely increased inappropriate laughter and “silly behaviour suggestive of yeast symptoms”, said the grounds. Dr Kay suspected a gastrointestinal disorder and a possible yeast infection, and ordered a test which showed markers of bacterial and yeast metabolites, indicating dysbiosis. He offered various options to the patient’s mother and she chose to go for a short course of antibiotics and antifungal agents, said the grounds, adding that “notable improvements” were reported. The parents of the third patient also agreed to a trial of the antibiotics, after Dr Kay diagnosed her with acute gut bacterial infection. She eventually stopped crying without reason and her sleep improved. With all three patients, their parents provided testimonials, said the grounds. None of the three patients suffered any side effects due to the antibiotics and “instead benefited from the medication”, Dr Kay said, according to the grounds. Dr Kay said his prescription with the medications was according to “best practices” he learnt from training by attending various accredited conferences and training programmes, adding that there was no evidence he posed any risk to the public. The interim orders committee said it is of the view that there will be “risks of potential harm” to the public if Dr Kay is not restricted from prescribing Fluconazole and Vancomycin to young children below the age of seven. This is pending the complaint committee’s proceedings, and if the complaint is referred to the disciplinary tribunal. Lawyers on both sides agree it is not for the committee to decide if Dr Kay’s prescription of the medications were based on scientific evidence or is generally acceptable medical practice. The committee said it agrees that public trust and confidence in the medical profession “may be undermined” if it is made known that four specialists in paediatric medicine had raised concerns regarding Dr Kay’s conduct, yet he was allowed to continue without restrictions. “On the other hand, Dr Kay’s current practice would face little disruption if he is simply prohibited from prescribing such medication to children below the age of seven,” said the grounds."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-vaccine-booster-shots-seniors-immunocompromised-elderly-care-homes-2154791,"Singapore to offer COVID-19 vaccine booster shots to seniors, some immunocompromised people","SINGAPORE: Singapore will offer COVID-19 vaccine booster shots to people who are moderately to severely immunocompromised, as well as people aged 60 and above, and residents of aged care facilities. The Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination have evaluated the need for booster shots, said co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force Gan Kim Yong on Friday (Sep 3). Having reviewed the available evidence and scrutinised the safety and efficacy of booster doses administered globally, the committee has recommended, and MOH has agreed, to start a booster programme for these groups of people. Seniors are at risk of severe COVID-19 infection and may develop a lower immune response from their two-dose vaccination regimen, said MOH. This is coupled with the expected decline of their immunity over time, as many were vaccinated earlier, added the Health Ministry. They should receive a booster dose of an mRNA vaccine about six to nine months after having completed their primary course of vaccination regimen. This is to ""ensure higher levels of protection from infection and continued high levels of protection against severe disease, and reduce the possibility of spikes in infections and more people falling severely ill"", said MOH. About six months have passed since the first batch of seniors aged 60 and above completed their second doses in March under the national vaccination programme. They will be eligible for the third dose within this month, said MOH, adding that more details on the implementation of the booster shot will be announced later. Immunocompromised persons have a ""blunted immune response"" to vaccination, and are also at a higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19, said the Health Ministry. ""These individuals are recommended to receive a third dose of the same mRNA vaccine two months after their second dose as part of their primary course of vaccination to ensure that they start off with an adequate protective immune response to vaccination,"" said MOH. Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said that immunocompromised individuals will be contacted by their doctors. Mr Ong added that with new variants, there have been more breakthrough infections despite vaccinations, and that the strength of protection decreases as antibodies wane over time. ""In Singapore, our data shows that the ability of vaccination to prevent any COVID-19 infection is around 40 per cent. Second observation is, despite this, vaccines continue to be very effective in protecting against severe illnesses and deaths, should you be infected,"" said Mr Ong. This is because even when the antibodies wane, memory cells in the body have learnt how to produce new antibodies the next time they meet the coronavirus. The percentage of vaccinated people infected with COVID-19 who get very sick or die is 1.3 per cent compared to 9.2 per cent for unvaccinated people, he said. A booster programme will pre-empt a very sharp rise in breakthrough infections which can still lead, in absolute terms, to many deaths or cases of severe illness, said Mr Ong. ""This is especially relevant to the elderly and to other higher-risk groups,"" he said. A number of countries have started or are planning to give their population booster shots, including Israel, United Kingdom, Germany and France. The US Food and Drug Administration has also approved a third dose for immunocompromised individuals and is considering the recommendation for seniors. Mr Ong said that 81 per cent of Singapore's population has completed the full vaccination regimen. The expert committee will continue to review the evidence and data for other groups. One area it will pay specific attention to is the rare but more severe adverse reactions to vaccines that occur mostly in the younger age group. Another area of study will be whether using a different brand of vaccine for the booster shot will be more effective than using the same vaccine as the first two doses. ""Many parents have asked me about vaccination for children. I believe this will happen, but it may take some time because clinical trials are ongoing for those aged below 12 years,"" said Mr Ong. MOH expects vaccination for children to start early next year after the studies are completed and regulatory approval processes are carried out, he added. A pilot for a home recovery scheme will also be starting. Mr Ong said that in the coming weeks, about 50 COVID-19 cases are expected to be allowed to recover at home. The pilot will aim to smoothen operations before the programme is expanded. ""If you find that you have a neighbour infected and recovering from home, you cannot meet him, because he will be isolated in his room. But please, give him your full understanding and full moral support,"" said Mr Ong. Watch the full news conference and Q&A session with journalists: "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/style-beauty/skin-breakout-caused-dirty-facial-cleansing-devices-2110766,Ever wondered just how dirty your old bath sponge and facial brush are?,"Many of us keep an entire arsenal of beauty essentials in our bathroom. Besides skincare and body-care products, these also include tools such as your electronic facial-cleansing device or brush, or perhaps a washcloth and a sponge or two.  You’re probably using them daily to keep your skin clean, but have you ever considered how clean these tools and devices actually are, before applying them to your face and body? As we all know, microbes thrive in a warm, moist environment, which is the exact condition that exists in most bathrooms.  It could be worse, should your bathroom not have any windows – mould may grow on damp surfaces, and these include those on your sponges, towels and cleansing devices.  Dr Kok Wai Leong, a dermatologist at DS Skin & Wellness Clinic, explained that bathrooms can indeed be a breeding ground for micro-organisms like bacteria, fungi and even viruses.  “This is primarily due to the humid environment, lack of ventilation, as well as the sources for physical contamination. These factors contribute to the accelerated growth of microbes,” he said. While not a lot has been said or written about the cleanliness of cleansing devices stored in the bathroom, much has been revealed about bacteria found on makeup tools.  “There has been prior laboratory research showing that used makeup brushes and sponges contain significant amounts of bacteria. This may be a result of inadequate washing, improper sanitisation or incomplete drying before storage,” explained Dr Kok. If this is true of makeup tools kept on top of your vanity or in its drawers, imagine how much more bacteria can breed on your cleansing tools that are in the bathroom, which provides microbes with a much more hospitable “home”. You might argue – so what if there is bacteria on these beauty tools? Doesn’t bacteria always exist on our skin, anyway?  “There are micro-organisms that naturally occur on the skin. The current understanding is that most of these skin microbes are harmless, and even play essential roles in maintaining skin health. However, in predisposed individuals with existing skin conditions or impaired immune systems, their presence may cause skin disease or flare-ups,” said Dr Kok. He further explained that microbes from contaminated products or tools transferred to the skin can alter the balance of the resident micro-organisms. This disruption may lead to interactions that cause the development of skin inflammation. This is bad news for those with skin problems. “Existing skin conditions may be aggravated, for example, in patients with skin sensitivity or eczema, where the skin barrier function is already compromised, or those with existing acne. The re-introduction of residual oil and bacteria from the applicator to the face causes flares of eczema, infections or may worsen acne,” he said. So, if you are thinking about introducing one of these tools into your skincare or body-care routine, know that it will also require you to invest some effort into keeping them sanitary.  Here’s what you should know about cleaning them thoroughly so that they are safe for use on your skin. ELECTRONIC SKINCARE DEVICES Devices such as facial-cleansing brushes are designed to last for a long time, subject to the frequency and conditions of use. However, these need to be cleaned from time to time to ensure that they remain hygienic for use. Some brands that utilise silicone bristles in their product claim that the material is bacteria-resistant. But Dr Kok is of the opinion that the protective effect against bacteria remains controversial.  “While there have been some studies showing that polymer coating or silicone material have anti-microbial effects, it is also widely reported that bacteria may still colonise these surfaces with time. It is important to note that such effects also may not be long-lasting and the tool will require replacement after prolonged use. I would emphasise the need for proper cleansing to prevent contamination,” he said.  Which is why it’s a good idea to wash the bristles, no matter if they are made from nylon or silicone, with a gentle-formula soap and water – once a week if you’re using it daily or every two weeks or so if you are using it less frequently. Also note that nylon bristles tend to wear out after a period of use and may harbour more bacteria when they are worn out. Such devices typically come with brush heads that can removed and replaced – follow the advice or instructions provided with your device and replace the brush heads according to the time period specified. Most importantly, do not leave your cleansing device in a dripping-wet state on the bathroom counter after use, as the moisture will encourage the growth of bacteria and mould. It’s best to leave it a well-ventilated area to dry thoroughly before the next use. FACIAL MUSLINS AND WASHCLOTHS Most people typically use a washcloth to massage their skin after applying facial cleanser, or they use it to wipe off the cleanser along with any makeup residue. Does that mean that the cloth remains clean after use, since it’s already “soaped” while you were using it with your facial cleanser? No, because dirt from your face and makeup residue can actually stick to the washcloth after use. It’s best to wash your face cloth with gentle-formula soap and water after every use to remove dirt from the fibre. If you are using the cloth with an emollient cleansing balm, you’ll need to clean it even more thoroughly to remove any traces of oil left from the product. Hang it up in a well-ventilated area to dry completely before the next use. Instead of repeatedly using just one washcloth day after day, it’s a good idea to buy multiple pieces so that you can use them on a rotational basis. This will also allow enough time for you to wash and dry each one thoroughly before they go back into storage. Every now and then, give all your wash cloths a deep cleansing by soaking these in a mixture of warm water and laundry detergent (use one for delicates if you have it) for about 15 minutes before rinsing them out. Don’t hold on to your washcloths if they have become stiff and stained, and are no better even after a thorough scrub and wash – it’s definitely high time to throw them out and buy some new ones. LOOFAHS, BATH SPONGES AND SCRUBBING TOWELS First up, we need to make it clear that the use of these bath accessories is not recommended. According to Dr Kok, sponges and scrubbing cloths may cause friction and micro-tears, especially when excessive force is applied to the skin of the body.  “These cuts and abrasions become a portal of entry for unwanted micro-organisms from contaminated applicators. Moreover, friction from these tools strips the skin of its barrier function, thereby doing more harm than perceived,” he explained. This is why it is ever more crucial to keep your loofah, bath sponge or scrubbing towel sanitary, if you simply must use one of these in the bath or shower. Do not leave them to dry in the shower area – instead, take them out of the bathroom after each use and hang them up in a cool, ventilated place where they can air-dry completely. Soak them every now and then in a warm solution of water mixed with some laundry detergent, then rinse them out and air-dry thoroughly. To use these bath accessories safely without harming skin, they will need to be replaced quite often – once a month if you are using them frequently.  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/in-focus-social-egg-freezing-women-2137286,IN FOCUS: Is the time right to allow women to choose to freeze their eggs?,"SINGAPORE: When she was in her early 30s, Ms Tan was in a serious relationship with a man she thought she would marry. When that didn't work out, she still wanted to have children eventually – and this led her to explore the option of egg freezing. At the age of 35, she went to freeze her eggs in Valencia, Spain. She didn’t want a biological “ticking clock” to influence her decision on getting married, she told CNA. She was referring to the natural decline over time in the quantity and quality of her eggs.  “I knew I wanted a family, but I didn't want to make any rushed, impulsive kind of decision. So, by freezing my eggs, it gave me like a form of insurance,” she said. Now 39, Ms Tan (she didn't want her full name to be published) has frozen her eggs twice. The second time was in Kuala Lumpur and while that was closer to home, she wishes she had been able to have the procedure done in Singapore.  “That would have made things so much easier, more convenient. I think it might have been more cost-effective as well,” said Ms Tan, who spent about S$20,000 in total on the two procedures. Women like Ms Tan have to go overseas for the elective procedure known as ""social egg freezing"" because it is currently banned in Singapore.  However, freezing of eggs is allowed for medical reasons, such as for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy that may affect their fertility. Some groups here are lobbying to change the situation. In July, the People's Action Party's (PAP) Women's Wing and Young PAP released a joint paper on women’s development that recommended allowing the procedure for non-medical reasons. The groups also suggested putting in place a regulatory framework to impose conditions or limit the use of eggs to certain circumstances, such as “only within the confines of marriage”. Egg freezing involves retrieving a woman’s eggs, freezing and storing them. The eggs then stop ageing and can be warmed and fertilised with sperm when needed. Upon successful fertilisation, the eggs are transferred to the uterus as embryos. The process involves the woman undergoing hormone injections for an average of 10 to 14 days. She will have to go for regular blood tests and ultrasound scans to monitor her response to the injections, said Dr Lim Min Yu of Astra Women’s Specialists. When there are sufficient mature follicles in her ovaries, the woman will have a ""trigger"" injection to prepare the eggs for egg collection, he said. Egg collection is done in an operating theatre, with the woman under sedation or a general anaesthetic. The collected eggs are then frozen by a method known as vitrification, or ultra-rapid freezing, and stored in special liquid nitrogen containers until it is time for them to be warmed up and fertilised. The risks of egg freezing are the same as for women undergoing an in-vitro fertilisation cycle, including “some pain and bruising” at the injection sites, said Dr Lim. “There may be mood or emotional changes in response to the hormone injections, and there is a risk of a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, where the ovaries become swollen, and fluid can accumulate in the abdomen,” the fertility specialist said.  The Government reiterated its position on social egg freezing last year. The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) said in response to a question in Parliament that it was ""carefully reviewing"" the matter of extending egg freezing to be allowed beyond medical grounds.  MSF acknowledged that social egg freezing ""may benefit some women because of their personal circumstances"", such as not being able to find a partner and wanting to preserve their chances of conceiving if they marry later. ""However, we also have to take into account the ethical and social concerns over legalising social egg freezing, including inadvertently causing more to delay marriage or parenthood based on a misperception that they can have a child whenever they wish to,” MSF said. The ministry noted that the risks of developing complications during pregnancy also increase with age, “even if the child is conceived through a frozen egg”.  Singapore’s social issues and biological realities are among the reasons why some are advocating a review of the current policy. The position paper by the PAP Women's Wing and Young PAP, which said there is an “urgent need” to look into the issue, noted that the reproduction rate of Singaporean women has continued to decline over the past two decades. This is despite the availability of monetary and other social incentives put in place by the Government to encourage procreation.  Singapore's fertility rate reached a historic low of 1.1 babies per woman last year, compared to 1.6 in 2000, according to the latest data from the Singapore Department of Statistics.  Source: Singapore Department of Statistics Singaporean women who choose to pursue their career aspirations and delay marriage and childbirth reflect the “changing realities”, the paper said. “We should continue our efforts to make it conducive for people to marry and have children early, but we need to be cognisant of these current realities and consider pragmatic, multi-pronged approaches to address our declining birth rates and support women in their journey to motherhood,” it added.  MP Cheng Li Hui (PAP-Tampines), who is part of the PAP Women’s Wing, has been championing the cause since 2016. She found out about egg freezing after the topic came up in her conversations with young families in her ward. The women who want to freeze their eggs should be able to benefit from Singapore’s “world-class healthcare system”, Ms Cheng said. “We should give peace of mind to our ladies undergoing the process – nowhere better than here really,” she said, adding that the procedure could promote medical tourism.  “Now more than ever, the ladies who have been wanting to freeze eggs in the last two years … They can't. In the last two years, their quality of eggs would have dropped, the quantity of eggs would also have dropped,” she said, referring to the limits the COVID-19 pandemic has placed on international travel. Ms Cheng acknowledged that some are against the idea of egg freezing. A survey she did in 2019 with more than 700 respondents found that 63 per cent supported egg freezing. Among those who did not, a common concern was that allowing the procedure would encourage people who are not in a traditional family nucleus, such as same-sex couples and single women, to have children, she said. The National Council of Churches released a statement in 2019 on its stand against egg freezing for non-medical reasons. In the statement, which explored ethical and social issues, the NCCS said it is “unable to support the legalisation of social egg freezing because of the serious ethical and social issues it raises”. “The fundamental problem with social egg freezing is that this technology is used for non-medical reasons. The technology is not used to treat a particular pathology or to prevent an illness but rather to facilitate and consequently promote a lifestyle option or preference,” the statement read. NCCS also called the elective procedure a “profoundly selfish act because it sees career as more important than the interests and welfare of the child”. Allowing social egg freezing would encourage women to postpone childbearing in order to ""have it all"", the council said. “The legalisation of social egg freezing reinforces a perspective on priorities that would have profound social implications.” On the point raised in the survey on non-traditional family structures, the recommendation by the two branches of the PAP is for the use of eggs to be allowed when a woman is married, Ms Cheng pointed out. She stressed that the procedure would be elective. “I would think that if it is allowed and you're against it, don’t do it. But don't make the rest of society follow your rules,” she said.  Associate Professor Tan Ern Ser from the department of sociology at the National University of Singapore noted that the “key factor” for delayed marriage and childbirth thus far has been the priorities women placed on career aspirations, together with work practices that are not entirely friendly to having children, even with the ban on social egg freezing in place. He suggested that women should have the “freedom to choose”. “Women should have the right to pursue what they consider to be their priorities, including when to have children,” he said.  If the country wants to raise the fertility rate, it should use incentives and make work-life practices friendly, and “not apply direct or indirect pressure”, he said. “As a sociologist, I’d argue that social egg freezing would empower women further,” he said. Apart from career aspirations and not being able to find a partner, there may be other reasons why some women delay starting a family, according to Ms Emma Zhang, who set up a page called “myeggsmytime” on Instagram. The women she encountered through the page have reasons that range from having to care for elderly parents to not being financially stable enough, said the 31-year-old freelance content strategist.  “The Government needs to realise that should any woman choose to give birth later in life and take on the risk, she does so for the sake of her unborn child,” she told CNA. “What’s the point of having children young if one is unable to provide for them emotionally and financially, especially in a society that places so much emphasis on success. Sometimes you can’t have it all now – but you can have it later. What’s wrong with that?” she asked. She added that “most importantly”, if a woman chooses to give birth later, that is “her right”. Ms Cheng said that egg freezing is not a decision that will be taken lightly. “It’s not a simple procedure. This procedure requires you to jab yourself every day. And there is a procedure to extract the eggs, so it’s not risk-free. It’s not fun. Why would a person want to go through it? It's only because they want to preserve that right to be a mother.” She said that women may not have been able to find a partner earlier in their lives. Egg quality is the “most important factor” in the chances of successful pregnancy, said Dr Lim. However, he noted that a woman is born with all the eggs she will ever have.  As she becomes older, both the quantity and quality of her eggs will diminish, he said. “The younger the egg, the higher the chance of pregnancy. The chances reduce after the age of 35, and even more steeply after the age of 40,” he said.  Elective egg freezing allows women to take action about the drop in their fertility, he said, adding that the chances of success are “much higher” if eggs are frozen before the woman reaches 35 years old.  Dr Suresh Nair from fertility centre Seed of Life in Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital similarly said the quality of eggs has a “precipitous drop” from age 34. With the option of freezing eggs, at the age of 34 with 20 extracted mature eggs, the chances of one successful birth is 90 per cent, Dr Nair said, quoting published research on the subject. This chance of success drops to 75 per cent for a 37-year-old woman, he said.  “Women don't really tend to start appreciating this (the decline in fertility) until they are 36, 37, 38 (years old),” he said. Dr Nair said that while getting pregnant at an older age comes with its own medical risks, these can be managed. “There's a higher chance of Caesarean sections, higher chance of diabetes, higher chance of hypertension no doubt, but we don't think is terribly problematic, so the only thing that suffers is eggs,” he said. Both doctors said that there is a need to educate the public about the decline in female fertility with age. For 32-year-old Stephanie Zheng, who has been married for two years, being allowed to freeze her eggs would give her time to be ready to be a mother. “Basically, I’m trying to get my life on track to do all the things that I want to do first, before I think about having enough money and enough time and effort to nurture another human being,” said Ms Zheng, who holds a full-time job and manages two side businesses. She said that if she wants a child at a later age, it would be her “torch to carry” even if it means her body may not be as strong. “If I can't get a child, then it's also sort of on me. But at least I have that option ... if we have the resources to do so, to freeze our eggs, then we should have that choice.” "
