Teacher Angel Low, 28, feared the worst when her cat, Ben, did not return home on Monday night, after she learnt that a reticulated python with a bulging belly had been caught earlier that day. ""Ben usually comes back when my mum calls him. We suspected that something was wrong when we saw the python's belly in a video shared by other residents and immediately contacted the Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (Acres), which had removed the snake,"" said Ms Low. Her three-year-old tabby cat weighed about 6kg, she said. To her family's horror, they learnt the next day that the python had vomited their pet's carcass while the reptile was being transported to the Singapore Zoo. But it was too late for them to retrieve the carcass, which was thrown out by staff. ""I wish they had been a bit more sensitive in handling the issue... especially when my cat had a collar,"" said Ms Low, who felt that the staff could have taken the trouble to find out if the cat belonged to someone. Responding to queries from The Straits Times, Mandai Wildlife Group and Acres said the python was taken to the group’s animal hospital, which is the central processing point for all rescued pythons in Singapore. On the way to the hospital, the snake regurgitated the cat, and when scanned at the hospital, the carcass had no microchip indicating its origin, they said. “Acres made a call to the security officer to provide an update and was informed that no reports of a missing cat had been made up until then. After a discussion between the two organisations, the body was carefully disposed of, in accordance with the zoo’s standard protocols for biosecurity,” they added. Following the incident, the veterinary department at Mandai Wildlife Group is reviewing its processes to temporarily keep dead domestic animals taken to the hospital, they said. This was the first time Ms Low and her family, who live in a three-storey house, had seen a snake at D'Manor since they moved into the estate more than 10 years ago. Ms Low said they were surprised to see one as the condominium is not near any nature areas. ""My mum is devastated because she was very close to Ben, whom we've had since he was one week old. He was a very sweet cat that wouldn't hurt anyone and would cuddle up to us when we were upset."" ""Every time we think about what happened, we still cry,"" she added. Ben liked to sun himself so the family allowed him to roam the compound, she said, adding that the cat would return home on its own. After the incident, they are now more vigilant of the whereabouts of their six-year-old dog and two other cats. Reticulated pythons, which are native to Singapore, can grow up to 10m and eat mammals ranging from mice to deer, according to the National Parks Board's (NParks) website. They have been known to devour pets, including cats, birds and dogs. Reticulated pythons are regularly spotted in urban storm drains and play an important role in controlling the population of rats, said Mr Sankar Ananthanarayanan, president of the Herpetological Society of Singapore. He added: ""Our hearts go out to the family of the cat, and we sincerely hope they find closure from this incident. ""These animals do not mean us any harm. It is advisable not to let house pets outdoors unsupervised. In general, keep a safe distance from wildlife."" Said Acres co-chief executive Kalai Vanan Balakrishnan: “While such occurrences of snakes preying on pets are not common,  we are living in increasingly integrated environments that may result in more wildlife encounters. “It is advised to keep a close eye on pets when outdoors and use a leash if possible or keep pets safely indoors for the well-being of both the pets and other wildlife such as snakes.” People who come across snakes in a public area or on their property should call NParks’ 24-hour Animal Response Centre on 1800-476-1600.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/ted-chen-evercomm-rolex-we-the-earth-singapore-sensors-eco-warrior-sustainability-environment,Data to counter climate change: How his firm gets everyone to play a part in protecting the planet ,"  Dealing with climate change may seem like something that requires global action, but this company believes every person can lessen their impact with their tech innovation. You may look for the energy star when buying appliances, replace lights, and use renewables, but have no idea how much carbon footprint you are actually reducing.  A pilot project tracking local carbon emissions, between sustainability business Evercomm and the Pan Pacific Hotels Group, aims to keep you informed about how you’re helping to protect the environment on your next staycation. In the near future, guests at the group’s hotels in Singapore will get a breakdown of their electricity and water usage, and resulting carbon dioxide emission, at the end of their stay.  With this awareness, Mr Ted Chen, 32, Evercomm’s co-founder and chief executive, says: “We hope that this will motivate people to make simple changes to limit their carbon footprint.”.   His keen interest and desire to develop ways to conserve energy started in his years as an undergraduate at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in the late 2000s. He and his fellow electrical engineering coursemate Phyo Ko Ko took part in hackathons on energy management, where the idea for their business evolved. Mr Chen and co-founder and chief innovation officer Mr Phyo, 37, set up Evercomm in 2013. “I was interested in sustainability and engineering, and it made sense to try and merge my two passions,” Mr Chen shares.  With advice from NTUitive, the university’s innovation and enterprise incubator, they refined their pitch and landed GlobalFoundries as their first customer in 2013. Still, the company’s early years were a struggle.  Mr Chen recalls: “Sustainability was not mainstream back then. The only firms that showed some interest were the large industrial entities – semiconductor firms, data centres, high-end manufacturers – because they used a lot of energy and could cut costs. Even then, it took a lot of convincing because they were not sure the effort would be worth the savings.” Evercomm offered free trials of its technology that lasted four to six months, to prove its value proposition. “The moment we showed them the data from their production floor, how much wastage there was and how much they could save, most of them came on board.”  Since then, Evercomm has helped hundreds of companies to find cost-effective ways to minimise their energy, water and other resource use, averting four tonnes of carbon emissions annually. Evercomm has offices in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar and Taiwan, and counts semiconductor giant GlobalFoundries, the National Dong Hwa University in Taiwan, and the General Electric conglomerate as its clients.  “We use sensors and artificial intelligence to answer three essential questions for firms: how much they are consuming, how much they actually need, and how much they are wasting. It is amazing how much you can save just by optimising existing equipment,” he explains.  The Singapore government has lauded the firm for “addressing global problems such as food wastage, climate change and excessive energy consumption”.  As the company sought to win clients, it worked on improving its offerings.  “At the beginning, we had analysts who studied the collected data to make cost-cutting recommendations, but we realised this was not so scalable, so we invested in artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. These can self-learn and tailor solutions for different firms,” says Mr Chen, who was named one of Forbes magazine’s 30 changemakers under 30 years old to watch in Asia in 2016, in the manufacturing and energy sector. “For a factory that produces around the clock, our system can suggest more efficient settings for equipment that cannot be switched off. For a site that does ramp down regularly, it can optimise the production schedule to save even more electricity. There are lots of ways we can finetune operations.” By 2019, more businesses and organisations had signed onto Evercomm’s sustainability vision.  The National Dong Hwa University, for instance, has saved between five and 10 per cent in its electrical consumption by using Evercomm’s energy analytics system.  “By combining software and sensors, we can track, among other things, how much cooling a room needs, and adjust the cooling system’s air flow and temperature,” Mr Chen says. The firm is currently replicating its approach for Thailand’s Chiang Mai University. While the Covid-19 pandemic threatened to derail the company’s growth, it surprisingly accelerated it instead.  Mr Chen elaborates: “The start of the pandemic was difficult. Many of our hospitality customers were out of commission, and even manufacturers weren’t thinking about optimisation anymore.” Evercomm pivoted to marketing its systems as digital solutions for firms trying to cope with manpower restrictions. Food businesses used its monitoring technology to keep tabs on the temperature of their warehouses, cold rooms and freezer rooms, so they did not have to deploy staff to check and record the temperatures every few hours.  With the pandemic raising awareness of sustainability issues, and governments worldwide committing to green development plans, however, demand for Evercomm’s services not only recovered but soared. “Before Covid-19, we were signing seven to 10 customers per year. Last year, we had nearly 70 new customers. It’s clear that there has been a big change in the attitude towards sustainability,” Mr Chen says. Sources: Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction and Building and Construction Authority   The company has found a new niche too, in helping firms to collect and verify the data that they need to apply for green loans from banks and other institutions. It also co-founded CO2 Connect, an online platform launched in October last year, to enable small and medium enterprises to easily track their carbon footprint for benchmarking, green certification and other purposes. Mr Chen, who has consulted for and partnered with the United Nations Development Programme on several projects, including advising the Philippines government on how to promote green financing, stressed the importance of advancing sustainability.  “If you look at the Asia-Pacific region, we are not on track for any of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. None. The impact of climate change is only going to get worse, and more countries, more people and more businesses will be affected,” he says.  “We need to do more to support a grassroots approach to sustainability, so that everyone is involved in protecting the planet for our future.” We The Earth is a partnership between The Straits Times and Rolex and its Perpetual Planet initiative. Mr Ted Chen from Evercomm is a stellar example of the many individuals who are doing their part to solve the issues earth faces. "

It could be hot, hot, hot – 40 deg C on some days – by 2045 here. You would be in your 30s: Imagine the unforgiving sun beating down on your back as you dash out at lunchtime to buy lunch. Should you care? After all, you could simply turn the air-conditioner to a lower temperature, and turn up the fan to a higher speed. Well, yes. Today, the effects of a warmer world are felt most harshly by people who work outdoors – from engineers and architects who survey work sites, or even physical education teachers to gardeners – as well as people who live in less ventilated places.  The elderly also suffer more, as their bodies are more prone to heat-related illnesses. For instance, their sweat glands may be less efficient, so they are unable to lose excess heat easily. Other than humans, animals suffer too. For instance, cattle that are overheated will produce less milk and are less able to conceive. The warmer oceans and seas also are causing algal blooms (when algae grows rapidly on the water surface), bleaching corals and decreased oxygen levels in the water. How else do you think warmer temperatures would hurt this earth and its inhabitants, and what do you think your role would be? While the effects of climate change will likely be different depending on each region, life is set to get harder for everyone everywhere around the world. Erratic climate conditions means that not only are some places facing searing heat, but that many others are facing another catastrophe – rising sea levels.  Many coastal or low-lying areas are already facing the threats of constant floods, as increasingly warm temperatures cause the ice at the earth’s poles to melt.  Besides disrupting the habitats of animals such as polar bears and penguins, the melting ice will also flow into the oceans. Since water expands when it becomes warmer, it will take up more space in the oceans, which will raise sea levels. Low-lying areas may become submerged in the future. Singapore is one of the countries that is facing that risk. The country has experienced some of its worst flash floods in the last few years. With climate change, this could get worse. About 30 per cent of all land in Singapore is less than 5m above sea level. Because of that, the country is already taking steps to protect its coasts. One way it is doing that is by conducting studies that will help develop coastal protection measures for Singapore’s coastlines. Another way is to ensure that new developments will be built at least 5m above sea level. How else do you think rising sea levels would hurt this earth and its inhabitants in the future, and what do you think your role would be? Climate change is hastening the loss of animal species and habitats all around the world. When animal species and habitats disappear, in a process called biodiversity loss, food supplies, jobs, economies and human health are threatened. However, many conservation projects around the world are helping to bring back endangered and extinct wildlife species. For example, in Australia, an endangered mammal has been reintroduced after disappearing more than 100 years ago. The brush-tailed bettong, also known as the woylie or “rat kangaroo”, is about the size of a rabbit and moves around with a springy hop. While it used to be found in many areas in Australia, experts said that the species was almost wiped out when cats and foxes were introduced by Europeans.  Last year, 12 male and 28 female woylies were reintroduced to South Australia. Woylies help to improve habitats for other species by dispersing seeds and nutrients while digging up tonnes of soil. Meanwhile, an endangered wild horse species known as the Przewalski’s horse was once extinct in China. But now, the country is home to 800 of the horses after the species was first reintroduced in 1985. There are many animal species that are native to Singapore. What role do you think you can play in the future, should any of them face the danger of extinction? Right now, car mechanics may mostly do repair work on “traditional” vehicles that run on petrol. But in the future, they may need to improve their skills so that they can repair an electric vehicle.  Likewise, a power engineer who is keen to be part of the green economy may need to learn more about hydrogen, solar and other renewable energies.  As Singapore works towards its sustainability goals, many workers here are keen to explore green jobs. Companies are also eager to hire workers to fill these roles. However, for the moment, firms here have not created enough of such jobs. And employees have not acquired enough green skills to take on the scarce openings that are available. This was the picture painted by several studies published earlier this year by various websites and consultancies. To address that, Singapore plans to provide more opportunities for people to equip themselves with the relevant skills so that they can benefit from the growing green economy. One example of a company that has taken steps to train its staff in sustainability is OCBC. Last year, the bank launched a suite of sustainability training modules to groom more subject experts within the bank. At that time, it had also created more than 50 sustainability-related jobs within the bank across various areas such as sustainability research, ESG (environmental, social and governance) assessment, and community development and environment conservation programmes. What sort of green jobs do you think would be available in the future? What role would you like to play in the green economy? Most young writers dive into developing their plots and characters to make their stories convincing. However, every good story needs a time and location to take place in – its setting. Your story’s setting will lend a sense of realism to your plot, and keep your reader engaged through the following ways:  1. Instead of merely describing the environment in your story, show how the characters interact with it, and how they feel being in that place. 2. Focus on details when describing your setting. If your story is set in the daytime, do not simply say it was a hazy morning. Describe how the sky looked or the air smelled like so that you can paint a vivid picture for the reader. 3. Use actual locations or buildings around you for inspiration. If your story takes place in the distant future, think about how such buildings will change in appearance as time passes, and describe those changes in your story as your character experiences being in these places. 1. Avoid having too many characters in a short story.  Having one or two main characters allows you to focus on developing their thoughts and feelings as the plot progresses. Try to refrain from having too many minor characters as this would mean your main character ends up as a very superficial figure in your short story. 2. The background of a character can be told through flashbacks. The past experiences of your main character allows the reader to understand his or her feelings better. 3. To make your characters more interesting, reveal their inner conflict through their reactions to events in the plot. For instance, take the time to elaborate on a character’s feelings when he realises something is beyond his control. Suspense in any short story gets the reader riveted to the storyline. Here are ways you can build a sense of excitement in the reader. Foreshadowing is a technique that writers use to hint at something that will occur later in the story. One type of foreshadowing could be through a detailed description of the setting. For instance, if your story does not have a positive ending, then you might foreshadow the conclusion with storm clouds in the distance to hint that danger is about to occur. Another way to build anxiety or uncertainty is through the use of onomatopoeia. This refers to the use of words that imitate the sounds one is trying to describe, such as “shriek”, “crash” and “creak”. These sound effects help to build suspense as your reader is provoked into an emotional response while reading your story. Try ending your short stories with the following methods: 1. Open endings Not every good ending has a resolution for your characters. Stories with open endings leave the reader guessing what might happen next. Such unexpected endings add an element of surprise and may even contain a twist in the tale. 2. Endings with reflections or morals of the story Though these may seem predictable, such stories tend to give personal insight, and can allow the reader to also ponder about an important life lesson, or the writer’s main message. 3. “Full circle” endings Such endings are challenging to write, as you will have to plan your plot cleverly such that the story ends as close as possible to how it begins. For instance, if your story begins with your main character standing on the beach looking at the sunset, it could end with him on the same beach, at sunrise. 1.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/carbon-credits-used-to-offset-carbon-tax-bill-in-singapore-must-meet-certain-criteria-nea,Carbon credits used to offset carbon tax bill in Singapore must meet certain criteria: NEA,"SINGAPORE - Large emitters in Singapore who plan to shrink their carbon tax bill by buying international carbon credits would only be able to do so if the credits meet certain criteria. At minimum, for instance, the credits must be certified by Verra or Gold Standard - two international organisations that have developed standards to ensure the carbon offsets they certify truly result in a reduction in the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The two bodies also have registries that list certified projects, enable the trading of carbon credits and allow ""used"" credits to be retired so the same credit cannot be used to offset the emissions of more than one party. The National Environment Agency (NEA), which oversees Singapore's carbon tax regulations, said on Monday (Aug 29) that it has signed agreements with Verra and Gold Standard, to pave the way for businesses here to offset their carbon tax bill. This update follows Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's announcement in February that businesses who must pay a carbon tax in Singapore can, from 2024, buy ""high-quality, international carbon credits"" to offset up to 5 per cent of taxable emissions, in lieu of paying the tax. Singapore's carbon tax applies to all facilities producing 25,000 tonnes or more of greenhouse gas emissions in a year. Said NEA in a LinkedIn post: ""Companies can acquire eligible high-quality carbon credits issued by Gold Standard and Verra, and surrender them to the Singapore Government, subject to the carbon credits meeting the prescribed criteria set by the Singapore Government."" The agency added that both Gold Standard and Verra have ""robust approaches and procedures to safeguard the environmental integrity of the carbon credits they issue"". The Straits Times understands that the full prescribed criteria for carbon credits that can be used under this scheme is still being worked out, as consultations between the Government and industry players are ongoing. But the latest update from NEA is the first time that the Government has given an indication of what it might consider a high-quality carbon credit - that at the very least the credits must be certified by Verra or Gold Standard. Carbon dioxide, produced from human activity like burning fossil fuels, is the main greenhouse gas driving climate change. Companies in emissions-intensive sectors, such as the petrochemical industry, that find it hard to shrink their carbon footprint in the short term can purchase carbon credits, from say, a forest restoration project elsewhere. Each carbon credit represents one tonne of emissions, so buyers of the credits can offset this amount from their total emissions. Singapore's carbon tax rate, which will be in place until 2023, is $5 per tonne of emissions. But this will go up to $25 in 2024 and 2025 and $45 in 2026 and 2027, before reaching $50 to $80 per tonne by 2030. Partially offsetting tax liabilities with international carbon credits would mean that companies can shrink their tax bill if they buy credits generated by, for example, a forest conservation project in Indonesia. Essentially, it means that a company here would have the option to pay another entity to reduce emissions in another jurisdiction, where it may be cheaper to do so. But a major problem with international carbon credits is that some of them can be of poor quality - meaning the projects that are the source of the credits do not actually have a positive impact on the climate. If poor quality carbon credits are bought by companies to offset their emissions, then it may result in emissions growing overall. Other than Verra and Gold Standard, there are at least four other standards for carbon offsets. Verra and Gold Standard are among the largest , with projects registered with Verra accounting for two-thirds of all voluntary carbon market transaction volume, said Ms Marissa Lee, a senior associate at consultancy Global Counsel, which advises companies on climate and sustainability policy. She noted that Climate Action Reserve and American Carbon Registry - the third and fourth largest certification programmes - are mainly active in North America. Ms Lee told The Straits Times that governments have to be careful about what kinds of credits they allow companies to count towards reducing their carbon tax obligations. ""If the bar is set too low, then companies can simply surrender poor quality, cheaper credits to the government instead of investing in decarbonisation,"" she added. The prices of carbon credits vary by project type more so than the standards used in their certification. For example, credits derived from projects that remove carbon from the atmosphere - such as a forestry project - trade at prices nearly five times higher than reduction-based offsets, such as those from a renewable energy project, said Ms Lee, citing data from Ecosystem Marketplace, an environmental finance site. ""This reflects how carbon removal projects that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere are more desirable but also scarcer, whereas credits from carbon reduction projects such as renewable energy projects are more abundant,"" she added. Ms Cherine Fok, director, sustainability services at professional services firm KPMG in Singapore, said Verra and Gold Standard are globally recognised frameworks, which are backed by consistent methodology, rigorous accreditation, verification processes and large volumes of use cases. Both have a track record of high reliability and relevance, she said.
 
“Ensuring that suitable criteria are in place and applied in a robust manner will be essential in maintaining the reputation of Singapore as a trustworthy carbon trading marketplace and economic hub,” added Ms Fok, who is also director of KPMG Impact, the firm’s sustainability arm."

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/rare-sambar-deer-killed-in-accident-on-bke,Rare sambar deer killed in accident on BKE,"SINGAPORE - A rare sambar deer was killed in an accident on the Bukit Timah Expressway (BKE) on Thursday night (Aug 25). Videos shared on social media show the animal lying motionless in the middle of the expressway, with vehicles passing by. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) tweeted shortly after 9.30pm on Thursday, warning motorists of an accident on the BKE - which separates the Bukit Timah and the Central Catchment nature reserves - towards Woodlands before the exit to the Kranji Expressway. Mr Muhammad Azhari said he was riding his motorcycle home on the BKE when the incident occurred a few vehicles ahead of him. ""I thought it was a wild boar or stray dog, which are more common roadkill,"" said the 28-year-old auxiliary police officer, adding that he helped direct traffic around the deer and called LTA's hotline. The National Parks Board (NParks) said it was aware of the incident. ""This is the only incident involving a sambar deer that we know of on an expressway this year,"" said NParks wildlife management group director Adrian Loo. Mr Kalai Vanan - the co-chief executive of animal welfare group Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (Acres) - said its wildlife rescue team received a call about a sambar deer on the BKE at about 10pm that day. ""Unfortunately, the team was stuck handling several other cases. We understand that the public contacted NParks as an alternative and they attended to the case,"" he said, adding that the area is known for the presence of sambar deer. ""This unfortunate animal likely ventured too near to residential areas by mistake, panicked and tried to cross the expressway. We hope that the motorists involved did not sustain any injuries,"" Mr Kalai said, adding that more fencing could help prevent such accidents. The deer may have been drawn by the sight of a forested area on the opposite side of the expressway, said a representative of the Singapore Sambar Deer Group, which monitors the endangered species here. ""It's their natural instinct to dash to the safety of the forest,"" he said. He described the dead deer as a very healthy mature adult male weighing approximately 160kg. He added that he was aware of another instance in December where a sambar deer was injured and subsequently died after making its way to the Senja area of Bukit Panjang. Listed as a vulnerable species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species, there are no more than 20 sambar deer in Singapore. In June 2018, a wild sambar deer was put down after it suffered severe injuries from wandering onto the BKE near Mandai Road and causing a three-vehicle accident. There were also two other instances of sambar deer dying after getting hit by vehicles in Mandai Road in February and December that year."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/clementi-forest-nature-trail-to-be-enhanced-public-helps-with-nature-survey,"Clementi Forest nature trail to be further enhanced, public helps with nature survey","SINGAPORE - The next phase of enhancements for an upcoming 2km nature trail within Clementi Forest will be done near sensitive areas along a stream, which is home to the common walking catfish and the globally critically endangered straw-headed bulbul. To minimise the recreational pathway's impact on the environment there, the National Parks Board (NParks) is roping in members of the public and environment consultants to help. This weekend (Aug 27 and 28), members of the public, including student volunteers, will help to survey and record the flora and fauna along Clementi Forest Stream, which is part of the upcoming Clementi Nature Trail. The data collected by the ""citizen scientists"" will help to guide habitat enhancement efforts for the area, such as the choice of plant species along the stream banks to support aquatic life, NParks said in a statement on Saturday (Aug 27). The biodiversity surveys will eventually be sent to environment consultants who will closely study how the development works near the stream will impact the plants and animal life, and come up with mitigation strategies. To this end, NParks has called for an environmental impact assessment to be done before the second phase of enhancement works are carried out at the trail. The assessment will cover pathways totalling 800m, which includes the stream and a path along the Bukit Timah First Diversion Canal. Last year, it was announced that two new nature trails running through Clementi Forest will be created and the 2km Clementi Nature Trail is one of them. This pathway will run from the Clementi Forest Stream to a new nature park in Ulu Pandan West. In the first phase of enhancements for the trail, work began last year on the middle stretch of the trail, south of the Bukit Timah First Diversion Canal. That stretch is about 500m long.  The second upcoming nature trail is the 4km Old Jurong Line Nature Trail which will run along a stretch of the old Jurong Railway Line. These trails will be progressively completed from 2023. The freshwater Clementi Forest Stream is home to various dragonflies, freshwater fish and amphibians. The biodiversity survey carried out by the public this weekend will cover the aquatic fauna, hydrology, dragonflies and vegetation along the stream, as well as bird species nearby. In addition, surveys using camera traps are also being carried out over two months to monitor wildlife in the area, NParks said. This will enable sightings, including nocturnal species, to be recorded in a manner that minimises disturbance to the animals. This weekend's surveys are led by student volunteers from the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University, and carried out by members from the Friends of Clementi-Ulu Pandan Nature Corridor - comprised of nature group members and residents. Mr Muhammad Nasry, who leads the Singapore Youth Voices for Biodiversity, participated in some of the surveys at the stream on Saturday. He hopes that the environment impact studies at the site will prioritise connectivity and wildlife movement, especially for animals that are not able to fly and need to rely more on how green spaces are designed. “Building structures like culverts to improve connectivity for frogs and other ground-dwelling species could be a good addition as well,” Mr Nasry added. Both the Clementi Nature Trail and the Old Jurong Line Nature Trail will be part of the recently identified Clementi Nature Corridor, comprising a series of linked green patches between Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and the Southern Ridges that wildlife can travel through.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/nparks-to-centralise-environmental-assessments-of-nature-sensitive-projects,NParks to centralise environmental assessments of nature-sensitive projects,"SINGAPORE - From next year, environmental consultants who assess the impact of development works on an area's plant and animal life will be managed by the National Parks Board (NParks) instead of the developers themselves. This move to centralise environmental impact assessments (EIAs) will enable NParks to work more closely with the consultants to raise the quality and rigour of their work and ensure urban developments are carried out in a sustainable manner. A key aim is to prevent miscommunication or mishaps, such as clearing of woodland that could lead to environmental damage and loss of wildlife.  ""In the past, the developers will manage the consultants and they check back with us... but now we are right in the centre of the action and this will certainly reduce miscommunication or sometimes (parties) forgetting to update us on certain key EIA results,"" said Mr Ryan Lee, group director of NParks' National Biodiversity Centre. The shift involves standardising methods for conducting wildlife surveys, said NParks on Saturday (Aug 27). Instead of developers calling their own EIA tenders, NParks will have a centralised tender that consultants can respond to, and it will also manage them directly on behalf of the developers. This will also allow NParks to gather information from various environmental impact studies to create a database that will provide resources for long-term monitoring and research of the areas studied, and how the areas connect to one another. This move will first be piloted early next year for new Housing Board (HDB) and JTC projects that require EIAs, before deciding to expand this to all government projects, said Minister for National Development Desmond Lee in a Facebook post on Saturday. ""Our assessment is that centralising the management of EIA consultancy services under NParks has many benefits, and will raise standards across the industry."" Mr Ryan Lee said NParks will prepare the tender specifications in consultation with the developers and other agencies. The consultants will report to NParks and the developers on their progress. This change in the management of EIA services is part of a three-pronged review on the strengthening of processes - which started early last year. The first part involved the creation of tools and maps to have a comprehensive picture of Singapore's green spaces and habitats, and how they connect to one another. The project - which was completed in June last year - also identified routes that wildlife could take to get from one green patch to another. The second part refers to the EIA consultancy services being managed under NParks. In the third area under review, the authorities will explore using technology in the built environment sector and how it can be applied to project management. The review followed the erroneous clearing of 7.3ha of woodland in Kranji in late 2020 before approval was granted. Since the land was not near sensitive nature areas, an EIA was not deemed necessary. However, a new drain proposed for the Kranji development meant some environmental studies - including a biodiversity one - were required before land clearance. Two employees from site developer JTC and an employee from consultancy firm CPG Consultants were charged in April this year. They were accused of being part of a conspiracy to cause a construction company to cut the trees without approval from the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation. Enhancements to the EIA framework have been ongoing for a few years now. In late 2020, sweeping changes were made to ensure that development works are more sensitive to wildlife and areas of conservation value. Those changes included new guidelines for conducting biodiversity impact assessments and building up local expertise on ecological matters, added Mr Lee in his Facebook post. Environment consultants and members of the nature community who spoke to The Straits Times said centralising the environmental assessments within NParks is a step in the right direction. Ms Holly Siow, senior consultant at Tembusu Asia Consulting, said: “With NParks being the client, this also facilitates discussions for more favourable project outcomes, particularly for biodiversity conservation.” National University of Singapore marine biologist Toh Tai Chong said harmonising the requirements of EIA reports makes it easier for government agencies, community groups and companies to interpret the findings. Mr Muhammad Nasry who leads the Singapore Youth Voices for Biodiversity added that NParks could conduct spot checks and audit the development sites. This would deter contractors from cutting corners when carrying out mitigation steps to minimise ecological impacts. Agreeing, Ms Siow noted that one drawback with the changes is that it might be difficult to communicate the EIA findings to contractors because they will be managed by the developers. The consultants will not have a direct link to the contractors since they will be managed by NParks. “It is vital that the (mitigation) and monitoring plans are properly supervised to ensure that they (the plans) incorporate the recommendations from the EIA during construction and operational phases of projects,” she added."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/chief-finance-and-sustainability-officer-among-new-green-roles-in-finance-and-accountancy-sectors-study,Chief finance and sustainability officer among new green roles in finance and accountancy sectors: Study,"SINGAPORE - Companies that are committed to reducing their carbon footprint and making progress in green finance should consider having a chief finance and sustainability officer (CFSO), recommends a local accountancy study. A CFSO would have the chief financial officer and the chief sustainability officer reporting to him or her, whose role would be to integrate finance with sustainability in a company's business strategy. The high-ranking executive would convert the environmental impact of the company's activities - such as greenhouse gas emissions and pollution - into financial metrics to guide the firm's strategy in meeting sustainability goals. The CFSO is among an alphabet soup of new green professions - such as an environmental, social and governance (ESG) specialist - that is emerging as the green momentum picks up. It is an uncommon job role that is present in organisations, such as CapitaLand Investment, that already have well-developed sustainability initiatives and commitments, the report stated. The new study, Sustainability: Jobs and Skills For The Accountancy Profession, was jointly conducted by the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants and three other organisations including the Singapore Management University (SMU). Its report, released at the annual Professional Accountants in Business Conference on Thursday (Aug 25), shed light on the skills that accountants and finance professionals need in order to perform sustainability-related roles, and where the skill gaps lie. The study said accountants are well placed for the role of CFSO, as they have the intimate and in-depth finance knowledge to lead their organisation's sustainability agenda. It said the three trends that are driving finance professionals to expand into the green space are decarbonisation, sustainability reporting and disclosures becoming more widely adopted, and the growth of green finance. In her keynote speech at the conference, Second Minister for Finance and National Development Indranee Rajah said accountants can lead the charge in pushing their companies to become sustainable. Their roles in a company would give them the perspective and knowledge to set sustainability ambitions, institute environmental practices that make business sense, and hold their companies accountable for their sustainability pledges. The report added that sustainability reporting and disclosures, which can involve complex data, are the most pressing challenges for companies now. Sustainability reporting has been mandated on a ""comply or explain"" basis by the Singapore Exchange since 2016, and since 2022, climate-related reporting has been mandatory for listed companies. ""As sustainability reporting picks up, there will be demand for accountants to provide assurance and verify these sustainability reports, so as to hold companies accountable for their plans,"" added Ms Indranee, who is also Minister in the Prime Minister's Office. To bridge the knowledge gaps for working professionals and students interested in this sector, universities have introduced sustainability modules for accountancy and finance students. Professor Cheng Qiang, dean of the SMU School of Accountancy, said the curriculum at the school has been adjusted to include content on ESG metrics, to meet the rising demand for sustainability accountants. But the report concluded that more needs to be done, finding that business and accountancy courses at local institutes of higher learning offer few modules on sustainability and even fewer ones on sustainability reporting, and called for specialised courses or modules."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/more-options-for-refillables-may-lower-carbon-emissions-from-packaging-disposal-report,More options for refillables may lower carbon emissions from packaging disposal: Report,"SINGAPORE - More options to refill products such as detergent and drinks in Singapore can lower over 11,000 tonnes of carbon emissions generated from disposing of domestic packaging waste here last year, or the equivalent of over 350 dumpster trucks travelling around the circumference of the earth. These were among recommendations of a report on Tuesday (Aug 23) by the Singapore Environment Council and KPMG to improve the management of packaging waste here, which historically has relatively high generation and low recycling rates. Toothpaste tablets, for instance, can be packaged in refillable storage containers instead of toothpaste tubes or unnecessary paperboard packaging, the report said, citing US-based company Bite. Last year, about 523,000 tonnes of domestic packaging waste were discarded, contributing to emissions, said chairman of the Singapore Environment Council Isabella Huang-Loh. This is sufficient to fill more than 1,000 Olympic-sized pools. Singapore's only landfill, Semakau Landfill, is expected to run out of space by 2035 at the current rate of waste generation. This comes despite the bulk of more than 1,000 local consumers surveyed for the report saying they have an appetite for eco-friendly packaging. Most, however, were hindered by barriers such as cost, insufficient information on such packaging and its benefits. About 65 per cent of respondents also said they depended on the Government and businesses to inform them on purchasing and recycling sustainable products. ""(Demand for disposable packaging) will continue to grow with the insatiable desire of our consumers, so again, in line with promoting the shift towards recycling and reducing waste, we should be looking at the business model... B2B business is extremely important to empower green consumerism to change their habits,"" said Ms Huang-Loh. To encourage the flow of packaging materials in a circular manner, stakeholders including brand owners and e-commerce businesses must act, she said. Redesigning products, such as by substituting plastics for paper, can potentially reduce the amount of waste from 510,000 tonnes to 306,000 tonnes, the report noted. Other recommendations proposed improvements such as creating a separate collection point for biodegradables, in addition to recyclables. Currently, there is only one bin for recyclables, resulting in food contamination. Publication of the study's results was held in conjunction with the Singapore Environmental Achievement Awards, which was attended by Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu as well as about 160 guests, including industry leaders and sponsors. Lauding the report's recommendation to make refillable products more accessible, Ms Pamela Low, 27, told The Straits Times that she would like refillables as a readily available alternative to packaged goods in supermarkets and convenience stores. The founder of climate advocacy group Tingkat currently buys package-free rice from zero waste grocery bulk food store Unpackt and makes her own dishwasher liquid, she said, noting that this has led to savings of up to 20 per cent. ""While there are package-free products in Singapore and they are cheaper, it's not as convenient as going downstairs, making the barriers of entry to refilling bottles much taller than the benefits for most people,"" she said."

But efforts are ongoing to make the country's marine areas, as well as its patchwork of green spaces, more conducive for wild animals. For example, reforestation efforts and constant vigilance against poaching are helping animals such as the straw-headed bulbul find a stronghold in Singapore. The critically endangered songbird species has been poached to local extinction elsewhere. In the marine realm, man-made reef structures have been installed in the Sisters' Islands Marine Park to provide new substrate for the growth of coral. These efforts to help native wildlife thrive in Singapore's urban environment are showcased in the second episode of a Straits Times video series on sustainability, which airs on Tuesday (Aug 23). Called Our Better Nature, the six-part series is hosted by environment correspondent Audrey Tan, and will be screened on ST's website and social media channels. The other episodes will look at ways that the country is charting a more sustainable future under the Singapore Green Plan 2030. These include how innovations such as heat-reflective paint can help people here beat the heat. Each episode is between six minutes and eight minutes long, and will be aired every fortnight."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/new-edition-of-programme-on-sea-level-rise-to-benefit-over-600000-students-by-2024," New edition of programme on rising sea levels to reach over 600,000 students","SINGAPORE - More than 600,000 students will learn about the threat of rising sea levels to Singapore and participate in climate action projects in a two-year programme launched on Monday (Aug 22). The outreach effort, called R.I.S.E. to the Challenge II, is believed to be the largest school programme covering sea level rise and is an expansion of the first phase that ended in April this year. Both editions are run by property developer Keppel Land. Phase one, which started in 2020, reached out to more than 50,000 people comprising students, building tenants and the public. The new edition will continue with physical exhibitions and workshops highlighting the causes and impacts of rising sea levels, as well as ways to mitigate the destructive phenomenon and adapt to the rising seas. Information from the exhibitions is documented in a newly released eight-chapter e-book which will be given to all primary and secondary schools and junior colleges. The contents are aligned with primary schools' social studies and science syllabus and secondary schools' geography syllabus. The programme, which will end in 2024, is expected to reach about 340 schools and potentially more than 680,000 students and school leaders, said Keppel Land. Competitions will also be organised for students to showcase their climate action projects. R.I.S.E. to the Challenge II and the new e-book were launched on Monday at Xingnan Primary School in Jurong West. Low-lying Singapore has about 30 per cent of its land less than 5m above sea level, making the country vulnerable to the rising seas caused by a warming planet. Scientists from the Republic, Ireland and the United States have projected that Singapore's sea level could rise by between 0.37m and 0.78m by 2100, at rates of 4mm to 13mm a year - that may be exacerbated by ice sheet, ocean and atmospheric processes. The scientists made those projections based on data from a recent global report by the United Nations' top climate science body. Minister for National Development Desmond Lee attended the launch and explained the effects of climate change on Singapore and its 2030 Green Plan to the pupils. ""Whatever our challenges may be... including the impact of climate change, we will feel all these impacts differently, but the important thing is to be stewards, to work together as Singaporeans, differences aside, so that we (have) a better, brighter and more sustainable future,"" he said. He was citing Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s National Day Rally message on Sunday (Aug 21), which touched on the nation remaining united in the face of domestic and international challenges. The programme's first edition held 40 exhibitions in schools and commercial properties under Keppel Land. In extending the programme, its chief executive Louis Lim said: ""Our goal is to continue to promote awareness on this topic, spark more conversations and inspire our youth to become passionate environment advocates."" Primary 4 pupil Ray Goh, an eco-leader at Xingnan Primary, has helped to lead recycling efforts, encouraging schoolmates to deposit uneaten food in a food waste bin after recess. The school runs a programme that turns food waste into compost. ""I also want to take part in beach cleanups and pick up items that can be recycled,"" said the 10-year-old boy."

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/splooting-squirrels-how-animals-in-singapore-cope-with-the-heat,Splooting squirrels: How animals in Singapore cope with the heat,"SINGAPORE - While air-conditioning helps people stay cool, animals in the wild have found other ways to cope with high temperatures. Earlier this month, images of squirrels splooting in New York to deal with the summer heat circulated on social media. The Straits Times explains what splooting is and highlights various ways that animals in Singapore keep their cool as the mercury rises. Ever seen a squirrel splayed on the tree? Do not be alarmed, as the critter is just splooting, or heat dumping, to keep cool. The unusual position drew attention two weeks ago when the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation told residents not to panic when they see squirrels sprawled on the ground in the summer heat. Some mammals adopt such postures to lose heat more efficiently by increasing the surface area of their bodies on a cool surface, said mammal scientist at the National University of Singapore's Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum Marcus Chua. Squirrels native to Singapore - such as the plantain squirrel - also sploot to stay cool. Mr Chua added: ""I've seen them do that on tree branches. They essentially adopt a yoga-like pose on a horizontal branch when it is hot. I've seen uncles do that on the ground at parks after exercising too, albeit on their backs."" Some mammals rely on salivation and panting to cool down, as, unlike humans, they cannot sweat enough to lose heat. This increases airflow into the respiratory tract and helps to cool their bodies, but it is an energy-intensive process that comes at the cost of water loss, said Mr Chua. Many terrestrial animals such as the wild boar and the hippopotamus roll in the mud to lower their body temperature, said Dr Teo Boon Han, managing partner and veterinary consultant at VetTrust Singapore. These animals tend to have fewer sweat glands, so mud helps them to cool down. Heat is removed when water in the mud evaporates. Mud sticks on the body and acts as sunscreen so the skin is not fully exposed to the sun, Dr Teo added. To prevent their legs from overheating, storks frequently urinate on their legs, a behaviour known as urohidrosis. This helps the birds, which are often found in open environments exposed to the sun, remove heat through evaporative cooling, said Dr Yong Ding Li, regional coordinator at conservation group BirdLife International. Singapore has recorded four species of storks, including milky storks and painted storks. Rising sea temperatures brought about by climate change are causing coral reefs in Singapore and abroad to lose their colour. Increases in water temperature cause coral polyps to experience stress, which results in them expelling symbiotic algae that live within their tissues, said Mr Ryan Lee, group director of the National Biodiversity Centre at the National Parks Board. After the algae is ejected, the corals reveal their calcium carbonate skeletons, appearing white or bleached, he said. In Singapore, the warming of the sea is compounded by El Nino, a natural climate phenomenon that brings hotter and drier conditions to South-east Asia, he added. So far, there have been three coral mass-bleaching events recorded here, with the most recent occurring in 2016."

A third person who was injured in the incident has been discharged, said Holland-Bukit Timah GRC MP Christopher de Souza. In a Facebook post on Sunday (Aug 21), Mr de Souza said he made a visit to the home of the man, whom he identified only as Mr Neo, an Ulu Pandan resident. He said: ""I am greatly relieved he is all right and wants to get back to running along the rail corridor as soon as possible - he has such an amazingly positive and optimistic attitude."" As for the other two casualties, Mr de Souza said he wanted to visit them on Sunday but the hospital suggested a Zoom session on Monday instead, due to safe management measures in place at hospitals. He said: ""I have been kept regularly updated on the health and condition of the other two persons who are still in hospital. They are not residents of Ulu Pandan. I am very thankful that they are in a stable condition and recovering."" He added that they also needed the day for a bit more rest. ""I can completely understand and will call them via Zoom tomorrow,"" he said. Mr de Souza said there are key lessons to be learnt from the incident. He will be chairing a meeting early in the week ahead to see how to learn from it and put in measures to reduce the risk of repeat incidents. This, he said, will include steps such as ensuring the health of trees within the compound of the community club and studying the possibility of increasing the availability of access points for ambulances along the rail corridor. Mr de Souza said: ""Please be assured of my personal attention to this matter."" The tree, believed to be an African mahogany, fell on Saturday evening. The casualties were conscious and in a stable condition when taken to the National University Hospital on Saturday (Aug 20). Rescuers had to lower themselves down a steep slope and make their way through some vegetation to reach them, said the Singapore Civil Defence Force, which was alerted to the incident at about 6pm. The tree had to be cut before the casualties could be freed. Emergency medical specialists were on-site to monitor the victims' vital signs, and K9 search dogs were used to check if there were other victims. The African mahogany was introduced to Singapore in the late 1970s, to be planted on the roadsides. They can grow up to 60m high, have thick trunks and buttress roots and can be spotted along most expressways. The Straits Times has contacted NUH and Ulu Pandan CC for more details."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/nus-students-come-up-with-recycling-method-for-medicine-strips,NUS students come up with recycling method for medicine strips,"SINGAPORE - Once the last pill is taken, a patient or nurse will - without giving it a second thought - discard the medicine strip, which is made of polluting plastic and sought-after aluminium. Medicine strips - formally known as pharmaceutical blister packaging - cannot be recycled because they are made of plastic and aluminium heat-sealed together with a type of glue. It is difficult to separate the materials in this multi-layer packaging so the strips are usually discarded as general waste. To avoid having to throw them in the incinerators, a group of engineering students from the National University of Singapore (NUS) came up with a chemical recycling method to separate plastic from aluminium and salvage both components. Both materials can then be sent to recycling companies. This student initiative, called the Green Doctors Programme, was born last August when a pharmacist from the National University Hospital (NUH) approached the NUS department of Civil and Environmental Engineering to find a way to reduce medical waste. Every month, commonly prescribed medicines at NUH account for about 200,000 medicine strips being used up. Overall, about five million strips are thrown away every month in Singapore, said Ms Sophia Ding, founder of the Green Doctors Programme, and final-year civil and environmental engineering student at NUS. Chemical recycling involves adding chemicals to the waste materials to break down their original structures. Ms Ding declined to elaborate on her team's process to salvage the plastic and aluminium in the medicine strips as it is still in the early research phase. After three months of research, the Green Doctors Programme concocted a recipe to dissolve the adhesive layer between the plastic and aluminium earlier this year, so that the materials can be separated. The team, which includes about 10 chemical, environmental and mechanical engineering students, has been testing and working to optimise their solution using medicine strips provided by NUH. ""There were only two research papers on recycling medical blister packaging. So it was very difficult for us to come up with the methodology ourselves because we had to infer and go into the roots of the materials,"" said Ms Ding, 22. ""And we had to think about the technology that goes behind heat-sealing, and how to separate the layers without doing much harm to the original materials."" If all medicine strips in Singapore were to be recycled, 16 tonnes of plastic and 2 tonnes of aluminium could be saved each month, she added. According to the World Health Organisation, about 85 per cent of all waste from healthcare activities is non-hazardous, general waste. The remaining 15 per cent is biohazardous waste that is infectious, toxic or radioactive, and must be collected and disposed of safely and carefully to prevent cross-contamination and other public health risks. In a written answer to a parliamentary question about medical waste in May 2021, former Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said the amount of biohazardous waste generated in Singapore increased from 4,400 tonnes in 2016 to 5,700 tonnes in 2020. The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated the issue in 2020, due to additional infection control and biosafety measures. Mr Gan said hospitals and clinics have been mindful to reduce and recycle non-biohazardous waste, including packaging for sterile equipment, fluids, and glove wrappings. Professor Seeram Ramakrishna, chair of the NUS Circular Economy Taskforce, said much suitable medical or pharmaceutical waste is not recycled due to the challenges in segregating and pre-cleaning before recycling, in case it is biohazardous. But he noted that recycling industries are keen on trying to recycle plastics and other disposables, which have been treated and certified as non-biohazardous. Recently, hospitals and healthcare players here have been taking gradual steps to reduce their medical disposables and recycle them. Since 2020, the Singapore General Hospital has been sending stainless steel disposables - such as surgical instruments and laryngoscope blades - to vendors for recycling. The soiled instruments are thoroughly washed and decontaminated in the hospital, and between 450kg and 600kg of instruments are recycled each month. By 2030, Alexandra Hospital plans to reduce its waste by 60 per cent and raise its recycling rate by the same amount. The hospital is looking to see if their alcohol-based hand rub bottles can be cleaned so that they can be given to recyclers. The hospital also has specific bins for staff to drop off plastic packaging, and older operating theatre gowns are turned into recycling bags, said its chief operating officer Jeffrey Chun. From this year, most companies with an annual turnover of $10 million have to report the amount of packaging they use, and this includes pharmaceutical and medtech companies. Some companies have developed reusable inhaler devices - where the medicine canister for asthmatic patients can be replaced several times - to move away from disposable inhaler devices, said the Pharmaceutical Society of Singapore. The Green Doctors Programme also plans to look into how other types of hard-to-recycle medical waste such as IV bags can be recycled. The pandemic has also made medical waste more visible, with used surgical masks disposed in public places. Prof Seeram said: ""People can opt for reusable masks and face shields, and refillable sanitiser bottles. Provisions to take back unused antigen rapid test kits by pharmacies and retailers can be explored. ""Such simple measures will lower the medical waste footprint."""

Introduced to Singapore in the late 1970s, they can grow up to 60m tall. They have thick trunks and buttress roots and can be spotted along most expressways. An MP for Holland-Bukit Timah GRC Christopher de Souza said a professional arborist will advise on the health of the tree. “My immediate concern is the three people who were affected,” he said, adding that he will be visiting them in hospital. Earlier this year on Feb 20, a man was pinned in the driver's seat after a tree fell on his car. He narrowly missed being impaled by two branches that broke through his windscreen. At the time of the incident, there was a thunderstorm. On Feb 18 last year, a woman was killed after a tree fell on her in Marsiling Park. She was pronounced dead before SCDF officers could rescue her. The National Parks Board said it was a 20m-tall Araucaria excelsa tree. The tree was found to be healthy at its last inspection in April 2020."

While most Singaporean consumers say they are environmentally conscious, they tend to make purchases based on cost, convenience and preference, found the climate index released on Tuesday (Aug 16) by OCBC Bank and Eco-Business, a media and business intelligence firm. Sustainability is seen as a bonus or a happy consequence of a purchasing choice that made sense in the first place, the index also found. The index, which was first launched last year, hopes to raise awareness about environmental issues, nudge people towards more sustainable behaviour and influence policymakers. This year, after surveying 2,169 Singaporeans between the ages of 18 and 65, the index came up at a national average of 6.7 out of 10. The respondents were evaluated on their level of awareness regarding environmental issues, how many sustainable practices they have adopted, and how much they advocated for sustainable change. Based on the index, OCBC said that while most Singaporeans are conscious of almost all environmental issues, they make few sustainable choices on average and advocate for sustainability even more selectively. Also, Singaporeans scored exactly the same as last year, with little progress despite more investment in environmental awareness, said Mr Jason Boh, vice-president of Market Research at OCBC Bank. Some environmentally harmful choices were traced to the increased use of air conditioning, the resumption of travel as the Covid-19 pandemic abates, and consumerism as the economy recovers. Additionally, Gen-Z citizens chose to eat unsustainably owing to difficulty in changing their diets and a belief that their choices made little environmental difference. They also spent more on non-essential products. However, there are some encouraging findings, said Mr Boh. Those aged between 58 and 65 advocated for more climate action this year due to their increased comfort with digital tools acquired during the pandemic. Also, with more in that age group retiring, their lifestyles slow down and become more environmentally friendly, such as them choosing to take public transport more often. Additionally, citizens between the ages of 18 and 25 are also redirecting their finances into buying second-hand products, which are increasingly seen as legitimate, cheap and clean. Ms Jessica Cheam, founder and managing director of Eco-Business, said: ""Mainstreaming sustainability-driven consumer behaviour takes time, and many factors such as cost, convenience and infrastructure heavily impact personal decisions."" While some of the results can be discouraging, Ms Cheam said that the index ultimately aims to provide insight into the factors behind consumer decisions and what needs to be done to create a better environment for the right choices. Ms Cheam added that through a better understanding of people's behaviour, society can change for the better and never again return to old, unsustainable habits."

A local villager might value it more for its cultural or spiritual worth or for the animals that provide food. A palm oil plantation developer might value the land the forest stands on. Scientists tell us that nature provides benefits to people worth trillions of dollars a year, from the air we breathe to the soils we grow our food in. But it really depends on your perspective. And that’s the challenge in trying to put a value on nature. The more humanity destroys nature, the greater the threat to our existence.  Recently, the United Nations’ science advisory panel for biodiversity, known as IPBES, looked at this complex issue and found there are dozens of ways to measure the value of nature. The report came up with guidelines for policymakers. It found that putting a narrow economic value on nature is one of the key reasons behind the loss and damage to the world’s ecosystems.  In this episode, The Straits Times’ environment correspondent Audrey Tan and climate change editor David Fogarty discuss nature valuation with Dr Michael Christie, Professor of Environmental and Ecological Economics at Aberystwyth University in Wales, who is one of the co-chairs of the report.  Highlights (click/tap above): 1:33 Examples of nature's value 4:46 Why is it important to consider different ways to value nature? 7:20 Main recommendations of the IPBES report 12:24 How to manage conflicts over developments such as building a wind farm that might harm local wildlife? 15:13 Best ways for city-dwellers to connect with nature Produced by: Audrey Tan (audreyt@sph.com.sg), David Fogarty (dfogarty@sph.com.sg), Ernest Luis and Hadyu Rahim Edited by: Hadyu Rahim Subscribe to Green Pulse Podcast series and rate us on your favourite audio apps: Channel: https://str.sg/JWaf Apple Podcasts: https://str.sg/JWaY Spotify: https://str.sg/JWag Google Podcasts: https://str.sg/J6EV  Website: http://str.sg/stpodcasts Feedback to: podcast@sph.com.sg Follow Audrey Tan on Twitter: https://str.sg/JLMB Read her stories: https://str.sg/JLM2 Follow David Fogarty on Twitter: https://str.sg/JLM6 Read his stories: https://str.sg/JLMu --- Discover ST's special edition podcasts: Singapore's War On Covid: https://str.sg/wuJa The Unsolved Mysteries of South-east Asia: https://str.sg/wuZ2 Stop Scams: https://str.sg/wuZB Invisible Asia: https://str.sg/wuZn --- Discover more ST podcast series: Asian Insider: https://str.sg/JWa7 Health Check: https://str.sg/JWaN In Your Opinion: https://str.sg/w7Qt Your Money & Career: https://str.sg/wB2m SG Extra: https://str.sg/wukR #PopVultures: https://str.sg/JWad ST Sports Talk: https://str.sg/JWRE Bookmark This!: https://str.sg/JWas Lunch With Sumiko: https://str.sg/J6hQ Discover ST Podcasts: http://str.sg/stpodcasts Discover BT Podcasts: https://bt.sg/pcPL Follow our shows then, if you like short, practical podcasts! #greenpulse"

But in order to gain that knowledge, he added, you need to return to conservation's source of knowledge - the past. And in the case of the project that Prof Ng is leading at Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum in NUS, the pursuit of this past stretches more than 200 years."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/spore-taps-satellite-signals-to-monitor-air-moisture-to-better-predict-weather-amid-climate-change,S'pore taps satellite signals to monitor air moisture in effort to better predict weather,"SINGAPORE - Singapore is adopting a new method to better monitor the amount of moisture in the atmosphere, a move that could boost the weatherman's ability to predict severe weather and thunderstorms amid climate change. Unlike current methods that give limited and localised readings, the new method allows the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS) to monitor moisture continuously throughout the entire atmosphere by using satellite signals. As air moisture distribution in the atmosphere influences rainfall, the continuous stream of data could help the MSS better predict the weather, which is expected to turn erratic with global warming. The new method, which will be used from late August, makes use of satellite signal readings from 10 so-called reference stations dotted across the island. These ground stations receive satellite signals and are being used to help determine the positions of people and vehicles to make navigation more reliable. Water vapour in the atmosphere causes delays in the time taken for satellite signals to reach the stations, hence the amount of moisture in the air can be determined by the time taken for signals to reach the stations. The distribution of moisture in the atmosphere determines whether an air column is stable or unstable, said weather and climate scientist Koh Tieh Yong of the Singapore University of Social Sciences. An unstable air column leads to rain and storms, he explained. MSS uses an islandwide network of sensors on the ground to measure air moisture near the surface of immediate areas around the sensors. The MSS also releases a weather balloon twice a day to track conditions higher up in the atmosphere, up to 37km in the air. Its measurements of wind speed, temperature, air pressure and moisture can inform the MSS of the weather over large areas of the island. However, under rapidly changing conditions such as the convergence of winds over Singapore, the balloon's readings taken over the eastern part of the island may not match what is happening in the western part, for instance. The new method is aimed at plugging this gap. It is also less expensive than weather balloons to run. On Aug 2, the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) inked a five-year agreement with the National Environment Agency (NEA) to share atmospheric moisture data from SLA's network of nine stations. NEA, which oversees the MSS, has one station that will be added to SLA's network. Two more stations will be running by the end of this year. Using satellite signals to measure the amount of water vapour in the air is not new. Japan, for instance, has been using the method to forecast its weather for more than a decade, said Associate Professor Koh. NEA said it will conduct exploratory studies to find out if the additional air moisture data can help to better forecast thunderstorms. Apart from moisture, other elements that are key to forecasting storms include wind, temperature, atmospheric stability and large-scale weather patterns. Commenting on the new method, Prof Koh said it is unlikely to lead to quantum improvements in Singapore's weather forecast. ""In Singapore, a typical tropical thunderstorm blows past within one hour. To improve a forecast of such a storm three to 24 hours ahead, the (atmospheric moisture) data needed must be monitored to a range of about 100km to 700km, mostly outside of Singapore,"" he noted."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/hobbyist-moon-photographer-awestruck-by-largest-and-brightest-full-moon-he-has-seen,Photographers awestruck by supermoon and full moon ,"SINGAPORE - Every month for slightly more than a year now, Mr Kuick Chik Hong would place his telescope on a chair along the corridor of his 12th-floor Yishun Housing Board flat to take a picture of the full moon. It was a habit inspired by the youngest of his three sons, who is interested in the solar system, and for whom he had bought the telescope. He would place his mobile phone near the lens of his telescope to take the shots. The 45-year-old medical lab scientist was awestruck when he tried to take a photograph of the moon on Friday evening - it was the biggest and brightest that he has ever seen. ""I've never taken such a clear picture of the moon and its surface. I was quite surprised to see it so bright and clear,"" said Mr Kuick, who stays in a five-room flat with his family of five on the top floor of Block 661 Yishun Avenue 4. He has two other sons, aged 12 and 14. Mr Kuick was one of many readers who sent in their pictures of Thursday's (Aug 11) supermoon and Friday's full moon to The Straits Times. A supermoon occurs when the moon's orbit is closest to the earth. This makes the moon look brighter and larger than the usual full moon. Thursday's supermoon was the final one of the year, and is called the Sturgeon Moon. The full moon on Friday night was nearly as bright as Thursday's supermoon, said Science Centre Singapore. It also coincided with the 15th day of the lunar seventh month. For Mr Kuick, Friday's moon shot was a treat as the supermoon on Thursday was shrouded by the clouds. He said: ""My youngest one was very excited and shouting 'First time I can see the moon surface clearly.'"" ""It's fun to moon-watch. It feels good standing outside the house at night. There is a sense of achievement from capturing clear pictures of the moon."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/giant-panda-cub-born-in-singapore-celebrates-first-birthday,"Le Le, first panda cub born in S'pore, celebrates first birthday","SINGAPORE - Le Le, the first giant panda cub born in Singapore, celebrated his first birthday on Friday (Aug 12) with a three-tier ice cake stuffed with carrots, bamboo, edible flowers and apple slices. To clicks of cameras from media photographers and some visitors, the cub was let into the Giant Panda Forest enclosure in River Wonders at 10am. He wandered around the enclosure briefly before making his way to the ice cake, which he climbed and fell off from a couple of times. Le Le also tore down a decorated drawing of his mother Jia Jia, which was placed to emulate a zhuazhou - a Chinese ritual held when a child turns one to pick up objects related to career or personality trait. His mother, 14-year-old Jia Jia, joined the party shortly after, encircling the ice cake before settling down to munch on her bamboo. Weighing about 200g at birth, Le Le tips the scale at more than 33kg now.  Project manager Neeti Warrier, who visited the Giant Panda Forest yesterday morning with her husband and two sons, did not expect the cub to grow so fast. The 37-year-old said: “I didn’t expect Le Le to be this big since it’s my first time seeing him today.” Clad in a customised t-shirt of Le Le specially made for the occasion, operations director Tie Boon Ping, 55, said that the cub is not only “very adorable” but also “a symbol of our bilateral ties and friendship with China” He visits the pandas at least twice a month but specially took leave on Friday for the celebration.  Le Le marks one year of age with several milestones. While he is still mainly reliant on his mother's milk, he has started to eat solid food such as pellets and carrots since June. Zookeepers have also started training him to allow them to perform routine medical procedures on him, using pellets as treats. The birthday celebrations will continue on Sunday. Fans of Le Le can catch him celebrating his birthday - with another cake - at 10am at the Giant Panda Forest. Le Le was born to giant pandas Kai Kai and Jia Jia at about 7.50am on Aug 14 last year - their firstborn since they arrived in Singapore in 2012 on loan from China. It took them seven attempts to conceive the cub."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/new-st-video-series-spotlights-local-solutions-to-global-problem,New video series spotlights local solutions to global climate change problem,"SINGAPORE - Climate change is a global problem, but its impact is not felt by all countries the same way. Singapore, for example, may be affected by some climate shifts more than other nations. For one thing, the city's urbanised environment is making it hotter than the global average. Singapore's dependence on food imports also makes it vulnerable to global supply chain disruptions. Still, the Republic is taking steps to deal with these vulnerabilities, with people and organisations in Singapore coming up with new innovations that can not only cushion the climate impacts on the country, but also help the nation cut its carbon footprint. Some of these local solutions to global environmental challenges, such as climate change and biodiversity extinction, will be showcased in a new video series by The Straits Times. Called Our Better Nature, the six-part series is hosted by ST environment correspondent Audrey Tan, and will be screened on ST's website and social media channels. The first episode, which airs on Tuesday (Aug 9), zooms in on how companies and researchers in Singapore are safeguarding the country's food security through high-tech farming and by developing plant-based protein. The other episodes will look at other ways the country is charting a more sustainable future under the Singapore Green Plan 2030. These include, for instance, how Singapore is making its urban cityscape more conducive for the island's other dwellers - native wildlife - and how innovations such as heat-reflective paint can help people in Singapore beat the heat. Each episode is between six and eight minutes long, and will be aired once every fortnight. The series is brought to you by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/whats-in-a-name-6-animals-named-after-singaporean-naturalists,What's in a name: 6 animals named after Singaporean naturalists,"SINGAPORE - Besides the severity implicit in the use of Latin, naming a new species can also serve either a practical purpose - describing things they resemble, for instance - or be driven by emotion, such as when paying homage to a collector. The tiny Neopalpa donaldtrumpi moth with its golden ""mop"", for example, was named after former US president Donald Trump. Ahead of National Day on Tuesday (Aug 9), The Straits Times explores some stories behind creatures found here and abroad that were named after Singapore's very own naturalists. Endemic to Singapore, the pair of tiny armoured spiders of the same species - Singaporemma lenachanae - were named after Dr Lena Chan and have not been seen outside of the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve so far. The rare spiders were named after the senior director of the National Parks Board's international biodiversity conservation division by arachnologists Lin Yucheng and Li Shuqiang in 2017. The intent was to honour Dr Chan for her role in facilitating research collaboration between Singapore and academics from China. The common but little known Lebinthus luae cricket found in Singapore and Indonesia is named after former insect curator of the then Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research, Ms Lua Hui Kheng. It was identified in 2013 by National University of Singapore (NUS) postdoctoral researcher Tan Ming Kai and Dr Tony Robillard from the French National Museum of Natural History. They dedicated the cricket to Ms Lua as she had welcomed Dr Robillard from France to the collection, which she had tended to since the 1970s, when he first visited Singapore. ""Around the same time, she also welcomed me as a (full-time national serviceman) and taught me basic entomological skills such as specimen pinning, labelling and curation,"" said Dr Tan. The insect has since been a good study subject on human impact, said the 32-year-old, citing a recent study on how reduced activity during the circuit breaker affected the calling behaviour of different populations of this cricket species in Singapore. Former NUS Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum director Peter Ng has a knack for naming crabs after a number of his colleagues, including fish scientist Tan Heok Hui. The Polyonyx heok marine porcelain crab was christened as such because Dr Tan had collected it during a dive for the Comprehensive Marine Biodiversity Survey of Singapore. The reddish brown crustacean is uniquely found living in the tube home of a worm. While most of the taxa named after Dr Tan fell into his net at one time or another, there is one exception: the Dendrobium heokhuii orchid that the late orchid specialist Peter O'Byrne named after him for discovering the world's smallest fish in 2006. On top of his spider collection, which includes more than 12,000 specimens, former diplomat Joseph Koh has no shortage of arachnids bearing his name. For example, the Tetragnatha josephi, or mangrove long-jawed spider, was named after Mr Koh by the late Japanese arachnologist, Dr Chiyoko Okuma, in 1988. The native species was first collected by Mr Koh in mangrove swamps at Lim Chu Kang and subsequently found also in mangroves in Malaysia and Brunei, said Mr Koh. ""Dr Okuma decided to call it 'josephi' instead of 'kohi', because 'kohi' sounds like 'coffee' in Japanese,"" Mr Koh told The Straits Times. Another species, the Anelosimus kohi spider, was named after him by the late Dr Hajime Yoshida in 1993 as the scientific description of this species was based on the specimens Mr Koh had collected in the mangroves fringing Sungei Seletar. Like the recently discovered species of moss animal named after her, marine conservationist Ria Tan has a strong attachment to marine life, said NUS marine biologist Huang Danwei. Moss animals are some of the most common but sometimes inconspicuous creatures that attach to underwater surfaces and fall under a group of marine life called Bryozoa. The bryozoan Reptadeonella riatanae was named after Ms Tan for the monumental efforts she has put in for over two decades, all the time as a volunteer, to promote knowledge on marine biodiversity through her web resource Wild Singapore, as well as in person, said Assistant Professor Huang, one of the scientists to help discover the species. Noting the permanence of a scientific name, he added: ""In that sense, it is an immortalisation of her name in the scientific record. ""Specifically, we wanted to acknowledge in a very real and permanent way Ria's significant contributions to marine biodiversity and conservation in Singapore, so that her work will continue to be an inspiration to the marine community and the public at large."" In June, a newly discovered paddy frog - the first new frog species to be described here in nearly 40 years - was named after the late environmental consultant Subaraj Rajathurai. The Micryletta subaraji frog, or Subaraj's paddy frog, was named so to commemorate Mr Subaraj, who died in 2019 and had been a good friend and nurturing mentor to the co-authors of the paper describing its discovery. The veteran nature guide fought to conserve Singapore's remaining wild spaces, including the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, as well as his active involvement in protecting them amid new infrastructure projects such as the Cross Island MRT Line."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/new-frog-species-discovered-in-singaporefor-1st-time-in-nearly-40-years,New frog species discovered in Singapore for 1st time in nearly 40 years,"SINGAPORE - The quest to identify a mysterious frog first recorded along Old Upper Thomson road three years ago has led to the discovery of a whole new frog species at a Kranji site littered with trash and construction rubble. The last time a frog species was discovered here was nearly 40 years ago. The greyish-brown frog, which is barely bigger than a marble, was named Subaraj's paddy frog (Micryletta subaraji) after the late conservationist Subaraj Rajathurai, Mr Sankar Ananthanarayanan, the president of the Herpetological Society of Singapore (HSS), told The Straits Times. ""Lots of places and wildlife in the region are named after colonial-era figures such as Stamford Raffles and Alfred Russel Wallace. It is only recently that regional scientists and amateur naturalists have become more prominent, so we wanted to name the frog after Subaraj, who was as much an inspiration to us as any of these other naturalists,"" added Mr Sankar, 27. Along with his trademark bandana and Santa Claus-esque beard, Mr Subaraj is renowned for helping to save some of Singapore's beloved green spaces, including the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, as well as fighting to protect the Republic's remaining habitats amid projects such as the Cross Island Line. ""Like Subaraj, the frog, which has so far been found only in Singapore, is priceless national and natural heritage that needs to be valued and appreciated by future generations,"" said Dr Chan Kin Onn, 38, curator of herpetology at the NUS Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum. Dr Chan was the primary investigator of the paper formalising the species' discovery. Published in scientific journal Vertebrate Zoology on June 29, the paper marks the first major publication for four of its co-authors. It is fitting to name the paddy frog after Mr Subaraj, who was very passionate about imparting his love of nature to the young people he served as mentor to during the founding of HSS, said the society's co-founder Law Ing Sind, 26. HSS secretary Shivaram Rasu, 28, added: ""We still remember every nature walk we've taken with him - he could remember and mimic the different bird calls in Singapore."" The authors' interest in identifying the diminutive amphibian dates back to 2019, when a single individual of its kind was sighted by some HSS members along Old Upper Thomson Road. It was initially presumed to be another species from the same genus, Micryletta. Investigation into the frog's true identity came a year later, when the four members of HSS embarked on a project with the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum to detect and build a tissue repository of non-native reptiles and amphibians. ""As we were unsure if the frog was native, we got permits to collect it from Kranji Marshes and sequenced its DNA,"" said HSS co-founder Law Ingg Thong, 24. After taking detailed measurements and conducting genetic analyses, the group found that the DNA sequence and morphology of the frog was sufficiently different from other paddy frogs in the region, which qualified it to be classified as a novel species. Given that Singapore has a very small land area and is quite urbanised, it is surprising that this new species has eluded detection for so long, said Mr Law Ingg Thong. The last new frog species to be described in Singapore was the Malesian frog (Limnonectes malesianus), or Malaysian river frog, in 1984. The nocturnal swamp-dwelling amphibian can also found in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. Said Mr Sankar: ""This and recent taxon discoveries in Singapore demonstrate that the biodiversity of the highly urbanised island-state is still far from being fully realised and underscores the need for continued systematic collections, surveys and protection of remaining habitats."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/new-textile-research-centre-launched-to-develop-recycling-techniques-for-new-textile-recycling-plant-here-in-2024,"New research centre, future recycling plant mark S'pore's first attempt at recycling used textiles","SINGAPORE - A pilot textile recycling plant will open in Singapore as early as 2024, as part of an overall investment into Singaporean textile recycling capacities. Part of these investments include a new textile recycling research centre that opened on Thursday (Aug 4). The new research centre and eventual recycling plant - which would produce new fabrics and materials from used fabrics, such as old clothes - mark Singapore's first attempt at recycling used textiles, beyond reusing them. Research from the centre will be piloted at the nation's first textile recycling plant, which will recycle 8,760 tonnes of fabric waste per year at full capacity. This is equivalent to the weight of 58.4 million T-shirts. The new research centre in Nanyang Technological University (NTU) comes from a $6 million investment from Royal Golden Eagle (RGE), a global resources-based manufacturing group and the world’s largest producer of viscose. RGE executive director Perry Lim said there is an urgent need to begin recycling textile waste in Singapore, as he said the Republic produced 189,000 tonnes of textile waste last year, from sources like discarded clothing, linens and bags. Mr Lim said: ""Currently, only 4 per cent of textiles are being (repurposed) and are either given to lower-income families or exported to other countries."" Furthermore, after the clothing has completely deteriorated in quality, it is ultimately thrown away and wasted. Therefore, Mr Lim said it is important to develop new and better ways of recycling textiles into higher-quality materials to increase the lifespan of raw materials such as cotton. However, recycling fabric waste has many challenges, said Professor Hu Xiao from the NTU School of Materials Science and Engineering, one of which is the separation of combination fibres used frequently in clothing - such as the cotton-polyester blend. Prof Hu, who co-leads the new RGE-NTU Sustainable Textile Research Centre, said: ""These blended fibres are actually a weave of cotton and polyester fibres twisted in a very thin diameter."" He added that separating them mechanically would be too complicated and also make the constituent fibres unusable. But he said the centre aims to overcome this difficulty by dissolving such fibres chemically to retrieve their base materials. In the case of the cotton-polyester blend, these would be cellulose - found in the walls of plant cells - and recovered polyester, which is a kind of plastic. Prof Hu said the cellulose would then be converted into viscose, which is made primarily of cellulose, and recovered polyester could be used in a myriad of things, such as clothes and adhesives. Presently, Prof Hu said the chemical process developed at the centre can break down a textile made of cotton-polyester blend into its base materials in under two hours. The centre, which is also led by Dr Jaroslav Stavik, head of RGE R&D, will also search for ways to strip dye from fabrics without using toxic chemicals like bleach, among others, to make the fabric recycling process less environmentally harmful and cheaper. Although there are presently textile recycling efforts in the United States, Europe and Asia, Prof Hu said most of these centres focused on repurposing the fabrics with some slight chemical treatment. He added that many of these efforts are by start-ups which can lack expertise and scale. Prof Hu said: ""This collaboration between NTU and RGE is really the first of its kind."""

The initiative comes under a tie-up which was first inked in 2019 between government facilitation office Infrastructure Asia and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The cooperation agreement has now been renewed, and it will see both parties working together to run a series of finance clinics to encourage governments to build sustainability considerations in developing their infrastructure programmes. Regional government officials and industry experts will gather at the clinics to showcase successful case studies. In announcing the collaboration on Wednesday, Ms Indranee, who is also Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, said that the clinics will strengthen and grow the pipeline of bankable sustainable infrastructure projects in the region, allowing the region to better tap commercial funding sources and bringing it closer to a net-zero future. She also highlighted the role multilateral development banks (MDBs), such as the ADB, have in spurring development opportunities in the region. In a speech at Sands Expo and Convention Centre, Ms Indranee said in 2020, MDBs committed US$66 billion (S$91 billion) to climate finance. This attracted commitments of US$85 billion in the same year from other public and private external parties to co-invest in climate mitigation and adaptation activities alongside MDBs. ""Beyond contributing capital, MDBs also support capability development in the region by sharing expertise and knowledge, offering project structuring advice and conducting capacity-building programmes."" Infrastructure Asia also signed a new memorandum of understanding with India's national investment promotion agency Invest India. The collaboration will support infrastructure development in India and promote private sector partnerships through knowledge sharing, and advisory in the funding and implementation of infrastructure projects."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/cities-can-tap-nature-for-solutions-as-they-seek-to-develop-without-harming-the-environment,Cities can tap nature for solutions as they seek to develop without harming the environment,"SINGAPORE - In China, Hainan province built interlocking fingers of land that channel sea tides into the island's 10ha mangrove park. These fingers help to reduce the impact of strong storm currents on Sanya Mangrove Park's mangroves, in an area that had previously been damaged by years of tourism development. The park was one of two projects using nature-based solutions cited by Second Minister for National Development Indranee Rajah on Tuesday (Aug 2) at the World Cities Summit, where she said meeting the development needs of cities and their citizens need not come at a cost to the environment. Nature-based solutions involve using nature to counter challenges faced by society, such as climate change. Citing Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University Centenary Park and Sanya Mangrove Park, Ms Indranee said that nature-based solutions, which cities have increasingly adopted, are one way to meet development and environmental needs. To help cities plan for such projects, Singapore's Centre for Liveable Cities and National Parks Board on Tuesday launched a book that compiles best practices shared by experts and stakeholders involved in implementing nature-based solutions. Speaking at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre, Ms Indranee was one of a host of speakers who addressed the resilience of cities and their ability to deal with climate change. The Netherlands' Rotterdam city Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb was among several who highlighted the pressing reality of climate change, with its impacts clearly felt globally. Mitigation strategies are for the short term, he said, and will not be effective in the long term. ""We have to adapt to a new situation,"" said Mr Aboutaleb, adding that his city, which was previously battling rains, is now threatened by droughts. But even in crises, there are opportunities, said the mayor, who cited seven urban greening projects that the city has pursued in recent years. For instance, the city's planned Hofbogen Park will be built on a former railway viaduct. Besides serving as a corridor for people and nature, the park also helps with water management - its plants naturally filter rainwater, which is stored in underground aquifers and can be tapped during dry spells. Mr Aboutaleb added that these infrastructural projects will also benefit the city's economy, as attractive cities draw investments and increase the value of homes. Ms Indranee also said cities should collaborate more to help one another address constraints in meeting net-zero emission goals. An example of this, she said, is the Laos-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project, which has allowed Singapore to tap hydropower instead of relying solely on solar power as a renewable energy source. Besides international collaboration, panellists on Tuesday also said community involvement is essential in building resilience and fighting climate change. New Zealand's Christchurch Mayor Lianne Dalziel said: ""The wisdom of the community, when combined with the knowledge of the experts, always exceeds what one can offer without the other."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/singapore-and-rotterdam-team-up-to-push-cleaner-fuel-digitalisation-on-shipping-route,"Singapore and Rotterdam team up to push cleaner fuel, digitalisation on shipping route","SINGAPORE - Singapore and Rotterdam are working together to have vessels between the two cities run on cleaner fuel by 2027. On Tuesday (Aug 2), the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) and the Port of Rotterdam signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to improve collaboration on sustainability and digitalisation. In a joint media statement, the two port authorities said they will start trials for bunkering as well as digitalisation, and also test the use of low- and zero-carbon fuels on the 15,000km route. On the sustainability front, the cities are striving to move away from marine gas oil and low-sulphur fuel oil - both popular within the shipping industry - to more sustainable alternatives such as biofuels and biogas. Other alternatives such as synthetic methane, hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels, including ammonia and methanol, are also being tested for future deployment, said the authorities, which noted that each alternative fuel faces challenges relating to cost, availability, safety and range restrictions. To overcome these restrictions over the next few years, they will bring together shippers, fuel suppliers and other companies to devise potential solutions. These partners include the Maersk McKinney Moller Centre for Zero-Carbon Shipping and the Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation, as well as industry partners across the supply chain. As for digitalisation, the two port cities will be sharing relevant data, electronic documents and standards to facilitate movement of vessels and cargo, making the arrival of vessels at the respective ports a more seamless process. The MOU signing at Marina Bay Sands between MPA chief executive Quah Ley Hoon and Port of Rotterdam chief executive Allard Castelein was witnessed by Transport Minister S. Iswaran and Mayor of Rotterdam Ahmed Aboutaleb. Mr Iswaran said that ports cannot work in isolation on decarbonisation, as shipping is a network solution involving multiple partners. He hopes the collaboration with Rotterdam will have a ""catalytic effect"" on others who trade with Singapore, in terms of spurring the adoption of greener shipping solutions. Noting that the maritime sector has been ""relatively conservative in approaching and addressing climate change challenges"", Mr Castelein said the challenges are ""so formidable"" that entities have to collaborate to overcome them."

Portuguese artist Artur Bordalo, who is renowned for turning trash into giant animal sculptures, said the feline marks his largest upcycled artwork in Asia and aims to highlight the global wastage of scarce resources and the need to reduce, reuse and recycle. The world is estimated to generate 2.01 billion tonnes of waste annually. ""The inspiration behind my works is not to create beautiful art but to give a voice to endangered animals,"" said the street artist known as Bordalo II, who is behind more than 240 art pieces in over 20 countries. Numbering fewer than 400 in the wild, the Sumatran tiger - the smallest subspecies of tigers - is an ideal muse for the artist's craft. Habitat loss and poaching are the two main threats facing the Sumatran tiger, which mostly lives in protected areas on the Indonesian island. On Monday, the artwork was unveiled by Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean, the guest of honour at the launch of a nationwide campaign by UBS and real estate company Ho Bee Land to use art to narrate sustainability. The sculpture will be displayed at the SG50 lattice of Gardens by the Bay's Bayfront Plaza for the next three years. Much like Bordalo II's trademark works, it is made from an eclectic range of waste materials, including plastic hoses, trolleys and parts of children's playgrounds, collected by the Ad Planet Group, UBS employees and Ho Bee Land's construction partner. In the later part of this year, there will also be an art competition titled Art Of Trash. Students in Singapore can take part by upcycling waste materials to create sculptures, UBS said. Said Mr Edmund Koh, president of UBS Asia-Pacific: ""Aligned to our UBS purpose to connect people for a better world, we hope that this iconic art piece inspires impactful conversations around sustainability."" ""This nationwide campaign is in line with the Singapore Green Plan 2030, which is a strong road map that charts our way towards a more sustainable future. ""At UBS, we work closely with our clients globally on this sustainability agenda and have seen a rise in our sustainability focus and impact investments by 78 per cent, reaching US$251 billion (S$346 billion) at the end of last year."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/rainy-days-expected-in-first-half-of-august,Rainy days expected in first half of August,"SINGAPORE - Carry your umbrella with you as wet weather is expected to continue in the first two weeks of August, said the weatherman on Monday (Aug 1). Short-duration thundery showers are expected on most days over some parts of Singapore between the morning and early afternoon, according to the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS). In addition, widespread moderate to heavy thundery showers are likely to sweep through Singapore on one or two days, due to large-scale convergence of winds in the region. The MSS also predicted thundery showers with occasional gusty winds in the pre-dawn and morning on a few days, brought about by Sumatra squalls from the Strait of Malacca. A Sumatra squall is an organised line of thunderstorms that originate from Sumatra island and typically move eastward towards Singapore and the surrounding region. ""Total rainfall for the first fortnight of August this year is forecast to be above average over most parts of the island,"" added the MSS. The daily temperature on most days will likely range from 24 deg C to 33 deg C. ""On one or two rainy days, the daily minimum temperature may dip to around 23 deg C,"" said MSS. In the second week of August, the daily maximum temperature could reach up to 34 deg C. Warm and humid nights are expected on a few days, with temperatures hovering at above 28 deg C, particularly in the eastern and southern coastal areas of Singapore."

A recent report shows mankind is far more dependent on nature than many believe. For example, humanity uses about 50,000 wild, non-farmed, species for food, medicines, wood and fuel and even tourism. This includes more than 10,000 wild species harvested directly for human food. The report from the United Nations’ science advisory panel for biodiversity, known as IPBES, which was released in early July, found that 70 per cent of the world’s poor are directly dependent on wild species. And one in five people rely on wild plants, algae and fungi for their food and income. And yet over-exploitation, including the illegal trade of animals and plants, is endangering nature and threatening the lives of billions of people. In this episode, The Straits Times’ environment correspondent Audrey Tan and climate change editor David Fogarty discuss the importance of wild species with report co-chair Dr Marla Emery, a research geographer with the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research.

The showers brought relief from days of dry weather, which had resulted in warmer temperatures here.  Occasional showers are expected till early afternoon on Wednesday and cloudy weather thereafter for the rest of the day, according to the National Environment Agency (NEA).  The weatherman said last Friday (July 15) that the first few days of the second half of July are expected to be warm and fair, due to stable atmospheric conditions that inhibit the formation of rain clouds. But rain is expected for the rest of the month as the monsoon rain band is forecast to lie close to the equator, said the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS), a unit under the NEA. ""This is expected to bring more rainfall over the equatorial South-east Asia region,"" MSS said in its fortnightly weather outlook. On most days, short showers, accompanied occasionally by thunder, are expected in the late mornings and afternoons. The showers could be heavy on some days, due to the convergence of winds over Singapore and the vicinity, MSS added. Daily temperatures are forecast to range between 24 deg C and 33 deg C for most days, with the wet weather bringing lower temperatures of between 23 deg C and 32 deg C on a few days.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/singapore-could-see-5000-tonnes-of-solar-panel-waste-in-next-2-years,"S'pore could see 5,000 tonnes of solar panel waste in next 2 years","SINGAPORE - As Singapore ramps up solar energy deployment to meet its growing clean energy needs, the issue of how to deal with solar panel waste is proving to be a challenge. Dr Stanley Wang, co-founder and chief executive of solar tech firm EtaVolt, estimates that up to 5,000 tonnes of photovoltaic waste could be generated within the next two years, assuming that these solar panels are not recycled properly. EtaVolt, a spin-off from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), works with firms to sustainably recycle their used solar panels and helps them determine when to upgrade to more efficient ones. Photovoltaic waste could increase exponentially in a few years' time, said Dr Wang. The country currently has a solar capacity of more than 630 megawatt-peak. It is aiming to ramp up solar energy deployment to at least two gigawatt-peak by 2030 as part of the Singapore Green Plan. Countries around the world have also been rapidly increasing their solar energy deployments amid a push for renewable energy, but this has led to solar panel waste. The latest report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) published in 2016 estimated that the world could face up to 78 million tonnes of photovoltaic waste by 2050. Professor Subodh Mhaisalkar, the executive director of the Energy Research Institute @ Nanyang Technological University (ERI@N), said cities like Singapore primarily deploy solar panels on rooftops. As newer technologies become available, it makes sense for customers to upgrade their solar panels to higher-efficiency ones, said Prof Subodh. Dr Wang said that while high-quality solar panels could have a lifespan of around 20 to 25 years, they are generally about 10 per cent to 15 per cent less efficient beyond the 10-year mark. Thus, those deploying solar panels now would be looking to have them replaced in  seven to 10 years, said Prof Subodh. Dr Wang said the lifespan of solar panels could also be shortened if they are damaged during transportation and installation, and in lightning strikes. ""Given that Singapore's solar panel deployment started to pick up over the past five years, we expect significant solar panel replacement or recycling to increase significantly by 2025,"" said Prof Subodh. But solar panel recycling is not without problems. They are made of materials such as aluminium, glass and silicon, which can be potentially recycled, but are often difficult to separate, said Associate Professor Nripan Mathews, who is the cluster director of renewables and low-carbon generation (solar) at ERI@N. This makes recycling costly, said Prof Subodh. He said that while Singapore could develop new recycling technologies for a pilot plant here, it could be more cost-effective to have a large-scale recycling plant in the region, collating solar panel waste from countries in South-east Asia. This is because Singapore does not have as much solar panel waste, compared with other countries. A spokesman for solar panel firm EDPR Sunseap told The Straits Times that only about 300 of its solar panels have been recycled thus far, as most of its panels have yet to reach the end of their life cycle. Some were damaged during installation, while others had manufacturing defects, lowering their efficiency. ""One of the challenges to solar panel recycling is the cost, and there are only a handful of recycling plants or vendors who are capable of recycling solar panels here,"" the  spokesman added. Under the National Environment Agency's (NEA) Resource Sustainability Act, companies that import solar panels and sell or install them here must provide free take-back services for their customers when the solar panels reach their ""end of life"". These companies can then engage NEA-licensed waste collectors or e-waste recyclers to dispose of or recycle these solar panels. NEA said it is currently funding two projects under its Closing the Waste Loop initiative, and they involve recovering valuable materials through solar panel recycling."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/scientists-from-astar-ntu-find-way-to-upcycle-old-solar-panels,"Scientists from A*Star, NTU find way to upcycle old solar panels","SINGAPORE - Recycling old solar panels is challenging, but scientists from Singapore have found a way to upcycle the silicon inside and turn them into materials that can convert heat into electricity. The team comprising researchers from the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) turned old solar panels into thermoelectric materials. Such materials convert heat into electricity, and work in a similar way to how hydropower generation plants use water movement to drive turbines to generate electricity. The joint study was published in the scientific journal Advanced Materials in March. Dr Ady Suwardi, the deputy head of the soft materials research department at A*Star's Institute of Materials Research and Engineering said that by moving heat from one side to another, thermoelectric materials generate electricity. This can then be used for applications like cooling, added Dr Ady, who co-led the study. The team found that impurities and defects in the silicon used to make solar cells actually enhance the performance of thermoelectric materials. A solar panel is made up of many solar cells, also known as photovoltaic cells. Separating the materials used to make solar panels and recycling each of them is a complex and costly process, said Associate Professor Nripan Mathews. Prof Mathews, who is the cluster director of renewables and low-carbon generation (solar) at the Energy Research Institute @NTU (ERI@N), added that current recycling methods are able to recover only the glass and metallic support structures from solar panels. Solar cells contain a complex mix of materials such as aluminium, copper, silver, lead, plastic and silicon. Silicon, which is extremely pure, makes up 90 per cent of solar cells. However, this normally ends up in landfills. This is because silicon has to be chemically treated and remelted to be recycled into pure silicon, said Prof Mathews. He added that it is challenging, energy-intensive and expensive to recover the silicon to create new, functional solar cells. ""While silicon holds very little weight in the entire solar panel, it is the most valuable part of it, which explains why it is important for us to try and upcycle it,"" said Prof Mathews. The team is currently looking to pilot the technology for large-scale upcycling of waste silicon to create silicon-based thermoelectrics. This can be used for high-temperature energy harvesting applications such as converting heat generated from industrial waste processes into electricity. There are a number of research efforts ongoing in Singapore to see how solar panels can be recycled. The NTU project, for example, is one of two currently supported by the National Environment Agency’s (NEA) Closing the Waste Loop funding initiative.  The $45 million initiative was launched in 2017 to boost research and development in areas such as the recovery of materials from waste streams. The other project, a recycling programme led by Singapore Polytechnic (SP), aims to recycle solar panels on a commercial scale and recover more than 90 per cent by weight of the materials from the solar panels, said NEA. In 2019, The Straits Times reported that Sembcorp and SP will also work together to develop a pilot recycling plant for solar panels. However, the institutions declined to comment when asked for updates on the effort.  Another research effort by NTU spin-off EtaVolt, a solar tech firm, is working with the university on various other solar recycling projects, said its co-founder and chief executive Stanley Wang.   The project is not funded by NEA’s Closing the Waste Loop initiative. Dr Wang said that the upcoming projects aim to recover materials from decommissioned solar panels so they can be recycled and reutilised as raw materials for battery, solar panel manufacturing and other industrial applications. “This would allow us to recover the end-of-life value of these raw materials, which can potentially be given back to companies in the form of rebates to incentivise them to recycle their solar panels sustainably,” he added. "
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/local-farms-hit-by-rising-costs-forced-to-raise-prices-but-demand-is-up-amid-food-security-threats,"S'pore farms hit by rising costs forced to raise prices, but demand is up amid food security threats","SINGAPORE - Local farms are feeling the strain of rising operation costs and electricity prices, and many have had to raise the prices of their produce. Despite higher prices, some farms report an increase in demand for their produce, partially due to recent brushes with food security threats. Inflation and supply chain disruptions have been driving up the cost of fish feed, fingerlings - or juvenile fish - seeds, fertiliser and logistics. Local fish producer Barramundi Group said it has been facing ""meteoric increases"" in energy, diesel and raw material costs. ""Even having hedged to lower electricity prices before the hikes, these electricity contracts will end and we will ultimately see almost a tripling of our kilowatt per hour costs,"" said its chief marketing officer James Kwan. The prices of fish feed, a major cost for the group, have seen significant increases in the last few months with further increases on the horizon, he added. Barramundi Group uses feed that comes from a Norwegian animal nutrition supplier. Sustained cost shocks proved difficult to bear, and Barramundi Group raised the prices of its products by about 15 per cent from July 1, added Mr Kwan. The 14-year-old aquaculture company runs two ocean farms in the southern waters of Singapore and also has farms in Australia and Brunei. It sells products such as locally farmed Asian sea bass and ready-to-eat seafood to businesses and homes in Singapore. Some of the reasons for the premium on fish feed are the supply chain disruption of grains due to the Russia-Ukraine war and recent adverse weather events in some parts of the world affecting crops. For instance, the heatwaves currently sweeping across Europe have been wilting crops in the region. Meanwhile, Russia and Ukraine are among the most important producers of grain and other agricultural commodities. Russia is also one of the top three exporters of nitrogen and phosphorous fertilisers. The war has disrupted the supply of these commodities. A spokesman for local vertical farm Sustenir said delays in farming material supplies and rising inflation have significantly increased the cost of doing business. Sustenir's facility in Admiralty uses fully controlled environments to optimise growth of its crops. The company, founded in 2014, produces kale, spinach, lettuce and other greens. It has two other farms in Hong Kong and Malaysia. The produce from each country is mostly sold locally. But amid the trying period, there is some cause for optimism as demand for local produce has seen an uptick as food security came to the fore with the global food supply crunch and Malaysia's chicken export ban, which started last month. Barramundi Group noticed an increase in demand for its barramundi and salmon by about 10 per cent on its retail website. A spokesman for the Singapore Agro-Food Enterprises Federation noted that some of the farms that are open to visitors have reported an increase in footfall for a few months now as people become more interested in local produce and want to learn more about the production process. Mr Jeremy Ong, chief executive of vertical shrimp farm Universal Aquaculture, said: ""The pros (of Covid-19 and the war) are that food security is now at the forefront of our world problems and producing local is gaining traction."" Universal Aquaculture has been producing vannamei shrimp in stacked tanks at its indoor Tuas farm since last year. The farm's electricity cost has doubled and feed price has gone up by 30 per cent, said Mr Ong. The company has not adjusted the prices of its shrimp so far. The Fish Farmer, which has four fish farms off the coasts of Lim Chu Kang and Changi, has noticed an increase in demand for its produce since the middle of last year - around the time a shadow was cast over local seafood supply when a Covid-19 cluster last July forced Jurong Fishery Port to shut for two weeks. Overseas supplies from countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam were disrupted as a result. The closure caused some anxiety among shoppers who rushed to wet markets fearing there would be a shortage of chilled seafood. Local aquaculture farms, such as The Fish Farmer, were roped in to raise their production and supply fish to supermarket chains such as FairPrice. The Fish Farmer chief executive Malcolm Ong said: ""The Jurong Fishery Port closure made people realise that if something happens, there will be a cut in supply. That brought the awareness that it is good to have local (produce)."" The firm also faces rising costs - mainly in fish feed and logistics - and has had to increase the price of its produce. Singapore has set a goal to produce 30 per cent of its people's nutritional needs by 2030. To combat the various economic uncertainties, local farms should adopt renewable energy and turn to innovation to rely less on conventional fertilisers, said Professor William Chen, director of the food science and technology programme at Nanyang Technological University. He highlighted how urban farming start-up AmpleFresh is working on using fermented soya pulp - a food waste from tofu and soya milk factories - as a nutrient base for its vegetable shoots. This reduces the firm's reliance on chemical fertilisers. ""The need to push for local food production for enhanced food security is even greater against the backdrop of the headwinds in the global food system,"" Prof Chen added."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/old-mrt-train-parts-get-new-life-as-benches-handrails-plant-holders-in-hdb-towns,"Old MRT train parts get new life as benches, handrails, plant holders in HDB towns","SINGAPORE - Residents in most towns can expect to see new benches, safety handrails and plant holders made from old MRT train parts installed in the neighbourhood. The project aims to upcycle at least 1,500 MRT seats into benches for void decks and other communal locations, as well as 1,400 handrails that will be repurposed as safety handrails for less mobile residents. About 900 intercom panels and LED light covers found in trains will also be converted into plant holders for use in community green spaces. The upcycling effort is being undertaken by all 15 People's Action Party (PAP) town councils to repurpose old MRT train parts to cut waste and add to the community environment, the party announced on Sunday (July 17). By 2025, around 14,400kg of reinforced plastics, metals and other hard-to-recycle materials from old trains will be upcycled instead of tossed in landfill sites, said PAP. The initiative, which was officially launched with an exhibition in Woodlands Drive 50 on Sunday (July 17), will help town councils to save some $275,000 in cost of amenities, said the PAP. Project vice-chairman Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC) said: ""With this project, we target to relieve Semakau of about 14,400kg of waste, doing our part to prolong its lifespan."" Pulau Semakau is Singapore's only landfill and is expected to be fully filled by 2035. Ms Soh added that MRT trains are a central pillar of the Singapore identity and said that residents will feel a sense of familiarity when they see the repurposed materials. These upcycling ideas were adapted from survey and public consultation feedback by residents, who were asked for suggestions on how old parts from trains could be reused. Ms Soh told The Straits Times that more forms of upcycled amenities may be rolled out in the future. She said: ""We will look at how viable and suitable these suggestions are and how they can be used, depending on each town council."" She added: ""For Marsiling-Yew Tee, we've targeted most of the studio apartments, where there are a lot of seniors. While waiting for lifts or vehicles, those with mobility issues can use the benches installed."" The launch event, held at a multipurpose pavilion in Woodlands, was attended by more than 50 residents, volunteers, media and other guests. The upcycled seats were earlier rolled out at lift lobbies and the void deck area at the housing block where Madam Annie Kwa, 75, lives. The retiree said that the new installations are helpful to the seniors, many of whom live in the studio apartments in the estate. Said Madam Kwa: ""A lot of elderly (people) walk around here and they need to rest. When they are waiting for the lift, they can rest there too."" She added that although the train seats are not new, they are sturdy and easy to wipe down. ""Sometimes the wooden benches have a bad smell when they are old,"" she said, adding that she hopes to see more repurposed benches in the neighbourhood. Another resident, former civil servant Leong Kum Tong, 75, said the handrails will be helpful for the many elderly residents, especially when they walk up ramps. Mr Leong said he was pleased to see old materials reused, and added: ""If we use recycled things, we won't have so much wastage... The parts are old but they still look new."" The project adds to the green initiatives under the Action for Green Towns (AGT) campaign, which involves MPs from each PAP town council working closely with residents on environmental goals. Last December, the campaign kicked off an initiative that rewarded those who recycle paper at one of 77 recycling machines with 6 cents per kilogramme. Giving an update on the project, AGT chairman Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar GRC) said on Sunday that residents saved more than 5,000 trees with the paper they recycled in the first half of the year."

However, fair and warm conditions are expected on the first few days of the second half of July, due to stable atmospheric conditions brought about by the presence of dry air over Singapore and the surrounding region, the Meteorological Service (MSS) said in a statement on Friday (July 15). Stable atmospheric conditions prevent the formation of rain clouds.  But for the rest of the month,  the monsoon rain band is forecast to lie close to the equator, MSS added. This is expected to bring more rainfall over the equatorial South-east Asia region, where Singapore is located.  Short-duration showers accompanied occasionally by thunder are expected over some parts of the island in the late morning and afternoon. On some days, the showers could be heavy, due to the convergence of winds over Singapore and the vicinity, the MSS statement added. “Island-wide thundery showers with occasional gusty winds due to Sumatra squalls can be expected in the predawn hours and morning on some days,” MSS said.  On most days, the daily temperatures are forecast to range between 24 deg C and 33 deg C. The wet weather may bring lower daily temperatures of between 23 deg C and 32 deg C on a few days. Associate Professor Koh Tieh Yong, a weather and climate scientist from the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS), said the rainy weather is typical of the south-west monsoon season which Singapore is experiencing now. “MSS’ prediction of 23 deg C on certain days is not extreme. While it is cooler than the average value of 25.4 deg C in July, we also expect roughly half of July nights to be so,” he said. Night-time minimum temperatures are expected to hover at about 28 deg C, particularly over the eastern and southern coastal areas. The influence of two climate phenomena could also bring more rainfall to Singapore in the coming months, The Straits Times reported in June.  La Nina, as well as the Indian Ocean Dipole, which is now in its negative phase, could cause wetter than average rainfall for Singapore for the June to August period. "
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/sustainable-shopping-raffles-city-recycling,Sustainable shopping: How this mall wants to help save the planet with you,"In recent years, terms like “fast fashion” and “overconsumption” have seeped into modern society’s consciousness, giving shopping a bad rap. Raffles City is changing that, one eco step at a time.  Through the Project Green campaign–a series of sustainability initiatives involving retail, hospitality and corporate stakeholders–Raffles City Singapore is revolutionising its retail experience for the better.  “By providing our retailers, office tenants and hotels a suitable platform via Project Green to expand on their green offerings, Raffles City aspires to make a bigger impact to inculcate sustainable living in the daily lives of our shoppers and stakeholders, and to adopt an eco-conscious attitude to make a positive impact on our planet together,” says general manager of Raffles City Singapore, Steve Ng. From July 8 to Sept 25, there will be  a slew of activities lined up for shoppers at the mall. Discover your inner eco-warrior when you take part in workshops that teach you how to incorporate recycling into your everyday life, through ordinary activities like dining and shopping. Here are three easy ways to get involved. Held at Raffles City Level 3 Atrium, the Project Green showcase features brands within the mall and their sustainability efforts.  Leading by example, Raffles City has created part of the display using upcycled materials from the mall’s past Christmas decorations. It includes a prominent tree centrepiece with two bicycles that shoppers can pedal to power up the lights.  In addition, an Adopt-A-Tree initiative by local cafe, The Providore, gives shoppers another avenue to practise sustainability efforts. Participants can help repopulate forests in Sumatra and Borneo, while helping to lower carbon emissions at the same time. The main Project Green showcase is divided into four zones that feature different tenants from F&B, beauty, and fashion, along with an exhibition area that displays the initiatives by Swissotel the Stamford and Fairmont Singapore, as well as the CapitaLand Master Plan 2030.  Meanwhile, you can also help weave the Pledge for Sustainability art mural at the exhibition area using recycled cotton and fabric, and possibly end up contributing to bid for the largest textile yarn installation in the Singapore Book of Records!  At the F&B and beauty zones are Nespresso and L’Occitane, which will hold masterclasses and upcycling workshops. Learn how Nespresso recycles their used capsules, turning them into new aluminium objects, while L’Occitane unveils its Recycling Program – the first in Singapore to accept empty packing from any beauty brand. And while you’re at it, why not pop by their first and only eco store in Singapore on Level 1?  The fashion zone, on the other hand, will include brands like the socially conscious Little Match Girl and Lush cosmetics, as well as Furla, with its Bloom bag made from a special paper-like fabric and recycled acrylic chain strap. Social enterprise Terra SG, known for its engaging eco-education programmes, will be running weekend public workshops. Featured mall tenants will also take turns to run workshops that help educate shoppers on other ways to go green.  Going green is not just in fashion these days – it’s essential to help reduce our carbon footprint and preserve the Earth for the generations to come.  Unsure how to start? Head to the Green Corner at Lobby A on Basement 2 for inspiration.  A permanent set-up, the space has been reimagined and decked out with preserved moss, recycled wood and steel frames, with low-energy lighting and interactive elements.  To be refreshed every quarter, the Green Corner is designed to educate the public about sustainability and how to adopt good recycling habits. Featuring interactive educational displays, vending machines which take in recyclable items, as well as recycling and e-waste bins, the Green Corner also has a Bag Sharing Station for shoppers to, well, share the love by depositing their unused paper bags for other shoppers to take and use. With beautifully designed reusable bags becoming commonplace in Singapore, make ‘Bagless Fridays’ your new shopping habit as you wind down for the weekend. A new initiative by Raffles City, ‘Bagless Fridays’ will take place throughout the Project Green campaign. Shoppers are encouraged to BYOR (Bring Your Own Reusables), with participating tenants not offering shopping bags in order to reduce plastic bag use and wastage. As a bonus, shoppers who use their own recyclable bags at participating stores at Raffles City can earn double STAR$ on the CapitaStar app.   For a minimum spend of $450, shoppers will receive a Raffles City x Tiong Bahru Bakery limited edition reusable Sttoke cup specially designed in celebration of the bakery’s 10th anniversary.  With Project Green, Raffles City is leading the way in encouraging a sustainable lifestyle, while showing us how simple it can be. So the next time you head out to the mall, how about taking that reusable bag with you?

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/spores-third-national-climate-change-study-to-be-completed-in-sept-2023,S'pore's third national climate change study to be completed in Sept 2023,"SINGAPORE - Singapore's third national climate change study, which will provide localised and high-resolution climate projections till 2100, will be completed in September next year. The study will provide South-east Asia's most advanced climate projections, zeroing in on every square of land or sea spanning 8km. It will help countries plan ways to guard against the dangerous effects of climate change in the most accurate way possible. The model will divide Singapore and the rest of the region's land and sea into grid cells of 8km by 8km , and each cell's changes in temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall amount and sea level rise will be projected till 2100. This is finer than usual global models, where the side of each grid cell spans between 70km and 250km, which means Singapore appears as just one grid point, or not at all, because the island city-state is only about 45km across at its widest. The Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS) has been working with the National Supercomputing Centre to scale down global climate models to produce the 8km resolution forecasts. Localised projections are important as different regions experience climate change differently. To date, about 60 per cent to 70 per cent of data has been produced for the study, and researchers will start to analyse the data next year, said Dr Dale Barker, director of CCRS, at the third Sea Level Conference of the World Climate Research Programme on Tuesday (July 12). Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu, who gave the opening address at the conference at Sands Expo and Convention Centre, noted that climate scientists have found this region's climate, especially rainfall patterns, particularly challenging to model. Rainfall in South-east Asia is affected by many factors. But many climate scientists call this region the engine room of the global climate system, said Ms Fu. ""The atmosphere, water bodies and land masses here are in constant conversation with each other, exchanging huge quantities of heat and moisture, and fuelling global atmospheric and ocean circulation,"" she added. Localised and high-resolution models of temperature, rainfall and wind changes here will allow scientists to better assess the impacts of climate change on local crop and aquaculture yields, for example. This will help the country choose sea spaces that are more suitable for aquaculture, said Ms Fu. Dr Barker added that the data from the regional climate projections can be used in near-future projects such as the newly launched Climate Impact Science Research Programme, which will scrutinise the long-term effects of the warming planet in areas, including biodiversity and energy. Singapore will share its downscaled regional climate projections with the region so countries can use them in their adaptation planning. The Republic's climate science research will not end with its third national climate change study, also called V3. After September next year, CCRS will work on a V3+, which will focus on modelling urban heat scenarios and storm surge parameters. The fourth national study, or V4, will be completed around 2027, said Dr Barker."

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/new-65m-effort-to-make-nanoparticle-manufacturing-in-spore-cheaper-more-efficient,"New $6.5m effort to make nanoparticle manufacturing in S'pore cheaper, more efficient","SINGAPORE - A new Singapore-based research project that aims to speed up the manufacture of nanoparticles - which are used in everything from Covid-19 vaccines to sunscreen and spacecraft - was launched on Monday (July 11). The $6.5 million effort - called the Accelerated, Manufacturing Platform for Engineered Nanomaterials (Ample) - will develop a manufacturing platform that can be rapidly scaled up to produce up to 100kg of nanoparticles a day. Ample is funded by the National Research Foundation's Central Gap Fund. Current nanomaterial manufacturing techniques are time-intensive, inaccurate or bulky, said Dr Nicholas Jose, one of the project leads for Ample. However, this new platform could help to reduce the time needed for such materials to come to market, he added. This experimental platform, conducted by the Cambridge Centre for Advanced Research and Education in Singapore (Cares) and NTUitive, the innovation and enterprise company of Nanyang Technological University (NTU), is expected to be commercialised in Singapore around 2024, said the two institutions in a joint statement on Monday. While Ample will initially focus on manufacturing antimicrobial zinc oxide particles, which are used in sunscreen and self-cleaning coatings, the technology can also be used to manufacture other products, they said. These include, for example, biological capsules that are used to encase mRNA in Covid-19 vaccines, and advanced coatings for spacecraft. Dr Jose said: ""We can see nanomaterial applications all around us - in paints, computers, cars, medicine and textiles, to name a few."" He added that the microscopic particles, which can be up to 10,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair, can dramatically enhance the performance of current products and even enable the development of new products. NTUitive chief executive David Toh said: ""The success of this multidisciplinary project... will put Singapore in the lead position to produce novel nanomaterials, a field where the nation is already at the forefront."" Dr Jose, a Cares research fellow, said that nanomaterials are usually made slowly in large containers with high temperatures, pressures and toxic chemicals, or are produced quickly yet imprecisely through techniques like the grinding or burning of larger molecules. This process of slow experimental scaling-up leads to a lead-up time of between 10 years and 20 years for a nanomaterial to come into the market. As a result, the long timeline to commercialisation makes investors and industries reluctant to invest, creating a ""chicken or egg"" dilemma. He added: ""Some of the first materials like graphene, which was discovered in 2003, still have not reached economically viable tonne-scale production."" Graphene, which can conduct electricity, is being studied for use in gene therapy and to create more durable hydrogen fuel cells for cars, among other things. However, Dr Jose said that Ample's technique, which uses a combination of machine learning and new reactor technology for efficient energy generation, will allow for the fast and accurate manufacturing of nano materials at a much lower cost. He said: ""Singapore and the world will undoubtedly face new and daunting challenges, whether pandemics or rising temperatures, which new materials are necessary to solve."" By providing an economical pathway to rapidly produce and commercialise these innovations in nanotechnology, Dr Jose hopes that such research will be brought to the masses at a faster rate. Professor Lam Yeng Ming, chair of NTU's School of Materials Science and Engineering, who is not involved in Ample, said that the central bottleneck for the application of nanoparticles lies in how much of these can be manufactured. Prof Lam, who created a face mask filter with copper oxide nanoparticles that can destroy 99.9 percent of bacteria and viruses in face masks, said: ""To be able to produce large amounts of nanoparticles in a short time will ensure the adoption of the use of these nanoparticles."" She added that, ultimately, the ability to shorten the manufacturing process of these nanoparticles while keeping manufacturing precision high will shorten the time for this material to be produced in reasonable scale and used practically."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/only-a-small-fraction-of-eligible-households-have-used-their-vouchers-for-energy-saving-appliances,Only a small fraction of eligible households have used their vouchers for energy-saving appliances,"SINGAPORE - Only a small fraction of around 300,000 households living in one- to three-room flats have used vouchers given to them by the Government to help them offset the cost of buying energy-efficient appliances - which can lower their electricity bills. Since late 2020, each one- to three-room Housing Board flat household can redeem three e-vouchers worth $225 in total. They comprise a $150 voucher to buy energy-saving refrigerators, a $25 voucher for LED lights, and a $50 voucher for water-saving shower fittings. This means that 300,000 flats can redeem 900,000 vouchers in total. As at May this year, about 23,000 e-vouchers have been redeemed - of which 11,700 were for refrigerators, 7,600 for LED lights, and 3,700 for shower fittings, said the National Environment Agency (NEA), which runs the scheme with national water agency PUB. The e-vouchers under the Climate Friendly Households programme are valid till Dec 31 next year. Eligible households can redeem the vouchers through the programme's website. Under NEA's Minimum Energy Performance Standards, appliances are rated with up to five ticks which are shown on labels pasted on the products being sold. More ticks indicate a more energy-efficient appliance. An appliance with at least three ticks is deemed energy-efficient and can be bought using the vouchers under the scheme. Energy-saving appliances tend to be more costly compared with ordinary ones. While the programme aims to help homes reduce their carbon footprints, it also helps them reduce their utility bills amid rising electricity prices. Households can save between $40 and $120 annually by switching to such appliances, said NEA on its website. It was announced on June 30 that the electricity tariff here would be 30.17 cents per kilowatt-hour for the next three months - an 8.1 per cent hike from the last quarter. For three-room flats, the tariff jump is expected to add an extra $6 to each household's monthly bill, on average. Electricity prices have been soaring globally since last year, due to factors including the unanticipated demand for gas from pandemic recovery, reductions in global gas supply, and the rippling effects of the Russia-Ukraine war. When asked if the programme's deadline may be extended to raise the take-up rate of the e-vouchers, NEA said that as the vouchers are valid for about 18 more months, households are likely to save the vouchers until their appliances are due for replacement. ""We will continue to monitor the take-up rate of the vouchers and review the programme at an appropriate juncture,"" the agency said. Meanwhile, NEA and PUB will continue to reach out to eligible households to raise awareness about the programme. This will be done through posters and digital display panels at community centres and HDB blocks, and through roadshows, for instance. Mr Yeong Choon Hong, 46, who lives in a three-room flat in Woodlands with his family, opted for the e-vouchers in mid-2021 to buy eight LED bulbs and two water-efficient shower heads, which cost about $120 in total. The maintenance manager already owns energy-efficient models for his refrigerator, washing machine and television. He said that after replacing the lights and shower heads, his monthly electricity and water bills dropped from $85 and $100 to $70 and $85. But with the hike in electricity prices, his electricity and water bills are currently $80 and $100. Still, he manages to save about $5 on each bill compared with before replacing the lights and shower heads. Mr Yeong lives with his wife and two children, aged eight and 12. He added that staying on a fixed-rate electricity plan and adopting more energy-saving habits at home have prevented his electricity bills from rising further. ""We increased the air-con's temperature to 25 and 26 deg C, from 23 and 24 deg C. We turn the air-con on an hour before bedtime, and turn it off after the kids fall asleep,"" he added. Dr David Broadstock, who heads the energy economics division at the National University of Singapore's Energy Studies Institute, noted that heating and cooling devices, such as water heaters, air-conditioning and refrigerators are the largest energy guzzlers at home. ""One thing households need to be mindful of is that when saving money from using energy-efficient appliances, some will use that saved money on other goods and services, which may themselves use energy. This can create a rebound effect,"" he added. Mr Sasthitharan Gopal, 29, who lives with his grandmother and mother in a three-room flat, said he had not paid attention to how many green ticks there were on the energy labels on the appliances at home. ""When buying a washing machine or refrigerator, usually what I would look at are the features or the size. We try to limit the usage of appliances to keep our bills manageable. I am not sure if I am going to save much just by changing (to energy-efficient models),"" said Mr Sasthitharan, an administrative assistant at a dormitory. Mr Mohamed Jairzinno, 48, a private hire driver, lives with two children in a two-room flat in Toa Payoh and he spends about $130 on water and electricity bills. Mr Jairzinno is aware of the vouchers but chose not to redeem them. He said: ""Even with a voucher, I will still need to fork out (money). And if my current appliances are working fine, I am not going to spend extra money to change them. If I were to use the voucher and go buy a fridge now, I will have $200 to $300 less to spend on necessities for the month."" Eligible Singaporean households will receive double their regular Goods and Services Tax (GST) Voucher - U-Save rebates this financial year to further offset their utility bills. This amounts to about eight to 10 months' worth of utility bills for residents of one-and two-room HDB flats, and about four to six months' worth of bills for those living in three-and four-room flats. The payouts are between $440 and $760, depending on flat type. Every Singaporean household will receive a $100 utilities credit as part of a $1.5 billion support package. The credits will be disbursed by September."

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/what-highly-active-people-eat-may-raise-their-risk-of-heat-stroke-report,What highly active people eat may raise their risk of heat stroke: Report,"SINGAPORE - Military servicemen, athletes and outdoor workers should watch what they eat - not only to stay healthy - but also to prevent heat stroke caused by exertion. The common nutrition, health supplements and diets of these highly active individuals can make them more at risk of exertional heat stroke, if taken inappropriately, said researchers from the National University of Singapore's Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (NUS Medicine), in a recently published review paper. Those food choices, if over-consumed, mainly lead to gastrointestinal complications, leading to fluid loss and higher risk of exertional heat stroke. One example is carbohydrate, which is a staple for many, including sportsmen, who may take it in the form of energy bars, gels and energising drinks in between training and workouts. But if taken in large amounts - more than 90g of the carbohydrates per hour - those foods can cause vomiting and diarrhoea. ""One possible reason is that large doses of carbohydrates may not be adequately absorbed - the carbohydrates left sitting in the gut can subsequently lead to gastrointestinal symptoms,"" said Dr Beverly Tan from NUS Medicine's Human Potential Translational Research Programme, and one of the two co-leads of the paper. Scientists from Britain and the United States were also part of the team. Exertional heat stroke happens with a spike in the core body temperature to above 40 deg C at times - due to strenuous exercise - often in hot and humid environments. Key symptoms are disturbances to the central nervous system, such as delirium, and unconsciousness. Organ and tissue damage are also common, which can lead to multiple-organ failure.  In Singapore, exertional heat injuries are more common, compared with classic heat injuries during heatwaves in temperate regions. These exertional heat injuries are more common among people who do intensive physical activities for long hours under the sun, including marathoners, construction workers and those in the military. A doctor from Khoo Teck Puat Hospital previously told The Straits Times that it sees up to three times more patients with heat-related injuries during the hotter months which fall around mid-year than in the cooler months. And with temperatures and humidity expected to rise due to climate change, the risk of exertional heat stroke will be even greater, said Associate Professor Jason Lee, deputy director of the Human Potential Translational Research Programme and the other co-lead of the paper. Beyond carbohydrate bars and gels, performance-enhancing supplements containing caffeine and sodium bicarbonate do their job by helping consumers reduce their perception of effort and fatigue. But those effects can increase the consumers' risk of exertional heat stroke when they end up over-estimating their abilities while doing strenuous work in the heat. The paper also highlighted a number of food substances that can both contribute to and prevent heat stroke. One of them is glutamine, an essential amino acid found in whey protein, for example. When consumed either over seven days, or a single dose two hours before exertional heat stress sets in, the amino acid enhances the ability of cells to withstand heat stress. But for some, that same amount of glutamine can lead to gastrointestinal distress, noted Dr Tan. The review paper, published in scientific journal Experimental Physiology in April, aims to shed light on the role of supplements and food choices in influencing exertional heat stroke. The more commonly known factors that influence heat stroke and injuries include clothing, environmental conditions, the fitness and health status of individuals, and how acclimatised they are to the heat. Tweaking those factors can reduce the risk of heat injuries. Prof Lee said: ""It is likely that nutrition needs to go hand in hand with other more proven strategies such as work-rest cycles, aerobic (fitness), heat acclimatisation, cooling and appropriate hydration to truly heatproof humans."" In furthering the heat-nutrition understanding, Dr Tan added: ""It is important for more research to be performed in women, youth, middle-aged individuals and multi-ethnic populations, as the participants in the majority of research studies are young men, mostly Caucasians."" - Workers in indoor places such as commercial kitchens, boiler rooms and food factories are not shielded from heat stress. Those places may have insufficient ventilation and some work processes may emit radiant heat. - High humidity: When the surrounding air is humid with more moisture, that will impede the process of sweat evaporation, which is the body's main mechanism for losing heat. - Sleep deprivation: Tiredness impairs decision-making, and reduces a person's ability to regulate body heat. - Low nutrition: The high energy demands of occupational work may lower a person's immunity and make him more susceptible to infections. Such illnesses can blunt one's tolerance to heat stress. - Poor physical fitness: A fitter person has a more efficient sweating mechanism, and his body experiences less strain when working under the heat. - Personal protective equipment covers the body and face, and limits air movement and the cooling effect of sweating. The additional outfit layer puts an increased heat load on the body. Rest breaks should be longer or more frequent for these workers. - Workers should go for loose-fitting and light-coloured clothing. - New workers, especially those who come from colder climates, should slowly increase their heat tolerance by starting small and increasing their work hours and workload in the hot setting. - Workers new to Singapore would need one to two weeks to adjust to the local weather conditions and workload. - Working returning from long quarantine indoors - common during Covid-19 pandemic - or long sick leave will need to be reaccustomed to the hot environment. - One way workers can ""heat-proof"" themselves is to do more aerobic fitness exercises, to train the heart to pump blood more efficiently and raise their thermal tolerance.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/can-solar-energy-power-coral-growth-research-effort-one-of-spores-initiatives-to-safeguard-oceans,Can solar energy power coral growth? Research effort one of S'pore's initiatives to safeguard oceans,"SINGAPORE - Singapore is undertaking various initiatives to improve the health of the ocean, including a research effort that aims to study if solar energy can be used to power coral growth. Dr Karenne Tun, a director at the National Parks Board's (NParks) National Biodiversity Centre, told The Straits Times last week that the project aims to test the feasibility of using very low voltage electrical currents to aid the growth of coral fragments in Singapore waters. A healthy and diverse coral reef maintains and drives other beneficial ecological processes, she said. For example, a healthy reef can support healthy food webs and is also more resilient to harmful species invasions. ""Findings from this project will help facilitate coral restoration works in other marine areas with similar water sedimentation and light conditions,"" Dr Tun added. The project is one of nine new initiatives that the Republic is undertaking to boost the health of the oceans. The nine, which include efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of the emissions-intensive maritime sector and an environmental training course, were announced by Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan during the United Nations Ocean Conference in Portugal last month. Singapore is a tiny island, a maritime city-state, whose history, people and economy are inseparable from the ocean, Dr Balakrishnan said then. ""Our survival, our prosperity depend on the oceans... The ocean provides food, jobs and livelihood. It enables global trade, and it plays a vital role in the climate systems and the water cycle, and is an important reservoir of biodiversity,"" he added. Dr Balakrishnan said the conservation and sustainable use of the ocean must be conducted under the aegis of international law, and that such efforts should also be based on data and science. Multilateral cooperation is needed to protect the health of the oceans, he added. ""While Singapore is tiny, we are doing our part,"" Dr Balakrishnan said, in announcing the Republic's new voluntary commitments to the United Nations. Commitments made by countries during the conference are listed on the website of the UN's Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Of the nine commitments Singapore is undertaking, three are environmental research projects. Other than the coral research project, the other two initiatives include a $25 million Marine Climate Change Science programme, which was announced in March 2021 by the National Development Ministry; and a study on the sustainable management of marine fish populations by marine biologists at NParks and the National University of Singapore. ""Mapping the connectivity of fish populations can provide insights into the connectivity between marine habitats in Singapore and inform the sustainable management of fish larvae,"" Dr Tun said. Singapore has also committed to five new measures to reduce the environmental impact of the shipping industry. ""On the shipping front, we are spearheading a transition towards the supply of environmentally friendly ship fuel, and are actively involved in promoting green financing and building capacity in carbon accounting within the maritime industry,"" Dr Balakrishnan said. ""We are also incentivising shipowners to switch to energy-efficient technologies and low or zero-carbon fuels."" A spokesman for the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) said maritime decarbonisation is a global challenge requiring collective action, and that it is committed to working towards clean shipping and the protection of the marine environment. ""MPA works closely with stakeholders across the maritime value chain, complementing the efforts by the International Maritime Organisation, and based on a multilateral and coordinated approach to developing maritime decarbonisation solutions,"" she added. This year, Singapore will also be conducting three courses - for government officials and policymakers from developing countries - on the international law of the sea, managing coastal biodiversity under urbanisation pressures, and environmental conservation and sustainability, under the Singapore Cooperation Programme, said Dr Balakrishnan. The programme was launched in 1992 to share Singapore's development experience and extend technical assistance to fellow developing countries."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/businesses-can-work-with-universities-to-produce-talents-in-sustainability-field-dbs-ceo-piyush-gupta,Businesses can work with universities to produce talents in sustainability field: DBS CEO Piyush Gupta,"SINGAPORE - Businesses can work with universities to advance green efforts through research and innovation, and also with scholarships to produce talents in the sustainability field. DBS Bank chief executive officer Piyush Gupta made the points on Thursday (July 7) at an annual meeting of university leaders to discuss sustainability issues. Mr Gupta said that universities and businesses like DBS should explore co-creation and research to combat climate change. They could also partner to train manpower in the sustainability field, by providing grants for example. ""The private sector and the corporate world are serious about putting money behind these big issues. Just the motivation of being able to fund some research helps businesses and universities come together,"" he said. He highlighted the bank's partnership in 2019 with Singapore Management University which led to the introduction of a new sustainability major in the SMU Lee Kong Chian School of Business. The DBS-SMU Sustainability Initiative also provides funding for sustainability research, scholarships, fellowships and community engagement. DBS has committed more than $1 million for this initiative, said Mr Gupta. The discussion was part of a four-day-long Association of Pacific Rim Universities (APRU) meeting at Nanyang Technological University. The event saw 90 university leaders come together for the first physical meeting since the Covid-19 pandemic. Dr Joy Johnson, president of Simon Fraser University in Canada, asked Mr Gupta to reflect on how some communities are disproportionately impacted by climate change, particularly those which are economically disadvantaged. Mr Gupta said DBS is involved in responsible lending, for example, to palm oil companies in Indonesia that undertake good environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices. The framework gives investors an insight into how an organisation manages risks and opportunities around sustainability issues. The event also included panel discussions on sustainability and climate change, how to prevent the next pandemic and the need to collaborate in a post-pandemic world that is seeing a rising trend of protectionism."

The area has one of the largest and most biodiverse secondary forests in Singapore. National water agency PUB said the upgrading of the aged Choa Chu Kang Waterworks, which is the only plant supplying treated reservoir water to the western part of Singapore, is vital for the nation's water security. It added that it will take steps to reduce the impact on wildlife. Work to clear the forest is expected to start next year. About 3.2ha of vegetation south of the existing site will be cleared for the expansion of the plant, which dates back to 1975. This is equivalent to the size of about six football fields. An environmental impact assessment (EIA) for the project was completed at the end of last year. Members of the nature community in Singapore were consulted by PUB in March this year, and the report was published on PUB's website on Monday evening (July 4). The report, by sustainability consultancy firm Tembusu Asia Consulting, said the works are expected to negatively impact the flora and fauna in the Western Catchment forest. The entire Western Catchment area, which houses a number of reservoirs and is also used by the military, is bound by Tuas in the south, the Johor Strait in the west, Lim Chu Kang to its north and Tengah to its east. Wildlife in the area include the fern Helminthostachys zeylanica, which was found for the first time in Singapore during the biodiversity surveys done as part of the EIA. The affected plot is also home to critically endangered Sunda pangolins and straw-headed bulbuls. Two freshwater forest streams, considered rare habitats in Singapore, will also be affected by the works, said the report. Surveys had shown that the streams are home to the critically endangered elf dragonfly. The Johnson's freshwater crab - a species found nowhere else in the world - has also been recorded in the streams there. The report said that while ""environmental impacts... are expected to be of slight to major negative levels"", the negative impact can be cushioned if certain measures are undertaken. EIAs evaluate the impact of a construction project on wildlife based on factors such as the permanence of the change and the importance of the species, meaning whether it is locally or globally endangered. These scores are then pegged to a band and labelled using such terms as ""moderate negative change"" or ""major positive change"". In this case, the report said the works will cause a ""complete loss of certain habitats or ecological components"", which could in turn affect sensitive creatures in the area. ""However, this can be reduced to moderate negative levels and lower by diligently implementing the environmental mitigation measures recommended in this report,"" added the report. For example, to avoid directly impacting one of the streams in the area, PUB adjusted the boundaries of the project so there would be a 10m-wide strip of vegetation serving as a buffer between the main tributary of the stream and the project footprint. Other proposed measures mentioned in the report include the installation of sound-proof barriers to reduce the impact of construction noise on sensitive wildlife; not conducting works at night and the establishment of tree protection zones so that some trees can be retained. The report also recommended transplanting plants of high conservation value and relocating native aquatic fauna species. Mr Chew Chee Keong, director of PUB's water supply (plants) department, said that while the measures will add to the overall time and cost of the project, the agency is committed to implementing all of them to mitigate the project's impact on the environment. For example, saplings of plants that are of conservation significance will be salvaged and placed in a designated nursery or transplanted to other suitable habitats, he said. ""The salvaged species can be utilised in the replanting of the site if feasible, such as for reinstatement, slope stabilisation, forest enhancement or animal connectivity purposes,"" Mr Chew added. Plans for the expansion of the Choa Chu Kang Waterworks were announced by PUB last year. The agency said then that the plant would be upgraded with the latest water treatment technologies and smart capabilities to enhance its operations, maintenance, safety and security. The expansion is expected to be completed in 2026. Built in phases between 1975 and 1981, the plant draws water from the Kranji, Pandan and Tengah reservoirs to supply 80 million gallons per day - which can fill about 145 Olympic-sized swimming pools - of drinking water to the western part of the country. Asked why PUB had to cut down parts of the Western Catchment forest instead of keeping the renovation work within the existing site, Mr Chew said the plant is the only one located in western Singapore. ""As part of PUB's long-term planning to safeguard water security, it is paramount that we conduct timely renewal of (the plant's) aged infrastructure to ensure it can continue to supply good and safe drinking water in the years to come,"" he added. But there is not enough space within the existing plant to cater to both the operation of existing facilities, and the construction of new treatment facilities to replace old structures. “Additional land is therefore needed to house the new infrastructure,” he said. Mr Chew added that a key consideration when selecting the plot of land was the potential for lower energy consumption in the longer term, which would reduce the overall carbon footprint of the plant. The parcel of land to be cleared is at a comparatively lower ground level compared with the original site of the plant, which eliminates the need to construct pumping facilities, said PUB. This will help to improve energy efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint of the plant during its operations, the EIA report noted. ""PUB sought to limit the land take and made a decision to leave as much of the natural streams out of the plant's footprint as it was possible,"" Mr Chew said. Dr Vilma D'Rozario, co-director of local wildlife group Singapore Wildcat Action Group, said PUB had consulted the nature community on the project. ""Our concerns were for the natural streams and notable, native flora and fauna, but it looks like carefully planned mitigation measures have been set out,"" she said. Dr D'Rozario said she was heartened by the thorough survey of flora and fauna, and by PUB's commitment to carry out the mitigation measures. But she added that it was equally important that the measures are implemented as well as they were planned. ""It's so difficult to balance our needs for clean water in the west with preservation of native biodiversity,"" she said. ""Yet, the reconstruction of the water plant is just one of a few other large developments in the area, including a station for the nearby Jurong Region Line. ""So, coming all together, this will be a blow to biodiversity."" The environmental impact assessment report for the Choa Chu Kang Waterworks can be found on PUB's website. Members of the public can provide their feedback on the report by Aug 1, 2022."

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/new-25-million-research-institute-to-bring-green-hydrogen-from-lab-to-society,S'pore eyes green hydrogen as energy source with $25m institute,"SINGAPORE - A new $25 million research institute aimed at making green hydrogen a commercially viable clean fuel to power Singapore's needs was launched last Friday (July 1) as the Republic moves to decarbonise its energy sector. The National University of Singapore's (NUS) Centre for Hydrogen Innovations will help create breakthrough technologies that will make hydrogen a viable green energy source. Professor Ho Teck Hua, NUS Senior Deputy President and Provost, said that both the new centre as well as NUS' Green Energy Programme - which focuses on carbon capture and utilisation technologies - are part of the university's strategy of coming up with innovative ways to reduce Singapore's reliance on fossil fuels. The centre, the first of its kind in South-east Asia, has received a total investment of $25 million, of which $15 million is an endowment gift from government investment firm Temasek. Led by Professor Liu Bin, who also established the NUS Green Energy Programme, the centre will be ""taking a holistic approach"" in tackling both the technological and infrastructural challenges of creating a competitive hydrogen economy. Low carbon hydrogen imports have also been identified as a viable way forward in bringing the power sector - which now produces 40 per cent of the country's emissions - to net zero by 2050, according to the Energy 2050 Committee report, which was released in March. In the first phase, the centre will primarily focus on hydrogen carriers for storage and transport - a fairly nascent area of research - as well as the global supply chain for hydrogen. ""While hydrogen can be imported through pipelines, this can only be done for short distances from countries like Malaysia. Liquefied hydrogen is very energy-intensive and would require investments in new infrastructure,"" Prof Liu told The Straits Times. Another method would be to convert hydrogen into a liquid chemical carrier that can be transported at room temperature using existing infrastructure. But more research is needed to extract hydrogen from its carrier. Aside from looking into transporting hydrogen, the centre is also gearing up to produce hydrogen locally, to safeguard Singapore's energy security in the event of supply chain disruptions. Hydrogen can be produced through the electrolysis of water, separating it into hydrogen and oxygen, as well as methane pyrolysis - a process which splits natural gas into hydrogen and solid carbon. But in order to be considered a green fuel, both processes must be powered by renewable energy such as solar. To accelerate the use of green hydrogen as a fuel for sectors such as transport and electricity, the centre will be working closely with industrial players in these areas. It will also create a talent pipeline such that workers can contribute to different components of the hydrogen economy. These training programmes range from degree programmes to short courses which target undergraduates to adult learners and industry leaders. To enable the safe adoption of these novel hydrogen technologies, the centre will collaborate with NUS to work with policymakers and national agencies to come up with safety regulations, risk assessments and policies targeting these issues. So far, nine projects in hydrogen research will be funded by the centre, each receiving up to $250,000. Temasek's head of Strategic Development Russell Tham said it is pleased to support the centre to accelerate its research and development efforts and develop talent for the hydrogen economy. A board comprising leaders from the academic, government and corporate sectors in Singapore and overseas will be co-chaired by Prof Ho and Mr Tham to provide strategic direction and stewardship for the new centre. Dr Victor Nian, chief executive of the Centre for Strategic Energy and Resources, an independent think-tank which is headquartered in Singapore, said that while the NUS centre is striving to make an impact in accelerating the creation of a global hydrogen economy, industries will also have to build strategic partnerships along the value chain, especially for building an ecosystem from hydrogen supply to demand among countries. The Government would also have a role in accelerating the adoption of hydrogen for downstream applications, he added."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/science-talk-boosting-spores-food-security-by-making-meat-without-animals,Science Talk: Boosting S'pore's food security by making meat without animals,"SINGAPORE - During a recent lunch break at a hawker stall in Singapore, some young farmers sat down to enjoy tasty satay made with chicken that they were proud to say they helped produce. But the meat sizzling over the open flame did not come from a shed or slaughterhouse, nor was it imported like most chicken consumed in Singapore."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/fresh-greens-grown-in-community-gardens-in-ang-mo-kio-given-to-residents-as-part-of-community-ecoday,Greens grown in community gardens in Ang Mo Kio given to residents at neighbourhood eco event,"SINGAPORE - Fresh vegetables grown in various community gardens and farms in Ang Mo Kio were distributed on Sunday (July 3) to Cheng San and Seletar residents facing financial difficulties. The greens were harvested as part of sustainability efforts in the neighbourhood. Residents of Ang Mo Kio learnt about such initiatives during the neighbourhood's first-ever Community EcoDay, which was organised by the Cheng San-Seletar Citizens' Consultative Committee. At the event, social enterprise City Sprouts explained how it uses food scraps from nearby hawker centres as compost for the plants in the gardens. Over the last few months, it has also been engaging community gardeners and supporting the launch of a community composting effort. Residents were encouraged to bring reusable bags and recyclable containers and cups to the event, which was held at Chong Boon Market and Food Centre. Those who did were given the chance to spin a wheel and win various prizes, including food vouchers. There was also a pop-up thrift store organised by Upcircle, a ground-up group which advocates and promotes sustainability through organising door-to-door collection of recyclables and reusable items. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who was guest of honour, toured the neighbourhood and spoke with residents about the various green initiatives. He also took part in the day's activities by planting eggplant seedlings at the Cheng San Bottle Tree Residents' Network Community Garden. Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin, who is an Ang Mo Kio GRC MP together with PM Lee, said residents' interest in gardening and other sustainability efforts had grown during the Covid-19 pandemic. This was because they were spending more time at home. ""Sustainability is a big word, but it's really about our day-to-day habits... we hope to see more people coming together to be able to literally share the fruits of their labour,"" she said. Madam Manor Param, 74, who had just taken part in a craft project using recycled materials, said senior citizens could educate the younger generation about recycling. Ms Tay Wee Leng, who founded Upcircle, hopes her organisation's thrift shop can show residents that there is still value in second-hand goods. The 34-year-old Ang Mo Kio resident said it is important for people to understand the benefits of the circular economy, a model of production and consumption that involves sharing and reusing items for as long as possible. ""We have a lot of technology that can turn things into other items, but at the heart of it, it's every consumer's action that really counts. ""You can have great recycling technology, but if nobody does the recycling, it doesn't work,"" said Ms Tay. Student Jolynn Yeo, 15, has been turning her family's food waste into compost for use with their plants. She said: ""In school I learnt a lot about how our actions impact the environment... there's a lot of food waste produced in Singapore, and if we're able to reduce some waste, I think it'll make a big difference."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/spore-launches-three-new-satellites-into-space-for-security-climate-disaster-monitoring,"S'pore launches three new satellites into space for security, climate, disaster monitoring","SINGAPORE - The Republic made further strides in space with the launch of three new satellites for national, research and commercial uses on Thursday (June 30). The two larger satellites - developed by government agencies and firms - will act as eyes on the region for various uses such as enhancing maritime security, detecting oil spills and monitoring disasters for humanitarian aid. The third and smallest among them, a 3.1kg nanosatellite, was designed and built by more than 50 students from Nanyang Technological University (NTU). This research satellite will remain in space for six months to test new technologies. On Thursday, a 44m-tall rocket carrying the three satellites lifted off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in South India after 6pm (8.30pm Singapore time). The satellites were released into orbit about 570km above Earth a little after 8.50pm Singapore time. Thursday's launch brings the total number of Singapore satellites to 19, since the first one was sent up in 2011. Most were research satellites. Mr David Tan, executive director of Singapore's space office, the Office for Space Technology and Industry (OSTIn), said: ""We are committed to supporting the development of local capabilities in space-based technologies to ensure that Singapore can effectively harness these technologies to serve national needs in domains such as aviation, maritime, climate and sustainability."" The second-largest of the three new satellites is the first locally developed satellite with a radar technology that can capture images in the night and in poor weather. This NeuSAR satellite is equipped with synthetic aperture radar that sends radio waves to the Earth's surface and collects the returns to form images. The 160kg satellite can thus penetrate darkness, thick clouds, haze and volcanic ash, unlike those that use optical cameras. NeuSAR's development was led by DSO National Laboratories, Singapore's defence research and development organisation. The largest satellite among the trio is the 365kg DS-EO, a venture by the Defence Science and Technology Agency and ST Engineering. Unlike NeuSAR, the DS-EO's image quality is dependent on good weather and daylight. This Earth observation satellite can take full-colour snapshots to recognise scenes on different ground terrain features, generate high-quality maps and serve disaster relief needs. Singapore mainly focuses on the small satellite business, with machines below 500kg. They are less costly and faster to develop than traditional large satellites. Constellations of small satellites - which provide wider Earth coverage - can be formed to provide on-demand images for commercial and civil purposes, said DSO National Laboratories and OSTIn in a statement. NTU's 35cm-long Scoob-I is the 10th research satellite the university has launched since 2011. It is also Singapore's first satellite that can measure the amount of energy from the Sun that reaches Earth. The data obtained from the satellite's sensor can contribute to climate studies and help protect sensitive space electronics from harsh solar activity. ""Part of the solar energy coming to Earth is reflected (back to space). Because of climate change and global warming, we are retaining more of the energy,"" said Assistant Professor Amal Chandran from NTU's Satellite Research Centre, who designed and developed the solar spectrum sensor. ""We need to study both incoming and outgoing energy to understand how much energy is being retained on Earth. The sensor from Scoob-I will help to quantify a small part of the incoming solar energy,"" added Prof Chandran, who is the director of space science and technology at the research centre. Scoob-I is also the first of three NTU satellite missions that will be helmed by students. The three projects allow them to take on more leadership roles and make decisions related to the missions, said Prof Chandran. For NTU's previous nine satellites, students were involved on a need-to basis as part-time employees. One of the engineering undergraduates who worked on Scoob-I, Mr Isaac Wong, 25, said: ""One of my main tasks was to iron out any remaining kinks in the software and ensure (the satellite) is flight ready. ""It feels unreal to be able to send something I worked on to space."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/ema-issues-second-call-for-proposals-to-import-low-carbon-electricity-to-singapore,EMA issues second call for proposals to import low-carbon electricity to Singapore,"SINGAPORE - The Energy Market Authority (EMA) has put out a second call for proposals to supply electricity to Singapore from renewable energy sources. It had issued the first request for proposal in November last year - to import about 1.2GW of electricity from 2027 onwards. Submission of the bids closed on April 14. In a statement on Friday (July 1), the authority said it is now open to a second round where participants may submit non-binding proposals as an expression of interest for preliminary discussions with EMA, before developing their proposals further for final submission. Those keen can submit before 3pm on Dec 29 next year. The two requests for proposal will account for the import of up to a total of 4GW of low-carbon electricity to Singapore by 2035, as part of efforts to decarbonise the energy sector. This is expected to make up around 30 per cent of Singapore's electricity demand then. EMA said that potential importers will have to demonstrate their supply reliability, credibility, track record, cost-competitiveness, and ability to supply and manage the carbon output of their power generation supply. Proposals for electricity supplied using coal-fired generation technologies will not be accepted, it said. The authority also said that it had received 20 proposals to supply electricity from sources such as solar, wind, hydro and geothermal power from four countries - Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia and Thailand - in the first round. As it had received requests from the first round participants for more time to develop their proposals, EMA will be combining both requests for proposal. Proposals which have been submitted under the first request will automatically be considered under the second one, without having to be submitted afresh, it said. These efforts come as EMA has also been working with various partners over the past few years on trials to import electricity, in preparation for large-scale imports. The trials allow EMA to assess and refine the technical and regulatory frameworks for importing electricity into Singapore, it said. The Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project, which involves the import of up to 100MW of electricity from Laos to Singapore via Thailand and Malaysia, began last week. It marked the first multilateral cross-border electricity trade involving four Asean countries and the first renewable energy import into Singapore."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/ntu-students-to-send-machine-learning-software-to-international-space-station,NTU students to send machine learning software to International Space Station,"SINGAPORE - Five Nanyang Technological University (NTU) students have achieved the next best thing to being on the International Space Station (ISS) - their machine learning software is going up to the home of astronauts for three months later this year. The students will be running the show from their laptops - testing the software, which was built to predict hardware disruptions on the ISS, satellites or other spacecraft. Such disruptions can cause these space vehicles to go off course or crash, in the worst outcomes. Called single event upsets, these hardware disruptions tend to afflict sensitive electrical components in space, such as memory devices on semiconductors. The disruptions happen when highly charged particles from the sun or nearby constellations strike such sensitive electronics. Energised solar particles tend to come from sunspots and large explosions from the sun's surface that release radiation. ""The space environment is very hostile towards electronic devices,"" said Mr Eng Chong Yock, 22, a first-year student at NTU's School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and one of the team members who built the software, called Cremer. The students see the predictive solution software as their contribution to protecting the trove of space experiment data that is electronically stored in the ISS. The space station is a giant orbiting lab for astronauts to regularly conduct research in areas such as human health and growing crops in space, as well as biomedical studies. Between 2000 and 2020, astronauts conducted nearly 3,000 experiments on the ISS. NTU team member Archit Gupta, 20, a second-year student from the School of Computer Science and Engineering, said: ""The purpose of the ISS is to collect experimental data, and if (single event upsets) happen, then the sanctity of the data gets compromised and the experiment is wasted."" Cremer was named after an existing software called Creme, which also addresses single event upsets. Mr Gupta said: ""We wanted to build a better version of it, and hence we named it Cremer."" The NTU team is getting to test its machine learning model in the ISS after it emerged as the champion at a competition earlier this month, which called upon tertiary students in South-east Asia and Taiwan to develop innovative ways to use artificial intelligence for space applications. The competition, called AI Space Challenge, was organised by four space tech companies - including the home-grown Zenith Intellutions, a firm that provides consultancy services for advanced satellite development and related technologies. The other members of the NTU team are third-year business student Sim See Min, 22, third-year mechanical engineering student Deon Lim, 24, and second-year electrical and electronic engineering student Rashna Ahmed, 21. Ms Sim, who is specialising in analytics, said the team members complemented one another well. She said: ""Archit was more familiar with coding and algorithms. Chong Yock, Rashna and Deon are more familiar with electrical engineering and physics. I helped to add value during the pitching part of the competition."" The ISS and other space vehicles are equipped with safeguards and other hardware to shield against or reverse hardware disruptions when they happen. But predictive tools like Cremer are not as common. Cremer could enhance the suite of solutions available to combat such disruptions, added Mr Gupta. Software solutions are also cheaper and scalable compared with hardware solutions that need to be tested in space for years before they can be commercialised. Mr Tan Cheng Hai, a consultant at Zenith Intellutions, said that prediction tools are more important for unmanned space vehicles, as the advance warning will help engineers on the ground activate safeguards. During the competition, which started in October last year, the NTU team showcased Cremer's potential to identify and predict incoming single event upsets using data from a satellite launched by the University of Stuttgart in Germany. Mr Gupta said the machine learning model is flexible, and can be trained and fed with ISS data to predict any hardware disruptions on the space station. Cremer will be sent up to the ISS for three months, and the mission is planned to be completed by the end of this year. The software will be installed in a tiny supercomputer on the space station, which comes in the form of a 10cm by 10cm white cube. Called AI Box, it is one of the world's smallest supercomputers and is produced by a Belgian company. Before Cremer is sent up to the ISS via radio communications, the software will be plugged into a ""rehearsal"" AI Box in Belgium, to ensure it passes safety and security checks before it reaches space. The team will also use that time to fine-tune and optimise the software."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/rare-costa-rican-orchids-on-display-at-gardens-by-the-bays-cloud-forest,Rare Costa Rican orchids on display at Gardens by the Bay's Cloud Forest,"SINGAPORE - More than 30 species of orchids from Costa Rica - including three that have almost vanished in the wild - were donated to Gardens by the Bay on Tuesday (June 28). The orchids will be put on display at the horticultural attraction's cooled conservatory, the Cloud Forest, for two weeks until July 11, as part of the Orchids of Costa Rica - Resilient Beauty floral display. The blooms were from the Lankester Botanical Gardens in Costa Rica, and were donated to Singapore's Gardens by the Bay through a collaboration that aims to deepen research and conservation efforts of Costa Rican orchids. Dr Adam P. Karremans, director of Lankester Botanical Gardens, said, ""Orchids are very delicate, and they can disappear quickly in the face of external threats like climate change. ""But they are also resilient, and orchid populations can be recovered if we take proper measures like setting up protected areas and sustaining the ecosystem they thrive in."" Madam Andrea Kee, deputy director of Gardens by the Bay, said the Cloud Forest in the Gardens is able to replicate the cool, moist climate of Costa Rica's montane forests found in the mountains. The Costa Rican orchid display also commemorates 35 years of diplomatic relations between Singapore and the Central American nation. Speaking at an event on Tuesday to mark the donation of the orchids, Costa Rica Ambassador to Singapore Victor Hugo Rojas Gonzalez said: ""Both Singapore and Costa Rica share the orchid as the national flower, perhaps because we find beauty and resilience in it."" Guarianthe skinneri, also known as guaria morada, is the national flower of Costa Rica and is said to represent hope and good fortune. The display also features endangered species such as the Specklinia pfavii, which exists in low numbers in the wild. ""Gardens by the Bay hopes that this display will help to raise awareness of the importance of conserving the myriad biodiversity present in cloud forests. ""This is especially important when cloud forests worldwide are threatened by climate change,"" said Mr Felix Loh, chief executive of Gardens by the Bay. As the Gardens approaches its 10th anniversary, Mr Loh said its goal to bring the world of plants to Singapore has not changed. ""We share a common purpose with Lankester Botanical Gardens in educating the public on the beauty and diversity found in cloud forests of the world, and, in turn, why conservation efforts are so crucial,"" he added. After the floral display ends on July 11, the orchids will be taken back to the nursery for nurturing, said a spokesman for Gardens by the Bay."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/singapore-to-host-international-xprize-rainforest-competition-in-2023,Singapore to host international XPrize Rainforest competition in 2023,"SINGAPORE - Singapore's forests may be small and fragmented, but next year, they will play an outsized role in helping humanity glean insights into how the remaining rainforests of the world can be conserved. The Republic has been chosen to host the semi-finals of an international competition that aims to identify technologies - such as drones and artificial intelligence - that can be used to monitor rainforests and their rich treasure troves of biodiversity in real time. The ability to monitor rainforests remotely will help humanity develop a better understanding of these iconic habitats, which are often difficult to study because rainforests are dense, vast and complex. The venue for the semi-finals was announced by competition organiser XPrize, a non-profit organisation that designs public competitions to benefit humanity, during the World Biodiversity Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday evening (June 28) Singapore time. XPrize Rainforest is a five-year competition that was launched in 2019 with a US$10 million prize (S$13.9 million) sponsored by Alana Foundation, an independent philanthropic organisation founded in the United States. Other XPrize initiatives include the US$100 million carbon removal competition funded by electric carmaker Tesla's chief executive Elon Musk and the Musk Foundation, as well as a US$15 million pot that will go to the development of alternative proteins. The winning team will develop novel technologies ""to rapidly and comprehensively survey rainforest biodiversity and use that data to improve the understanding of this complex ecosystem"", said XPrize on its website. Founder and president of Alana Foundation Ana Lucia Villela said during Tuesday's event: ""This prize will generate critical data and insight for preserving our rainforests, its culture and people, which are essential for stabilising our earth's climate."" About 15 teams are expected to take part in the semi-finals, including the Act Now Amazonas Action Alliance, which leverages an audio technology and artificial intelligence developed by start-up Rainforest Connection to ""eavesdrop"" on the forest. XPrize said Singapore was selected because of its conservation efforts and its efforts at harnessing science to address biodiversity in an urban landscape. For example, researchers at the National Parks Board (NParks) had used a suite of bird tracking technology to find that Singapore is located at the intersection of two major flyways, the superhighways in the air that migratory birds take every year to escape the winter chill in the Northern Hemisphere. Previously, Singapore was thought to be a stopover for birds only along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, the world’s largest migratory route, spanning the Arctic Circle down south to Australia and New Zealand.  But the study published in December 2020 showed that some birds which spend their winters in Singapore had journeyed here using the Central Asian Flyway across the Himalayas. More recently, NParks had embarked on an effort called ecological profiling exercise to show how the various vegetated plots in Singapore connect with one another. This connectivity is crucial in ensuring that wild animals do not become isolated in their own forest plots, but can make their way around the nation’s fragmented forest landscape to find food and mates in other green areas. Such a connectivity map can help guide development work so that this can be done more sensitively. “The proximity of Singapore’s rainforests to the resources of the city will be a critical asset for teams at this still early stage of testing,” XPrize added. “It’s vastly different from the typical field sites where autonomous technologies, like the ones being developed, will be most useful. But the teams that succeed at semifinals testing will move on to test their tech in a remote location, without those helpful and accessible resources, in 2024.” There are three rainforest basins in the world - the Amazon, which is the largest at 6.7 million sq km, more than twice the size of India; the Congo basin and South-east Asia. Such habitats are crucial for humanity on a number of fronts. They play an important role in the climate system, because trees on the equator can take in planet-warming carbon dioxide through photosynthesis all year round. Rainforests are also home to many human communities, as well as many different species of rare wildlife. The panel of nine judges for XPrize Rainforest include Singaporean conservation scientist Koh Lian Pin, who heads the National University of Singapore's Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions. Among other judges are Dr Stuart Davies, director of the Forest Global Earth Observatory at the Smithsonian Institution, as well as primatologist Luisa Arnedo from the National Geographic Society. For the final round of the competition in 2024, the winning team will have to survey the most biodiversity in a 100 ha tropical rainforest plot in 24 hours and use that data to produce the greatest number of new insights after 48 hours that will reveal the true potential of the standing forest. Minister for National Development Desmond Lee said in a video address during the event that Singapore is honoured to host the semi-finals. ""As both a city and a country, we have always faced unique challenges in land planning,"" he added. ""The autonomous technologies that the XPrize teams are developing for rapid biodiversity assessments will be very helpful to enhancing our collective understanding of rainforest ecosystems, both in Singapore and around the world."""

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/singapore-conservation-group-aims-to-protect-endangered-malayan-tigers,Singapore conservation group aims to protect endangered Malayan tigers,"SINGAPORE - The Malayan tiger that once roamed Singapore's forests is no more, but a local conservation group is hoping to empower local communities in Malaysia - the only place in the world where the creature can still be found - to save the majestic beast. The Singapore Wildcat Action Group (Swag) will be organising a series of events, including a movie screening, next month to raise funds to protect the Malayan tiger (Panthera tigris jacksoni) - the one out of six tiger species most in danger of going extinct. The funds raised will go towards supporting forest patrols conducted by indigenous people, said Swag co-director Vilma D'Rozario. ""We believe our small effort helps to support the livelihood of Bateq community rangers for six months,"" said Dr D'Rozario, referring to the local Bateq tribe that lives in the forests of Pahang, Malaysia, where Malayan tigers can still be found. Swag partners the Malaysian Conservation Alliance for Tigers (Mycat), a Malaysian non-government organisation, to rope in representatives from the indigenous community to conduct patrols of forest reserves. The goal is to keep poachers away and restore degraded tiger habitats by planting trees. Acknowledging the efforts of local communities in wildlife conservation, and putting them at the centre of decision-making and funding, is expected to be a key topic of discussion at the COP15 biodiversity summit in Canada at the end of the year. The conference aims to establish a global framework to protect biodiversity and will include discussions over biodiversity targets and finance. The Malayan tiger was once widespread throughout the southern and central parts of the Malay Peninsula, including Singapore, and the southern parts of Thailand. But fewer than 150 tigers remain, with poaching and habitat loss the major drivers of the species' decline. Many tigers are often poached so their parts can be sold in the illegal wildlife trade. Dr D'Rozario said the Malayan tiger is also thought to be extinct in Thailand. ""Once gone from Malaysia, the species is lost forever,"" she said. Mr Suzalinur Manja Bidin, Mycat assistant director, told The Straits Times that the support and involvement of the local indigenous community in conservation efforts is critical to the long-term survival of the Malayan tiger. The community rangers are able to cover more ground and conduct more patrols throughout the week compared with volunteers who may be able to do so only in the weekends, he said. ""The intelligence they gather on the job and while conducting their daily activities provides useful insight into what's going on in this tiger landscape,"" Mr Suzalinur said, adding that Mycat was able to expand its areas of protection in the Sungai Yu Forest Reserve in Pahang, Malaysia, as a result of the information gathered. ""With their knowledge of the local forest and forest confidence and proficiency, the local indigenous community is able to take note of signs of poaching, illegal activity and wildlife that the lesser-trained eye may miss,"" said Mr Suzalinur. The rangers also help out with wildlife monitoring, including documenting signs of the tiger and its prey, the sambar deer. ""The presence of sambar is critical to tiger survival, but in the absence of camera trap evidence, their signs are difficult to discern from other ungulates (hoofed mammals) without considerable experience and a sharp eye,"" said Mr Suzalinur. ""Bateq are able to read the forest, the way you and I might read road signs.""

The Republic came one step closer to achieving its target of importing 30 per cent of its electricity from low-carbon sources by 2035 last Thursday (June 23), when the first cross-border flow of ""green"" electrons into the country began."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/food-production-costs-could-go-up-by-80-in-move-towards-sustainability-study,Asean needs to prepare for greater weather extremes and food price spikes: Study,"SINGAPORE - Hotter and wetter weather is already having an impact on crops in South-east Asia, and climate change is set to bring even greater extremes that will disrupt food supply chains and food prices in the region, global forecasting firm Oxford Economics said. Presenting its findings of a recent analysis of climate impacts on the region, the advisory company said in a webinar last Thursday (June 23) that governments in the region need to implement more ambitious policies. These guidelines must not only cut greenhouse emissions but also minimise greater food price volatility, especially for the poor.  The transition to greener economies and the race to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century also present cost challenges but these can be tackled with the right policies, Oxford Economics said.  The findings come amid spikes in food prices globally because of supply disruptions caused by the war in Ukraine, which has upended the grain market and caused prices of energy and fertiliser to soar. The poorest nations have been hit the hardest.  The Oxford Economics study was commissioned by Food Industry Asia. 
The advisory firm looked at how the weather has changed in five Asean countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.  “South-east Asia is getting wetter and warmer, particularly in the last decade compared to the previous two.  “And the frequency of extreme weather events is becoming greater,” Mr Tom Rogers, Oxford Economics’ head of macroeconomic consulting for Asia, said in the webinar on the report which was released in March.  Temperatures are spiking more frequently, along with more heavy rain events and periods of drought.  Thailand and the Philippines, in particular, have recorded more wetter months compared with the long-term average. More volatile weather makes it more difficult for farmers and other parts of the food supply chain to function. “And these extreme events are going to become more frequent in the next decades, regardless of the level of climate ambition that governments around the world show,” Mr Rogers said. Climate scientists say the world will continue to warm for some time even if humanity stopped producing greenhouse gas emissions. The study found that heatwaves in Thailand in December 2014 and in Vietnam in February 2019 contributed to food prices going up between 5 and 6 per cent during those months. Agricultural yields, though, would not be immediately affected by more extreme weather, Mr Rogers said. This is because more carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air leads to more efficient photosynthesis, meaning crops grow a little faster.  But that benefit is outweighed in the longer term as temperatures continue to rise. By the second half of this century, yields will decline.  To reduce the impact of price shocks, governments need to take steps, including protecting vulnerable consumers, the report added.  Greater spending on social assistance, targeted at the poorest consumers, would help shelter them from food price volatility. Countries in the region also need to use agricultural spending more efficiently, said the report.  For example, costly price-support schemes for farmers and subsidised farm inputs, such as fertiliser, distort farmers’ behaviour and lead to inefficiency.  Focusing spending on measures to improve climate resilience would reduce vulnerability to extreme weather, said the report. Greater uptake of farm insurance is another key policy step because insurance payouts after bad weather mean farmers can restart production faster.  Limiting warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels, a key goal of the Paris climate agreement, can reduce the impacts of bad weather.  But the report said the green transition could also trigger price rises, especially from higher energy costs.  Oxford Economics estimated that the cost of producing food could go up by as much as 80 per cent in countries such as Indonesia by 2050, as governments implement measures aimed at achieving net-zero emissions. However, governments should protect consumers from the added costs of moving towards sustainable methods, said the report. Oxford Economics recommends that governments support farmers in adopting measures such as solar panels and the conversion of food waste to energy, which would make them less reliant on electricity from the grid. Boosting direct foreign investment by removing barriers to investors in the agriculture sector would open up new technologies and productivity gains.  Further opening up to trade and lowering agricultural tariffs could also drive higher productivity.  “We think there’s a lot that governments can do about it, we think there are plenty of policy options,” Mr Rogers said. “There’s a need to start the discussion about how best to go about both mitigating short-term impacts of food price volatility, and also tackling that cost of transition.” Singapore's core inflation hit 3.6 per cent in May on the back of rising food prices - the highest core inflation rate the Republic has faced since December 2008, when it hit 4.2 per cent."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/years-of-trial-and-error-bear-fruit-as-native-bird-species-raises-young-on-pulau-ubin,Years of trial and error bear fruit as native bird species raises young on Pulau Ubin,"SINGAPORE - After years of trial and error, efforts to get the blue-throated bee eater - a bird species under the National Parks Board’s Species Recovery Programme - to nest here have finally borne fruit. On Saturday (June 25), NParks said that 21 occurrences of successful nesting have been recorded, with the current breeding season still ongoing. Group director of conservation at NParks Lim Liang Jim told The Straits Times that while the birds are native to Singapore, they rarely nest as sand banks and high river cliff banks, where the birds typically like to nest, are hardly present here. Since 2016, a site in Ketam Quarry - a disused granite quarry - has been converted into a bird nesting area that caters to the different nesting requirements of three targeted bird species, including the blue-throated bee eater. The birds dig holes in sand banks, which they use as nests. ""We looked at what conditions were needed when they were breeding overseas - sand banks and cliff banks - so we decided to pile up a mound of sand,"" he said. ""From then on we went through several years figuring out what was the optimal way to arrange the sand to that the birds are happy to use it."" Mr Lim said several ways were experimented with, such as adjusting the gradient of the mound. ""We even put in plastic tunnels for them, to encourage them to explore, but they didn't seem to like it,"" he said. After several rounds of trials, those working on the breeding site found last year that a mound of sand about 3m to 5m tall was stable enough for the birds to feel comfortable digging nests in it and laying their eggs. The angle of the mound's slope also mattered, said Mr Lim, who added that at a gentler slope, the birds could feel threatened that predators would climb the mound and steal their eggs. After pairs of birds had nested, equipment was brought in to monitor the success. ""When we felt certain that there were chicks inside the nests, we waited for the parents to fly away and we went in with an endoscope to see how many eggs were laid, how many hatchlings there were,"" he said. ""We have a lot of very cool footage of them bringing back food for the babies, having the babies come out for the first time and endoscope videos of the babies moving inside the nest."" NParks also said its species recovery efforts have benefited two other bird species - the baya weaver and the red-wattled lapwing."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/vaccination-centres-busier-this-week-as-more-aged-50-and-above-go-for-booster-shots,Vaccination centres busier this week as more aged 50 and above go for booster shots,"SINGAPORE - More people aged 50 and above have gone for their first as well as their second Covid-19 booster shots, as vaccination centres saw higher footfall this week than in previous weeks. Parkway Shenton, which runs a vaccination centre in Hong Kah, said about 30 per cent more people turned up at the centre this week compared with the week before. On Saturday (June 25), when operations ended at 1pm, more than 120 people had taken their booster shots at Commonwealth joint testing and vaccination centre (JTVC), a higher than usual number compared with recent weeks. The centre also said footfall for this week is double that of last week, although it declined to provide exact figures. The higher numbers come as people aged 50 to 59 were from June 10 added to the older age groups that are being offered a second booster. There are also 80,000 people aged 60 and older who have yet to take their first booster jabs, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung had said on Monday. It was a busy first weekend for the new Bukit Merah JTVC, with seven to 10 people already waiting in line outside the centre in Lower Delta Road at 8.45am on Saturday, before the centre opened its doors at 9am. By 10.30am, the centre had seen between 30 and 50 people. JTVCs are open till 1pm on Saturdays and 7pm on weekdays. The Bukit Merah centre was one of five new JTVCs that started operations on Thursday, bringing the total number of such facilities to 10. Kidney transplant patient Katherine Goh, 53, was among those who took their booster shots at Commonwealth JTVC on Saturday. She was taking her fourth shot, but it is considered the first booster as those with weak immune systems require three shots for their primary vaccination course. She said three weeks after getting her third jab in January this year, she caught the virus amid the Omicron wave. She tested positive for about three weeks, and also spent a night in hospital when she had chest tightness and breathing difficulties at one point. Ms Goh, who is unemployed and lives with her husband in Bukit Timah, had two kidney transplants - one in 2001 and another in 2018. ""For me, vaccination is not encouraged, but a necessity."" Also at Commonwealth JTVC were Ms Ng Ai Choo, 59, and her 80-year-old mother, who were there to take their second booster shots. Ms Ng wanted her mother, Madam Ng Leh Tien, further protected, because she goes for daily physiotherapy at Apex Rehab Centre in Bukit Merah View, and mingles with other seniors. For seniors aged 80 and older, protection against severe disease from the virus with three doses is lower, and a second booster is needed to protect them further, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has said. Ms Ng, a housewife, said she was spurred to get her fourth shot as she is wary that another Covid-19 wave may be on the horizon. Mr Ong had previously warned that Singapore is likely to see another Covid-19 wave in July or August this year. This will be driven by the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron sub-variants, which are more transmissible, but have not been linked to higher hospitalisation and deaths. On Tuesday, MOH said these variants accounted for around 30 per cent of all virus cases in the past week. As at June 22, 78 per cent of the total population have taken their booster shots. Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore, said: ""It is my opinion that eventually, almost everyone in Singapore will be infected with Covid-19 at some point in their lives, and when that happens, we want to ensure the risk of severe disease and death is as low as possible."" Mr Karl Kleemeier, 58, was among those who took their second booster shots at Bukit Merah JTVC on Saturday. The head of market data provider Argus Media's Singapore office has been diligent in getting his jabs when the opportunities came, because he knows how potent the virus can be, having been infected while in Saudi Arabia in May 2020. ""I was in hospital for two weeks. I had pneumonia, fever, night sweats, and I was on oxygen,"" he recalled."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/pulau-ubins-main-village-may-have-up-to-90-of-electricity-from-solar-by-2023,Pulau Ubin's main village may have up to 90% of electricity from solar energy by 2023,"SINGAPORE - By 2023, Pulau Ubin's main village could have up to 90 per cent of its energy needs powered by the sun, thanks to an upgraded power grid. The upgraded grid was among the enhancements to Pulau Ubin that Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong announced on Saturday morning (June 25) at the annual Ubin Day event. Mr Tong also said that personal alert buttons have been installed in the homes of elderly villagers by the National Parks Board (NParks) and GovTech, under a trial. This allows seniors to quickly call for assistance in emergency situations. He said fire hydrants and hose reels will also be installed in the island's main village, as well as at Kampong Sungei Durian and Ubin Living Lab (a facility for field studies and environmental education) to strengthen the island's fire management response. Previously, all households were given fire extinguishers as part of a larger initiative to improve facilities on the island. Mr Tong was joined at the event by National Development Minister Desmond Lee and NParks chief executive Kenneth Er. NParks is the central managing agency of Pulau Ubin. The Pulau Ubin Micro-grid was launched by the Energy Market Authority (EMA) in 2013 to provide more than 30 of the island's residents and businesses with a more reliable, cleaner and affordable electricity supply than diesel-powered generators. EMA's Industry Development Department director Jeanette Lim told The Straits Times that when the grid was launched, about 15 per cent of the daily electricity demand was supplied through solar energy, while the remainder was supplied by diesel-powered generators connected to the grid. Besides making the grid's energy supply cleaner, EMA said on Saturday that NParks will be extending the grid's coverage beyond the island's main village to Kampong Sungei Durian, where 13 households will benefit. ""This will help address the villagers' request for a cleaner and more reliable electricity supply and raise their quality of life,"" said the authorities. The grid is operated by EDPR Sunseap APAC. Ms Lim said those who consume energy from the grid pay a fixed rate of $0.80/kWh, which is lower than the cost of operating their own diesel generators, which was about $1.20/kWh. To optimise the grid's solar photovoltaic (PV) system's output, its operators will add plants next to solar panels to create a ""solar green roof"". This reduces the ambient temperature of solar PV systems by 3 deg C to 8 deg C, increasing its efficiency by 1.5 per cent to 4 per cent. An energy storage system will also be deployed to help improve the reliability of the grid. A provision shop owner in the island’s main village, Madam Ng Ngak Heng, said on Saturday that she started using the grid in 2014, she has not needed to use her own diesel-powered generator, which has reduced noise and smoke pollution. While the 72-year-old, who has lived on Pulau Ubin for the past 47 years, said purchasing electricity from the grid has been more expensive than using generators in her experience, she appreciates the convenience of no longer needing to fill up and operate the generator, which can be a laborious process. Meanwhile, Ms Ong Ah Sam, 84, who lives in one of five houses where the personal alert buttons have been installed, said being able to call for help easily gives her peace of mind. “It’s easy to use and more fuss-free than picking up a phone and then looking for a number,” she said of the buttons, which are installed at about waist-height and will allow her to call for help with a push of the button. On Saturday, Mr Tong also gave updates about species recovery and habitat enhancement efforts NParks has undertaken over past years. For instance, since the development of nesting sites for the blue-throated bee-eater, a species under NParks Species Recovery Programme, NParks has recorded 21 nesting occurrences. Monitoring of the current breeding season is still ongoing. Meanwhile, the enhancement of Pekan Quarry with floating wetlands has successfully increased the area of usable wildlife habitat for birds, leading to more sightings of herons, kingfishers and waterhens in the area. A first breeding of the lesser whistling duck at Pekan Quarry was also recorded this year. ""It was only last year that we first spotted a pair of them using the floating wetlands and floating logs to roost,"" said Mr Tong. ""Now the two ducks have grown their own family."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/new-initiative-aims-to-help-green-singapore-and-raise-funds-for-social-causes,New initiative aims to help green Singapore and raise funds for social causes,"SINGAPORE - A new project that aims to help green up Singapore's urban areas and raise funds for social causes was officially launched on Friday (June 24) by community-based initiative Target15.sg. The Hold-a-Hand Project is facilitated by Target15.sg, a community-based initiative launched by events management company Circus Maximus International. The project involves the initiative partnering with organisations such as schools to grow 150,000 trees over the next five years on their premises from seeds or seedlings sourced from partner nurseries in Malaysia and Indonesia. Once the trees reach a suitable size, they will be transplanted to other areas in Singapore, including nursing homes, religious institutions and properties like condominiums and shopping centres. Mr Edward Kent, 55, founder of Target15.sg and managing director of Circus Maximus International, said the initiative aims to complement Singapore's target of planting one million more trees islandwide by 2030, and also supports Singapore's 2030 Green Plan. Target15.sg has collaborated with St Patrick's School to germinate and nurture 1,300 tree saplings from 16 species within the school compound under the Hold-A-Hand Project. Students are responsible for caring for the young trees. When the saplings mature - which takes six months - Target15.sg will collect and donate them to nursing homes and religious institutions, helping to create a greener, healthier environment in those areas. For every viable sapling harvested, Target15.sg will also donate $30 to the school, with the money to be used at the school's discretion. It will also pledge a $2 contribution for each tree harvested to charities, including SDI Academy which is an education centre for IT and financial literacy for migrants and refugees; and migrant workers charity ItsRainingRaincoats. A variable sum was also pledged to the selected charity for Friday's event, the Singapore Muslim Women's Association. Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong, who was guest of honour at the project's launch, held at St Patrick's School, said: ""(Being) green should be part and parcel of our everyday, part of our lived experiences, part of how we conduct ourselves.” He added that a mindset change is needed to make being green sustainable.  Mr Adrian Lim, head of character and citizenship education at St Patrick's School, said: ""Part of being a gentleman is not just taking care of families and themselves, but also taking care of the environment and being stewards of the environment."" Among the 1,300 tree saplings being cared for by St Patrick's School, are 500 moringa trees - whose leaves and fruits are often used by migrant workers from Bangladesh and India in their food and drinks. The Rotary Club pledged $250 per tree to St Patrick's School to underwrite the cost of the trees. Upon harvest, these trees will be donated to the migrant worker community. The first 100 moringa trees nurtured by St Patrick's have been harvested and were donated at the event, to be planted in migrant worker dormitories across the island. Mr Kelvin Wee, 60, commercial director of Target15.sg, said that planting trees within the school and collaboration within the district helps students and the various communities get involved in protecting nature. Correction note: In an earlier version of this story, Mr Kelvin Wee's full name and designation were incorrect. It has been corrected. We are sorry for the error. "
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/singapore-begins-importing-renewable-energy-from-laos-via-thailand-malaysia,"S'pore begins importing renewable energy from Laos via Thailand, Malaysia","SINGAPORE - The Republic on Thursday (June 23) began importing renewable energy from Laos via Thailand and Malaysia - a move that marks the first multilateral cross-border electricity trade involving four Asean countries and the first renewable energy import into Singapore. Up to 100 megawatts (MW) of hydropower from Laos will be brought into Singapore using existing interconnectors under the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project - an intergovernmental project set up in 2014 to study the feasibility of cross-border power trade. The 100MW account for about 1.5 per cent of Singapore's peak electricity demand in 2020 and could power around 144,000 four-room Housing Board flats for a year. The cross-border electricity flow follows an agreement inked in September last year between Keppel Electric - a wholly owned subsidiary of Keppel Infrastructure Holdings - and Electricite du Laos - the state-owned power supplier of Laos - to import renewable energy into Singapore. The two organisations have also signed an initial two-year power purchase agreement. The import will serve to test the technical and regulatory frameworks for importing electricity into Singapore, facilitating larger-scale imports from the region in the future. The power integration project is a step forward in the development of a broader Asean power grid, said the Energy Market Authority (EMA), the Ministry of Energy and Mines of Laos, Electricite du Laos and Keppel in a joint statement. ""The Asean power grid is a key regional initiative to enhance interconnectivity, energy security and sustainability through existing electricity interconnections,"" the joint statement added. ""This provides opportunities to tap on low-carbon and renewable energy sources in the region and contributes towards economic development and improving energy security and stability."" Dr Daovong Phonekeo, Minister of Energy and Mines of Laos, said his country aims to be a major supporter of renewable energy in the region. ""The country has more than 8,000MW of installed hydropower capacity, which is set to grow in the near future to support its domestic demand and future exports... This project proves that we are on the right track as we promote the development of clean energy resources, including solar and wind power,"" he said. The Republic had in October 2021 announced plans to import around 30 per cent of its electricity from low-carbon sources, such as renewable energy plants, by 2035, to reduce the carbon footprint of its power sector. At present, more than 95 per cent of Singapore's electricity is generated by burning natural gas, a fossil fuel. Burning fossil fuels produces planet-warming carbon dioxide, which contributes to climate change. The power sector is responsible for about 40 per cent of Singapore's total emissions; however, a recent report commissioned by EMA found it would be feasible for the sector to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. But land constraints in Singapore hinder the construction of large solar farms, and the country also cannot access alternative forms of renewable energy, such as wind energy or hydropower. Still, Singapore's power sector can reach its net-zero target by 2050 by importing - among other things - clean energy generated elsewhere, the report by the Energy 2050 Committee has found. Other potential solutions include developing infrastructure suitable for clean-burning hydrogen to be used as a fuel, as well as investing in emerging low-carbon technologies that will enable carbon dioxide to be captured from smokestacks before it is released into the atmosphere. Keppel Electric is the first entity to be issued an electricity importer licence by EMA. But the authority has also announced plans to import electricity from other sources. Last October, the EMA announced that YTL PowerSeraya - a generation company and electricity retailer in Singapore - would be embarking on a two-year trial project to import 100MW of electricity from Malaysia. This pilot is expected to start this year. EMA is also working with power generation company PacificLight Power on a pilot to import 100MW from a solar farm in Pulau Bulan, Indonesia. Electricity will be supplied via a new interconnector that directly connects a solar farm in Pulau Bulan to PacificLight's power station in Singapore. The pilot is expected to be commissioned by around 2024. EMA chief executive Ngiam Shih Chun said: ""The commencement of electricity imports from Laos marks a significant milestone in our regional energy cooperation... Interconnected power grids can accelerate the deployment of renewable energy, promote supply diversification, and strengthen grid stability for the region as a whole."" Dr Victor Nian, CEO of independent think-tank Centre for Strategic Energy and Resources, said that the import of 100MW of renewable energy from Laos is unlikely to have an impact on electricity prices here since the imported electricity makes up only a small fraction of the country's energy mix. But even if more renewable energy is imported into Singapore in the future, the impact on electricity prices will depend on a number of factors, including the price at which Singapore is buying the imported electricity and the quantity imported. EMA declined to reveal the cost of the imported renewable energy. Dr Nian said the energy import pilots will have to look into a number of issues to determine the feasibility of scaling up cross-border electricity flow. A key one, he noted, is how imported electricity will affect the reliability of Singapore's power grid. ""Right now, because only a small quantity of electricity is imported, any disruptions in the supply would not have an impact on electricity supply in Singapore,"" he said. ""But in the future, if more electricity is imported, Singapore will have to study how to safeguard electricity reliability in case of any supply disruptions."" Such disruptions could be caused by the intermittent nature of certain sources of renewable energy - less solar power can be harnessed on a cloudy day, for instance - and due to geopolitical situations, for example, if countries ban the export of renewable energy. Other issues to consider would be whether cross-border infrastructure could handle the transnational flow of electricity and how electricity imports would affect generation companies in Singapore. ""Would renewable energy imports replace some generation capacity in Singapore? If some generation plants were to be kept as standby in case of regional disruptions, then the impact on the business models of the generation companies would have to be studied too,"" said Dr Nian."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/spore-firm-tria-partners-kfc-to-recycle-food-and-packaging-waste-into-fertilisers,S'pore firm Tria partners KFC to recycle food and packaging waste into fertilisers,"SINGAPORE - Singapore-based sustainable packaging firm Tria is partnering with KFC on a pilot project that aims to recycle food and packaging waste from one of the fast-food chain's local outlets into fertilisers for agriculture use, the company's chief executive Ng Pei Kang said on Tuesday (June 21). The pilot started earlier this month at KFC's outlet at Northpoint City in Yishun. Mr Ng told The Straits Times on the sidelines of the official launch event in Tuas that the six-month pilot would also involve close collaboration with Norwegian fertiliser giant Yara International to help it assess the commercial viability of scaling the pilot to make a product that is compliant with international global standards. ""With Yara, we will look at how we can further improve and enhance the product such that this becomes commercial grade fertiliser, making this a full loop right from cradle to the farm,"" said Mr Ng, adding that the urgency to find sustainable alternative sources of fertilisers was now more pronounced following the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Western sanctions on Russia, a major exporter of fertilisers, have disrupted shipments of these natural resources globally, forcing farmers worldwide to scale back usage and reduce the amount of land they use for growing essential crops such as wheat, corn and rice. ""The Tria-KFC organic recycling pilot is an important example of projects which can help smallholder (farmers who work on plots that average 1.2ha) and commercial farmers and governments achieve food security, while ensuring sustainability in Singapore and other nations around the world,"" said Ms Marisa Soares, vice-president - Farming Solutions, Africa and Asia at Yara International. She added that scaling such projects would require more partners within the food chain getting more aggressive in adopting sustainable solutions, similar to KFC Singapore. ""This will require investment from all concerned, but we aim to prove that closing the loop in this ecosystem can be financially sustainable, while having a positive impact on our natural resources,"" she said. ""Should we be successful in this project, we will leverage our regional and global presence to create a marketplace for this solution, leveraging our connectivity and presence on the farm to support farmers and to help them adopt and use new solutions that would have a positive impact - not only on the soil, but also on crops and on helping to reduce carbon emissions."" Mr Ng said Tria will work alongside Singapore-listed recycling and environmental services company Shanaya to collect the waste bags from the KFC outlet, which will then be transported to the waste processing facility currently located at the premises of Shanaya's waste management plant in Tuas. By recycling food waste that would otherwise have to be incinerated, the collaboration with KFC helps to drive greater sustainability in the food services industry and support the Singapore Green Plan 2030, Mr Ng said. ""Such ownership is imperative in driving circular food systems because we know that circularity cannot be done in isolation,"" said Mr Ng, while encouraging potential partners interested in shaping the future of circular food systems to come forward and team up with it. KFC Singapore's general manager Lynette Lee said it will review the results and assess the viability of scaling the programme across all its restaurants in Singapore at the end of the pilot. ""Through this partnership, KFC Singapore aims to continue our efforts for the environment and take the lead to bring together zero waste close-loop recycling concept in the food and beverage industry,"" said Ms Lee. KFC Singapore's environmental sustainability efforts go back to 2016 when all its restaurants here switched from paper boxes to reusable baskets for dine-in orders, and in 2018, it was the first to stop the use of plastic straws. Under the current initiative, Tria will also be supplying KFC's outlet in Yishun with the single-use plant-based food packaging items. Minister of State for Trade and Industry Low Yen Ling, the guest of honour at the event, emphasised the importance of innovation in Singapore accomplishing its zero waste goals. ""Clever circular economy solutions like what we see today have the potential to break the cycle of escalating waste. Innovation is critical for sustainable development, especially with rising global demand for food supplies and fast-depleting resources,"" she said. The collaboration was facilitated by Enterprise Singapore under the Enterprise Sustainability Programme launched in 2021 that supports Singapore companies to build capabilities and capture new opportunities in the green economy."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/population-of-critically-endangered-monkey-increased-but-more-needs-to-be-done,"Increase in population of critically endangered monkey in S'pore, but more needs to be done","SINGAPORE - The Raffles' banded langur - a shy, critically endangered monkey native to Singapore - appears to be faring well in the Republic, with numbers of the black-and-white leaf eater growing from about 40 to 70 over the last 10 years. But primatologist Andie Ang, who studies these creatures, said not all the monkey babies may survive and grow into adults. ""The concern that we have now is that due to its small population, the genetic pool of the langur is quite poor,"" said Dr Ang on Tuesday morning (June 21), during a visit to the Thomson Nature Park to promote a new podcast series called Expedition: Earth by National Geographic. Dr Ang, who is a research scientist at Mandai Nature and a National Geographic Explorer, added: “Similar to humans, the infants born in an inbred population may have physical deformities and some of them might not survive to adulthood.” Genetic data from the langurs - which scientists like Dr Ang glean by collecting and analysing stool samples left by the creatures - showed that the shy and elusive langurs are highly related to one another, said Dr Ang, who is also the president of conservation group Jane Goodall Institute in Singapore. The 12-episode podcast series was launched on April 22. Hosted by various National Geographic Explorers from across the world, the series aims to help listeners appreciate and learn ways to protect nature and wildlife. The Raffles' banded langur can be found only in Singapore and the southern parts of Peninsular Malaysia, such as in Johor and Pahang. In a bid to improve the gene pool of the local primates, Dr Ang and her team at Mandai Nature are consulting with scientists and naturalists from Malaysia, such as those from the Malaysian Nature Society and the Universiti Sains Malaysia, on the possibility of introducing monkeys from Malaysia to Singapore. This way, said Dr Ang, langurs from the neighbouring country would be able to mix and breed with the species here, increasing the genetic diversity of the next generation. But before such translocation programmes can happen, more research is needed, said Dr Ang. Such studies will look into, among other things, whether the habitats in Singapore are able to accommodate the monkeys from across the Causeway. ""We can't just throw them into the nature park and expect them to adapt to this different environment. It is a long-term thing that we need to work on but we have to start now."" Dr Ang also highlighted the importance of outreach and education efforts in Singapore to promote co-existence between humans and wildlife. As Singapore becomes greener, and with development projects happening in or near nature areas in the country, members of the public are likely to encounter wildlife such as otters, long-tailed macaques, crocodiles and wild boars more regularly. Not all of these encounters may be pleasant. In March, for example, a woman was knocked unconscious by a wild boar. The next month, a 52-year-old man was bitten by an otter in Kallang. Such incidents can leave people with a negative impression of wildlife and prevent them from learning more about and appreciating wildlife, said Dr Ang in the second episode of the Expedition: Earth by National Geographic podcast series. Dr Ang said people can avoid such negative encounters by not feeding wild animals, and by keeping a distance of at least 2m when observing animals so that they would not feel threatened. The public is also reminded to not pluck fruits like durians when visiting nature parks as they are a source of food for the long-tailed macaques and Raffles' banded langurs. ""Nature is not just the beautiful things like hornbills, it also consists of other animals that might not be typically cute but are also part of our ecosystem. Rather than chasing them away or removing them from the habitat, we could just do little things to prevent negative interactions,"" said Dr Ang."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/colourful-mandarin-fish-spotted-in-singapore-waters-for-first-time-likely-from-aquarium-trade,Colourful mandarin fish spotted in S'pore waters for first time,"SINGAPORE - A pair of mandarin fish - colourful reef fish known among scuba divers for their exotic mating dances in the moonlight - has been spotted for the first time in Singapore. The fish species is not known to be found naturally in the Republic, although it does occur in nearby waters, such as in the Philippines, as well as in Borneo and Java in Indonesia. Fish scientists The Straits Times spoke to on Tuesday (June 21) think it is likely that the pair was released from the aquarium trade. Hospital care coordinator Venus Tan, 49, spotted the two mandarin dragonets (Synchiropus splendidus) at One°15 Marina on Sentosa while on a leisure dive there at about 5.30pm on April 22. Speaking to The Straits Times over the phone on Tuesday, Ms Tan said: ""I had not used my camera for some time, so I was hovering near some stones on the seabed, trying to adjust the settings, when I saw a dark shape moving in and out of the rubble."" Visibility that day was not great, Ms Tan said. She slowly drifted closer to the rock pile, trying not to spook the fish, and shone a faint beam of light from her dive torch on the rubble. That was when she saw flashes of the mandarin fish's signature colouring - wavy patterns of bright blue and orange. ""My first thought was: Isn't that a mandarin fish? I quickly set up my camera and got a few shots,"" said Ms Tan. There were two of them, she added, although she did not witness them doing their mating dance. The courtship ritual between mating pairs of mandarin fish is a sight to behold. The spectacle usually takes place after sunset, when females gather to watch males perform a dance. ""If the female likes a male she will join him by resting on his pelvic fin and as they float above the reef they will spawn, releasing a cloud of eggs and sperm,"" says the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History on its website. Ms Tan's sighting was confirmed by National University of Singapore (NUS) fish scientist Zeehan Jaafar. The observation was published as a biodiversity record in the scientific journal Nature In Singapore on May 31. Dr Jaafar, who suspects that the two fish were released from the aquarium trade, said the fish are assumed to be a breeding pair. Asked if the two could eventually start a population in Singapore, she said: ""They may lay eggs and the eggs may be fertilised. But the larvae are planktonic (free-floating) so they would have to return to the area when they become juveniles. Many ifs!"" There is evidence that fish from the aquarium trade, when released into natural environments where they are not usually found, have disrupted local ecosystems. In the western north Atlantic region, populations of introduced lionfish - a predatory fish native to the Indo-Pacific region - have swelled dramatically, and are harming native coral reef ecosystems in the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. Adult lionfish eat other fish and have very few predators outside of their home range. Researchers have discovered that a single lionfish residing on a coral reef can reduce recruitment of native reef fish by 79 per cent, said the United States' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Dr Tan Heok Hui, a fish scientist at the NUS Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, said it is unlikely that the mandarin fish could have such an impact on local waters, as they may end up as food for local resident predators instead. Still, he cautioned that introducing non-native species into Singapore's marine environment could have other harmful impacts. Dr Tan said: ""There are far more impacts than one can see immediately. There is also the potential spread of disease. If they mate with other closely related species in Singapore waters, there is also the possibility of hybridisation and weakening of the local gene pool."""

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/scratched-by-pets-scolded-by-owners-its-recognition-time-for-veterinary-nurses,"Scratched by pets, scolded by owners: It's recognition time for veterinary nurses","SINGAPORE - When a dog escaped from its owner outside Island Veterinary Clinic in Jurong last year, senior veterinary nurse Apple Neo and two of her colleagues went on a two-hour chase. While the owner, feeling tired, gave up halfway, Ms Neo ran onto the road to prevent the dog from being hit by cars. The clinic staff expected the owner to show relief and some appreciation to them when they managed to trap and return the dog to her. Instead, they were blamed for the dog's escape. ""There are many times (on this job) that no matter how much we contribute, we don't get appreciated,"" said Ms Neo, 33, who has been a vet nurse for about 13 years. Demanding humans aside, she has also been scratched by aggressive and skittish animals, with one scratch needing medical attention. Last month, Ms Neo received the inaugural Veterinary Nurse and Technician of the Year award, alongside another vet nurse, Mr Arvind Anandamohan, 29. The award was given out by the Singapore Veterinary Nurses and Technicians Chapter (SVNTC) under the Singapore Veterinary Association (SVA), and pet food company Royal Canin Singapore. In Singapore, the terms ""vet nurse"" and ""vet technician"" are used interchangeably. Their duties, which are similar with those of a hospital nurse, include measuring animals' vital signs, inserting IV catheters and taking blood samples, running X-ray machines, and making sure the animals remain clean and calm. But this somewhat invisible profession has been seeing a high turnover rate over the years due to long working hours, lack of career progression, lower salary and mental health challenges as a result of compassion fatigue, and sometimes, abuse from pet owners. In addition, the profession is not well regulated. Many local vet nurses, like Ms Neo and Mr Arvind, learnt on the job and took certification courses a few years later. Others come in with a diploma in veterinary science from polytechnics. Mr Arvind, an operations manager and vet nurse at Pets Avenue Veterinary Clinic in Farrer Road, joined the clinic about seven years ago, aspiring to become a vet. Amid an ongoing national review to raise the standards of the vet sector here, the SVNTC, formed last year will lead the way in defining the competencies that are expected of vet nurses and technicians from day one of their job, said its co-chair, Dr Teo Boon Han. It will also help to develop career progression frameworks for vet nurses in clinics, as well as in research, wildlife and livestock, he added. There are between 800 and 1,200 vet nurses in Singapore. Higher standards are key because the demand for vet nurses - especially specialised ones in geriatric and critical care - is rising as pets are living longer with better nutrition, diagnostics and treatment. ""Pet owners need the support of competent veterinary nurses to provide palliative care for their geriatric pets in cases of chronic renal failure or cancer treatments,"" said Dr Teo. Mr Arvind, who decided to put aside his ambition to become a vet and instead aims to pursue further studies in emergency vet nursing, said: ""I want to do more for pets that come to us in critical condition, to stabilise them better and to enact any early intervention steps, such as animal CPR, that can save their lives."" Dr Teo added that when vet nurses can do higher-value tasks and contribute more effectively, it justifies a sustainable higher wage. The starting pay of a vet nurse rarely exceeds $3,000. Despite the challenges of the job, Ms Neo is staying on as a vet nurse as she is passionate about animals and because of the years of hard work she has put in to master her nursing skills and manage difficult pet owners. To safeguard the mental health of his colleagues in the clinic, Mr Arvind regularly encourages mindfulness exercises to help them reduce stress. When he notices a vet nurse or receptionist becoming frustrated, he will tell them to take a break or breathe before answering a phone call from a frantic pet owner. ""In this industry, any bad scratch or bite can actually level up your nursing skill by five or 10 years. After the first attack, you will realise that you really need to handle the animal properly, or you are endangering yourself, the pet and the person working with you. After my second experience with an aggressive cat, I told myself no, I really need to improve."" Ms Apple Neo, 33, senior vet nurse at Island Veterinary Clinic. ""Due to fatigue on the job, I think vet nurses are losing track of empathy and compassion. At times, they can be direct and upfront with worried pet owners. This can make or break owners' experiences at the clinic. Showing empathy helps to build a stronger rapport between the vet clinic and pet owner, and, in turn, establish more trust in the vets and better care for the animals."" Mr Arvind Anandamohan, 29, operations manager and vet nurse at Pets Avenue Veterinary Clinic."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/prehistoric-singapore-new-species-of-ancient-worm-suspected-to-originate-in-singaporean-forests,Endemic velvet worms may be new species,"SINGAPORE - The velvet worm is far from a worm. Existing in its own biological classification known as Onychophora, fossils of these velvety creatures have been found as far back as around 500 million years ago. "
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/velvet-worm-proteins-sequenced-at-last-one-step-closer-to-becoming-a-bioplastic,Velvet worm proteins sequenced at last: One step closer to becoming a bioplastic,"SINGAPORE - Velvet worms are the carnivorous cowboys of the invertebrate world, using slime ""ammunition"" to catch prey. This sticky substance, touted as a possible plastic replacement, is squirted out of two ""muskets"" from the sides of the worm's mouth. It is famed for its ability to harden to trap prey in a string-like web as strong as nylon, and also dissolve completely when exposed to water. The exact composition of the slime has so far eluded scientists, but a team of scientists from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) have just uncovered the exact constitution of proteins in the slime. This brings the slime from the endangered worm a step closer towards having commercial viability as a biodegradable plastic or adhesive. The supervisor of the study, Professor Ali Miserez, from NTU's School of Material Sciences and Engineering (MSE) and School of Biological Sciences, said though it was known ""a long time ago that the slime was mostly made of proteins, no one knew the complete sequence of amino acids of the proteins"". Amino acids are the basic building blocks of proteins. There are 20 different amino acids in total, all with different chemical compositions and capable of different types of chemical reactions. Furthermore, he added, it was understood that the hardening mechanism behind the slime was caused by the sudden assembly of many different slime proteins into a larger complex, known as a biopolymer, under certain conditions. Biopolymers can be thought of as elongated molecules that can be made of proteins or other types of large molecules such as cellulose, the main building block of wood. Listing common biopolymers like silk and spider webs, which have attracted much public interest, Prof Miserez said: ""But these (slime proteins) are special in that they will form bonds with each other to make the slime solid but not strong enough such that we cannot dissolve it afterwards."" He added that charting the exact sequence of amino acids in these polypeptides would therefore allow them to study how exactly these proteins interact with one another to give rise to the slime's unique qualities. As part of the sequencing research, one of the first authors of the study, NTU scientist Bhargy Sharma from MSE, discovered that a short section of one protein contributed to the slime forming tiny droplets, like oil in water. This section, known as the N-Terminus, or the extremity of a protein, was instrumental in enabling the proteins to form the droplets surrounded by water. These droplets are like ""islands"" of concentrated amounts of proteins that make the slime very viscous but not solid, so that it can be stored by the animal in its body before ejection. Prof Miserez said this discovery would not have been possible if they did not have the complete amino acid sequence. Funded by the Singapore Energy Centre (SgEC) the study  supervised by Prof Miserez’s team and conducted primarily by Dr Bhargy and Dr Yang Lu, who has since left NTU, was published in May in Advanced Science - one of the top multidisciplinary scientific journals in the world. SgEC is a consortium founded by the NTU, the National University of Singapore, and founding members such as ExxonMobil. While the team recognise their achievement, they acknowledge that this research is still far away from being incorporated into a consumable product. It is estimated that around five more years of work will be required before an artificial version of the slime can be manufactured for larger scale. Further proof-of-concept experiments will then have to be done on the artificial slime before it is ready for commercial use. Despite this, Prof Miserez stresses that fundamental research is essential. ""Many research studies actually begin with very basic and fundamental aims, with scientists not being able to predict whether their research will eventually be used in life-changing creations,"" he said. One life-changing invention that Prof Miserez's team recently developed was a novel method of delivering drugs into human cells using large biological molecules, by first encasing them in a protein-based micro droplet. The method, which was published earlier this year in the journal Nature Chemistry, would be safer, faster and more effective than traditional drug delivery methods. It would also be more suited for more invasive drug therapies, like genetic therapy, cancer treatment and vaccinations. However, what is lesser known is that this discovery was directly inspired by a protein from the beak of squids, said Prof Miserez. The squid beak is a very hard material, but unlike vertebrates' teeth (like human teeth), it is not calcified but a combination of proteins and chitin, another type of biopolymer, as discovered by a team of scientists led by Prof Miserez in 2008. Later, in 2015, the team were able to sequence the main proteins of the beak and then discovered that shorter segments of the proteins can form micro droplets that may be used for delivery of drugs into human cells. Citing the example of the squid beak protein, Prof Miserez said: ""I had no idea that I would use this discovery eventually to deliver vaccines or anti-cancer drugs."" He added: ""Research is an ongoing process that never stops: For every question answered, there will be two more questions that arise, unanswered."" Returning to the velvet worm's slime proteins, he said: ""Maybe with these proteins, we will have something similar one day or another application we may have never thought of in the first place."" ""It is not impossible,"" he added."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/wet-weather-and-thundery-showers-expected-for-the-rest-of-june,Wet weather and thundery showers expected for the rest of June,"SINGAPORE - Singaporeans should remember to pack an umbrella for the thundery showers that will be continuing into the second half of June. The daily temperature for the rest of June is expected to range between 24 deg C and 33 deg C, with the exception of a few warm days that could exceed 34 deg C, said the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS). The continuation of wet weather comes after warm and humid conditions last month and the first half of this month. Some nights are also expected to be warm, especially over the eastern and southern coastal areas of the island. This is due to the south-east winds blowing warm and moist air from the sea towards land. The temperature on these nights may reach 28 deg C, said MSS. The monsoon rain band is expected to lie close to the equator in the second fortnight of June, therefore resulting in more rainfall over the South-east Asia region. Sumatra squalls are expected to bring widespread thundery showers with gusty winds to Singapore. The showers are expected before dawn on some days and could continue and get heavy in the afternoons - due to strong daytime heating of land areas and winds over the island and surrounding areas. In comparison to last month, said MSS, the first half of June was less warm, with the highest daily maximum temperature of 35.1 deg C recorded in Paya Lebar on June 8. The highest such temperature in May was 36.7 deg C, in Admiralty on May 13. It is also the highest temperature recorded in Singapore. Most parts of the island also received above average rainfall in the first fortnight of this month - at 135.3mm, with the highest recorded at 223 per cent above average in Simei. The rainfall at Bukit Panjang was the lowest, at 21 per cent below average."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/what-to-expect-when-nea-knocks-on-your-door-for-a-dengue-inspection,Dengue on the rise: What to expect when NEA knocks on your door for an inspection,"SINGAPORE - Knock knock. Who's there? It's an officer from the National Environment Agency (NEA), who is here to check your home for mosquito breeding spots. As dengue cases continue to rise around the island, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said on Wednesday (June 15) that individual and community responsibility are the most critical elements of dengue control here. The Straits Times followed NEA inspection officer Sindhusha Selvakumar to a dengue hot spot in Little India to see what happens when the NEA comes knocking. NEA officers decide which homes to inspect based on the number of mosquitoes caught in gravitraps designed to attract female Aedes mosquitoes which spread dengue. The officers also take into account feedback received, as well as the presence of dengue cases in the area. However, when there is a surge in dengue cases, the officers will focus their resources on homes with dengue cases, or within dengue clusters, explained Ms Sindhusha. When an NEA officer like Ms Sindhusha visits a unit, she will introduce and identify herself as an NEA officer by showing an NEA authority card. Residents who wish to verify officers' identities may call NEA on 6225-5632 before letting the officers into their homes. Officers can enter a home only after a resident has given consent, and will have to be accompanied by the resident throughout the entire inspection process. ""Some residents have the misconception that we go with the intention of (issuing fines). Our intention is purely to eliminate any possible mosquito breeding sites. This is a very serious public health concern, so we go there to... contain the dengue cluster,"" said Ms Sindhusha. After entering a home, Ms Sindhusha checks the areas where mosquitoes may potentially breed. These include the dishwashing area in the kitchen, dish drying rack, under the sink, pails in the toilet, toilet cistern, and any plants inside and outside the home. The entire inspection process usually takes up to 15 minutes, depending on the layout of the home, said Ms Sindhusha. She added that flowerpots are some of the most common breeding spots of mosquitoes. Once the inspection is done, she sprays pesticide in dark corners of the home where mosquitoes may be lurking. If a mosquito breeding spot is found, she will point it out to the resident and use an empty vial to collect a sample of the mosquito larvae or pupae. The vial will be sealed and sent to a laboratory for testing. An NEA officer may also ask the resident to present his identification card so she can take down the details as it is an offence to breed mosquitoes. The officer will not issue a fine on the spot. A fine will be issued at a later date if the sample in the vial is found to contain mosquitoes or other vectors. During Ms Sindhusha's visits, she also gives residents advice on steps they can take to prevent mosquito breeding, and shows them how to apply insect repellent properly. At times, if a home is located in an active dengue cluster, an NEA officer may ask the resident if he is willing to have ULV misting carried out on the premises. This involves a contractor spraying pesticide around the home to kill mosquitoes and is done free of charge, usually on a separate day. The day in the life of an inspection officer is a tiring one. Ms Sindhusha said an officer typically has to check about 30 to 40 homes a day. The number may sometimes go up to 50, depending on the estate the officer is assigned to. Besides constantly having to enter dengue hot spots, spotting mosquito breeding areas is also a difficult task, as Aedes mosquitoes need only a volume of water the size of a 20-cent coin to breed. But these are not the only challenges the officers face. ""Once we find mosquito breeding habitats and engage the residents, most of them refuse to acknowledge that they have created conditions favourable to (mosquito breeding),"" said Ms Sindhusha. She added that at times, some residents would try to stop the officers from continuing their inspections. She said that the officers will try to defuse the situation by explaining that the purpose of their visit is not to pin blame on the residents, but rather to remove any mosquito breeding habitats. ""When we explain that we're doing our job (to look after) public health and safety, most of them will oblige,"" she said. She added: ""My one wish is for residents to see us as partners, so we can come together and fight dengue."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/south-east-asias-biodiversity-worth-3-trillion-a-year-in-economic-growth-jobs-report,"South-east Asia's biodiversity worth $3 trillion a year in economic growth, jobs: Report","SINGAPORE - South-east Asia's nature, from forests and coral reefs to mangroves, provides the region with at least US$2.19 trillion (S$3.05 trillion) in economic benefits a year, a new report by Malaysia's highest scientific advisory body has found. The paper, titled ""The Nexus of Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Socioeconomic Development in Southeast Asia"", is the first to calculate the economic value of the vast diversity of wildlife and swathes of rainforests, peatlands and mangroves in the region. In 2020, the total combined gross domestic product of the 10 Asean member states was US$3 trillion. Nature's economic contribution of $3.04 trillion to Asean member states refers to the benefits South-east Asia's biodiversity provides now, and the figure can rise if nations further act on conservation, said the Academy of Sciences Malaysia, which published its report on Wednesday (June 15). The $3.04 trillion figure was derived from a valuation of biodiversity here, based on a 2018 report by the World Wildlife Fund which estimated the global value of economic activity underpinned by nature to be US$125 trillion. One of the report's authors, Professor Pervaiz Ahmed from Malaysia's Sunway University, said their valuation considered four domains: A forest's role in soaking up carbon dioxide and preventing floods, its role as a habitat for wildlife species' survival, its place in education and tourism, and lastly, its provisional services such as the value of timber, food and medicine from the rainforest. He added at a virtual media briefing streamed from Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday: ""Previous valuation studies have been looking (only) at provisioning systems, such as, if we exploit nature or timber, what is the value we will get... we moved away from that narrow view which (is) simple, immediate and profit-centric."" Although South-east Asia covers only 4 per cent of Earth's land surface area, the region is rich in its native flora and fauna, comprising six of the world's 25 biodiversity hotspots. The Asean region is responsible for 15 per cent of the world's fish production, and harbours one of the world's most extensive seagrass beds, coral reefs and mangrove mass. The Academy of Sciences Malaysia argues that as South-east Asia's population grows and urban development continues, the region should not follow the lead of the wealthy Group of Seven (G-7) nations, which depleted much of their natural resources while building their economies. The G-7 is an organisation of the world's seven largest advanced economies, including Canada, Germany, Japan and the United States. ""Leaders in the (Asean) region should take note of a growing body of research showing that countries can and should achieve economic growth and generate jobs through strategies that protect rather than destroy nature,"" said the academy in a statement. The report highlights promising nature protection initiatives that have brought about economic growth and jobs to local communities and indigenous tribes, either through ecotourism or carbon credit projects. One example is Indonesia's Rimba Raya Biodiversity Reserve Project, which preserves carbon-dense tropical peat swamps in Kalimantan, and has halted the deforestation of about 65,000ha of forest originally planned for oil palm plantations. It is also the world's largest project to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. As a carbon offset project, part of the revenue from the sale of carbon credits went to local community development and government infrastructure. A carbon credit represents a tonne of reduced or avoided carbon dioxide emissions from a verified project, such as Rimba Raya, and is bought by firms to help them meet emission reduction goals. The paper by the academy comes a week before nations around the world, including Asean member states, gather in Kenya to discuss a proposal to protect or conserve at least 30 per cent of the planet's land and ocean by 2030. While the report found that nature is valued at close to US$100 million in Singapore - a smaller figure compared with its neighbours due to it smaller land size - the island-state's strength lies in its financial hub status and potential in mobilising green finance and carbon trading in the region, said Prof Pervaiz, who is based in Malaysia. One way to unlock and maximise the $3.04 trillion promise from nature is to leverage science, technology and innovation to further the conservation and restoration of biodiversity, which Singapore is also strong in, he added. Those include using satellites and drones to study the health of mangroves and sustainable fisheries, and using novel methods to breed endangered plants and restore habitats. Commenting on the paper, Associate Professor Roman Carrasco from the National University of Singapore's Department of Biological Sciences said: ""The region has to invest in what it has a clear global competitive advantage of: biodiversity."" As Singapore helps to transform South-east Asia's economy into a green economy powerhouse, more specialised sustainability jobs will be added here, he said. Those include talent equipped to measure carbon stocks and help companies demonstrate their net-zero and nature-positive pledges."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/18-sites-on-sentosa-to-be-powered-by-solar-power-installation-to-begin-this-month,"18 Sentosa sites to be powered by solar energy, installation to begin this month","SINGAPORE - Solar panels will soon power 18 sites on Sentosa, including well-loved attractions in Universal Studios Singapore (USS), to make the resort island more environmentally friendly. These panels will be installed on the roofs of attractions such as the Revenge Of The Mummy roller coaster, among others. The sites were selected based on factors such as sufficient sunlight, renovation plans of buildings and whether they would obstruct guest experience. In a statement released on Wednesday (June 15), Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) said these installations mark the first major milestone in the corporation’s aim of powering 10 per cent of the island with renewable energy. When the panels are fully installed by 2023, SDC said it expects an overall reduction of carbon emissions equivalent to that generated by 60,000 hotel rooms a year. The panels will also make up 1 per cent to 2 per cent of Sentosa’s total energy usage, compared with 2021, said SDC in response to queries from The Straits Times. SDC divisional director of planning Lee Cheh Hsien said: “This is the first wave of large-scale solar installations in Sentosa, we have plans to install more solar panels  in the coming years.” More details will be shared when information is available, he added. The statement added that SDC is also experimenting with other forms of renewable energy such as tidal energy and waste-to-energy generators to green its energy grid further. This comes under SDC’s general commitment to net-zero emissions by 2030, as announced in its sustainability road map in 2021. Under this road map, the corporation has pledged to implement a slew of measures such as investing in more renewable energy infrastructure and food recycling efforts. On the other renewable energy alternatives being studied, the statement said: “Small-scale pilots are currently being explored with the view to scaling these solutions for mass deployment should the trials prove successful.” The installation of panels on the roofs of 11 sites run by Resorts World Sentosa, such as USS rides and the Hard Rock Hotel, will begin this month. Also, the tender to install panels at the seven sites managed by SDC, such as cable car stations and Beach station on the Sentosa monorail, will begin on Wednesday. Even though these sites are of different sizes and have different tenure lengths, SDC said that the rights for each site will be consolidated into a single tender. The aim is to make it more economically viable for vendors hoping to provide their service. Chief executive officer of SDC Thien Kwee Eng said the corporation hopes that such site consolidation for the tender will set a good example for businesses to collaborate to create a better environment for sustainable investment. She said: “Solar is one of the most viable renewable sources of energy for Sentosa and Singapore. Using this approach, the initiative will take us one step further towards being a sustainable leisure destination with a lower carbon footprint.”"
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/transition-to-clean-energy-must-be-affordable-and-fair-indonesias-coordinating-economic-minister,Transition to clean energy must be affordable and fair: Indonesia's coordinating economic minister,"SINGAPORE - Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto called for a just and affordable transition to clean energy even as countries around the world scramble to secure energy resources in the short term amid a global oil and gas crunch. ""The most important thing for the energy transition is to obtain a just and affordable transition, and during the discussion in Davos, one of the most important issues that every country was looking at was their own energy security,"" said Mr Airlangga, who was speaking virtually in a panel discussion at the Indonesia-Singapore Business Forum held at the Hilton Singapore Orchard hotel on Tuesday (June 14). Davos, Switzerland, is the venue for the World Economic Forum, an annual gathering of business, government and civil society leaders to discuss global issues. The event resumed last month following a two-year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr Airlangga noted that the component of financing would determine not only the affordability of projects that support the energy transition, but also the prices which consumers would eventually pay. He said this in response to a question by Mr Warren Fernandez, editor of The Straits Times and Editor-in-Chief of the English/Malay/Tamil Media Group, who was moderating the panel. The minister added that the country is looking to phase down 5.5 gigawatts of power generation capacity currently supported by coal-fired plants and turn to renewable energy instead. Mr Airlangga also noted that Indonesia is currently looking at developing renewable energy projects with Singapore in geothermal, hydro, wind and solar power. According to a Bloomberg report in early June, Indonesia is looking to subsidise renewable energy projects, as well as open its first nuclear power plant by 2045, in a draft legislation to help it reach its net-zero emissions goal. The Bill, which requires approval from President Joko Widodo and Parliament before becoming law, positions the country on a path that would ensure all 270 million residents have access to power while also making the country entirely reliant on clean energy by 2060. Panellist Jeffrey Jaensubhakij, group chief investment officer of Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC, said governments have a big part to play in attracting investment for energy transition projects. “Obviously, the project risks are potentially enormous, and (it is important that) governments come in with standardised PPAs (Power Purchase Agreements), where people can know that if we are going to invest in a certain country that the PPAs will stand up to regulatory and legal frameworks,” he said. He added that governments could consider making initial investments in such projects and then transferring them over to the private sector at a later stage. Singapore Manpower Minister Tan See Leng, who was a member of the panel, echoed the importance of collaboration on climate change, especially when it is a central issue for countries across the world. “I think when countries come together, where clarity is provided in terms of pathways, then the costs can actually be distributed and shared. Likewise, the risk profile, given the fact that clarity also breeds certainty... actually drops. Then there is a lot more confidence from the private sector to come in and invest in the public sector,” he said. He added: “This is a perfect, wonderful opportunity especially for Asean... especially for close neighbours, for instance like Singapore and Indonesia and the rest of Asean, to come together to develop the regional grid for renewable energy.”"

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/sporean-team-developing-bacteriophages-as-antibiotic-replacement-in-black-soldier-fly-protein,S'porean team developing bacteriophages as antibiotic replacement in black soldier fly protein,"SINGAPORE - Black soldier fly larvae not only munch up waste, but they also transform their bodies into valuable animal feed. A Singapore team is finding ways to supercharge these larva protein packets with antimicrobial qualities. Animals such as chickens and fish fed this diet could get better protection against an array of bacterial infections - without the need to administer antibiotics. The secret to this lies in the fly larvae's ability to coexist with a bacterial predator: bacteriophages. Bacteriophages are viruses that prey on bacteria to convert them into factories to proliferate their genetic material. Chief technological officer Martin Zorrilla of Nutrition Technologies, the company keen on incorporating phages into insect protein, said this ability comes from the fly's role in the food chain as a decomposer that thrives in potentially biohazardous environments. ""To thrive in their natural environments such as manure or even carcasses, the flies must have a very special relationship with microbes,"" said Mr Zorrilla who works at the firm that specialises in soldier fly products. By virtue of their need for microbes to decompose, he added that the flies have evolved to coexist with these microbes within them, from bacteria to bacteriophages. This, he noted, makes them ideal carriages for bacteriophages as antibiotic replacements. Funded by The Singapore National Biofilm Consortium, an agency that dispenses grants for collaborations between industry and microbial academic research, the proof-of-concept project is currently being conducted between Nutrition Technologies and National University of Singapore microbiology and immunology scientist Wilfried Moreira. The latter said the idea came, in part, because the rampant use of antibiotics in farm animals was contributing to the global issue of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. According to the Natural Resources Defence Council, an international environmental non-profit organisation, around 65 per cent of medically important antibiotics sold in the United States are used in farmed animals. Though antibiotics have been used to keep these animals healthy and keep farm yields high, Dr Moreira said such indiscriminate use can end up selecting for bacteria that are resistant. ""Taking an antibiotic to kill a harmful bacteria is the equivalent of carpet bombing a town to take out a single enemy,"" he added. This can also lead to wiping out healthy and protective natural microbial life and also potentially provide a blank and fertile slate for harmful bacteria to colonise completely. Drawing a comparison, he added: ""Bacteriophages are more like special force troops or snipers that take out specific bacteria."" He attributed this selectivity to the co-evolution between bacteriophages and their specific prey bacteria. As a result of this selectivity, Dr Moreira said bacteriophages target only their bacteria and are harmless to human cells. The study began in January this year and the first stage is slated to end by 2023, although the collaboration is expected to continue. Nutrition Technologies plans on incorporating bacteriophages into its fly protein in two to three years. While these bacteriophages will initially target poultry-related infections, Mr Zorrilla hopes to tap them to fight bacteria in other animals, like fish. ""The cool thing here is that we have two entities that we would normally consider as our foes - insects and viruses - working together for our benefit,"" he said."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/south-american-butterfly-the-julia-heliconian-makes-singapore-home,"South American butterfly, the julia heliconian, makes Singapore home","SINGAPORE - A butterfly species that originally hails from South America has settled in Singapore, following a territorial expansion down the South-east Asian archipelago that took more than a decade. The strikingly orange julia heliconian butterfly - also known by its scientific name Dryas iulia - was first spotted in the wild in Thailand in 2007, after having escaped from butterfly farms in Phuket. The first sighting of the butterfly in Singapore was at HortPark in June 2021. In less than a year, it has established colonies across Singapore, including on Pulau Ubin. Dr Anuj Jain, an ecologist at bioSEA, a firm that consults on ecological design, said it is likely that the butterflies proliferated as they found a familiar food source - a South American passion fruit, or Passiflora foetida. They are growing in abundance in South-east Asia after the plants were introduced for food, medicinal and ornamental reasons in countries such as Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. Dr Jain, a former chairman of the butterfly and insect group at Nature Society (Singapore), said: ""It must have taken many generations for the butterflies to eventually expand to Malaysia and Singapore."" Members of a Singapore butterfly interest group, Butterfly Circle, spotted the butterflies during an outing to Pulau Langkawi in 2009, the year the butterfly was recorded in Malaysia as a newly settled species. Of the sighting, Mr Khew Sin Khoon, the head of Butterfly Circle, said: ""It was a curiosity, as this species is of South American origin and native to countries like Mexico, Colombia and Brazil."" Researchers then had also performed DNA sequencing and traced the julia heliconian butterflies to stock from Costa Rica exported to the butterfly farms in Phuket, confirming Mr Khew's hunch that the butterflies had escaped from the farms. In 2015, the orange butterflies were spotted farther south in Selangor by Butterfly Circle members. When this sighting was recorded, Mr Khew, who is also the president and group chief executive of CPG Corp, an Asian architectural consultancy firm, said: ""I predicted that it would be a matter of time before the julia heliconian will arrive in Singapore."" He said this was because two other exotic species of butterflies had made their way down to Singapore in the same way. The leopard lacewing has been recorded in Singapore since 2005 and the tawny coster since 2006. On these two butterflies, Dr Jain said they were likely to have expanded to Malaysia and Singapore eating their way through the peninsula on the South American passiflora plants as well. The National Parks Board (NParks) said in response to queries from The Straits Times that more data on the julia heliconian butterfly will be collected to understand their impact on local ecosystems. Mr Ryan Lee, group director of NParks' National Biodiversity Centre, said NParks takes efforts to safeguard Singapore's native biodiversity through measures such as removing invasive species when they compete for food with native species, or only selectively planting native trees and shrubs to provide more food for native fauna. He added: ""Maintaining high species richness and diversity in our native ecosystems can create a natural resistance to invasion."" Mr Khew said no Singapore species is known to feed on the host plants that the three alien species of butterflies rely on as a food source. He added that this means their migration is unlikely to have a negative impact on the local environment. ""All three species are now considered common in Singapore and are frequently recorded by photographers and nature enthusiasts over a wide distribution across the island,"" he said. Over the years, some non-native fauna have been localised in Singapore. Several African grassland birds, such as the golden-backed weaver, have become established in Singapore. Also, the julia heliconian butterfly is just one of more than 30 species of exotic butterflies that have been spotted in Singapore. There are more than 320 species of butterflies in Singapore. Mr Khew said: ""Like birds, butterflies do not respect geographical nor political borders."" As long as conditions are favourable for the colonisation of habitats, these exotic species will continue to spread across regions and exist in Singapore, he added."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/more-philanthropy-funds-focusing-on-climate-change-needed-reports,More philanthropy funds focusing on climate change needed: Reports,"SINGAPORE - To support green causes and efforts to further climate action, Mr David Heng, chief executive of a private equity fund, set up the Mind the Gap 200 - Sustainable Earth fund in 2019. It is part of a project Mr Heng, who is in his 50s, undertook with nine friends and the Community Foundation of Singapore. The fund, which supports charities and programmes that address some of the United Nations' sustainable development goals, is one of the few set up by philanthropists to tackle climate change. The cause attracts less than 2 per cent of philanthropic giving globally, according to global non-governmental organisation ClimateWorks Foundation. A recently published 110-page guide by Swiss bank UBS is looking to change this by showing donors, philanthropists and investors how to fill the climate funding gap, and the benefits and impacts of ""green philanthropy"". The report, called On Thin Ice, comprises insights and tips from more than 40 experts in the areas of sustainability and investment. The report also emphasises the importance of prioritising climate funding since the dangerous impacts of climate change will cut across other focus areas such as children's health, mental well-being, inequality and food security. ""While the need to engage directly with climate change is now recognised, many who may have the means to take action are unclear on how to best use these resources to achieve the greatest impact,"" said Ms Hannah Wood, one of the authors of the report. Ms Wood, programme director of UBS Optimus Foundation, added that areas that need funding include the energy transition, agriculture and climate research. ""Investors may wish to consider investing in key sectors such as renewable energy and carbon capture, energy efficiency and smart mobility."" Shifting to renewable energy and scaling up research are expensive. The International Energy Agency estimates that 70 per cent of clean energy investments over the next decade need to come from private investors, consumers and financiers. Limiting global warming to 1.5 deg C by 2030 will require an extra US$4 trillion ($5.5 trillion) investment in clean energy projects and infrastructure every year. Beyond money, philanthropists and investors can also use their influence as shareholders to push for positive environmental change in companies - especially for firms that are economically important but polluting, added Ms Wood. ClimateWorks Foundation said that between 2019 and 2020, overall philanthropic giving grew by 3 per cent while climate funding grew by 14 per cent. Mr Heng is the founder and CEO of $405 million impact investment fund ABC World Asia. Impact investment funds aim to generate positive environmental and social impact while bringing good returns to investors. For Mind the Gap 200, people can donate to it through the Community Foundation of Singapore, a charity that encourages and helps to enable philanthropy in Singapore by matching donors' interests with various causes. Ms Catherine Loh, chief executive of Community Foundation of Singapore, said interest in green philanthropy picked up here when the Singapore Green Plan 2030 - a movement to advance the national agenda for sustainable development - was announced early last year. From this year to 2024, the foundation will prioritise five issues for grant-making, and one of them is climate and environment. This covers environmental conservation efforts, research into climate-related phenomena and climate solutions, added Ms Loh. ""The inclusion of this as an area of focus stems from the recognition that a healthy natural environment is conducive to the well-being of a community,"" she said. She cited the Khurana Nurture Foundation, which supports the Institute of Technical Education's green ambassadors, training them to be the next generation of environmental activists. The philanthropic organisation also helps people with disabilities pursue a career in urban farming. Those philanthropy efforts together address climate action, education, social welfare and jobs. Charitable family foundations The Straits Times contacted declined to be interviewed because they prefer to keep a low profile about their philanthropic work. Ms Wood said: ""There are big returns to be made from environmental philanthropic and sustainable investments, and as the pace of change continues to speed up, the wisest will be out ahead of the curve driving the transition.""

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/new-beach-hub-in-pasir-ris-park-to-drive-sustainability-efforts-in-the-area,New beach hub in Pasir Ris Park to drive sustainability efforts in the area,"SINGAPORE - A new structure set up at Pasir Ris Park will become the focal point of environmental sustainability efforts in the area. The OPP Beach Hub, set up by social enterprise Ocean Purpose Project (OPP), will act as a place from which researchers can study algae and where volunteers can gather to do monthly beach clean ups. Launched on Saturday (June 11), it will eventually become a meeting point as well for the group's members to educate fish farm owners about the use of seaweeds and mussels in guarding against algal blooms. The solar-powered hub measures 6m wide and 3m long. Ms Mathilda D'Silva, 39, chief executive officer of OPP, said: ""It is also meant to be something that can maybe become a studio, a live stream area for us to create content and drive behavioural change in the community. ""There will be staff working from here... it is almost like an office space, but it is also meant to be an interactive community space."" Ms Mathilda said OPP will work with NParks and other organisations to set up a garden on the grass patch in front of the hub. The garden, which is expected to feature a range of traditional herbs, will be fertilised by seaweed that are washed up on Singapore's beaches. She hopes that the garden can be set up in the next two or three years. Ms Yeo Wan Ling, an MP for Pasir-Ris-Punggol GRC, said the opening of the hub will give residents in the constituency more opportunities to play their part in environmental sustainability. OPP was founded in 2020. It aims to create a movement to drive ocean conservation and plastic pollution prevention via creative projects, such as turning plastic waste into hydrogen. Another one of its projects is the use of seaweed and mussel culture as natural filters to clean Singapore's seas. For a start, it has worked with a fish farm off Pasir Ris Park to create a curtain of seaweed and mussels around the farm. OPP has put in place 220 ropes around the farm, so as to attract seaweed and mussels to latch on to them. These seaweed and mussels would feed on algae in the waters, which should thus reduce the risk of algae smothering the waters and fishes within the farm. This ocean hazard - called harmful algal blooms - is a global phenomenon that is rising in step with increasing fisheries, coastal development and marine exploitation. Ms Mathilda said the seaweed and mussels grown can be harvested and processed into bio-plastics. She hopes the successful trial of this method would help to attract other fish farms in Singapore to take up the idea as well. On Saturday, OPP also announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding with James Cook University to study seaweeds off the shore of Singapore. Through this, both path parties hope to create products such as seaweed leathers and bio-plastics. On why OPP is trying out unconventional ideas in its sustainability drive, Ms Mathilda said: ""There is an innate sense of good that people have but there's also this very intense behaviour that is pertinent to our culture today, which is called fear of missing out. ""That's the behaviour we are tapping into, to get people to adopt these kind of practices and think out of the box."""
