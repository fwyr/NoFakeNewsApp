https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/secondary-school-discipline-master-took-upskirt-videos-of-colleagues-and-students,"Secondary school discipline master took upskirt videos of colleagues, students","SINGAPORE - A secondary school discipline master ironically broke the law at his own workplace when he took multiple upskirt videos of his colleagues and at least seven students. The married man, a father of three, also committed the offence at other places, including his mother-in-law's home where he targeted a female relative. Over a period of more than three years, he took a total of 170 upskirt videos of at least 47 different women. The 49-year-old man pleaded guilty on Friday to three counts of insulting a woman's modesty. The court heard that on one occasion, a male student from the school was caught and punished for taking two upskirt videos of a teacher. On the pretext of retrieving evidence of the student's wrongdoing, the man used his own mobile phone to make recordings of the videos that the boy had filmed. The man then transferred these videos to his hard disk for his own collection. Details about the teacher and the school cannot be disclosed due to a gag order to protect the victims' identities. The Ministry of Education (MOE) told The Straits Times in an earlier statement that the man has been suspended from service since July 2018, and is no longer teaching in any school. Its spokesman said: ""MOE takes a serious view of staff misconduct and will not hesitate to take disciplinary action against those who fail to adhere to our standards of conduct and discipline, including dismissal from service."" Deputy Public Prosecutor Yvonne Poon said that between April 18, 2015, and July 11, 2018, the man filmed multiple upskirt videos of numerous women, targeting at least 38 of his colleagues. To commit the offences, he would set his mobile phone to video-recording mode before inviting a female colleague to his workstation for data entry purposes. While she was standing at his desk and keying in data, such as attendance records, he would place the device beneath her skirt and record a video without her knowledge or consent. The DPP added: ""The accused only invited female colleagues wearing skirts or dresses over to his workstation for data entry. ""He would not invite female teachers who were wearing trousers, and seldom invited male teachers over to his workstation for data entry."" By using a similar method, the man also filmed multiple upskirt videos of several students. DPP Poon told District Judge Brenda Tan: ""At least seven of the victims were students of the secondary school, which means that they would have been aged 16 or below and especially vulnerable to his predation. ""In committing the offences, the accused exploited their deference to his authority, as well as the trust that their parents reposed in the school and its faculty."" His offences came to light when a female teacher, who was one of the victims, suspected that he had been taking upskirt videos and alerted the police on July 14, 2018. On Friday, the court heard that the man was suffering from major depressive disorder at the time of his offences. Judge Tan then called for a report to assess his suitability for a mandatory treatment order (MTO). Those given an MTO will undergo treatment for their mental condition in lieu of jail time. The man is expected to be sentenced on Nov 3. For each count of insulting a woman's modesty, an offender can be jailed for up to a year and fined."

Tien Kiat Chong, 26, pleaded guilty earlier to a single charge of insulting women's modesty, while another charge of possessing obscene films was taken into consideration during sentencing. The court heard on Friday that he intends to appeal against the sentence and was offered bail of $8,000.  He was a Singapore Management University (SMU) student at the time of the offence. An SMU spokesman told The Straits Times in March that Tien had been put on leave of absence. ST has reached out to the university for comment. The court heard in March when Tien was convicted that he would feel an urge to follow women in dresses and skirts and take upskirt videos of them using his mobile phone. At about 7.15pm on Sept 4, 2019, he was travelling upwards on an escalator in Sengkang MRT station when he saw a woman wearing a denim skirt in front of him. He placed his left foot on the step above, just below where the victim was standing, and put his phone with its camera facing up on his left knee to try to take an upskirt video, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Ng Jun Chong. A witness saw him and alerted the station staff. When confronted, Tien denied trying to take an upskirt video of the victim. When the station staff asked to check his phone, Tien went through the phone before handing it over. The station staff and the witness found an upskirt video in his phone, filmed from behind a woman on an escalator. Tien repeatedly apologised and asked them if they could forget about what happened, adding that he was still studying. He was handed over to the police despite his pleas. In his statement to the police, Tien denied taking any upskirt videos. He claimed he had wanted to record a video of the woman's face but managed to capture only her ""back view"". The police later found 19 upskirt videos in his phone, taken between May 28 and Sept 4, 2019. The DPP said that 17 of the videos were recorded on escalators in public places, one was filmed in a train and another in a retail shop. DPP Ng said Tien was intruding on the privacy of the women, with the intent to insult their modesty. ""The accused would review the videos at home, or when he was alone,"" he said, adding that 37 other obscene videos were found in Tien's phone. An offender found guilty of insulting the modesty of a woman can be jailed for up to a year and fined. Those who possess obscene films can be jailed for a maximum of 12 months and fined."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/trio-charged-after-they-allegedly-sold-their-bank-account-details-to-scammers,Trio charged after they allegedly sold their bank account details to scammers,"SINGAPORE - Three men were charged in a district court on Friday after they allegedly sold their bank account details to scammers in unrelated cases. The accounts were used to launder at least $370,000 from various scams involving at least eight victims. The trio are Muhamad Hakim Fugi, 19; Tan Yong Kwang, 22; and Zhang Demin, 33. Hakim, the sole Singaporean, is accused of two counts of engaging in a conspiracy with an unknown person to cheat Standard Chartered Bank and UOB. He was also handed two charges under the Computer Misuse Act. Hakim is said to have committed the offences in January. In a statement on Thursday, the police said he allegedly made a deal with an unknown person over messaging platform Telegram to open bank accounts and hand over their control in exchange for cash. The police added: ""(He) allegedly cheated banks into opening two bank accounts and subsequently handed over the Internet banking login username, password and one-time password (OTP) of both bank accounts to the unknown person."" Hakim's case has been adjourned to Sept 21. Tan, a Malaysian, was handed a charge under the Computer Misuse Act on Friday. Police said that in November last year, he allegedly responded to a Facebook post offering him ""fast cash"" if he agreed to ""rent out"" his bank account. He was contacted by an unknown person who offered him RM1,600 (S$500) a month. Tan allegedly provided the Internet banking login username, password and OTP of his bank account. He is expected to plead guilty on Oct 10. Zhang is accused of one count of helping another person control the benefits of criminal conduct between November and December last year. According to the police statement, the Chinese national allegedly responded to a post from a website that offered him money to sell his bank account. The police said: ""He contacted an unknown person who offered him $900 in return for his bank account and prepaid SIM card."" Subsequently, he allegedly provided to the unknown person an ATM card with the personal identification number, information linked to his bank account, and prepaid SIM card. The court heard that Zhang intends to plead guilty on Oct 13. For each charge, those convicted of assisting another person to control benefits of criminal conduct can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined up to $500,000. Those convicted of cheating can be jailed for up to three years and fined for each charge."

The court heard that one of the men, Mohamed Alias, 40, might be handed one more charge in the future - that of harbouring an offender. Details about this potential charge were not disclosed in court. No additional charges will be handed to the second man, Mohamad Fazli Abdul Rahman, 38. They had told the court on Aug 5 that they intended to plead guilty to their charges. Both are in remand and their cases have been adjourned to Sept 16. Currently, each man faces two charges of assisting the escape of Singaporean Pi Jiapeng and his Thai wife Pansuk Siriwipa. According to court documents, Mohamed allegedly helped the couple unlawfully leave Singapore from Tuas Checkpoint at around 7.30pm on July 4 by allowing them to hide in the container compartment of a Malaysia-registered lorry. Fazli is accused of engaging in a conspiracy with him in arranging the alleged escape. Pi and Pansuk, both 27, left Singapore after they allegedly failed to deliver $32 million worth of goods to customers. Pi, who was born in Fujian province in China, was initially arrested by the Singapore police on June 27. His passport was impounded, and he was released on $15,000 bail the next day. Pansuk was assisting the police with investigations and had surrendered her passport on June 30. The couple became uncontactable and allegedly fled Singapore illegally on July 4. Arrest warrants and Interpol red notices were then issued against the couple. The Royal Thai Police told the police here that the duo were possibly staying in a Johor Bahru hotel. The police then asked their counterparts in Malaysia to locate the couple. The couple were arrested on Aug 11 and handed over to the police here that day. Pi and Pansuk first appeared in court on Aug 12, when they were each handed three charges - two for cheating and one of leaving Singapore illegally. They are accused of being involved in a conspiracy to cheat customers of Tradenation and Tradeluxury between January and June. The amounts said to be involved were not disclosed in court documents. The pair allegedly duped victims into believing they would be sold watches and luxury handbags but had no intention of delivering the items. Both were refused bail after a judge agreed with the prosecution that they were flight risks. The cases involving them have been adjourned for a pre-trial conference on Oct 11."

The 33-year-old will be charged on Friday with assisting another person to control the benefits of criminal conduct. He is among three men who will be charged for allegedly selling their bank account details that ended up being used to launder at least $370,000 derived from various scams involving at least eight victims, said the police in a release on Thursday. Another of them, a 22-year-old, had allegedly responded to a Facebook post in November last year promising fast cash if he agreed to rent out his bank account. He was contacted by an unknown person who offered him RM1,600 (S$498) a month in return for his bank account. The man allegedly provided the person the Internet banking login username, password and one-time password of his bank account. He will be charged with abetting unknown persons to gain unauthorised access to the bank's computer system. A 19-year-old also faces a similar charge. He had allegedly made a deal with an unknown person over Telegram to open bank accounts and hand over control of them in return for money. He also faces a cheating charge, after allegedly conning banks into opening two accounts and subsequently handing over the Internet banking login username, password and one-time password of both accounts to the unknown person. The police said it takes a serious stance against any person who may be involved in scams and perpetrators will be dealt with in accordance with the law. Said the police: ""To avoid being an accomplice in these crimes, members of the public should always reject seemingly attractive money-making opportunities promising fast and easy payouts for the use of their bank accounts, or for allowing their personal accounts to be used to receive and transfer money for others. ""Remember that you will be held accountable if these are linked to crimes."" The offence of unauthorised access to computer material carries a jail term of up to two years, a fine of up to $5,000 or both. Repeat offenders can get jailed for up to three years, fined up to $10,000 or both. Those convicted of assisting another to control benefits of criminal conduct can be jailed for up to 10 years, fined up to $500,000 or both. Those convicted of cheating can be jailed for up to three years, fined or both."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/thailand-legalising-cannabis-poses-more-challenges-to-spores-anti-drug-stance-shanmugam,Thailand legalising cannabis poses more challenges to S'pore's anti-drug stance: Shanmugam,"SINGAPORE - The easier access to cannabis in neighbouring countries will pose challenges to keeping Singapore drug-free, said Minister for Home Affairs and Law K. Shanmugam on Thursday. Thailand became the first country in Asia to decriminalise cannabis nationwide on June 9. Mr Shanmugam noted that within a week, the drug was everywhere: in drinks, food, toothpaste and cookies. ""The freer availability of cannabis in Thailand, to which a lot of Singaporeans go and from where a lot of tourists come to Singapore, is going to present more challenges,"" said Mr Shanmugam on Malaysian news channel Astro Awani. He noted how the authorities in Thailand had tried to rein in the effects of legalising cannabis but stressed the difficulties in policing and controlling its use. Mr Shanmugam was speaking during an interview with host Melisa Idris, who also asked how Malaysia's looking into legalising medical marijuana would impact Singapore. Mr Shanmugam said: ""If Malaysia legalises cannabis or other drugs, given the even greater flow of people between Malaysia and Singapore compared to Thailand and Singapore, of course, it will be more challenging from the law enforcement (angle) and trying to keep Singapore drug-free."" He stressed that research shows that the drug is addictive and can cause irreversible brain damage, brain shrinkage, and serious mental and psychiatric illnesses. Mr Shanmugam cited the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) saying that the East and South-east Asia region is ""literally swimming"" in methamphetamine, with more than one billion tablets seized in the region last year, and organised crime treating ""the region like a playground"". Due to the huge supply of methamphetamine in the region, the drug is becoming cheaper and more easily available, but Singapore's tough laws have kept the country safe. Asked about international criticism of Singapore's use of the death penalty, Mr Shanmugam pointed to the thousands of lives saved through the strict rules on drugs. He cited an Aug 25 Financial Times article that stated that all but three of Latin America's 21 mainland nations are now ""main countries of source or transit"" for cocaine, according to the UNODC. The 18 countries face big problems such as kidnappings and crime, said Mr Shanmugam, questioning who is looking at protecting the lives of victims of these crimes. In defending Singapore's strict approach to drugs, he cited a World Health Organisation (WHO) report from August last year that said 500,000 people die each year due to drug use. Mr Shanmugam also cited United States' Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data, which said 100,000 people in the US died last year due to drug overdose. He also said 80 babies were born every day with neonatal abstinence syndrome, which can cause the baby to be dependent on drugs at birth, which the CDC reported using data from 2017. Mr Shanmugam also cited another Financial Times report earlier this year that opioids have shaved one year off the average male life expectancy in the US. ""These are big numbers, but, you know, we focus on a few drug traffickers. But these hundreds of thousands of lives, are we not compassionate about them?"" said Mr Shanmugam. When Ms Idris asked if the Government would reconsider the mandatory death penalty in a similar way that Section 377A was reconsidered because attitudes had ""shifted appreciably"", Mr Shanmugam said the issues differed slightly. ""It's... a philosophical question when people think when the state should put someone to death - should it or should it not? And it's bound with other philosophical questions which have real-life consequences, like - can you put someone to capital punishment even if you're convinced that a larger number of lives will be saved?"" he added. Mr Shanmugam also noted that despite international outcry against the mandatory death penalty, Singapore's reputation has never been stronger in terms of people wanting to invest and move to Singapore. He said: ""Having looked at the facts, having looked at the data, I will say it is my duty to continue to try and persuade Singaporeans that having the death penalty works as a serious deterrent, and it keeps Singapore safe... ""Most importantly, it saves thousands of lives, and we don't descend into the state of chaos that a lot of other countries have descended into."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/3k-fine-for-east-ocean-teochew-restaurant-for-third-breach-of-covid-19-measures,$3k fine for East Ocean Teochew Restaurant for third breach of Covid-19 measures,"SINGAPORE - A popular restaurant at Ngee Ann City has been hit with a fine after it allowed a group of 11 guests from different households to dine together in January this year, flouting Covid-19 regulations that limited group sizes to five people. The Chinese New Year reunion gathering was found out three weeks later, when safe distancing enforcement officers inspected the establishment's bookings. On Thursday, East Ocean Teochew Restaurant was convicted of breaching Covid-19 measures and fined $3,000. The restaurant had flouted Covid-19 control orders on two previous occasions. At the time of the latest offence, group sizes for dining at restaurants were capped at five people as Singapore emerged from an outbreak caused by the Delta variant of the Covid-19 virus. The court heard that operations manager Lai Yoong Chong and his manager Ho Yan Min were in charge of the restaurant at the time of the dinner on Jan 31. The establishment occupies a unit on the fifth floor of Ngee Ann City. Deputy Public Prosecutor Cheng You Duen said that about three weeks after the dinner, a team of safe distancing enforcement officers from the Singapore Tourism Board inspected the restaurant and checked its reservations list. They spotted a booking by a customer Chang Pei Ching for a group of 11 customers seated across three tables. Investigations found that the customers were not from the same household. Mr Ho had accepted the reservation but he and Mr Lai did not check if the customers were from the same household before allowing them into the premises. Seeking a fine of at least $4,000, DPP Cheng said it was not the establishment's first time running afoul of Covid-19 measures. In 2021, it was fined $2,000 in July and $1,000 in February for similarly breaching pandemic measures."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/maximum-jail-and-fine-for-serial-protester-who-held-illegal-demonstration-at-us-embassy,"Maximum jail, fine for serial protester who held illegal demonstration at US Embassy ","SINGAPORE - For the ninth time in six years, a serial protester was dealt with in court for holding illegal demonstrations in public areas - 18 days after he was released from jail for similar offences. Singaporean Yan Jun, 46, was on Thursday jailed for 12 months and an additional 53 days as he had committed the offences during his remission order. He was also fined $5,000 but will serve an additional six months in jail as he is unable to pay the sum. Yan displayed placards in front of the United States Embassy in Napier Road on June 12, denouncing the governments of the US, Singapore and Canada, after notifying various authorities and media outlets about his plans to do so, the prosecution said. Yan, whose occupation was not mentioned, repeatedly shouted at the top of his voice despite being asked by police officers to calm down. He was later arrested, Deputy Public Prosecutor Sean Teh added. His protests mostly targeted political figures and the Singapore judiciary and dates back to at least 2016, when he was convicted of holding demonstrations outside the Istana and the US Embassy, according to court documents. He staged several protests in 2017 and used a loudhailer to yell at police officers from a distance for a prolonged time. He was also convicted of shouting in an officer's face. Yan has been jailed between three weeks and roughly a year and fined around $5,000 each time for his previous convictions. He spent additional time in jail as most of the fines were unpaid. DPP Teh, who sought a maximum penalty for Yan's offences, said: ""It is striking that this is the ninth occasion the accused is being convicted for similar offences within a short span of less than five years."" He added: ""The total sentences imposed (for) his previous convictions have had no deterrent effect on the accused."" He noted that the High Court had warned Yan in an earlier conviction that he would face a maximum punishment if he were to reoffend. The prosecutor said that Yan suffered from a delusional disorder that contributed to his offending, adding that Yan was not suitable for community rehabilitation due to his refusal to comply with treatment and lack of insight into his condition. A lengthy jail term gives Yan the best chance to break out of his cycle of offending and to receive structured treatment in prison, DPP Teh told the judge. DPP Teh said that Yan provided no defence to his charges during trial, instead making claims about the Government's involvement in scandals. On Thursday, Yan insisted the trial was unfair and said he would remain silent. When asked by District Judge Shawn Ho if he had a mitigation plea, he stayed silent, rocking side to side on his seat in the dock. After several prompts to hear his plea, Judge Ho took the prosecution's position on sentencing. For disorderly behaviour in a public place, a repeat offender can be jailed up to 12 months and fined a maximum of $5,000. Those who organise a public assembly without a valid permit can be fined up to $5,000."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/2-ex-directors-of-firm-linked-to-ponzi-scheme-convicted-of-carrying-on-fraudulent-business,2 ex-directors of firm linked to Ponzi scheme convicted of carrying on fraudulent business,"SINGAPORE - Two former directors of a firm linked to a Ponzi scheme were found guilty on Thursday of carrying on a fraudulent business, an offence under the Companies Act. At the time of the offences, Singaporean Iseli Rudolf James Maitland, 63, and Malaysian How Soo Feng, 48, were directors of The Gold Label (TGL), which sold gold to more than 2,000 customers under a ""buyback"" arrangement, bringing in revenue totalling more than $120 million. TGL has since wound up. In January this year, the third former director Wong Kwan Sing, then 50, was sentenced to two years and 10 months' jail after pleading guilty to an offence under the Companies Act. The court heard that Maitland and How were directors and shareholders of TGL from July 7, 2009, to Nov 15, 2010. In their submissions, Deputy Public Prosecutors Kevin Yong, Edwin Soh, Grace Teo and Ong Xin Jie said the firm had no investment activities and relied on sales of new contracts under the buyback scheme to repay its obligations under the older contracts. The cycle continued until TGL was unable to sell new contracts and the business broke down. Its payout and buyback obligations to clients came up to more than $85 million, while the company had just over $450,000 in its bank accounts as at Oct 7, 2010. The prosecutors told District Judge Ng Peng Hong that Maitland and How had profited handsomely from the fraudulent gold buyback business. More than $1.2 million in directors' fees had been paid between July 2009 and June 2010. The DPPs said: ""The more gold buyback contracts TGL sold, the more the accused persons earned... it is because of such personal greed that the accused persons continued with TGL's operations, despite the overwhelming evidence that they knew there was no profit-generating formula."" The Straits Times had reported in January that Wong, a Malaysian, who is also known as ""Gary"", had pocketed at least $598,000 from the scheme. Maitland was represented by lawyers Adrian Wee and Lynette Chang from Characterist law firm. Lawyers from Withers KhattarWong - Mr Shashi Nathan, Mr Jeremy Mark Pereira and Ms J. Jayaletchmi - represented How. During the trial, the pair had claimed that they were unaware that TGL was operating a financially unsustainable business. According to them, they had relied on Wong to run a ""formula which would magically generate sufficient profits"" for TGL to honour its payment obligations. Maitland and How had claimed that they did not know how this formula worked but left it entirely to Wong to run. The DPPs said: ""The accused persons' defence is disingenuous and totally without merit. There is a wealth of evidence which shows the accused persons must have known there was no formula generating profits for TGL."" For instance, the court heard that Maitland and How admitted they knew that the firm's business model involved money circulation. The pair also admitted they knew that TGL needed to invest the sales proceeds to generate returns but the firm did not conduct any investments, said the prosecutors. Their mitigation and sentencing will take place on Sept 12."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/29-million-fine-for-supplier-who-was-part-of-largest-syndicate-involving-duty-unpaid-alcohol,$2.9 million fine for supplier who was part of largest criminal operation involving duty unpaid alcohol,"SINGAPORE - When an alcohol supplier heard that others in the trade were siphoning off duty unpaid liquor to sell illegally, he struck a deal with them to sell his stock. For a fee, the syndicate helped Ng Yin Hon to cover up the sale of duty unpaid alcohol to his customers, evading some $500,000 in taxes. Ng, 35, was part of the largest and longest-running syndicated operation involving duty unpaid alcohol uncovered in Singapore, the court heard. The total amount of taxes evaded amounted to some $25 million. On Wednesday, Ng pleaded guilty to tax evasion and was fined $2.9 million. He will be jailed for 40 months if he does not pay the fine by Oct 24. The court heard that the syndicate sold liquor illegally here by diverting duty unpaid alcohol meant for consumption only on board vessels calling at Singapore, or in the territory permitted by Singapore Customs. Such alcohol is considered as exported and thus exempt from taxes, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Jordon Li. Without paying taxes, the syndicate would earn illegal profits by selling alcohol at much lower prices than other legitimate sellers, he added. The syndicate was formed in 2017 by Lim Wei Luen, now 41, and Teo Tian Soon, 56 - also known as Muhammad Ridwan Teo - who handled supplies for ships. They bought duty unpaid alcohol from suppliers who stored duty unpaid alcohol at licensed warehouses here to be sold to the vessels. The group then formed nine shell entities which were declared as exporters of alcohol. To forge the necessary permits, they paid a shipping agent to give them the details of the auxiliary police officers on duty, whose details were included in falsified permits to make it look genuine. They also paid off drivers to move the liquor to a holding warehouse, from which the syndicate delivered the duty unpaid alcohol to their buyers illegally. When Ng learnt in 2018 that Teo was illegally selling duty unpaid alcohol, he saw it as a chance to sell some stock to his customer Siva Reuben Sreetharan, 49, whose occupation was not mentioned in court documents. For a fee, Teo agreed to forge the permits to cover Ng's illegal sales. Over at least 60 occasions in 2019, Ng falsely declared some 40,000 bottles of liquor and nearly 100,000 cans of beer for export, despite knowing that they were meant to be delivered only to territories approved by Customs. It amounted to nearly $500,000 in taxes evaded, said DPP Li, who sought a fine of $2,990,018.10 for Ng. The offences came to light during a sting operation to catch the syndicate in November 2019 when Customs officers spotted a truck unloading duty unpaid alcohol at an unlicensed warehouse, leading to the arrests. Ng is among 12 people who have been taken to court for their involvement in the syndicate. Teo was earlier jailed for a year and fined $48 million, while Lim was fined $28 million."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/askst-did-joseph-schooling-get-off-lightly-why-is-mindef-involved-in-the-case,askST: Did Schooling get off lightly over cannabis use?,"SINGAPORE - National swimmer Joseph Schooling confessed to taking cannabis while he was overseas to train and compete in the Hanoi SEA Games in May. Schooling, 27, was then on short-term disruption from full-time national service. His urine test for controlled drugs returned negative. The swimmer will be put on a supervised urine test regime for six months by the Ministry of Defence (Mindef). Lawyers who have handled military court cases explain why Mindef is involved, the penalties the swimmer could have faced, and how the law works when someone tests positive for illicit substances at border crossings. A: Under the Misuse of Drugs Act, any Singapore citizen or permanent resident found to have abused controlled drugs overseas will be treated as if he had abused the drug in Singapore. The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) conducts enforcement checks at Singapore's checkpoints and has taken action against those found to have consumed drugs overseas. Consumption of any controlled drugs, including cannabis, heroin and methamphetamine, carries a jail term of between one year and 10 years, and may also include a fine of up to $20,000. It is also an offence for a person to possess any pipe, syringe, utensil, apparatus or other article intended for the smoking, administration or consumption of a controlled drug. This offence carries a jail term of up to three years, a fine of up to $10,000 or both. A: Under the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Act, full-time national servicemen (NSF) are subject to military law. Serious offenders can face a general court martial and less serious offenders may be dealt with by means of summary trials. Penalties include detention, reduction in rank, fines, discharge from service, and reprimand. Criminal lawyers The Straits Times spoke to said offences that fall under the Act, such as insubordination and misconduct in action, generally will not be referred to the civilian court. Drug cases will result in a court martial. Depending on the nature of the case, the matter may be referred to CNB. A: Under the SAF Act, every person subject to military law who consumes controlled drugs can be jailed in a military prison for up to five years. Schooling's urine test for illicit substances came back negative, which means the only evidence against him is his confession. Mindef said in its statement that those who are suspected of or have confessed to abusing drugs will be placed on an SAF-supervised urine test regime as part of the treatment and rehabilitation process. ""All SAF personnel who test positive during this regime will be charged and sentenced accordingly,"" it added. Lawyer Laurence Goh, the sole proprietor of Laurence Goh Eng Yau & Co, said: ""The way they (SAF) dealt with Schooling has nothing to do with favouritism. ""It's exactly the way they deal with everyone else."" Veteran criminal lawyer Amolat Singh said a confession without further evidence is unlikely to lead to a conviction. ""Because of the inherent difficulties in this case to actually charge him, either in a court martial or in the (State) Court, they've put him on this screening regime, which is not unusual for military or civilian cases. ""A lot of civilians who are caught consuming drugs for the first time are normally not thrown in jail."" Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam reiterated on Thursday (Sept 1) that while Singapore is tough on drug traffickers, since 2019 the approach for drug abusers has been to rehabilitate them. “People might have taken drugs, years ago, or months ago. We don’t send people to DRC (drug rehabilitation centre), or even give warnings, in the absence of current drug-taking/positive test.”
  A: The court martial, which is a judicial court for trying members of the SAF, handles military cases involving serious offences. Mr Singh said: ""If (Schooling's urine test) had been positive, then I'm very sure there would have been no compromises, no leniency, and he would have been meted out the standard nine months' sentence which the court martial imposes on all first-time drug abusers."" For civilians, first-time abusers who are unlikely to take drugs again can be given an enhanced direct supervision order. This is a non-custodial supervision order with compulsory counselling, instead of going through a drug rehabilitation centre regime. They will be placed under supervision for five years during which they would have to report to CNB for urine or hair testing. A: Mr Rajan Supramaniam from Regent Law said Schooling is unlikely to have a criminal record as his urine test was negative. Under the civilian criminal justice system, in cases where the urine test comes back positive, a person found guilty of drug consumption may end up with a registerable offence. Mr Singh added that the military urine testing regime could entail surprise checks for the NSF at any time of the day. A: The military court has its own jurisdiction with military prosecutors. Accused persons can hire their own defence lawyers or get an officer, who may not be a trained lawyer, to represent them in court. Mr Singh told ST that officers who may be assigned to defend an accused person go through legal training, which he has helped to run. Like the criminal justice system for civilians, defence counsels will argue mitigating factors including the circumstances of the offence and whether the accused shows genuine remorse. The lawyers said that if convicted, a confession would be a significant mitigating factor because it shows genuine remorse and a good chance of reform through rehabilitative efforts."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/ex-director-fined-558000-for-falsifying-statements-on-export-certificates-customs,"Ex-director fined $558,000 for falsifying statements on export certificates: Customs","SINGAPORE - A 41-year-old former director was slapped with a $558,000 fine for faking statements on the export of some $9.72 million worth of goods, in order to benefit from preferential tariff treatment. In a statement on Tuesday, the Singapore Customs said Solaiyappan Ramanathan pleaded guilty to two charges under the Regulation of Imports and Exports Regulations on Monday. Another six charges were taken into consideration during sentencing. Solaiyappan, a Singapore permanent resident, held a directorship at Feccuni Singapore and was the sole proprietor of Shakambri Overseas. He set up these companies to trade in scrap metals and other metal products sourced from local and overseas suppliers. From August 2017 to April 2019, he imported scrap metals from China and re-exported them from Singapore to India. He applied for 137 preferential certificates of origin (PCOs) for the export of the goods to India. These certificates offer preferential tariff treatment under the India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement and Asean-India free trade in goods agreement. Singapore Customs began investigating Solaiyappan after it received information alleging that Feccuni had issued false statements about the country of origin of the scrap metals in the PCOs. The statement added that the scrap metal was from China, but Solaiyappan had falsely stated on the PCOs that they were from Singapore, knowing that the preferential tariff would apply only for goods manufactured or wholly obtained in Singapore. Customs also revealed that Solaiyappan had been approached by a Malaysian to use Feccuni as an exporter for shipping scrap metals to India. In return, Feccuni would earn commission for every PCO applied. This was done as buyers in India had expressed interest in the preferential tariff treatment. While his company was not involved in any transaction between the Malaysian and the Indian buyers, Solaiyappan created invoices bearing Feccuni's name and submitted them for PCO applications. This, the statement said, was done to give the impression that the scrap metals sold by Feccuni were of Singapore origin instead of China. Under the Regulation of Imports and Exports Regulations, any person found guilty of providing false statements to the issuing authority to obtain preferential tariff treatments can be jailed for two years, or be fined the higher of a sum of up to $100,000, or three times the value of the goods involved, or both."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/jail-for-offender-who-helped-man-obtain-bank-loan-by-submitting-forged-payslips,Jail for offender who helped man obtain bank loan by submitting forged payslips,"SINGAPORE - A man gave his friend forged payslips, which were later used to unlawfully obtain a loan of nearly $13,000 from Citibank. Ng Jia Hao, 26, was sentenced to nine months' jail on Wednesday (Aug 31) after he admitted to engaging in a conspiracy with at least three other men to cheat the bank. Two of his accomplices have been dealt with in court. One of them, Kurumoorthy Chandran, also known as Kelvin, was a contract worker at Citibank at the time of the offences. He was sentenced to a year's jail in July. In an earlier statement, the bank said he had not been working on Citibank-related matters since 2019. The second accomplice was Ng's friend, Eugene Yap Siang, 28, who was sentenced to eight months' jail on Aug 8. The case involving a third man, Noah Loo Yu Hong, 28, is pending. Between September and October 2018, Citibank received and approved about 20 loan applications that were later found to contain forged income documents. Ng is the latest offender linked to the scam to be dealt with in court. On Monday, Kiran Kaur, 29, was sentenced to six months' jail over her role in the ruse. For the current case, Deputy Public Prosecutor Foong Ke Hui said Ng told Yap in 2018 that he could help him obtain a bank loan even if he did not meet the minimum income requirement. Ng also asked Yap if he had any friends who would be interested. He offered Yap a commission if he managed to get his friends to obtain such loans. On Sept 14 that year, Yap sent Loo a text message to ask if he would be interested in getting a bank loan. Loo agreed and gave Yap his full name to forward to Ng. Some time before Sept 26, 2018, Ng obtained two forged payslips from an unknown person and handed them to Yap. The payslips stated that Loo was working for another bank, with a salary of $6,350 for August and September that year. DPP Foong said: ""The accused told Eugene to hand the forged payslips to Noah. He also told Eugene to advise Noah to take the forged payslips and use them to apply for a loan from Citibank at the Ion Orchard branch. ""The accused told Eugene to advise Noah to look for an... officer at that branch named Kelvin."" After receiving the information from Yap, Loo went to Citibank's Ion Orchard branch and gave the forged payslips to Kurumoorthy, who helped him fill up a Citibank loan application form. The application, dated Sept 26, 2018, was submitted to Citibank, which was duped into approving a loan of nearly $13,000. DPP Foong said Ng then informed Loo to collect the loan amount from Citibank's MacDonald House branch and meet him. Loo also agreed to give Ng 25 per cent of the loan amount. After collecting the money on Sept 27, 2018, Loo met Ng nearby and gave him around $2,000. Loo also gave Yap $1,100, the court heard. Loo has since made full restitution to Citibank. Ng's bail was set at $10,000 on Wednesday and he is expected to surrender himself at the State Courts on Sept 5 to begin serving his sentence."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/5-years-jail-for-man-behind-largest-e-commerce-fraud-by-an-individual-in-singapore,5 years' jail for man behind 'largest e-commerce fraud by an individual' in Singapore,"SINGAPORE - A serial conman cheated 396 victims on online marketplace Carousell over 18 months, resulting in losses totalling $108,693. The prosecution said Caine Poh Zhenlong's case involved the largest scale of e-commerce fraud committed by an individual to date in Singapore. On Wednesday (Aug 31), Poh was sentenced to five years' jail and a fine of $17,000 after he pleaded guilty to two counts of cheating involving more than $87,000 and five charges involving unlawful gambling activities. Another nine charges, including one count of cheating involving some $21,000, were considered during sentencing. Poh will spend an additional 10 weeks behind bars if he is unable to pay the fine. The court heard that Poh came across news articles in 2018 on victims who had been cheated on Carousell. He decided to commit similar offences and registered multiple Carousell accounts. As the registration process for a Carousell account required a mobile phone number, Poh posted on multiple Facebook groups to ask if anyone needed a job. After receiving responses, he told the jobseekers that he needed their mobile phone numbers, which he then used to register the Carousell accounts. He also asked the jobseekers for the one-time-password that was sent to their devices to register the accounts. Poh then told the jobseekers to wait for his response but did not get back to any of them. To carry out his scam, Poh posted advertisements on Carousell purporting to sell various products. Most of them were tickets to attractions, particularly Universal Studios Singapore as he had noticed many people were looking to buy them on the platform. Between Jan 1 and Dec 28, 2019, Poh duped multiple victims into believing he had items for sale, resulting in them transferring more than $76,000 to various bank accounts. Deputy Public Prosecutor Ng Shao Yan told the court: ""As part of his deception, the accused sent some of the victims fake tickets by e-mail. He created these tickets by retrieving images of the tickets from the Internet and editing the ticket details. ""Thereafter, he sent the edited tickets to the victims and informed them that they were valid e-tickets."" After deceiving his victims, Poh instructed them to transfer money to bank accounts belonging to online casinos which he frequented. He then gambled with the money and transferred his winnings to bank accounts belonging to his mother and late father, which he had full control of. Using a similar method, Poh cheated more victims of over $11,000 between Jan 1 and June 14, 2020. The police received numerous reports about the offences. Poh was caught in a surprise raid at his home on June 16, 2020. Defence lawyer S. Balamurugan told the court on Wednesday that his client cheated his victims to fuel his gambling habit. Citing a medical report, he said Poh has a severe gambling disorder, which contributed to his offences. Arguing against the defence's assertion, DPP Ng said: ""As stated in the report, his cheating offences provided 'means to enable him to have a chance to gamble and win'. This would not qualify as a direct causal link to his cheating offences."" Poh has not made any restitution to his victims. For each count of cheating, an offender can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/fine-for-officer-who-raised-road-barrier-at-istana-without-checking-leading-to-collision,Security officer fined for causing Istana collision injuring MFA perm sec during Kamala Harris visit,"SINGAPORE - A Certis Cisco auxiliary police officer raised the security barriers along a road in the Istana without checking if there was a car approaching - causing an accident on the morning of the visit of US Vice-President Kamala Harris. A car carrying Mr Chee Wee Kiong, the Permanent Secretary for Foreign Affairs at the time, then crashed into the barriers, called bollards. Mr Chee and the driver of the car suffered multiple fractures. The permanent secretary was hospitalised for two days with injuries including a sternum and tooth fracture. The officer, Tan Chee Kiat, 29, was fined $2,500 after pleading guilty on Wednesday to causing hurt through a negligent act. The court heard that Tan was deployed at a security post in Edinburgh Road - located within the Istana - and was tasked to operate the control panel for the ground bollards mounted along the road. When activated, the bollards, which are about waist-high, would come out from the ground and block vehicles from passing. On Aug 23 last year, a car driven by Mr Abdul Latif Karim approached the security post and received clearance to enter Edinburgh Road, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Jaime Pang.  Ms Harris visited the Istana that day as part of her trip here from Aug 22 to 24 last year.  At 9.15am, Tan raised the bollards without checking if the car had passed through. Mr Latif, who was driving the car at around 10kmh, noticed the bollards being raised but was unable to stop in time, leading to a collision, said DPP Pang. Mr Latif and Mr Chee, who was in the front passenger seat, were hurt and taken to Raffles Hospital for treatment. Mr Latif, who had a sternum fracture and left knee contusion, was discharged the next day. Investigations found that Tan, as the operator of the bollards, was required to look out for vehicles when raising the barriers. DPP Pang, who sought a fine for Tan, said: ""When he activated the bollards, the accused had failed to conduct such a visual inspection and assumed that the car had passed the bollards, thus resulting in the collision."" She added: ""Raising the bollards without checking was an act which was so negligent as to endanger the personal safety of others."" Defence lawyer Wee Qianliang told the court that Tan was fired after the incident and is currently unemployed. He added the control panel was positioned such that Tan's back would be facing the road where the cars travelled. Tan immediately offered to help the victims and had written apology letters to them. He said Tan had received multiple commendations in the past for his performance at work and intends to find a job after the case concludes. Both victims have fully recovered from their injuries, said Mr Wee, adding that Tan was remorseful."

The police said on Wednesday that cases of outrage of modesty increased by 4.6 per cent to 773 from January to June this year, up from 739 cases in the same period last year. Cases where the culprits were known to the victims saw a rise of 9.6 per cent to 489, up from 446 in the first half of last year. Meanwhile, cases involving offenders unknown to the victims dipped slightly by 3.1 per cent to 284, from 293 in the first six months of 2021. ""The number of outrage of modesty cases occurring within the public transport system, including public transportation nodes and on public transport, remains a concern,"" said the police on Wednesday. The police added that 63.8 per cent of outrage of modesty incidents, committed on public transport by those not known to their victims, targeted individuals aged between 13 and 29. According to mid-year crime statistics released on Monday, 80 outrage of modesty cases happened on public transport in the first half of the year. The police said closed-circuit television cameras, as well as vital information provided by the victims such as descriptions of the suspects, their clothing and distinctive facial features, helped to solve many of the cases. The police gave the example of a case that took place in April this year. A 27-year-old woman reported she had been molested by a man she did not know at Woodlands Avenue 6. She provided a detailed description of the man and the police trawled through footage captured by police cameras in the area, eventually establishing the identity of the man. The 40-year-old offender was arrested by officers from Woodlands Police Division within three days of the report. He was charged with outrage of modesty and sentenced to four weeks' jail in May. Those found guilty of outrage of modesty may be jailed for up to three years, fined, caned or receive any combination of such punishments. If the victim is under 14 years of age, the offence carries a jail term of up to five years, a fine, caning, or any combination of the punishments. The police said it would launch a public education video about outrage of modesty at Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) stations in October and will continue to work with public transport operators and partners, including the National Crime Prevention Council, to raise awareness about this issue. ""Outrage of modesty cases remain a key concern for the police. (We) have zero tolerance towards sexual offenders who threaten the personal safety of the community and offenders will be dealt with sternly in accordance with the law,"" said the police on Wednesday. The police urged victims of outrage of modesty to step forward and report the crime, adding: ""(We) adopt a victim-centric approach for sexual crime investigations and victims will be handled sensitively during the investigation process."" The police also listed the following crime prevention tips for the public: - Be alert and attentive to your surroundings, especially when you are in a crowded and confined space or alone with a stranger who moves very near to you. - If someone rushes into the lift at the last minute and you are alone, it is safer to step out and take the next one. - If someone is following you, head to a crowded area. If someone moves uncomfortably close to you (for example, someone deliberately sits next to you in a bus or train), move away if possible."

Responding to queries from The Straits Times, the police said they were alerted to the incident in Bukit Batok Street 41 at about 12.40am, and the man is being investigated for the offence of voluntarily causing hurt. Security officer Afinde Mohamad, 55, said he was making the rounds with a fellow officer past midnight when a stranger allegedly attacked him after he entered the lift on the ground floor. ""He scolded me but I didn't know what he was saying,"" said Mr Afinde, adding that the man appeared to be drunk and ""not normal"". In closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage seen by ST, the man gesticulates and speaks to Mr Afinde before grabbing his head and shoving him. As Mr Afinde attempts to fend off the blows, the attacker is seen slapping him. Another CCTV clip shows the security officers leaving the lift when it arrives on the third floor. The attacker then exits the lift, slaps Mr Afinde, grabs him by the neck and pushes him again. ""I still feel pain in my back and head. But it's better now after taking painkillers. This is the first time I've been attacked on the job,"" said Mr Afinde, who has been a security officer for about five years. He was given three days of sick leave. Mr Eric Goh, senior manager of operations at Formteam Consultancy where Mr Afinde is employed, said the company will help take care of his needs and salary while he recovers. Mr Goh said Mr Afinde is a very efficient officer, and that he has not received any complaints about Mr Afinde over the past few years. By the time police arrived at the scene, the assailant had disappeared, said Union of Security Employees (USE) executive secretary Steve Tan, noting that the man is believed to be a resident. In a Facebook post on Tuesday (Aug 30), USE said it has filed a police report against the assailant. It has also given some vouchers to Mr Afinde, who is its member. USE has handled 25 cases of abuse involving security staff so far this year, up from nine cases for the whole of last year, said Mr Tan. He said he is concerned about the growing number of such cases. ""Cases like these are really unnecessary, unprovoked, and something that we find quite abhorrent,"" he added. USE said in its Facebook post: ""Our officers carry out important duties as provided for under the law. We seek the support from the public to help ensure a safe environment for them to work in. We urge anyone who spots abuse of our officers to report them to us through our mobile app or e-mail use@ntuc.org.sg."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/jail-for-woman-who-tricked-18-investors-into-putting-in-22m-in-her-ponzi-scheme,Jail for woman who tricked 18 investors into putting $2.2m in her Ponzi scheme,"SINGAPORE - Lured by the promise of 5 per cent returns, 18 investors put in a total of $2.2 million into what turned out to be a Ponzi scheme. Some had doubled down on their investment after they received repayments on their supposed returns - but these were just done by the perpetrator to create a false sense of security. The victims lost up to $300,000 each, as Wan Lai Kuan, 34, never planned to come true on the deals. On Tuesday (Aug 30), Wan was jailed for five years and nine months after she pleaded guilty to six counts of cheating. Another 12 cheating charges and one charge over the running of a fund management business without a valid licence were taken into consideration during sentencing. The court heard that in 2014, Wan and two partners Chan Xuan Feng and Ang Shi Yi set up Skycastle Capital, a business dealing with fund management from foreign exchange trading for profit. Wan's role was to conduct trading for clients, while Chan managed the firm and referred investors to Skycastle, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Lee Wei Liang. For reasons not mentioned in court, both partners left the firm by June 2015. Chan continued to refer investors to Wan even after he left and was paid for it. From 2015, Wan reached out to old acquaintances, pitching an investment opportunity that promised a 5 per cent monthly return on their invested sum. She received between $3,000 and $720,000 from each investor. In turn, some of them told others about the investment opportunity and referred them to Wan. To create a false sense of security, she prepared written contracts and made several repayments to the investors to trick them into thinking they were receiving genuine investment returns. This prompted some of them increase their investments, handing her more funds. But none of this money came from genuine investment returns, said DPP Lee, adding that Wan never intended to manage the investment portfolios for her clients and had no intention of fulfilling her contracts. Between March 2017 and October 2018, 10 investors lodged police reports against Skycastle over its failure to pay them their investment returns, prompting the police to investigate. It was found that Wan cheated 18 investors into investing $2,219,000 through the Ponzi scheme. She spent almost $1.2 million on personal expenses, such as to run her cafe, settle loans, and pay for the daily expenses of her mother and former boyfriend Marcus Seah Wei Liang. Seeking between 70 months and 76 months' jail for Wan, the DPP said she had taken deliberate steps to prolong the scheme and lured investors to hand her more funds by luring them into a false sense of security. He added that the repayments made cannot be regarded as restitution as they were made to induce more investments. Chan was not aware of Wan's cheating, but was fined in April this year for illegally carrying on business at Skycastle without a licence, said DPP Lee. Skycastle has since been renamed ASDF, at which Wan remains a partner, said the DPP. Those found guilty of cheating can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/jail-for-ns-defaulter-who-remained-outside-spore-without-valid-exit-permit-for-over-4-years,Jail for NS defaulter who remained outside S'pore without valid exit permit for over 4 years,"SINGAPORE - A man defaulted on his national service in Singapore for more than four years. Tsai Yi-Hsuan, 25, who unlawfully remained outside Singapore without a valid exit permit, was on Tuesday (Aug 30) sentenced to nine weeks' jail after he pleaded guilty to three charges under the Enlistment Act. The court heard that he was a Taiwanese when his Singaporean mother registered him as a Singapore citizen in 1998, a year after he was born. Defence lawyers Adrian Wee, Rachel Soh and Lynette Chang stated in court documents that Tsai was even liable for service in the Taiwan military, but his service there was waived in 2015 on medical grounds. But he still had to undergo NS in Singapore but defaulted on his duties here for a total of four years, seven months and 18 days. He is no longer Taiwanese and enlisted into full-time NS with the Singapore Armed Forces in April 2020. His lawyers said he became an operationally ready NSman on April 2 this year. The court heard that as a teenager, Tsai, who was born in Taiwan and has a Taiwanese father, knew he had to return to Singapore to serve his NS. He received his registration notice and came to Singapore on May 30, 2014, to register for NS and collect his Singapore identity card. He reported to the Central Manpower Base (CMPB) four days later and was reminded to apply for a valid exit permit to remain outside Singapore. Despite this, he left Singapore on June 5, 2014, without obtaining one. Two weeks later, Tsai's mother sent CMPB an e-mail to submit documents for his deferment from NS for his studies overseas. It replied on June 20, 2014, asking for further documentation, but did not receive a response from her. Tsai returned to Singapore on Sept 19 that year to attend his grandfather's funeral and left for Taiwan five days later. He remained outside Singapore without a valid exit permit and later failed to report for his medical screening here in November that year. Tsai returned to Singapore on April 2, 2018, to perform some rites at his grandmother's tomb and left for Taiwan eight days later. He remained outside Singapore yet again without a valid exit permit before returning here on Feb 7, 2019. He reported to the CMPB the next day and finally enlisted on April 3, 2020. In mitigation, his lawyers said that Tsai was raised in Taiwan and completed his formal education there, and that he currently holds a degree in chemical and material engineering. They added: ""Our client made the difficult decision of leaving his family and Taiwan, the country he grew up in. Our client now lives in Singapore without the benefit of family support."" He has been living alone in a rented room here for the past two years, they said."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-director-of-hdb-pleads-guilty-to-filming-nude-men-in-changing-rooms,Former HDB director admits to secretly filming 'attractive' men,"SINGAPORE - A former director with the Housing Board loitered in communal changing rooms in gyms and public areas on multiple occasions to film nude men with his phone. The crimes came to light after Leo Norman Chee Wei Kiong, 61, was caught in a supermarket in 2020 as he was trying to film an ""attractive"" man there. The man noticed Chee's camera pointing at him and confronted him. The police were alerted and later found 146 obscene videos - excluding those he had filmed - on Chee's phone. On Tuesday (Aug 30), Chee pleaded guilty to six charges for offences that include the filming of obscene footage and possession of obscene films. Another eight similar charges will be taken into consideration during his sentencing on Sept 9. The court heard that Chee worked as a civil servant for more than 35 years and reached a high rank in a statutory board. The Straits Times understands that Chee was a housing finance director at HDB. Deputy Public Prosecutor Colin Ng listed in court multiple instances since 2012 where Chee filmed videos of men undressed. On one occasion in December 2018, Chee recorded a 25-second video of an unknown man who was naked in the men's locker room at Safra Mount Faber. In January 2013, he took five pictures of another nude man in a locker room at an unspecified Safra clubhouse. On two occasions in 2017 and 2019, Chee recorded a minute-long video of a man named Billy while they were at Chee's apartment. Billy was unclothed in both videos which were filmed for Chee's personal gratification, said the DPP. Chee was caught in October 2020, when he noticed a man, who he thought was attractive, at a FairPrice supermarket in Kallang Bahru and filmed him on his phone. The man saw Chee and confronted him. A supermarket employee called the police. Chee admitted to filming the video of the man and agreed to delete it. As the man inspected Chee's phone to ensure the footage was removed, he saw several obscene videos of naked men and told the police, who seized the phone. DPP Ng said: ""(Chee) admitted to having a habit of using his mobile phone to film and take pictures of men he considered attractive. This took place in public places, gyms, and the communal changing rooms of gyms."" Chee also admitted to possessing 146 sexually explicit videos and photographs taken from the Internet for his own consumption, said the DPP. Seeking two to three week's jail and a fine of up to $2,000, DPP Ng said that Chee had filmed men who were unaware. He noted that while Chee did not circulate the videos, there was a risk of accidental or intentional dissemination. Defence lawyer Shashi Nathan, who sought no more than a week's jail for Chee, said that his client was a high-ranking civil servant but had resigned in order to spare the statutory board any embarrassment. Mr Shashi said: ""It was a painful decision as he gave up his career and everything although he wasn't convicted yet. It shows the kind of person he is."" He asked District Judge Kessler Soh for compassion so that Chee can resume living his life again and look after his mother who is unwell. Judge Soh said he needed more time to consider the verdict, adding that he was more persuaded by the prosecution's argument. He extended Chee's bail and adjourned the case to Sept 9."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/lawyer-eugene-thuraisingam-fined-4000-for-breaching-a-gag-order,"Lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam fined $4,000 for breaching a gag order","SINGAPORE - Veteran criminal lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam, 47, was fined $4,000 in a district court on Tuesday (Aug 30) for breaching a gag order, an offence under the State Courts Act. A second charge under the same Act was considered during sentencing. The lawyer, who has his own practice, had asked his associate Johannes Hadi, 32, to distribute transcripts to the press that were likely to lead to the identification of a complainant - a woman who had accused a doctor of molestation.  The two lawyers were part of a team that had represented Dr Yeo Sow Nam, then 52. All details that could lead to the identity of Dr Yeo's accuser cannot be revealed due to a gag order, as she could be a victim of a sexual crime. After a trial, Dr Yeo was given a discharge amounting to an acquittal in August last year. This means he cannot be charged again with the same offences. Both Thuraisingam and Hadi were handed charges under the State Courts Act in April. Hadi's case is pending. For the current case, Deputy Public Prosecutor Sivakumar Ramasamy told the court on Tuesday that on March 5 last year, Thuraisingam asked the judge handling the molestation case for permission to distribute the trial transcripts to members of the media. The proceedings were held in camera at the time. This means they were not open to the public, including members of the media. The judge then granted the application on the basis that Thuraisingam would make the necessary redactions and that there would be no breach of the gag order. On March 16 last year, Thuraisingam told Hadi via e-mail: “(Please) remember to black out (the complainant’s) name and remind the press that they cannot print (the complainant’s) name.” However, Thuraisingam did not instruct Hadi to redact all the other information that could likely lead to the woman being identified. The DPP said that Hadi then redacted only her name from the transcripts and e-mailed them to members of the media. During a pre-trial conference behind closed doors about three months later, the prosecution applied to withdraw the charges against Dr Yeo. Thuraisingam then indicated that he would be applying for the gag order to be lifted. Some time between Aug 4 and 11 last year, he instructed Hadi to distribute to members of the media the transcripts of the trial and their law firm’s written submissions for the gag order lifting application. However, Thuraisingam did not instruct Hadi to redact all the information that could lead to the revelation of the  woman’s identity. Hadi e-mailed the documents to members of the media - including those from Singapore Press Holdings and Mediacorp- on Aug 11 last year, with only her name redacted. Other information that could lead to her identity being revealed such as her age, her current employer, and her occupation at the time of the alleged acts of molestation, were not redacted. On Aug 16 last year, the court granted the prosecution’s application to withdraw the charges against Dr Yeo.  Thuraisingam also withdrew the gag order lifting application that day and said then: “If the prosecution says that it’s necessary to protect the alleged complainant’s identity, we take no position.” On Tuesday, the DPP asked for Thuraisingam to be given a fine of at least $4,000, adding that he had instructed Hadi - his most junior lawyer on the defence team - to redact only the woman’s name. Defence lawyer Jerrie Tan from K&L Gates Straits Law said that Thuraisingam accepted the prosecution’s submission that he should be fined at least $4,000. Ms Tan said her client has been a practising lawyer for around 21 years and a large part of his legal practice involves defending poor accused persons facing the death penalty.  She told the court that he does this on a pro bono basis and has obtained acquittals in a number of cases. Ms Tan added: ""In 2016, Mr Thuraisingam received the Legal Assistance Scheme for Capital Offences award from the Honourable Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon for his work in defending accused persons in capital cases. ""In 2021, the Singapore Law Society Pro Bono Ambassador award was presented to him."" In the molestation case, Dr Yeo had been accused of molesting a woman on the 12th storey of Mount Elizabeth Hospital on the evening of Oct 9, 2017. After the trial, the prosecution applied in August last year to withdraw the four counts of molestation that Dr Yeo was facing. District Judge Ng Peng Hong then gave him a discharge amounting to an acquittal. The Attorney-General's Chambers later said that it would not be taking action against the woman."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/shell-bukom-heist-2-more-surveyors-jailed-for-accepting-bribes-to-conceal-gas-oil-theft,Shell Bukom heist: 2 more surveyors jailed for accepting bribes to conceal gas oil theft,"SINGAPORE - Two surveyors who accepted bribes to misreport the theft of gas oil as part of a massive heist to steal oil from Shell's manufacturing site on Pulau Bukom have been jailed. With their help, multiple incidents of gas oil theft worth up to $2.5 million went undetected between 2016 and 2017. The pair showed up separately in court on Monday (Aug 29) and pleaded guilty to corruption. A. Duraisamy, 60, was jailed for 10 months and fined $42,870.60. He will remain in jail for an additional seven weeks as he is unable to pay the fine. Lee Been Lian, 58, was jailed for two months and fined $6,795. He will also remain in jail for 19 more days as the fine was not paid. At least 26 people have been hauled to court over this conspiracy, which was first noticed by Shell in 2015 when it observed significant unidentified oil loss at Pulau Bukom. The court heard that Duraisamy and Lee worked for firms that helped to inspect the quantity of cargo, such as gas oil, supplied to vessels in Singapore by Shell. Once the inspections were done, the surveyors would submit reports on the amount of cargo loaded onto the vessels and hand them to their employer and Shell, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Norman Yew. The duo were drawn into a conspiracy to steal gas oil from Shell's largest production plant in the Asia-Pacific region on Pulau Bukom. The heist was said to have been masterminded by former Shell employees Juandi Pungot, Muzaffar Ali Khan Muhamad Akram and Richard Goh Chee Keong, who bribed surveyors to hide the theft of oil. Juandi was on March 31 jailed for 29 years for his role in masterminding the misappropriation of more than 200,000 tonnes of gas oil worth $128 million. This was one of the longest prison sentences for a commercial crime. Muzaffar's and Goh's cases are still before the courts. Between 2013 and 2017, Duraisamy accepted around $25,000 in bribes from the masterminds to turn a blind eye to the theft of oil while he was employed by Intertek Testing Services and Inspectorate Singapore. He worked with colleagues, who have also been hauled to court, to conceal the theft of oil and split the bribe money with them. With Duraisamy's help, three incidents of misappropriation of Shell gas oil worth US$1.8 million (S$2.5 million) went undetected in 2016 and 2017. In 2017, Lee was similarly roped into the conspiracy when his colleague Erwin Suhardi Jamaluddin - who was jailed in July this year - offered him a cut of the bribe money to misreport the theft of oil. Lee received US$5,000 through Erwin, and his actions helped to conceal an incident of gas oil theft worth US$1.2 million. The maximum penalty for corruption is a $100,000 fine and five years in jail."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/friends-of-man-killed-by-father-in-law-lose-lawsuit-for-a-share-in-46m-holland-village-property,Friends of man killed by father-in-law lose lawsuit for a share in $4.6m Holland Village property,"SINGAPORE - The High Court on Monday (Aug 29) dismissed a lawsuit brought by two friends of businessman Spencer Tuppani, who was fatally stabbed by his father-in-law in 2017, for a share of a $4.6 million Holland Village property. Mr Jason Er Kok Yong, 42, and Mr Lawrence Lim Soon Hwa, 46, claimed that they each own a one-third share of the property that was registered in Mr Tuppani's sole name. They claimed the three of them agreed to each contribute $535,200 in cash towards the purchase of the Lorong Mambong property that was tenanted to well-known pub Wala Wala Cafe Bar. The suit was filed against the administrators of Mr Tuppani's estate - his widow Shyller Tan Cheng Cheng, her sister Sherry Tan San San and Mr Tuppani's first wife Felicia Keh Lay Hong. Justice Mavis Chionh found various aspects of Mr Er and Mr Lim's evidence to be ""full of gaps"", ""riddled with inconsistencies"" and ""highly suspicious"". Mr Er and Mr Lim had relied on a trust deed, prepared by Mr Tuppani's lawyer in May 2017, in which Mr Tuppani declared that he held a two-thirds share in the property on trust for the duo. The deed was never signed by Mr Tuppani, who died on July 10, 2017. Justice Chionh said the deed by itself was not credible evidence of a common intention for the three men to jointly own the property and for Mr Tuppani to hold Mr Er and Mr Lim's shares on trust for them. The judge agreed with the defendants that Mr Tuppani had asked his lawyer to draft the trust deed in the light of his impending divorce, and the anticipated fight over the division of assets. It emerged from WhatsApp messages between Mr Tuppani and his lawyer that Mr Tuppani had wanted a trust deed prepared so that he could ""show Shyller"" that the Lorong Mambong property was ""theirs not mine"", the judge said. Mr Er and Mr Lim also claimed that the trio had discussed the property purchase in their WhatsApp chat group, but could not produce the chats, which the judge said was highly suspicious. The pair claimed they deleted the chat group within weeks of Mr Tuppani's death because they felt ""sad"" seeing it. ""I found the plaintiffs' attempts to explain its unavailability to be shifty and wholly lacking in credibility,"" said Justice Chionh. The judge also had grave doubts as to whether each man had in fact paid $535,200. ""I found the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs of their alleged financial contributions to be riddled with inconsistencies and unexplained gaps and generally lacking in credibility,"" she said. Justice Chionh also dismissed a separate suit filed by Mr Er, claiming sole ownership of a $566,000 BMW M6 that was bought in Mr Tuppani's name. She found his case - that there was a common intention for Mr Tuppani to hold the car on trust for him - to be ""incoherent, internally inconsistent and frankly unbelievable"". Justice Chionh also dismissed a counterclaim brought by the defendants against Mr Er for $1.1 million that Mr Tuppani paid him from August 2014 to May 2017. She said the six-year limitation period has passed in respect of payments made in 2014. As for the other payments, the defendants failed to produce evidence that Mr Er owed them a duty to account for the money. Mr Tuppani, 38, was fatally stabbed by his father-in-law, Tan Nam Seng, on July 10, 2017, in Boon Tat Street. Tan, 74, is serving an 8½-year jail term for the killing. He was upset over how Mr Tuppani had treated his daughter, Ms Shyller Tan. He also believed that his son-in-law had cheated him of his shipping business."

Over 5.1 million SMSes have also been reported on the app, which was launched in November 2020 to reduce opportunities for scammers to contact potential victims. The app, managed by the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) and the Singapore Police Force, has been downloaded by 300,500 users of iOS devices. More Singaporeans will be able to download the app when it is released on Android devices next month. The app identifies and filters out scam messages and blocks calls from phone numbers that are verified as scam-related, said the police. Apart from reporting scam messages, users will also receive alerts on trending scam tactics. Separately, a revamped quiz to educate retail bank customers on various scams such as bank phishing, investment and job scams, which are among the top 10 scams of concern for the first half of this year, was rolled out on Monday. A total of $227.8 million was lost to the top 10 scams in the first six months of the year, up from the $142.5 million in the same period last year. Job scams have been the leading scam so far this year, with over 3,500 cases reported and more than $58 million lost. The first edition of the Scam Buster Bank Quiz, which was rolled out in 2020, was attempted more than 440,000 times. The police said the revamped quiz features more interactive elements and actual scam examples to educate bank customers on how to spot scams and red flags, and what to do upon receiving such scam messages. ""A discerning and well-informed public is the best defence against scams, especially given the increase in scam variants,"" said the police, adding that it will continue to work with the NCPC to conduct public education on scams, especially online where most scams are taking place."

Job scams topped the list with over 3,500 cases reported and more than $58 million lost, according to mid-year statistics released by the police on Monday (Aug 29). A total of 14,349 scam cases was reported this year, almost double the 7,746 cases reported in the same period last year. In response to The Straits Times’ queries, the police said a total of $346.5 million was lost to all scams in the first half of this year. This is more than half of the $633.3 million lost in the whole of last year. There was also a 36 per cent hike in overall crime to 25,593 cases, with a rise in outrage of modesty cases and cyber extortion crimes. ""The prevalence of scams continues to be high in Singapore. At least 90 per cent of scams in Singapore originate from overseas,"" said the police. ""These scammers are typically part of organised criminal groups, and run sophisticated transnational operations which are not easy to detect or dismantle. These scammers are also well-resourced, and adept at using technology to cover their tracks."" The police said job scams, phishing scams, e-commerce scams and investment scams remain of particular concern, with reports of such scams making up 74.5 per cent of the top 10 scam types in the first half of this year. Job scams, the fifth scam of concern during the same period last year, is now the most concerning. A common variant of the scam is tricking a victim to ""help"" e-commerce platform merchants improve their sales by making advance purchases. The victims are assured that their money would eventually be refunded and a commission would be paid to them. The scammers would initially refund the victims the cost of the items and pay them commissions. They would later claim to have encountered issues with the refunds and would stop paying the victims. Phishing scams recorded the second highest number of cases among all scam types. More than 2,300 cases were reported and the total amount lost was $7.8 million. In banking-related phishing scams, the culprits would impersonate a bank or government official and pretend to assist victims with issues concerning their bank cards or accounts. They would then convince the victims to provide their account details and one-time passwords. There was a spike in the number of e-commerce scams reported, from 1,057 cases during the first half of last year to 2,267 this year. The police said e-commerce scams generally involve the sale of goods online without delivering the items after payment is made. ""The increase in e-commerce scams is largely due to rental scams involving fake property listings, which made up 29.6 per cent of e-commerce scams."" The police said their Anti-Scam Centre froze more than 7,800 bank accounts and recovered close to $80 million in the first half of the year, which was about 31.4 per cent of the total amount scammed. ""The Anti-Scam Centre also works closely with local telecommunication companies to terminate mobile lines which are found to have been used for scams, as well as with social media platforms and online marketplaces to remove suspicious accounts and advertisements,"" they added. Meanwhile, victims of cyber extortion lost more than $754,000, as cases rose to 203 from the previous 138. In these cases, criminals would typically befriend victims online and subsequently coax them into performing compromising or indecent acts in front of a camera. The footage or images would then be used to extort money from the victims. Instagram was observed to be the most common platform used to approach victims, followed by Facebook and Tinder, said the police. Outrage of modesty cases went up to 773 from 739, while cases of voyeurism decreased to 216 from 236. Housebreaking and related crimes dropped to 77 from 88 cases while the number of robbery cases decreased to seven from 16 cases in the same period last year. This is the lowest mid-year figure for housebreaking and robbery cases in the past 10 years, said the police."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/he-would-have-lost-over-1m-if-not-for-red-flag-raised-by-member-of-banks-anti-scam-team,'I didn't stop to think': Man almost lost over $1m if not for bank's anti-scam team,"SINGAPORE - He was told over the phone by someone claiming to be a court official that he was involved in illegal money laundering activities, and while John (not his real name) knew he had done nothing wrong, fear set in. After a series of phone calls with the ""court official"" as well as ""police officers"" and even an ""auditor"" claiming to be from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the 58-year-old, who works in financial services, grew so worried he gave up personal information, including his bank account details. Using his banking credentials, the scammers transferred $93,000 out of his account, and it would have been much more if not for a member of the DBS anti-scam team, who flagged the initial transaction as suspicious. John, who is married with two children in their 20s, had fallen victim to a government official impersonation scam. In response to The Straits Times’ queries, the police said 996 government official impersonation scam cases were reported in the first half of this year. Victims of such scams were cheated of $25.2 million. Recalling the incident in June, John said last Friday (Aug 26): ""The scammers had Singaporean accents. It also seemed like they were authority figures I could trust. It was all very convincing."" He added: ""The 'court official' first accused me of money laundering activities that were carried out through a company which I set up. When I told him I had no knowledge of such activities, he transferred me to a 'police officer' who said he needed my information."" Hoping to the resolve the matter quickly, John, who has lived in Singapore for 16 years, took a photo of his employment pass card and sent it to the scammer. ""He then sent me a very official-looking court document for the offences I'd been accused of and said due the seriousness of the offences, the police would be at my home that evening to arrest me,"" John said. ""I was extremely fearful. There was also this time pressure. If I didn't get my name cleared by then, I was going to spend an evening in a jail cell."" John said the scammers used the tactic of confusion, transferring him to different authority figures, including a court official, a junior police officer, a senior police inspector and a financial auditor who claimed to be from the Monetary Authority of Singapore. He eventually handed over his DBS banking credentials to the scammers for inspection. ""I was told not to speak to anyone about this - not my employer, not my wife. Otherwise it would jeopardise the legitimacy of the financial review. They said not to talk to the police or any banks about this as they suspected that the criminals involved in the money laundering activities were employees of the bank. ""At that point I was even wondering if I was being followed or watched, so I took their instructions very seriously,"" said John. The scammers used his banking credentials to transfer $93,000 from his account and attempted a second transfer of $97,800. Ms Elaine Tan, a member of the DBS anti-scam team, said the bank's fraud surveillance systems flagged the second transaction as suspicious. ""The biggest red flag was that John wasn't aware of the $93,000 transfer when I spoke to him over the phone to verify the transaction,"" Ms Tan said. ""In fact, he claimed that he did not access his DBS internet banking that day, let alone add a new payee or make a funds transfer."" Believing John had been scammed, Ms Tan informed the Anti-Scam Centre. Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Simon Lam, a senior investigation officer at the Anti-Scam Centre, said subsequent transfers of around $1 million were in the process of being transferred from John's account at the time. He contacted John and took two hours to convince him that he had been scammed. ""(We finally) achieved a breakthrough with the use of a news article which elaborated on the modus operandi of a government official impersonation scam, which was similar to what the victim experienced,"" said ASP Lam. Subsequent transfer attempts by the scammers were halted and the first transfer of $93,000 was also recovered. ASP Lam added: “This is a testament of the strong collaborative relationship between DBS and the Anti-Scam Centre in our capabilities to respond swiftly to scam incidents and underscores our commitment to protect the community.” John is grateful that the money he saved for retirement remains intact. “I had seen the advisories on scams. Despite  that, the speed at which the events unfolded after the first call got me sucked in. I didn’t stop to think... It was the ultimate act of stupidity for me to fall for this,” he said.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/woman-jailed-3-weeks-for-causing-first-degree-burn-to-diabetic-ex-boyfriend,Woman jailed 3 weeks for causing first-degree burn to diabetic ex-boyfriend,"SINGAPORE - A call centre operator splashed hot water onto her diabetic former boyfriend's chest, causing him a first-degree burn after he told her she was unable to care for her child. The court heard that the 31-year-old man has Type-1 diabetes and that his condition made him susceptible to serious burn injury and scarring if splashed with hot water. He later went to a clinic and a doctor found that his diabetes did not affect the extent of the injury. His assailant, Shazila Akbar Bacha, 25, pleaded guilty on Monday (Aug 29) to an assault charge and was sentenced to three weeks' jail. A second assault charge was considered during sentencing. On July 18 last year, Shazila was on her way to a friend's flat in Marsiling when she bumped into her former boyfriend outside the unit. The pair then quarrelled at a nearby staircase landing and Shazila slapped his left cheek. The pair later entered their friend's flat where they had another argument. Deputy Public Prosecutor Chong Kee En said: ""The accused was also upset as the victim had made some comments that she was unable to take care of her son. The accused proceeded to the unit's kitchen and filled up an orange plastic cup a quarter full with hot water from a dispenser. ""She took the cup filled with hot water, went back into the living room, and dared the victim to repeat his statements about her not being able to take care of her son."" Her former boyfriend repeated his statements and she splashed the hot water onto his chest. He alerted the police before he went to a clinic the next day for treatment. The man was then given three days of medical leave, the court heard. For assault, an offender can be jailed for up to three years and fined up to $5,000."

In a statement on Monday (Aug 29), the police said there has been a persistent trend of scammers contacting victims through phone calls, pretending to be their friends while asking for financial assistance. Police said the victim would receive phone calls from unknown numbers with the ""+"" prefix. When the calls are answered, the caller would not identify themselves and instead mislead victims with questions such as ""Guess who am I?"" or ""You can't remember me?"". Thinking they are acquainted, the victims would reply with the name of a friend who they think sound similar to the caller, said the police. The caller will then assume the identify of the friend while claiming to have lost his mobile phone or changed his contact number. He will then ask the victim to update his number in the victim's contact list. After a few days, the caller would contact the victim and ask for loans due to financial difficulties or troubles with the law. He would provide bank account numbers or phone numbers to transfer money to. ""Victims would discover that they have been scammed only after contacting their actual friends whom the scammers have impersonated,"" said the police. People are advised to beware of calls with the ""+"" prefix, especially if they are not expecting an international call. The police also urged the public to be wary of unusual requests received via phone calls or messages even if they appear to be from family or friends. The public is also advised to verify the legitimacy of the request by checking with family and friends through alternative means, such as physical meet-ups or using previously established contact details. Those with information related to such scams are advised to call the police hotline on 1800-255-0000 or submit it online at their website.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/single-mother-13th-person-jailed-over-citibank-cheating-case-involving-forged-documents,"Single mother jailed over Citibank cheating case, 13th person to date","SINGAPORE - A single mother has become the thirteenth person to be handed a jail sentence for her role in a ruse that saw forged documents submitted to Citibank to secure loans. Kiran Kaur, 29, was on Monday (Aug 29) sentenced to six months' jail for cheating. The court heard that between September and October 2018, the consumer division of Citigroup received and approved about 20 loan applications that were later found to contain forged income documents. Each loan involved between $12,000 and $24,000. Kaur was jobless and facing financial difficulties when she responded to an advertisement in September 2018 for a ""fast cash"" job on online marketplace Carousell, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Dhiraj G. Chainani. Through the ad, she contacted a man known only as ""Charles"" via messaging platform WhatsApp. Charles, whose identity was not mentioned in court papers, told her he could help her obtain a loan from Citibank. The DPP said: ""The accused told Charles that she was not working at that time and did not have any Central Provident Fund contributions in order to apply for a bank loan. ""Charles told the accused not to worry and that the accused did not need to satisfy the requisite income level to qualify for a bank loan."" He got Kaur to divulge her Singpass login details and told her to meet an unidentified man outside a Citibank branch at MacDonald House in Orchard Road to collect a set of documents for the loan application. She did as she was told and received documents that falsely stated she was working for another bank and earning $6,700 a month for July and August that year. The court heard that Charles then told her to look for Citibank contract staff Kirk Chua Min Xuan, 29, at the branch. Her loan application was submitted on Sept 10 and later approved. In total, Kaur received $13,490 in cash, but she claimed she kept $4,000 and gave the rest to the man who gave her the forged documents. Charles had instructed her to do this, she said. On Oct 2 that year, a Citibank representative made a police report that the bank had approved loans based on falsified income documents. Kaur was identified as one of the applicants. Twelve other offenders linked to the ruse were dealt with in court earlier. Chua's case is still pending. In an earlier statement, the bank said that he has not been working on Citibank-related matters since 2019. The court heard that Kaur has since made restitution of $4,000. Her bail was set at $10,000 on Monday and she was ordered to surrender herself at the State Courts on Sept 26 to begin serving her sentence. For cheating, she could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined."

Geetha Priya Ravi, who faces one count of cheating, is accused of deceiving her victims into thinking she had units available for rent to get them to fork out rental deposits. According to charge documents, she allegedly duped a man into transferring to her $2,700 in exchange for securing the rental of a flat in Jurong West Central 3. On Friday, the police said, between March and April this year, they received several reports from victims who responded to listings on Carousell offering units for rent. They were told to pay a deposit after viewing the unit. After receiving the money, the woman allegedly became uncontactable. Officers from Woodlands Police Division established her identity and arrested her on Friday. The police said: ""Preliminary investigations revealed that she is believed to be involved in at least 20 similar cases of rental scams with losses amounting to more than $35,000."" If convicted, Geetha can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined for each cheating offence. The police said at least 997 people here have lost $3.9 million since January after falling victim to scammers posing as property agents.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/free-legal-centres-to-be-set-up-in-heartland-for-low-income-families,Free legal centres to be set up in heartland for low-income families,"SINGAPORE - Low-income residents in the heartland may soon get access to free legal help close to their home, with the first law community centre to be set up in Hougang. The centre in the Tian De Temple will open later this year under an agreement signed by the Law Society Pro Bono Services (LSPBS), the temple, the Singapore University of Social Sciences and the RSS Foundation on Aug 20. The foundation, established by law firm R. S. Solomon, will help raise funds for this initiative. In an exclusive interview with The Straits Times earlier this week, LSPBS chairman Gregory Vijayendran and chief executive Tanguy Lim said LSPBS, which will change its name to Pro Bono SG later this year, plans to roll out more of such centres in the heartland. The goal is to bring legal assistance closer to those with mobility and technology challenges. Mr Vijayendran, a senior counsel, said: ""This is like neighbourhood polyclinics or GPs who are right there at the locale. They are walking and journeying with the community and are able to troubleshoot problems."" Mr Lim said: ""We'll be connecting with all the family service centres, the SSOs (social service offices), all the different charities, which are often the first responders meeting persons who are facing some kind of calamity, which often may have some legal aspects as well. The idea then is to work holistically to help those persons."" For instance, he said, in cases of domestic violence, a social worker may help the parties to get counselling, while a lawyer may help the victim apply for an exclusion or personal protection order. Two full-time lawyers are expected to be deployed in each centre through the Community Law Fellowship Programme, which will recruit lawyers, or community law fellows, for the centres. On Friday night (Aug 26),  LSPBS celebrated its 15th anniversary with a concert at Victoria Concert Hall, where members of the legal fraternity shared the stage and sang duets with migrant workers. Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong was the guest of honour and sang The Beatles' With A Little Help From My Friends with Mr Vijayendran in front of an audience of about 600. Those in the audience included members of the legal fraternity and representatives from non-governmental organisations, as well as friends and family of the performers. Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (Clas) assistant director Sadhana Rai, one of the emcees for the evening, told ST she found her purpose in full-time pro bono work, citing cases involving young offenders as particularly meaningful to her. ""Juveniles tend to not be of the same maturity as adults when they make decisions, and they also don't have access to the same kind of resources to make better decisions... (And) there's always scope for second chances,"" said Ms Rai. She recalled getting probation for a 17-year-old who was charged with causing grievous hurt while his mother was serving jail time for a separate offence. The LSPBS was established in 2007 as a department in the Law Society and came a charity in 2017. Senior Counsel Jimmy Yim, 63, who sang with his wife, Mrs Cynthia Yim, in the concert, wrote the report that helped set up the office. He said: ""In those days, we would not have been able to see that the idea and genesis of that report would become such an important thing. ""The number of people the Law Society has served through this pro bono office has been phenomenal."" LSPBS has helped 132,000 people through its legal awareness, advice and advocacy services. It has more than 1,000 volunteers. Between April last year and March this year, it helped more than 17,000 individuals and community organisations through its programmes, which include Clas and legal clinics. Both Mr Lim and Mr Vijayendran cited the legal clinics for community organisations, which began in 2010, as a high point for the service, noting that lawyers with different specialities and of different levels of experience worked together to help those with no access to a lawyer. Mr Vijayendran said: ""One of the paradigm roles for lawyers is not just (being a) gladiator, there's a place for that; not just a trusted adviser, there's a place for that too. But there is another dimension - which is as a healer."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/criminal-legal-aid-scheme-to-complement-public-defence-office-continue-to-serve-foreigners,"Criminal legal aid scheme to complement Public Defender's Office, continue to serve foreigners","SINGAPORE - A scheme that currently provides defence lawyers to low-income accused persons for free will function alongside the Law Ministry's Public Defender's Office (PDO) and continue to receive government funding. The Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (Clas), run by the Law Society Pro Bono Services (LSPBS), will also continue to serve foreign workers. The PDO, scheduled to be set up by the end of the year, will provide low-income Singaporeans and permanent residents who face criminal charges a full-time public defender. LSPBS chairman, Senior Counsel Gregory Vijayendran, told The Straits Times in an exclusive interview on Wednesday (Aug 24) that the PDO will need time to build capacity and Clas sees itself as in a complementary partnership with the PDO, with the goal to provide legal representation to more people who need it. ""There will be time for any new entrants, including the PDO, to build its capability... So until then, we are still very much going to continue to do what we've been called to do, what so many lawyers have been doing without a single cent,"" said Mr Vijayendran, adding that Clas will continue to receive funding from the Government. ""We look forward to continuing to stay true and stay strong in the role that we have been entrusted."" Clas helped 1,404 people between April last year and March this year. Of these, 729 people were assigned a lawyer to represent them in court. Earlier this month, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Law Rahayu Mahzam said the income criterion for the PDO will be a monthly per capita household income of up to $1,500, or around the 35th percentile of resident households by income. This is an increase from the coverage of around the 25th percentile of households under the existing Clas, which is the equivalent of people whose monthly per capita household income is less than $950. Mr Vijayendran said: ""As far as we are concerned, it doesn't detract from the work that we're doing, certainly for the migrant workers and the foreigners. It's business as usual."" One of the most significant cases handled by a Clas lawyer involved former maid Parti Liyani, who was acquitted in 2020 of theft from then Changi Airport Group chairman Liew Mun Leong and his family. Her pro bono lawyer, Mr Anil Balchandani, told ST on Friday: ""The way we treat minorities and the underprivileged in our society is a reflection of ourselves. PDO is nascent and with time, we hope the PDO will adopt best practices and afford access to justice to all those who are unable to afford it, citizens or otherwise."" He noted that the foreign worker population is about one million, close to 20 per cent of the population, adding: ""Their ability to have access to justice benefits the institution of justice and the country in the long run. To paraphrase Martin Luther King, lack of access to justice is a threat to justice."""

In such scams, victims are told to make payment to the scammer in order to secure a unit for rent. On Friday (Aug 26), the police said that between March and April this year, the authorities received several reports from victims who had responded to listings on Carousell offering units for rent. The victims were told to pay a deposit to the woman after viewing the unit to secure its rental. After receiving these deposits, the woman allegedly became uncontactable. Through follow-up investigations, officers from Woodlands Police Division established the identity of the woman and arrested her on Friday, the police said. ""Preliminary investigations revealed that she is believed to be involved in at least 20 similar cases of rental scams with losses amounting to more than $35,000."" She will be charged on Saturday with the offence of cheating. If found guilty, she can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined. At least 997 people here have lost a total of $3.9 million since January this year after falling victims to scammers posing as property agents, the police said. Members of the public are reminded that they should verify the details and contact number of any real estate agent they are dealing with, the police said. They can also ask to visit the unit and verify with the owner if the rental offer is genuine. For more information on scams, the public can call the anti-scam hotline on 1800-722-6688. Anyone with information on scams may call the police hotline on 1800-255-0000 or visit this website. This month, a former real estate agent was sentenced to 4 ½ years' jail after cheating 71 victims of $138,365 in total. Ramanathan Sujithran, now 54, had asked them to pay him a sum of money as deposit to confirm rental but ended up cancelling the agreement and pocketing the funds."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/nparks-stepping-up-patrols-at-jurong-lake-gardens-after-unauthorised-signs-soliciting-donations-surface,NParks stepping up patrols at Jurong Lake Gardens after unauthorised signs soliciting donations surface,"SINGAPORE - Scammers have allegedly solicited donations at Jurong Lake Gardens, claiming to be collecting funds on behalf of those who grow plants in allotment plots in the park. Earlier this month, at least nine such signs appeared at allotment plots, asking members of the public to scan a QR code and make a donation. In a sign seen by The Straits Times, visitors are told that donations are a show of appreciation for the hard work put in to take care of the plants in the garden. However, these signs were not put up by individuals who leased the plots, a gardening enthusiast who wanted to be known only as Mr Pan, 41, told ST. The private tutor and his family tend to a plot they lease in Jurong Lake Gardens, and he found one of those signs in his plot on Aug 4. He immediately alerted the National Parks Board (NParks). In response to media queries, NParks confirmed that the signs are unauthorised and have since been removed. NParks officers have also stepped up patrols to prevent similar incidents from occurring. Ms Kartini Omar, group director of Jurong Lake Gardens at NParks, said: ""We have referred the matter to the police. Allotment gardeners have been reminded not to erect unauthorised signage, and to report such incidents to NParks."" Mr Pan said he was concerned after finding the sign as the allotment gardens are meant to be a space for the community. Introduced by NParks in 2016, the Allotment Gardening Scheme offers gardening spaces close to Housing Board estates for the public to lease. An allotment garden is a raised planter bed the public can ballot for on NParks' website. Those who are successful can grow herbs, vegetables and ornamental plants in the plot, which they lease for $57 annually for up to three years. Mr Pan said: ""These (unauthorised) signs were laminated, and the person who did this may have wanted to put them at multiple locations around Singapore."" As at July, there are almost 2,200 allotment gardens in 25 parks islandwide. Ms Cassandra Ho, 54, who grows vegetables in an allotment plot in Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, was upset when told about the alleged gardening scam. Ms Ho, a part-time cook, said: ""At the gardens, many of us grow vegetables for our own consumption, which will come in handy should Singapore ever see food shortages. But if people try to take advantage of this initiative, it is wrong."" Criminal lawyer James Gomez, an associate at Edmond Pereira Law, said that putting up these signs could be tantamount to cheating by personation. Mr Gomez said: ""The person who put up this sign is clearly representing himself as the individual leasing the plot, even though he does not have the authority to do so. Someone reading the sign will logically assume that the person soliciting donations is the one who is maintaining the garden."" For cheating by personation, an offender can be jailed for up to five years, fined, or both. Mr Cory Wong of Invictus Law said that the act of putting up these signs without having obtained permission from either NParks or the lessee could amount to vandalism. For vandalism, first-time offenders may be fined up to $2,000 or jailed for up to three years."

The three vehicles made a three-point turn before the roadblock and drove against the flow of traffic. ""The officers immediately initiated a pursuit and managed to intercept one of the vehicles along Syed Alwi Road,"" the police said. One of the drivers was arrested at the scene for dangerous driving and evading roadblock. The other two drivers were arrested subsequently on Monday and Tuesday (Aug 23). Roadblocks are conducted by the police to deter and detect crimes, the authorities said. These include drink driving and illegal modification of vehicles. Between 2016 and 2020, 33 people have been convicted or given stern warnings for evading police roadblocks. In March last year, Singaporean Lee Cheng Yan evaded a roadblock after he was stopped by a police officer and asked to take a breathalyser test, which he failed. He was out driving even though he was given a lifetime driving ban for a hit-and-run accident in 2017. During that incident, Lee, who was driving a Maserati, dragged another policeman for more than 100m after the officer stopped his vehicle as he was not wearing his seat belt. On Friday, the police advised the public to cooperate with officers when they are approached during roadblocks. Those who evade roadblocks can be fined up to $10,000, jailed up to seven years, or both."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/last-four-of-11-bar-exam-cheats-withdraw-applications-to-be-admitted-as-lawyers,Last 4 of Bar exam cheats withdraw applications to be admitted as lawyers,"SINGAPORE - The last four of 11 aspiring lawyers who cheated in the 2020 Bar exam were allowed on Friday (Aug 26) to withdraw their applications to be admitted to the Bar. Each of the four gave an undertaking not to bring a fresh application for admission to the Bar for periods ranging from nine months to three years. In determining the duration for each candidate, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon considered the circumstances of how they cheated, how quickly they came clean when confronted, and the extent to which they disclosed the cheating in their Bar admission applications. Ms Joleen Ong Jia Yi, who instigated two other candidates to give her the answers for two papers, including one for ethics, is not to apply for admission for three years. Mr Lim Zi Yi, who had given answers to Ms Ong for two papers, is not to apply for one year. Ms Annabelle Au Jia En, who helped Ms Ong with one paper, is not to apply for nine months. The three were in the same study group, and Ms Ong used their Discord chat to ask for help during the exam, which was held online in 2020. Chief Justice Menon noted that Ms Ong asked for answers not once, but twice, and was not forthcoming after being found out. On the other hand, Mr Lim and Ms Au immediately confessed during investigations. The Singapore Institute of Legal Education (Sile) also deemed that the trio had cheated in a third paper, which the candidates denied. Chief Justice Menon gave no weight to the third paper as there was no clear explanation for how Sile arrived at its conclusion. The fourth candidate, Mr Sean Wong Wai Loong, is not to apply for admission for two years. After submitting his answer script for one paper, he obtained the script of another candidate, copied her answer for a question he had missed out, and resubmitted his script. Although Mr Wong quickly admitted his misconduct, he initially did not disclose this in his admission application out of fear that his legal life might come to an end. All four also gave their word that when they bring a fresh application, they would have to satisfy any requirements by the Attorney-General, Law Society, Sile or the court as to their fitness for admission. All 11 candidates who were caught cheating in the exam had to retake it, and subsequently passed. The cheating became public in April, when High Court judge Choo Han Teck adjourned the admission applications of six candidates after the Attorney-General said they were not fit and proper persons to be admitted to the Bar. Ms Monisha Devaraj, Mr Kushal Atul Shah, Mr Sreeraam Ravenderan, Mr Matthew Chow Jun Feng and Mr Lionel Wong Choong Yoong had their admission applications adjourned by six months. The five, who shared answers in six papers via WhatsApp, admitted their misconduct as soon as Sile began its inquiry. Ms Lynn Kuek Yi Ting, who was found to have colluded with another candidate, Mr Leon Tay Quan Li, had her admission application adjourned for a year. Ms Kuek and Mr Tay denied cheating and explained that they had similar answers as they had studied together and shared notes. But Sile, which reviewed the study notes, rejected the explanation. Mr Tay then sought to withdraw his admission application, becoming the first of the 11 to do so. In May, Chief Justice Menon allowed Mr Tay to withdraw his admission application, on the condition that he was not to bring a fresh application for at least five years. Mr Tay had given a false account of what transpired when confronted and made selective disclosures in his admission application. The Chief Justice also required Mr Tay to give his word that, when he brings a fresh application, he would have to satisfy any requirements by the Attorney-General, Law Society, Sile or the court as to his fitness for admission. Earlier this month, six candidates - Ms Monisha, Mr Shah, Mr Sreeraam, Mr Chow, Mr Wong and Ms Kuek - appeared before Justice Choo again, this time to withdraw their admission applications. Their lawyers said they had realised they needed more time to show that they were fit and proper to be admitted as lawyers and cited the Chief Justice's decision in Mr Tay's case. Justice Choo granted permission to all six to withdraw their applications, saying that they were free to apply again, but did not impose specific conditions."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/body-found-in-hougang-drain-investigating-officer-rules-out-foul-play,Body found in Hougang drain: Investigating officer rules out foul play,"SINGAPORE - He parked his lorry in a heavy vehicle carpark and headed to a drain behind the lorry to relieve himself. There, the lorry driver spotted the body of Mr William Leck Swe Chua, an 80-year-old who had been missing for three days. On the first day of the coroner's inquiry on Friday (Aug 26), investigating officer (IO) Freddy Tan ruled out foul play and said Mr Leck's death could have been accidental. Mr Leck, who had dementia, was found in the drain in Hougang on Jan 3 this year. IO Tan said the police received a call from the lorry driver at about 7pm saying he had spotted a body in a drain. Police and Singapore Civil Defence Force paramedics who arrived at the scene, near 42 Defu Lane 7, found the body in an awkward position, said IO Tan. He added that Mr Leck was in his underwear and a vest, while his T-shirt was rolled up to his neck area. The body was extracted at about 10pm that night. Mr Leck, who had been reported missing, was identified following a fingerprint analysis. IO Tan said a meteorological report from the National Environment Agency showed that it was raining in the three days prior to the body being found. There were no signs of trauma on Mr Leck's body, he added. A search of the carpark turned up Mr Leck's bermuda shorts, wallet and mobile phone. The phone was faulty but data could be extracted from its SIM card. With Mr Leck's son working in China, IO Tan said an officer spoke to the dead man's granddaughter, who said she last saw him in December 2021. None of Mr Leck' relatives was present in court on Friday. The IO said Mr Leck's female partner had told the police that when she woke up on the morning of Jan 1, she found she was alone in their flat and assumed he had gone to the coffee shop. The duo reportedly lived in a unit at Block 313 Hougang Avenue 5. When she came back from work and found that he had still not returned, she called him a few times, starting at 3pm, and he said he was on his way back. Closed-circuit television footage at the heavy vehicle carpark showed that at around 3.20pm, Mr Leck had already walked in and out of the location seven times, and he was last seen at about 4.30pm heading towards the drain. There was no answer when Mr Leck's partner tried calling him at about 7.30pm that day. Medical reports showed that Mr Leck was diagnosed with cancer in 2011 and he later suffered from dementia, a disease where individuals lose various aspects of their cognitive functions such as memory, and thinking or reasoning abilities. State Coroner Adam Nakhoda asked IO Tan to seek more details from Mr Leck's partner about the phone calls she made to him on the day he went missing. The case will be heard next on Sept 12."

Mr Noor Shah Ryzqa Azman, 20, was earlier accused of ganging up with three others to voluntarily cause grievous hurt to Mr Justin Chua Yong Jie, 30, by using a glass bottle in Keng Cheow Street. But this latest move does not mean that Mr Noor is totally off the hook. Those given such a discharge can still be prosecuted for the same crime if relevant information or evidence were to emerge later. In a statement to The Straits Times on Friday (Aug 26), the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) said: ""After careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case, the prosecution applied for a discharge not amounting to an acquittal in relation to the charge against (Mr Noor). ""This was granted by the court (on Aug 4). The matter could be reviewed if new facts surface."" The AGC spokesman did not disclose details about the facts and circumstances of the case. Mr Noor and three other men were earlier charged in court over the attack. The cases involving Taitus Wong Wei Zhi, 20, Dani Zulastri Mohamad Salim, 22, and Mohamad Amirul Shafi Abdullah, 22, are pending. Mr Chua was struck on the back of his head with a glass bottle on March 20 as he was walking to a convenience store after enjoying a meal with friends. The financial adviser previously told ST that he had no clue as to who was behind the attack, which left him needing stitches for his wounded scalp. Mr Chua's girlfriend, who gave her name only as Ms Low, had earlier told ST that he was celebrating a friend's birthday with four others at a restaurant near Clarke Quay when he went to a convenience store to buy a drink. After the attack, he trudged back to his friends, who were shocked when they saw that he was injured. Ms Low said his friends then called for an ambulance. In a video posted on social media, paramedics could be seen tending to Mr Chua, as he lay limp on the ground with his clothes and napkins around him soaked in blood. ""He told me he didn't see who attacked (him) as he was in shock,"" Ms Low had said. Those convicted of voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a weapon or instrument can be jailed for up to 15 years and fined or caned."

The man, who is now 36, is said to have committed the offences when the victim was between 10 and 13 years old. Court documents did not disclose if she was his pupil at the time. The man was charged with three counts of molestation on Wednesday (Aug 24) and offered bail of $15,000. Details about him and the school cannot be revealed due to a gag order to protect the girl's identity. In a statement to The Straits Times on Friday, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said the man had been suspended from duty since June 2020 and is no longer teaching in any school. The spokesman said: ""MOE takes a serious view of staff misconduct and will not hesitate to take disciplinary action against those who fail to adhere to our standards of conduct and discipline, including dismissal from service."" According to court documents, the man allegedly slapped the girl's buttocks once over her clothes at the primary school in 2016. He is accused of hugging her at the school the following year. The pair were at Golden Village Yishun multiplex in 2018 when he allegedly molested her for the third time by touching her abdomen. The man's pre-trial conference will be held on Sept 23. For each count of molestation involving a victim below 14 years old, an offender can be jailed for up to five years, fined, caned or receive any combination of such punishments."

Any student who commits such acts will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include suspension or expulsion from the university, depending on the nature and severity of the offence. ""The university provided support to the individuals involved when the incident occurred in April (last year)... It would be inappropriate to comment further while the case is before the court.""

The case involving Singaporean Pi Jiapeng and his Thai wife Pansuk Siriwipa, both 27, has been adjourned for a pre-trial conference on Oct 11. A pre-trial conference is when the prosecution and defence lawyers come together behind closed doors to discuss how a case is managed. The couple appeared in court via video link from the Central Police Division on Friday (Aug 26). The court heard that the order of no bail for the duo, who were dressed in red tops, remained in place. They first appeared in court on Aug 12, when they were each handed three charges - two for cheating and one charge of leaving Singapore illegally. They are accused of being involved in a conspiracy to cheat customers of Tradenation and Tradeluxury between January and June. The amounts said to be involved were not disclosed in court documents. The pair had allegedly duped victims into believing they would be sold watches and luxury handbags, but had no intention of delivering the items. In earlier proceedings on Aug 19, the court heard that the case was a complex one involving more than 180 police reports. Pi, who was born in Fujian province in China, was initially arrested by the Singapore Police Force (SPF) on June 27. He had his passport impounded and was released on $15,000 bail the next day. Pansuk was assisting the police with investigations and had surrendered her passport to officers on June 30. The couple became uncontactable and allegedly fled Singapore illegally via the land border on July 4. Arrest warrants and Interpol red notices were then issued against the couple. The Royal Thai Police later told the SPF that Pi and Pansuk were possibly staying in a Johor Bahru hotel. The SPF then asked the Royal Malaysia Police to locate them. The Malaysian authorities arrested the couple on Aug 11 and handed them over to the SPF that day. Both of them were refused bail after a judge agreed with the prosecution that they were flight risks. Two Malaysian men, Mohamed Alias, 40, and Mohamad Fazli Abdul Rahman, 38, allegedly helped the pair flee Singapore by letting them hide in the container compartment of a Malaysia-registered lorry, which then passed through Tuas Checkpoint. Alias and Fazli were earlier charged in a Singapore district court over their alleged offences and their cases are pending. For each count of cheating, an offender can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined."

On Thursday (Aug 25), Prakash Mathivanan, 38, was sentenced to jail for three years and 10 months after he pleaded guilty to eight charges. A further 23 charges were taken into consideration during his sentencing. Deputy Public Prosecutor Theong Li Han told the court that Prakash became acquainted with a man named Gardi Bandi, an operations manager at a restaurant where he was seeking employment. The pair, together with Prakash's girlfriend, Malani Naidu Prabhakar Naidu, conspired to buy items using stolen credit card information and sell them for cash. The two men also agreed to use those details to pay for hotel stays. Gardi obtained the credit card details for Prakash, who promised to pay Gardi $100 for each set of details. Gardi uploaded photographs of the credit card as attachments to an e-mail message and saved the message as a draft in an e-mail account set up for Prakash to access. Using this scheme, they obtained the UOB credit card details of a Lee Su Lynn and used them to pay for several items worth $2,968.80 in total. The items, which were ordered on May 2, 2017, from online platform Qoo10, included printers, vacuum cleaners and an air fryer. On May 24, 2017, Prakash and Gardi agreed that Prakash would book a two-night stay at Raffles Hotel for Gardi using the stolen details of an American Express card held by Mr Solomon Thomas Fernandez. Gardi had taken a photo of its details from the personal organiser of Mr Fernandez's secretary. Court documents do not say how Gardi was acquainted with Mr Fernandez. Using the data, Prakash reserved a two-night stay at Raffles Hotel costing $1,401.60. On May 25, 2017, American Express alerted Mr Fernandez to several unauthorised transactions on his card and he cancelled the card. But Prakash called American Express, pretending to be Mr Fernandez, and got a new card delivered to a cafe owned by Gardi in Lim Tua Tow Road, in Kovan. On May 24, 2020, Prakash called Maybank, identifying himself as Mr Fernandez, and got them to send him a replacement credit card. The card was sent to Mr Fernandez's address, but Prakash retrieved it and used it to make fraudulent transactions. On June 2, 2020, Maybank lodged a police report about fraudulent transactions totalling $11,883.20 made with the stolen card. Prakash had also committed other offences. In January 2017, he was found with at least 0.36g of methamphetamine. In the same year, he also stole an iPad from his stepbrother's wife in April and on May 29 failed to turn up for a urine test. He had been placed on compulsory supervision for 24 months on Jan 5, 2016, and was required to present himself for urine testing at Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters every Monday and Friday, except public holidays. On Nov 5, 2020 - when the shooting occurred - he was arrested around midnight in an apartment by police officers and a search turned up at least 6.38g of methamphetamine. The police had said previously that a man was shot in the abdomen that morning during a struggle with officers who raided an apartment in City Suites condominium in Balestier Road. Three policemen in plain clothes, armed with revolvers and handcuffs, had raided the apartment to arrest four people suspected of being involved in a series of cheating cases. Prakash, who has charges pending against him, will return to court on Sept 8."

The attack was so vicious that the knuckleduster tore a chunk of flesh from the 29-year-old victim's head. The victim, who was later found with injuries including multiple stab wounds as well as fractures to his left foot and right forearm, also suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after the attack. But on Thursday (Aug 25), District Judge Eddy Tham said that the rape allegation was unproven, adding: ""(There is) no room for vigilante justice here."" The woman's husband, Andre Chen Si'En, 32, was sentenced to eight years' jail with nine strokes of the cane after he pleaded guilty to two assault charges and one count of drug consumption. The other assailant, Gervan Wong Jun Heng, 27, pleaded guilty to 14 charges, including assault, drug abuse and traffic offences. Wong was on Thursday sentenced to seven years, three months and 16 weeks' jail with six strokes of the cane. He was also fined of $2,400 and disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of two years. Court documents did not disclose the reasons behind the rape allegation. It was not mentioned if action would be taken against Chen's wife. Deputy Public Prosecutor Huo Jiongrui said that the victim, who was Chen's friend, did not know Wong. On May 9, 2020, Chen received text messages from his wife, claiming that the victim had raped her the night before. Chen then told Wong about the matter and the younger man agreed to accompany him to settle the matter with the victim. At around 9pm, Chen contacted the victim and asked him out for drinks. Chen and Wong later picked him up near his home and the pair took him to Choa Chu Kang Cemetery at around 3am on May 10, 2020. Chen then asked the victim about the rape allegation but received what he thought were half-hearted replies from him. Incensed, Chen attacked the man with a knuckleduster before stabbing his legs with a knife. Wong soon joined in and attacked the victim with the baton. The pair took turns to attack him until they were both winded, the court heard. At some point during the attack, Chen also took the victim's mobile phone, valued at $300, and smashed it against a tombstone. The DPP said: ""After (the pair) got too tired to continue, (the victim) begged the two men for water. Gervan took some water... and sprayed it (on his) face instead."" After that, the attackers ordered the man to crawl back to a nearby car before Wong drove him home. The prosecutor said that the injured victim was unceremoniously dumped at the foot of his apartment block to fend for himself. He managed to stagger back to his flat, leaving a trail of blood and his mother called for emergency services when she saw him at the doorstep. An ambulance took him to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and he was warded until May 12, 2020. The victim suffered from PTSD following this attack. As of June 20 this year, he had forked out around $2,050 for his medical bills at SGH and the Institute of Mental Health. In an earlier statement, police said that they were informed about the incident at around 5.40am on May 10, 2020. Officers from Jurong Police Division managed to establish the assailants' identities through ground inquiries and images from police cameras. They managed to arrest the pair later that day."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/apex-court-dismisses-bid-by-toc-editor-terry-xu-to-halt-contempt-proceedings,Apex court dismisses bid by TOC editor Terry Xu to halt contempt proceedings,"SINGAPORE - The Court of Appeal on Thursday (Aug 25) dismissed a bid by The Online Citizen (TOC) chief editor Terry Xu to stop the Attorney-General from continuing with contempt proceedings against him. The Attorney-General had started contempt of court proceedings against Xu last year after the now-defunct sociopolitical website reposted an open letter by Australian writer Julie O'Connor questioning Singapore's justice system. Xu then sought to challenge the Attorney-General's decision, arguing that prosecuting only him and not even investigating Ms O'Connor was a violation of his constitutional right to equal treatment under the law. But the three-judge apex court, in a written judgment issued on Thursday, said Xu has failed the legal test to show that the Attorney-General's actions had resulted in him being treated differently from another equally situated person. On Jan 27 last year, Xu published an article, comprising the letter Ms O'Connor had posted on her personal blog, on the TOC website. He also shared the article on TOC's Facebook page. After Xu refused to delete the article and Facebook post, the Attorney-General's Chambers filed an application on Aug 11 seeking to punish him for contempt. On Sept 8, Xu, who was represented by Mr Lim Tean, filed an application seeking judicial review. This was dismissed on Nov 25 by a High Court judge. Xu filed an appeal on Dec 8. At the heart of the case is how Article 12(1) of the Constitution, which states that ""all persons are equal before the law"", is applied in the context of the exercise of prosecutorial discretion by the Attorney-General. The apex court noted that the concept of equality under Article 12(1) means that all persons in like situations will be treated alike. The judgment, delivered by Justice Steven Chong, said it was clear that Xu's treatment cannot be meaningfully compared with that of Ms O'Connor's as there were differentiating factors between them. The fact that Ms O'Connor lives overseas, making it difficult for the Singapore authorities to investigate and prosecute her, was a key factor that differentiated her from Xu, who is within Singapore's jurisdiction. Another differentiating factor was that the publication of the article on the TOC website and Facebook page was likely to cause a greater degree of harm than Ms O'Connor's publication of the letter on her blog. The court said Xu's publication likely gave Ms O'Connor's allegations much wider circulation than they would otherwise have enjoyed, given TOC's substantial audience and reach as an established alternative news platform in Singapore. Xu also conferred a greater appearance of journalistic and editorial legitimacy on Ms O'Connor's allegations than they would otherwise have enjoyed, said the court. The court emphasised that the Attorney-General's overriding duty is to act in the public interest. In assessing what would be in the public interest, the Attorney-General was entitled to take into account the degree of difficulty in investigating and prosecuting Ms O'Connor, as well as whether taking action against Xu would be sufficient. The Attorney-General also was entitled to undertake an assessment of the degree of harm and to conclude that it was in the public interest to prosecute Xu, but not Ms O'Connor, said the court."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/maid-jailed-for-assaulting-employers-baby-daughter,Maid grabbed employer’s baby’s hair to pull her head up,"SINGAPORE - A maid tasked with caring for a baby was caught assaulting her when her employer viewed a live feed from a closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera installed in the child's room. Sri Eha Santika Sari, who initially denied any wrongdoing when confronted, finally came clean after the 44-year-old man retrieved all of the available CCTV footage and viewed it. Sri, 29, was jailed for 10 months on Thursday (Aug 25) after she pleaded guilty to assaulting the victim, who was 22 months old at the time. Details about the baby and her father cannot be disclosed due to a gag order. Sri started working for the household in December 2020 and they lived in a Bishan flat. Her employer installed a CCTV camera in his daughter's room to monitor her and ensure that she was sleeping well. He was viewing a live feed on his mobile phone on Aug 28 last year when he saw Sri grabbing her by the arm and thigh, and swinging her forcefully onto a mattress. He confronted Sri, who denied any wrongdoing and stopped caring for the baby soon after. Despite this, she continued living in the flat, the court heard. The child's father alerted the police on Sept 26 last year after viewing all of the CCTV footage. Court documents did not disclose why it took him about a month to do so. The baby was taken to KK Women's and Children's Hospital the next day (Sept 27), but no injuries were found on her. In the course of investigations, Sri admitted that she started handling the victim in a rough manner in June last year, and it often made the baby cry. Deputy Public Prosecutor Sruthi Boppana said: ""Among other acts, (Sri) would resort to hitting the victim, flicking her on her ears, pulling her by her hair, knocking her on her head, smacking her on her feet, pushing the victim back onto the mattress forcefully when she tried to move away, or pulling her by her hands or feet when the victim was restless or did not sleep."" The court heard that based on the CCTV footage, Sri intentionally caused hurt to the child multiple times between Aug 17 and 28 last year. Among other things, the maid grabbed the baby's hair to pull her head up. Sri also pressed the child's head into a pillow and slapped her left cheek. On Thursday, the DPP urged the court to sentence her to between eight and 10 months' jail. She said: ""The victim was especially and exceptionally vulnerable at only 22 months old, entirely defenceless and in no position to fend for herself, given the gross physical disparity at play and her inability to seek help."" The prosecutor also said that Sri had abused her position of trust when she committed the offences."

CK Fresh had brought in the undeclared and under-declared food from Malaysia, said the Singapore Food Agency (SFA). This came to light on Nov 17 last year, when a truck delivering it to the importer was detained at the Woodlands Checkpoint during a joint operation between the SFA and the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority. The case was referred to SFA for follow-up investigations and all illegal consignments were seized, the SFA added. Company director Chai Chwee Yoke was also fined $5,000 for failing to prevent the offence. In Singapore, fruits and vegetables can only be imported by licensed importers, and every consignment must be declared and accompanied with a valid import permit, SFA said. The agency noted that illegally imported vegetables are of unknown sources and can pose a food safety risk if unregulated or high levels of pesticides are used. SFA said: ""The long-term ingestion of excessive pesticide residues through the consumption of vegetables that have been subjected to pesticide abuse could lead to adverse health effects."" Offenders who illegally import fresh fruits and vegetables can be fined a maximum of $10,000, imprisoned for not more than three years, or both."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/tanjong-pagar-crash-state-coroner-finds-the-5-mens-deaths-to-be-a-traffic-related-misadventure,Tanjong Pagar crash: Deaths of 5 men in burning car ruled a traffic-related misadventure,"SINGAPORE - The deaths of five men after a car crashed in Tanjong Pagar on Feb 13 last year and burst into flames has been ruled a traffic-related misadventure. Delivering his findings on Wednesday (Aug 24) in an inquiry into the men's deaths, State Coroner Adam Nakhoda said the sad and tragic event involved the deaths of five men who were in the prime of their lives. State Coroner Nakhoda added that this case serves to remind other motorists not to operate vehicles when they are under the influence of alcohol. One of the men, Mr Jonathan Long Junwei, 29, had clocked speeds of up to 182kmh while he was driving the white BMW M4 in the area, shortly before it ploughed into the pillar of a shophouse and burst into flames at around 5.40am that day. It was travelling at an estimated speed of between 87kmh and 99kmh at the point of impact. The speed limit for the stretch along Tanjong Pagar Road is 50kmh. State Coroner Nakhoda described the speed Mr Long was driving as staggering and said there was a shocking lack of consideration and a disregard for his own safety, as well as that of his passengers and other road users. Prior to the accident, which happened on the second day of Chinese New Year in 2021, State Coroner Nakhoda said it appeared that Mr Long had intended to show the others how fast the car could be driven and that there was an element of bravado to it. Three others had driven the car before the accident, and before Mr Long took the wheel, there was no evidence he cajoled the others to get in the car and they appeared to have got in of their own volition, State Coroner Nakhoda said. An autopsy later showed that Mr Long, who had recently bought the car, had a blood alcohol reading of 86mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood. This exceeded the legal limit of 80mg per 100ml. His four passengers were also killed in the crash. They were: Mr Wilson Teo Qi Xiang, 26; Mr Elvin Tan Yong Hao, 28; Mr Eugene Yap Zheng Min, 29; and Mr Gary Wong Hong Chieh, 29. In February last year, the police said this case involved the most number of people killed in a single traffic accident in the past decade. During earlier proceedings in June involving the inquiry, Traffic Police investigator, Senior Staff Sergeant Muhammad Firdaus Suleiman, told the court that shortly before the tragedy, Mr Long and his friends were at a Chinese New Year gathering in Ang Mo Kio where they had consumed alcoholic drinks. They then left for Hong Jja Jang restaurant in Tanjong Pagar Road, where they continued drinking. The eatery was run by Mr Park Se Jin, whose age was not mentioned in court. Senior Staff Sgt Firdaus added that witnesses said Mr Long later decided to show his newly purchased BMW to his friends. The group took turns at the wheel, each driving once around the Tanjong Pagar area. Mr Yap, who was later found to have 119mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood, was the first to take it for a ride that morning. He drove it from the Tanjong Pagar restaurant towards Keppel, and made a U-turn on Enggor Street. After that, he drove the car along Tanjong Pagar Road towards Maxwell Road before stopping near the eatery. The court heard that Mr Yap had driven the car at speeds of between 77kmh and 88kmh. Mr Park then took the wheel and drove at speeds of up to 59kmh while following the same path. A woman identified as Ms Phoo Yi Lin then took over. She also followed the same path, clocking speeds of between 109kmh and 130kmh. But dashcam footage taken from a taxi in the area suggested Ms Phoo may have hit speeds of up to 181kmh, said Senior Staff Sgt Firdaus. Mr Long was the fourth driver, and four of his friends - Mr Teo, Mr Tan, Mr Yap and Mr Wong - joined him in the vehicle, which had designated seats for only the driver and three passengers. Mr Long was speeding along Tanjong Pagar Road when the car skidded and mounted a kerb. The car's airbags did not deploy in the accident that killed all five men. Mr Long's fiancee, former air stewardess Raybe Oh Siew Huey, then 26, tried to help the occupants but got badly burned. She spent four months at Singapore General Hospital and needed multiple reconstructive surgical operations. Senior Staff Sgt Firdaus testified that Mr Long, Mr Yap and Mr Tan died of severe burns. Mr Teo died of severe burns and a spinal injury, while Mr Wong died of severe burns and pelvic injuries. The five men had one common link – all had at one time worked as representatives for Aviva Financial Advisers. Mr Wilson Teo Qi Xiang, 26; Mr Elvin Tan Yong Hao, 28; Mr Eugene Yap Zheng Min, 29 and Mr Jonathan Long Junwei, 29, were financial advisers at the firm when the tragedy occurred. The fifth man, Mr Gary Wong Hong Chieh, 29, was a former representative for the company at the time. Here are more details about the men: 1. Mr Long
- Driver of the car when it crashed.
- Clocked speeds of up to 182kmh before it crashed. The speed limit for the stretch along Tanjong Pagar Road was 50kmh.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/imda-principal-consultant-jailed-four-months-over-cheating-offences,"Man cheated IMDA of more than $41,000 to benefit his own business","SINGAPORE - Unsure if his contract at the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) would be renewed, a principal consultant there set up a business. But he used the company while he was still with IMDA to receive jobs from the statutory board without telling his employer of his vested interest. On Wednesday (Aug 24), Jeffrey Ho Kiat, 56, was jailed for four months after he pleaded guilty to three cheating charges. Four other charges were taken into consideration during his sentencing . He was given a discharge amounting to an acquittal for five other charges. Ho cheated IMDA of more than $41,000 together with his accomplice - his former secretary Ng Sok Luan, who he became acquainted with in 2006 during one of his previous roles in the public service.  Ng, 44, was sentenced to two months' jail last month. On Wednesday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Grace Lim said the pair developed an intimate relationship and that Ng continued to work with Ho until Oct 31, 2016. In her written sentencing submissions for Ho, DPP Lim added that the pair abused the position of trust that Ho was placed in by virtue of his role at IMDA. She said: ""Given that he was an expert in the area of design, his IMDA colleagues had trusted him to provide recommendations for suitable vendors who could carry out the required work. ""Instead, Jeffrey abused this trust by directing the work to his own companies."" DPP Lim told the court that Ho was seconded to IMDA some time after November 2016, and joined officially a year later on a contract basis. In April 2017, he set up Goldentree Innovations with Ng as he wanted to set up a sustainable business if his IMDA contract was not renewed. Ng's brother-in-law Low Kian Tong was registered as director and shareholder of the company, while Ng and Ho provided start-up capital for it. DPP Lim said Ho and Ng, who was with the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) then, were aware that they were required to declare their interest in Goldentree to their respective employers. But they did not do so. In March 2018, Ng and Ho set up Creative Futures Agency (CFA). Ng again got Mr Low to be registered as its director, and Ng took over in July 2018. Ho was again aware of his need to declare this interest but did not. When Ho was asked to work on various projects with IMDA, including one for the Punggol Digital District, the companies he recommended included CFA, Goldentree and another company called Zelkova Serrata (S). Two of the jobs were awarded to Zelkova on April 17 and Aug 20, 2018, and one was awarded to CFA in November that year. Ho informed Ng that a director of Zelkova would assist in providing supporting quotations and invoices for a few IMDA projects. Based on his instructions, she prepared quotations and sent them to the director for his submission to IMDA. While Zelkova was awarded the job, the actual work was carried out by Goldentree. IMDA paid Zelkova $5,965 on July 10, 2018, and $5,985 on Oct 5, 2018. It paid CFA $5,990 some time after November 2018. Ng made restitution to IMDA on April 14 this year, and Ho on May 11 this year. In their written mitigation, Ho's lawyers Paul Loy and Samuel Navindran from Wong Partnership said Ho had been worried about his financial situation and was anxious when he was asked to leave a position with MCI in 2016. They said Ho, who was then 50, was the primary breadwinner for his wife, a part-time lecturer, and three children. The lawyers also said he ""had a long and storied career in Singapore's design industry"" and listed Ho's previous contributions, including being the founding director of the School of Design at Singapore Polytechnic and successfully leading the push and application for Singapore to be appointed a Unesco Creative City of Design. Ho was suspended from the IMDA pending the conclusion of court proceedings against him. He is no longer employed by the agency, said an IMDA spokesman in response to queries from The Straits Times.  The spokesman added: “IMDA requires all staff to perform their duty with the highest level of integrity and professionalism and to ensure that good financial accountability and governance is upheld.” Ho could have been jailed for up to three years, fined, or both for each cheating charge he faced."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/prosecution-appeals-for-ex-ceo-of-the-prive-group-to-be-jailed-over-assault-on-teen,Prosecution appeals for ex-CEO of The Prive Group to be jailed over assault on teen,"SINGAPORE - The prosecution on Wednesday (Aug 24) appealed to the High Court, arguing that the former chief executive of food and beverage firm The Prive Group should be jailed for at least eight weeks for assaulting a 13-year-old boy. Deputy Attorney-General Tai Wei Shyong sought to overturn a 12-month mandatory treatment order (MTO) that was handed down to Vu Han Jean-Luc Kha, 44, by a district judge in March. Offenders given an MTO have to undergo treatment for the psychiatric condition that contributed to their offences, instead of serving jail time. Mr Tai said the facts of the case warranted a jail term and that handing down an MTO would send the wrong message on how public interest is protected. The prosecutor argued that Kha's mental disorder did not justify an MTO. He highlighted that Kha saw a psychiatrist only on Nov 17, 2020 - a year after the drunk French national verbally abused and punched the boy on Nov 22, 2019, while they were in a lift. Dr Ken Ung gave an initial diagnosis of adjustment disorder. Kha then sought a second opinion at the Institute of Mental Health, where Dr Pamela Ng diagnosed him with bipolar disorder on Feb 26, 2021. Kha adopted Dr Ng's diagnosis in seeking an MTO. But Mr Tai argued that Dr Ng's reports were premised on incomplete facts based on self-reported information from Kha. The prosecutor said Kha failed to tell Dr Ng, among other things, the exact words that he had used to abuse the victim and the fact that he had punched the victim in the head. Mr Tai argued that Dr Ng did not adequately explain how the bipolar disorder contributed to Kha's actions. ""We believe that public confidence in the system would be eroded if, on these facts, the respondent is allowed to evade his just deserts by relying on a psychiatric decision which was diagnosed long after the incident and based on self-reported facts,"" he said in written submissions. Defence counsel Teh Ee-Von cited other cases of offenders without mental disorders who were fined or given short jail terms for causing minor hurt to children. She questioned why Kha should be punished more severely. Ms Teh said her client did not know he had bipolar disorder before the incident, noting that mental disorders often go undetected. She argued that Kha has shown rehabilitative potential and that he has since stopped drinking alcohol, which can exacerbate the symptoms. Justice Vincent Hoong reserved judgment and will give his decision at a later date. Kha had pleaded guilty to one count each of causing hurt and harassment. On Nov 22, 2019, the victim, who was 13 years old then, and his younger brother, who was 12, were in a lift in Parklane Shopping Mall in Selegie at around 8.15pm when an intoxicated Kha and another man entered the lift. Kha directed lewd comments at the victim, and for no apparent reason, punched the victim on his left temple, causing the boy to fall backwards and slam his left upper arm on the lift's handrail. He then hurled vulgarities at the victim, who grabbed Kha's hands to prevent him from hitting him again. Kha exclaimed: ""You want to challenge me? Why do you want to challenge me?"" The other man held Kha back and pushed him out of the lift after it stopped on the first storey. But Kha refused to leave and slapped the victim on his left cheek. The incident mentally scarred the victim and he was still scared of taking a lift about a year later. The Singaporean teenager, who cannot be named due to a gag order, also experienced flashbacks of the attack and had difficulties sleeping. For causing hurt, an offender can be jailed for up to two years and fined up to $5,000. For harassment, an offender can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $5,000."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/jail-for-ex-prison-officer-who-gave-inmate-information-about-other-inmates,Jail for ex-prison officer who gave inmate info on other inmates,"SINGAPORE - A prison officer unlawfully gave a disruptive inmate information about other inmates, hoping that the inmate would not create problems for him at work. Muhammad Fattahullah Mohd Nordin, 38, who is no longer a prison officer, was sentenced to 10 weeks’ jail on Wednesday (Aug 24) after he pleaded guilty to two charges under the Computer Misuse Act. He had shared the information with Abdul Karim Mohamed Kuppai Khan, 36, who was also known as “Dio”. Another former prison officer, Muhammad Zul Helmy Abdul Latip, 33, is also accused of committing similar offences. The cases involving Abdul Karim and Zul Helmy are pending. Fattahullah, who used to be a sergeant, joined the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) in August 2008. In 2017 or 2018, he was transferred to Tanah Merah Prison, where he got to know Abdul Karim who was allegedly a secret society headman. Deputy Public Prosecutor Kelvin Chong said: “The accused was also aware... that Dio was known to be a disruptive inmate.” Abdul Karim would ask Fattahullah for information on other inmates, such as their locations in the prisons. This data was available on an SPS computer system, known as Prison Operations and Rehabilitation System II (Ports II), which Fattahullah had access to. All SPS staff had received training on the relevant prison standing order over the use of the agency’s computing devices and networks, including Ports II. DPP Chong said the standing order expressly stated that the unauthorised disclosure, alteration, removal or endangerment of classified material is an offence. Despite this, Fattahullah repeatedly told Abdul Karim information regarding the other inmates. “Dio approached the accused to ask for information on the locations of the other inmates on at least five occasions around January to June 2020. Dio would usually check via the intercom in his cell to see who was manning the housing unit control centre,” the DPP added. “After knowing the accused was manning the scene, Dio would give the accused the inmate’s number and ask (the accused) to check the cluster they were located at.”
  On multiple occasions in 2020, Fattahullah accessed Ports II to obtain information without authority and shared it with Abdul Karim. The court heard that Abdul Karim had even once asked Fattahullah for the home address of a particular inmate. Fattahullah declined this request after realising the inmate was Abdul Karim’s enemy. Court documents did not state how Fattahullah’s offences came to light, but the SPS later referred the case to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau. Fattahullah’s bail was set at $5,000 on Wednesday, and he was told to surrender himself at the State Courts on Sept 5 to begin serving his sentence. In a statement on Wednesday, SPS said it started internal investigations into the case in November 2020, after several contraband items and a note containing confidential information were found in an inmate’s cell during a routine check. Its spokesman added: “The investigations revealed that these former prison officers had allegedly accessed and provided confidential information to the inmate on separate occasions. SPS immediately referred the case to the CPIB for their investigation.  “SPS also interdicted them from service, pending the outcome of the investigation. They... subsequently resigned from service.”

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/pub-owner-jailed-over-use-of-blue-light-to-warn-performers-of-police-presence,Pub owner jailed over use of blue light to warn performers of police presence,"SINGAPORE - A blue light was installed in a Circular Road pub to warn performers engaging in illicit activity of the presence of police nearby. When it was switched on, performers had to stop all activities and move away from their customers towards a table near the entrance. The pub's owner, Lee Seet Khiang, 50, who had instructed his staff on the use of the light, was sentenced to six weeks' jail on Monday (Aug 22) after pleading guilty to two charges of obstruction of justice. Another similar charge was taken into consideration during the Malaysian's sentencing. Deputy Public Prosecutor Tin Shu Min said in court documents that Lee, a Singaporean permanent resident, took over as the registered owner and licensee of Club Para Para in September 2019. Lee was in charge of hiring and managing the performers at Club Para Para and another pub, Beer Inn, at nearby Lorong Telok, where he had been employed since 2012 or 2013. On March 22, 2020, a former performer at another Circular Road pub called T.G.I.F. e-mailed the Ministry of Manpower to allege that its performers were providing sexual services to encourage customers to spend more on drinks. Investigations into T.G.I.F. revealed that Beer Inn and Club Para Para were affiliated to it, and performers were cross-deployed across the three pubs. Performers at Beer Inn and Club Para Para sat with or mingled with customers, with at least four at each pub providing sexual services to customers in the premises, said DPP Tin. ""The performers were motivated to do so as they would earn a commission from the drinks purchased by customers,"" said the DPP, adding that they needed to earn extra commission to pay off their debts, which were incurred when they came to Singapore to work. She also said that Lee was aware that performers in Club Para Para were sitting with or mingling with the customers, which was a breach of its public entertainment licence conditions. In April 2019, Lee told Noraida Ghani, who had started working there as a manager, about the blue light and its purpose. She then briefed performers on what they should do when they see the blue light. ""These were acts she had done on the (Lee's) instigation,"" said DPP Tin. Between April 2019 and March 2020, Noraida briefed at least seven performers about the blue light, and recalled seeing the light switched on about seven to eight times. Lee also briefed Zainabbun Abdul Jalil when she started working in the pub in mid-2019. She was stationed outside to welcome customers and also to switch on the blue light if she saw the police nearby. Between mid-2019 and March 2020, Zainabbun switched on the blue light using a remote control about four to five times a week. For their role in the offences, Noraida received a 12-month conditional warning while Zainabbun received a stern warning. For each charge, Lee could have been jailed for up to seven years, fined or both. Last Wednesday (Aug 17), a bouncer pleaded guilty to six charges of obstructing the course of justice after he tipped off other outlets when the police raided nightspots where he worked or when he saw police vehicles in the area. The 26-year-old man, who also faced a charge each of affray and causing hurt by a rash act, was sentenced to 17 weeks' jail and fined $3,000. Eight others who were part of one of the WhatsApp chat groups that he sent tip-offs to were sentenced last Friday."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/jail-for-car-driver-who-hit-girl-9-on-zebra-crossing-causing-her-to-suffer-brain-injury,"Driver hit girl, 9, at zebra crossing, ignored mum's plea for help","SINGAPORE - A nine-year-old girl was walking home from Bedok Mall with her mother when they were hit by a car at a zebra crossing. Despite the mother's pleas for help, the driver, who was on delivery jobs, drove off and continued his deliveries. The crash caused the girl to suffer a severe traumatic brain injury, which needed surgery. The driver, Sheik Salim Said, was sentenced to five months' jail on Monday (Aug 22) after he pleaded guilty to a charge of careless driving causing grievous hurt. Three other charges, including one for driving the car away from the scene after the accident, were taken into consideration during his sentencing. The 46-year-old Singaporean was also given a five-year driving ban that will take effect after he is released from jail. The victims cannot be named as the girl's identity is protected under the Children and Young Persons Act. Deputy Public Prosecutor Jeremy Bin said in court documents that Sheik Salim was driving along Bedok North Drive at or around 8.20pm on April 18 last year when he filtered to a slip road to head to Bedok North Avenue 1. While on the slip road, he said, the accused drove ""without due care and attention by failing to keep a proper lookout for pedestrians along the designated zebra crossing"". As a result, he collided into the girl and her 37-year-old mother who were on the zebra crossing and had right of way. At no point before the collision did he slow down his vehicle, said DPP Bin. After the accident, Sheik Salim exited his vehicle and moved the victims to the side of the road. Ignoring the woman's pleas for help and to call for an ambulance, he then drove off. Members of the public later called for emergency assistance, and an ambulance took the victims to Changi General Hospital. The police tracked down Sheik Salim the day after the accident using information provided to them. Apart from the brain injury, the girl also had abrasions and a shinbone fracture. She was sedated for 10 days in the children's intensive care unit. She was discharged on May 13 and given 73 days of hospitalisation leave. DPP Bin said that as at April 5 this year, she continues to suffer from short-term memory problems, as well as problems in mathematics. Her parents have also reported behavioural changes in their child. The girl's mother, who had abrasions on her left elbow and a tender right foot, was admitted to hospital for three days and given 30 days of hospitalisation leave. DPP Bin said the car sustained dents on its bonnet from the impact of the collision. He also noted that the weather was fine, the road surface was dry and traffic flow was light at the time of the accident. For careless driving causing grievous hurt, Sheik Salim could have been fined up to $5,000, jailed for up to two years, or both."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/jail-for-ex-hr-personnel-who-used-former-colleagues-particulars-to-unlawfully-obtain-108-masks,Jail for woman who used ex-colleagues' particulars to obtain 108 masks,"SINGAPORE - A former human resource personnel of an engineering firm obtained her then colleagues' personal data without their consent and later used their particulars to unlawfully collect 108 face masks from vending machines in 2020. Koh Pek Keang, who held the position at G-Tech Engineering from 2000 to 2014, committed the offences as she did not want to fork out extra cash to buy face masks for her family. The court heard that she unlawfully obtained 54 packs containing 108 masks and 162 filters worth nearly $650 in all. On Tuesday (Aug 23), she was sentenced to 16 weeks' jail after she pleaded guilty to a cheating charge. Koh, 43, also admitted to retaining the personal data of 60 G-Tech employees which she had obtained without their consent. Deputy Public Prosecutor Jeremy Bin said that during Koh's tenure as a human resource personnel, she managed the personal data of the firm's employees. The information included their National Registration Identity Card (NRIC) or foreign identification numbers. The DPP added: ""Throughout the accused's employment as a human resource personnel, she concealed the fact that she retained a complete database of the employees' personal data for purposes beyond the scope of her job. ""She continued to retain updated databases of the employees' personal data until, at earliest, September 2014, shortly before she ceased working for G-Tech."" Six years later, in 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic began and Singapore investment company, Temasek, started a nationwide mask distribution exercise in November that year. Each resident could collect one free mask kit from vending machines between Nov 30 and Dec 13, 2020, by keying in his or her personal particulars into the machines. These included their NRIC numbers or any other government-issued identification. Koh decided to redeem more face masks than she was entitled to using the data of G-Tech employees that she had retained. She also printed out at least 54 pieces of paper - each containing the personal data of an employee. Koh then drove to Clementi Community Centre on Nov 30, 2020, and collected masks that her former colleagues were entitled to from the vending machines there. Her offences came to light when five people later filed separate police reports stating that they could not redeem their free face masks from designated vending machines. On Tuesday, DPP Bin asked for her to be sentenced to at least four months and two weeks' jail, stressing that her offences were difficult to trace. He said: ""The accused's crime was not one that could have ordinarily been detected by Temasek itself as Temasek had no means of verifying the actual identity of persons who collected face masks at the designated vending machines. ""Even after several police reports were made, significant time and resources had to be expended to identify the accused through CCTV (closed-circuit television) images."" Koh's bail was set at $10,000 on Tuesday and she was ordered to surrender herself at the State Courts on Sept 13 to begin serving her sentence."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/woman-allegedly-told-victim-to-not-sit-beside-her-on-bus-then-hurled-racial-insult, Woman allegedly nudged victim in bus before hurling racial insult at her,"SINGAPORE - She was on bus service number 51 when she allegedly used her elbow to nudge the arm of an Indian woman without the latter’s consent. The pair later alighted and Connie Soh, 47, is then said to have abused the woman with a profanity-laced racial insult. Soh, who is accused of one count each of using criminal force on the woman and deliberately uttering words to wound her racial feelings, had been expected to plead guilty in a district court on Tuesday (Aug 23). But after a closed-door session in chambers before District Judge Shawn Ho, her case was adjourned for a pre-trial conference on Oct 5. It was not heard in open court why the case was adjourned. Soh allegedly used criminal force on the woman when they were on the bus near Haw Par Villa MRT station at around 10.25pm on Nov 30 last year. The two women were near a West Coast Road block of flats about 20 minutes later,  when Soh allegedly abused her with vulgar language. Soh, who was unrepresented, is now out on bail of $5,000. For using criminal force, an offender can be jailed for up to three months and fined up to $1,500. And for deliberately uttering words to wound another person's racial feelings, an offender can be jailed for up to three years and fined. Several offenders in unrelated cases here have been dealt with in court after they abused others with racial insults. In May, Peethambaran Dilip, 69, was sentenced to six weeks’ jail after he pleaded guilty to two harassment charges. The repeat offender also admitted to one count of uttering words with the deliberate intention of wounding a man’s racial feelings. Peethambaran had committed a range of offences including hurling racial insults at a library officer in June last year. In another case in July last year, Muhammad Sadiq Syed Kadir, 29, was sentenced to 12 weeks’ jail and given a fine of $1,000. Among other things, he had verbally abused a man with racial slurs in December 2018.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/115-years-jail-for-man-who-sexually-abused-underaged-stepdaughter-and-sister-in-law,11½ years' jail for man who sexually abused underaged stepdaughter and sister-in-law,"SINGAPORE - A 50-year-old man who sexually abused two underaged relatives, telling them he was touching them for ""family love"", was sentenced to 11 ½ years' jail on Monday (Aug 22). The High Court heard that the man began sexually abusing his stepdaughter when she was eight years old and his sister-in-law - his wife's stepsister - when she was nine. He pleaded guilty to a charge of aggravated sexual assault by penetration and two charges of outraging the modesty of a person under the age of 14. Nine other similar charges were taken into consideration during sentencing. The man cannot be named owing to a gag order to protect the victims' identities. The sexual abuse began in 2014, when the man lived in a three-room flat with his 34-year-old wife and her daughter from an earlier marriage. His sister-in-law lived one floor above with her parents and would often visit the accused's flat after school to play video games and watch TV with his stepdaughter. On those visits when the unemployed man was the only adult in the flat, he would sit very close to his sister-in-law and touch her waist and thigh. Over time, his actions became more intrusive. On multiple occasions, he slid his hand under her clothes and sexually violated her, telling her that he had touched her for medicinal purposes and family love. The abuse only stopped after a new tenant moved in. Around the same time, the man also touched his stepdaughter on numerous occasions while she was playing games or watching videos on her phone. He also assured her that this was part of ""family love"" and instructed her not to tell anyone about what he had done. In 2015, almost on a daily basis, he would slide his hand into the girl's underwear to touch her, while she remained silent. The abuse stopped when mother and daughter moved out after the couple decided to get a divorce. In 2018, the sister-in-law realised that what the man had done to her was wrong after she learnt about inappropriate behaviour from a sexual education class in school. She cried for two hours in school but did not tell her family about the abuse. It was only in February last year (2021), when she had an argument with her father, that she revealed that the man had touched her inappropriately. Her father took her to make a police report, and investigations led to the discovery that the other girl had also been abused. After his arrest, the man was diagnosed to be a paedophile."

Ramanathan Sujithran duped nearly 200 foreign nationals of $308,815 in total. He was working for PropNex Realty before he was terminated in July 2017 and deregistered as a real estate salesperson. Despite this, the Singaporean continued to cheat his victims by using his own real estate firm, TSR Logistics. Ramanathan, now 54, was sentenced on Monday (Aug 22) to 4 ½ years' jail after he pleaded guilty to 11 charges including multiple counts of cheating. They involved 71 victims who were cheated of $138,365 in total. Ninety-seven other charges, including those linked to the remaining amount, were considered during sentencing. Deputy Public Prosecutors Louis Ngia and Ong Xin Jie stated in court documents: ""Rental scams do not simply occasion monetary loss to their victims but often cause much anguish and uncertainty, as they threaten a very basic and fundamental human need (such as) a roof over one's head."" To attract his victims, Ramanathan would claim in advertisements that certain units were available for rent in Singapore, the court heard. When prospective tenants responded to the advertisements, he would enter into tenancy agreements with them. The prosecutors added: ""At all times, the accused knew that he was in no position to satisfy the tenancy agreements that he had entered into, and that he would not be renting out the units to... the (prospective tenants) for the periods listed in the tenancy agreements."" Despite this, Ramanathan would ask them to pay him a sum of money as ""deposit"" to confirm the rental. On or around the moving-in date, he would give repeated excuses to the prospective tenants that they were not allowed to move into the unit yet. The tenancy agreement would later be cancelled, with Ramanathan pocketing the ""deposits"" for his own use. In one instance, he stated in an advertisement in May 2017 that a residential unit in Hougang Avenue 7 was available for rent. Investigations later revealed this unit was offered for rent without the homeowner's knowledge. The owner had instead engaged Ramanathan's services as a property agent to rent out only the master bedroom of the unit. Three prospective tenants, all Indian nationals, responded to the advertisement and entered an agreement with him to rent the whole unit. Ramanathan cheated the trio of $1,400 each, and none of them was able to move into the unit. The court heard that he had used a similar method to cheat his other victims. Out of the total amount taken from all his victims, only about $29,000 was returned to some of them. For each count of cheating, an offender can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined."

He had put up a listing on e-marketplace Carousell in February this year and deceived the victims into thinking he had Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) tickets available for sale. The VTL between Singapore and Malaysia was launched in November last year and allowed people to travel between the two countries on designated bus services without having to serve quarantine. After receiving payment from the victims, he disappeared and removed his listing from Carousell. On Aug 16, Solehudin, 27, was sentenced to eight weeks' jail after pleading guilty to one count of cheating. Two other similar charges were taken into consideration for his sentencing. According to court documents, Solehudin had cheated three people of $195, $97.50 and $97 respectively. The police received a report about the scam on Feb 19 this year. They established his identity through investigations and arrested him on March 3. In a statement on Monday (Aug 22), the police advised members of the public to be careful when making online purchases. ""Opt for buyer protection by using in-built payment options that release payment to the seller only upon delivery. Whenever possible, avoid making advance payments or direct bank transfers to the seller,"" they said. The police added that scammers may entice buyers to contact them directly through messaging platforms such as WhatsApp and WeChat by offering a better or faster deal if bank transfer payments are made directly to them. ""They may also use a local bank account or provide a copy of an NRIC or driver's licence to make you believe that they are genuine sellers. Do not fall for it."" In a similar case, a 25-year-old man was arrested in February this year for cheating two victims into paying $300 for a PlayStation 5. He did not deliver the item and used the ill-gotten gains for his personal expenses. The maximum penalty for cheating is a 10-year jail term and a fine."

The group had planned to kayak from West Coast to Pulau Hantu, but decided to detour to Pandan River when they realised they did not have a safety boat to help them navigate the open seas. While crossing the river, Mr Liow saw what he first thought was a gunny sack floating on the water. Speaking to The Straits Times, the sales manager said: ""We got closer and then I saw the tattoos on the man's back and his white hair. ""I remembered reading in the news that a man had allegedly fallen into the same river just yesterday, so we decided to call the Police Coast Guard for help."" On Monday, the police confirmed that they received a call for assistance at 9.57am. The police said: ""The body of a 60-year-old man was subsequently retrieved from the waters. Based on preliminary investigations, the police do not suspect foul play. ""The man was reported missing by his next-of-kin on Sunday."" The Straits Times understands that the body is of the man who was reported to have fallen into Pandan River on Sunday. On Sunday, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said it received a call for water rescue at about 6.50am at the canal near Block 291E Bukit Batok Street 24. The emergency responders also searched the area around Block 408 Pandan Gardens and along the canal nearby. SCDF said: ""The search operation was called off after 4½ hours as there was no sign of the person."" In an separate statement on Monday, SCDF said it received a call for assistance at the river at 10.15am and its firefighters helped to bring the body back on land. While waiting for the authorities, Mr Liow and his friends fended off otters that tried to approach the body. Even after the police and SCDF arrived, the kayakers remained at the scene. Mr Liow said: ""It felt wrong to walk away. It was our duty to take care of the body so we could bring it back safely and give his family closure."" Two kayakers from Mr Liow's group, Mr Bernard Lim, 56, and Mr Chong Chee Voon, 59, helped to tow the body to land using a tandem kayak. They had volunteered for this task as they found that their kayak was nimble enough to navigate the river, which was very narrow in some parts. Securing the body with a rope, Mr Lim, the head of procurement at a supply chain firm, held on to the body while Mr Chong navigated their kayak across the shallow water safely to shore. Mr Chong, a retired chief financial officer, said: ""I was worried as the kayaks we were in were inflatable boats and we came close to hitting a metal structure. ""But we knew what we had to do. Anyone would have done the same."" At about noon, the kayakers handed over the body to the authorities. Police investigations are under way."

On Monday (Aug 22), in what prosecutors said is one of the worst cases of paedophilic sexual abuse of young boys that have come before the court, the 30-year-old man was sentenced to 42 years' jail and 24 strokes of the cane. The man, described by prosecutors as a ""dangerous paedophile"", pleaded guilty to six charges of aggravated sexual assault by penetration committed against four victims when they were between nine and 11 years old. Another 54 charges - including one for aggravated rape, another 23 for sexual assault by penetration and 22 for sexual penetration of a minor - were considered during sentencing. The man, who cannot be named owing to a gag order to protect the children’s identities, admitted to sexually assaulting the 11 boys between 2013 and 2020, mostly at the centre and in his home. He also admitted to preying on a 12th victim he had met on dating app Grindr when the boy was 13 to 14 years old. High Court Judge Mavis Chionh said: ""This was an accused who relentlessly and cynically took advantage of his position at the after-school care centre and the access it afforded him to a pool of potential victims to carry on his campaign of sexual abuse for some seven years."" The man ""exhibited a calculated cunning in the manner he preyed on the naivete and childish sensibilities of his young victims"", added Justice Chionh. ""So successful was the accused at worming his way into the naive affections of his young charges that their parents came to trust him as well,"" she said. The man was allowed by the parents of victim V4 to take the boy out for movies and dinner, played badminton with V2 and his family on weekends, and was invited by V3's parents to their home for meals. The court heard that the man spent his primary school years at the centre, which provided after-school care and enrichment courses for children aged six to 12. After his national service, he returned to help out at the centre and was given a monthly allowance that was gradually raised to $900 in 2020. He gained the boys' trust by professing his love for them, plying them with food and mobile phone game credits, and taking them to his home to play video games. He began with seemingly innocent physical contact, such as hugging them, before progressing to performing sexual acts on the boys and getting them to perform sexual acts on him. On several occasions, he took two or three victims with him into the shower room. At times, he made the boys perform sexual acts on each other. He also recorded videos of the assaults - 105 clips were found in his electronic devices. The court heard that in 2015, the mother of victim V7, who was in Primary 5, confronted the man over the text messages, such as ""I love you baby"", he sent her son. The man accused her of neglecting her son and went on to commit further sexual assaults on V7. Deputy Public Prosecutor Sean Teh told the court that on April 22, 2020, the South Australia Joint Anti Child Exploitation Team alerted the Singapore police that an e-mail account linked to the man had received at least 17 e-mails containing links to download child pornography. The man's home was raided on Aug 11, 2020. After his arrest, he was diagnosed with paedophilic disorder and was assessed to pose a moderate to high risk of reoffending. DPP Teh sought 39 to 42 years' jail, while defence counsel Kalaithasan Karuppaya sought 33 to 40 years' jail. Each charge of sexual assault by penetration carries between eight and 20 years' jail and at least 12 strokes of the cane. - In 1997, Kelvin Lim Hock Hin was sentenced to 40 years’ jail for sexual offences against five boys aged eight to 12. The diagnosed paedophile befriended the victims and enticed them with promises of free tuition and gifts. - In 2009, Bala Kuppusamy was sentenced to 42 years’ jail and 24 strokes of the cane for robbing seven women and sexually assaulting three of them. He targeted women who walked alone at night and in some cases, dragged the victims to secluded spots and sexually assaulted them. - In 2014, Azuar Ahamad, who drugged multiple victims and raped and sexually assaulted four of them, was sentenced to 37½ years’ jail and 24 strokes of the cane.
He committed sexual offences against 22 women in 2008 and 2009 after getting to know them online. - In June this year, a part-time tutor who sexually abused eight children over a 16-year period, including some with special needs, was sentenced to 45 years’ jail.
He raped three girls when they were aged between five and eight."

But he did not, and on Monday (Aug 22), the 47-year-old Singaporean was fined $15,000 after pleading guilty to three charges under the Companies Act. Ong, who is also known as Alain, was also disqualified from acting as a director or taking part in the management of a company for two years. It was previously reported that Ong, whose wife, actress Vivian Lai, used to appear in Pokka advertisements, was asked to leave Pokka International, which is wholly owned by Pokka Corporation (Singapore), in September 2018. Between 2010 and 2017, he held various positions in the two Pokka entities, including director of both entities, while beneficially owning 40 per cent of shares in drinks company Asian Story Corporation (ASC). ASC was incorporated on Dec 15, 2009, and its shares were 100 per cent legally owned by a man named Mr Amos Wang Chia Ye. Ong did not wish to legally own ASC shares in his own name as he was an employee of Pokka when ASC was incorporated, and he did not take any dividends from ASC, Deputy Public Prosecutor David Koh told the court on Monday. The two Pokka entities entered into three agreements with ASC - a distribution agreement in 2010 and a distribution framework in 2017 with Pokka International, and a manufacturing agreement in 2016 with Pokka Corp. On all three occasions, Ong did not disclose his interest in these transactions to Pokka International or Pokka Corp. ASC was acquired by coffee shop operator Kimly for $24 million on July 2, 2018, and a cashier’s order for $9.6 million was issued to Ong by Mr Wang. Ong was placed on garden leave from Pokka Corp on Sept 19, 2018, following internal investigations. The following month, the firm’s group chief executive officer made a police report and on Nov 29, 2018, Kimly announced that it had received a notification from Pokka Corp of its intention to terminate its manufacturing agreement with ASC. Kimly then agreed with Mr Wang and ASC to rescind Kimly’s acquisition of ASC and the full sum received by Mr Wang for the acquisition was returned to Kimly between Jan 8, 2019, and Dec 30, 2020. Ong had returned $9 million to Mr Wang on Nov 5, 2018, and the remaining $600,000 in January 2019. In July 2019, Pokka filed a civil suit against Ong, which was settled. Ong was represented by Mr Timothy Tan and Ms Tara Heng from Trident Law Corporation and in mitigating for their client, they said he was remorseful and regrets having failed to disclose his interest in ASC. They added that in 2009, Ong was concerned by Pokka losing its market share and that it had gained from the three agreements made with ASC. They said: “Be it gaining market share, warding off a competitor or expanding Pokka’s capabilities, Pokka had benefited from (the agreements).” For each offence under the Companies Act, Ong could have been jailed for up to 12 months or fined up to $5,000."

As part of the sentence handed on Monday (Aug 22), Lee Hern Sing, 20, has to remain indoors from 11pm to 6am every day and perform 40 hours of community service. His parents were bonded for $5,000 to ensure his good behaviour. Before handing down the sentence, District Judge Brenda Chua noted that Lee has no prior antecedents. She noted that he is below 21 and such young offenders are in the right group for rehabilitation. Lee pleaded guilty in June to an offence under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act. He had attended a gathering, made up of more than five people, without a reasonable excuse - an offence under the Act. During earlier proceedings, the court heard that he operated a camera that recorded the antics of content creator Kotra Venkata Sai Rohankrishna, who was wearing a Spider-Man costume. Another youth, Glaxy Low Xuan Ming, donned a wrestling mask. Kotra and Low, who were both then 19, were dealt with in court earlier for flouting Covid-19 rules. On May 31, Kotra, who was the mastermind in the case, was fined $4,000, while Low was fined $2,000 on April 26. For the current case, Deputy Public Prosecutor Wu Yu Jie said Lee met Kotra and Low in Prinsep Street before 11pm on Dec 31 last year. Kotra had an idea to film interviews featuring members of the public for his YouTube channel. Lee and Low agreed to help him. Kotra and Low looked out for interviewees when they reached Clarke Quay. The DPP had said: ""When (Kotra) and Glaxy interacted with members of the public (in the surrounding area), the accused was present as well to operate the camera and lighting equipment."" One of the interviewees, Assiddiq Surani, 22, was fined $1,700 on June 10 after he pleaded guilty to an offence under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act. Videos posted online showed a rowdy crowd cheering, singing and celebrating in what the authorities called a blatant flouting of Covid-19 safe management rules and a potential superspreader event. To date, multiple men had been fined $1,500 each for breaching Covid-19 regulations. Two students who faced more than one charge each were fined $2,000 and $3,000 respectively on March 8. In an earlier statement, the Urban Redevelopment Authority said 14 people had been hauled to court for the incident, while 19 people had been issued composition fines. For committing an offence under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act, a first-time offender can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $10,000. A repeat offender can be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $20,000."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/parents-of-scdf-trainee-paramedic-in-motorcycle-accident-settle-for-38m,Parents of SCDF paramedic trainee in motorcycle accident settle for $3.8m,"SINGAPORE - She was a paramedic trainee who loved to travel, play the guitar and piano, and do cartwheels. But ever since a motorcycle accident in 2019, in which the bike she travelled on collided with another, Ms Nuruljannah Razib is minimally conscious and requires round-the-clock care at her family home. Earlier this month, a court approved a settlement payout of $3.8 million to her parents, who were acting on her behalf. Both riders involved had earlier accepted the full blame in a negligence lawsuit and their insurers will pay the compensation. The amount is believed to be among the highest reported settlements in a motorcycle accident claim here. Her parents, Mr Mohammad Razib Samsudin and Madam Anisah Salim, both 53, said that the money will help them and their children provide care for their daughter for the rest of her life. Speaking to The Sunday Times in their five-room flat in Pasir Ris last week, Madam Anisah, a primary school art teacher, said: ""Her dreams are shattered. She loved to travel. She went to Europe and said she wanted to take me to the Louvre… It's heartrending for us parents. But our focus now is on helping her."" In May last year, a High Court judge apportioned 70 per cent liability to Ms Nuruljannah's former Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) colleague, motorcyclist Calvin Loo, then 23, and 30 per cent to the second defendant See Toh Yew Mun, then 48. Ms Nuruljannah's parents were represented by lawyers Michael Han and Jamie Neo from Hoh Law Corporation. Mr Han told ST: ""Nuruljannah is receiving the best care any child can ever ask for, and that is for us the defining high point of this entire legal process."" At the time of the accident, Ms Nuruljannah, now 25, was a pillion rider on a motorcycle driven by Mr Loo in Bartley Road East on Feb 11, 2019. The two motorcycles collided near the slip road towards Kaki Bukit Avenue 4 in the direction of Tampines Avenue 10. Although she was wearing a helmet, Ms Nuruljannah suffered traumatic brain injury and critical skull fractures in addition to injuries to her spine, hands and face. She was warded for 316 days at Changi General Hospital. Her mother, who recalled sleepless nights at the hospital for two weeks, said: ""The doctors said it was time to call relatives and friends. She had three days left. It was heartrending. They said she wasn't showing good signs, so our friends and family and her friends came for prayers and she made it through."" The option of putting their daughter in a home was never a serious consideration. ""She said she would never send her grandma to a nursing home, she would take care of her; so how could we do that to her?"" said Mr Razib, visibly upset as he spoke. His wife recalled: ""She had also told me that she would take care of me (when I was old)."" Their flat has been converted into what the family calls Ward 555 - a play on the block number. Ramps were installed, doors were widened, and wheelchairs and other machinery brought in to hoist Ms Nuruljannah out of bed and help her with rehabilitation. These now occupy most of the space in the living room. Renovations to the flat to accommodate her heavy medical equipment cost $11,000, and the parents estimate that close to an additional $7,000 a month is spent to care for their daughter, not including hospital visits. When asked if Ms Nuruljannah knows what is happening, Mr Razib, a leather craftsman, said: ""We hope so. There isn't a clear indication, but doctors say patients like her may somehow just be aware."" He added that they had established a communication system, with their daughter blinking twice for ""yes"": ""I'll say 'Jannah Jannah, this is baba' and we'll give her a while and then she blinks."" Ms Nuruljannah, who has an older brother, 27, and a younger sister, 21, had six months left to complete her SCDF paramedic training when the accident occurred. When asked about her feelings towards Mr Loo, who was riding the bike her daughter was on, Madam Anisah said: ""Of course I'm upset that it happened, but being angry would take a toll on me because I know that nothing can be done to change this situation. Whatever we do now is to help her recover and (being angry) doesn't equate to helping her recover. And she needs a lot of help."" She added that the family is continually praying and giving their all to help her daughter on her long road to recovery. ""We will not give up hope,"" said Madam Anisah. Ms Nuruljannah Mohammad, then 22, and SCDF full-time national serviceman Calvin Loo who was riding the motorbike, were on their way to a work-related event on Feb 11, 2019, when they collided with another motorcycle in Bartley Road East. Ms Nuruljannah was unconscious when she was taken to Changi General Hospital, while Mr Loo and the motorcyclist were conscious. Both men suffered injuries to their body and limbs, said the SCDF then. Ms Nuruljannah and Mr Loo were attached with the Paya Lebar Fire Station at the time. Mr Loo was discharged from hospital on Feb 14 that year. The judge ruled that he was entitled to damages that take into account his life till the retirement age of 62, despite a medical forecast that his life expectancy would be shortened to 38. The boy, then nine, suffered severe traumatic brain injury when he was knocked down at a signalised pedestrian crossing in Jurong East Avenue 1 on July 6, 2011. The irreparable brain damage left him bedridden, requiring constant care. His mother quit her job as a receptionist in a law firm to look after him full-time. The High Court in July last year awarded the damages to the family after the victim, a Malaysian and permanent resident here, died in November 2015. His motorcycle collided with a bus in Tuas West Road. The bus was coming from the opposite direction when it turned right, encroaching into the motorcyclist's path. His wife, who was riding pillion, suffered multiple fractures. His family sued the bus driver and the company that owned the bus for damages."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/bullying-is-not-acceptable-and-has-no-place-in-schools-ministry-of-education,Bullying is not acceptable and has no place in schools: MOE,"SINGAPORE - Bullying is not acceptable and has no place in schools, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said on Friday night (Aug 19), days after a video emerged showing three girls beating up another girl in a Sengkang carpark. When there are reports of alleged cases of bullying, school staff seek to understand the underlying causes, as incidents of bullying can be complex, said an MOE spokesman. ""(These cases) extend into the online space, and often involve unresolved relationship issues,"" the spokesman added, in response to queries from The Straits Times. ""Counselling support is provided to the students involved, and appropriate disciplinary actions are meted out where necessary to help students understand that there are consequences for anti-social and hurtful behaviour."" MOE's response comes after the three girls, all aged 15, were arrested for wrongful confinement. They are under investigation for voluntarily causing hurt. The trio are alleged to have assaulted another teenage girl at a multi-storey carpark at Block 269 Compassvale Link. In videos circulating online on Tuesday, the victim is seen cowering on the floor as her assailants punch, kick and slap her. Two teenage boys, who are believed to be wearing T-shirts from Jurong Secondary School, can be seen looking on. Jurong Secondary did not respond to queries at press time. Over the past two years, incidents of bullying involving students include a case of hazing at Ngee Ann Polytechnic and one where an ITE College Central student slapped his schoolmate. Both incidents took place in March 2021. On Friday, MOE said that since 2012, the number of such incidents reported each year to schools has remained low, at about two incidents per 1,000 primary school pupils and five incidents per 1,000 secondary school students. When asked what policies have been put in place to address bullying, the MOE spokesman said that schools instruct students about the subject and also implement preventive measures. There are also intervention measures in place. Said the spokesman: ""All students are taught the safe channels to report serious incidents, inappropriate practices, or hurtful behaviours. Peer support leaders also help to keep online and offline spaces safe and positive, and alert teachers where needed... Schools also engage parents and work with them to provide students with the necessary support both in and out of school."" As part of efforts to establish a caring and enabling learning environment, schools appoint dedicated staff to oversee and build a peer support culture in the learning, social and cyberspace, the spokesman added. Counsellors ST spoke to said that while they have not seen a rapid increase in the number of bullying cases in recent years, videos such as the one reported on Tuesday may be the tip of the iceberg. Ms Lauren Yeo, principal counsellor of Restart Counselling for Wellness, said that besides incidents involving physical violence, bullying can also include subtler forms such as belittling a victim, body shaming and ostracisation. Ms Yeo added: ""For youth, the main reasons why they may bully others boils down to jealousy and competition. This could take place in the context of romantic relationships, changes in friendship group dynamics or social media comparisons. ""Bullies act the way they do for various reasons, such as a need for attention, to feel in control, especially when they feel vulnerable or because they do not know how else to resolve negative emotions in a more effective way."" Dr Annabelle Chow, a clinical psychologist who runs the practice Annabelle Kids, said that while the stereotype exists that youth who are bullied are weaker, for example, because they have learning difficulties or an unusual physical appearance, anyone can become a victim. Noting that the feelings of pain and helplessness can last long after an incident, Dr Chow said it is important victims know that they are not at fault and that these experiences do not define them. She said: ""Bullying is never acceptable. When you have been mistreated, know that these actions are a reflection of who the other person is and not your worth."""

The recipients could then take steps to prevent the detection of offences at their own workplaces. One of the men convicted, Muhammad Rashidi Rashid, 35, was on Friday (Aug 19) sentenced to two weeks' jail and a fine of $3,000 after he pleaded guilty to two counts of intentionally obstructing the course of justice. He was a customer service officer at Club Illusion in Clarke Quay at the time of the offences and had sent several incriminating messages via the chat group at 2.23am on Feb 17, 2019. Investigations revealed that there were ongoing police enforcement operations around River Valley at the time. The court heard that Rashidi sent another message on April 8, 2019, stating that officers, including those from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), were at several locations in the eastern part of Singapore. Deputy Public Prosecutors Lee Wei Liang and Foong Ke Hui said they had asked for Rashidi to be given a jail term for one of his charges. They said: ""The message in that charge made express reference to enforcement operations conducted by (CNB)... Drug offences are serious and attract stiff custodial sentences ranging from months to years."" Separately, the other seven men pleaded guilty to between one and three counts of intentionally obstructing the course of justice. Three of them were each fined $9,000. They are Abdul Hadi Zainuddin, 29, who was then a cashier and bartender at Club Flirtatious in Tanjong Pagar; Brandon Chung, 31, a security officer at Club 1+1 in Tanglin Shopping Centre and Club Gaga in Orchard Towers at the time of the offences; and Muhammad Rasyidi Safiee, 33, then a security officer at Club Illusion, and Club Ipanema in Orchard Road. Two men - Wilson Soon Jien Yang, 42, and Ang Whay Chong, 48 - were each fined $8,000. At the time of the offences, Soon was a security officer at Club Gaga, while Ang was the owner of Chaiyo 1 and Chaiyo 3 in Golden Mile Complex. Daniel Seet Joo Tong, 43, then an assistant general manager at Club V3 in South Bridge Road, was fined $5,000. Lim Poh Kian, 39, who was the owner of two Boat Quay pubs, Bubble Room and Hohnob, was fined $3,000. The offences had come to light after a Malaysian man was detained at the Woodlands Checkpoint on April 19, 2019, for failing to declare he had monies exceeding $20,000. A check on his mobile phone revealed the existence of the Night Owl chat group on messaging platform WhatsApp. For each count of intentionally obstructing the course of justice, an offender can be jailed for up to seven years and fined."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/shell-bukom-heist-15-weeks-jail-for-surveyor-who-reported-inaccurate-fuel-amounts-for-16k-in-bribes,Shell Bukom heist: 15 weeks' jail for surveyor who reported inaccurate fuel amounts for $16k in bribes,"SINGAPORE - A surveyor accepted bribes totalling US$12,000 (S$16,134) from his colleague in exchange for reporting the inaccurate amount of Shell gas oil loaded onto vessels and turning a blind eye to the misappropriation of fuel. As a result of Kumunan Rethana Kumaran's help, two incidents of Shell gas oil misappropriation worth around US$634,000 went undetected by Shell in 2016. Kumunan, 40, who was then working for CCIC Singapore, a company that provides cargo inspection services, was on Friday (Aug 19) sentenced to 15 weeks' jail after he pleaded guilty to a graft charge. He was also ordered to pay a penalty of $16,134, which is the amount of bribes he took. He will spend an additional four weeks behind bars if he is unable to pay it. Deputy Public Prosecutor Norman Yew said on Friday that Kumunan had accepted the bribes from another surveyor from CCIC Singapore, Noruliman Bakti. Noruliman had earlier been roped into a scheme to sell misappropriated Shell gas oil to vessels docked at the oil giant's Pulau Bukom facility. His case is still pending. As a surveyor, Kumunan was tasked to perform jobs which included checking the quantity of cargo, including fuel such as gas oil, supplied to vessels. The court heard that Noruliman approached Kumunan in 2016 to offer him money in exchange for reporting the inaccurate amount of cargo loaded onto vessels CCIC was hired to inspect. DPP Yew said Kumunan accepted the offer even though he suspected that Noruliman intended to facilitate the misappropriation of Shell gas oil. He added: ""(The accused) omitted to inspect non-nominated tanks and thereby falsely understated in his ullage reports the amount of cargo loaded onto the vessels. ""He also turned a blind eye to and kept quiet about any misappropriation of Shell gas oil."" In August 2017, a Shell representative alerted the police, stating that the company had suffered an unidentified loss of fuel worth nearly $3 million earlier that year. At least 26 people have been hauled to court over this conspiracy. On March 31, Juandi Pungot, 45, was jailed for 29 years for his role in masterminding the misappropriation of more than 200,000 tonnes of gas oil worth $128 million. This is one of the longest prison sentences for a commercial crime. For graft, an offender can be jailed for up to five years and fined up to $100,000."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/serial-conman-cheats-10-women-of-over-72k-and-gets-9-years-jail-with-no-hope-of-remission,Serial conman cheats 10 women of over $72k and gets 9 years' corrective training,"SINGAPORE - A serial conman was sentenced to nine years' corrective training for cheating 10 women of over $72,000, including a teenager looking for a sugar daddy. Tan Chip Huat, 49, was sentenced to corrective training on Friday (Aug 19) after he pleaded guilty earlier to seven charges, including cheating five victims of about $46,000. Thirteen charges linked to the remaining sum and the other victims were considered during sentencing. Corrective training is a prison regime for repeat offenders. Tan had from 2013 spent seven years serving a corrective training sentence for cheating multiple women. But within a year of his release in 2020, Tan returned to his old ways. He targeted his victims from January to August last year, and they included at least four young women whom he failed to pay after having unprotected sex. Court documents showed that while claiming to be working in the finance industry and earning about $60,000 a month, Tan posted on online classifieds website Locanto that he was looking for a ""sugar baby"". He was in fact working as a cleaner, drawing an average monthly salary of less than $2,000. Among Tan's victims were three 17-year-olds who knew one another. His first victim responded to his post on Jan 4 last year. Tan claimed he was willing to sponsor her $20,000 arts school tuition fees, but in exchange for sexual services. They met the next day in a hotel and had unprotected sex. Tan promised her he would give her an initial $10,000 but said he needed a $400 loan first because he did not have money on him at the time. He never returned the loan or gave her any money. The court heard that Tan told the student that he would withhold the money he promised unless she arranged for another person to meet him. Later that month, he asked to meet the teenager again but as she was unavailable, she introduced him to a sales promoter who agreed to have sex with him in exchange for $1,000. Tan met the girl, also 17, and they had unprotected sex. He did not pay this second victim. When he contacted the first victim again, she introduced him to her close friend, who was working as a social escort. Tan had sex with the third 17-year-old victim on Jan 13 last year and did not give her the promised $3,000. By using a similar method, he cheated a fourth victim, a 23-year-old freelance social escort, of $10,000 in July last year. In an unrelated case, the court heard that Tan had also cheated a 25-year-old woman of over $11,000 by using her credit card to buy mobile phones and other items. For each count of cheating, an offender can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined."

Scammers would approach users on the e-marketplace platform, purportedly to buy a listed item. They would ask for the victim's contact details claiming that payment would be made via well-known logistics companies such as FedEx and SingPost. They would then send a phishing link to the victims, instructing them to click on it and furnish details to get their payment. However, these links directed victims to fraudulent websites, which looked like legitimate portals, tricking them into providing banking details such as their one-time passwords. Victims realised they were cheated only after discovering unauthorised transactions on their bank accounts. On Friday (Aug 19), the police warned people to be wary. They are advised to always verify the profiles of others they deal with online, and to never click on unknown links or give out their personal banking details to anyone. Those who have fallen victim should alert their banks and the police immediately. Anyone with information relating to such crimes should call the police hotline on 1800-255-0000, or submit a report online. They can call 999 if they require urgent police assistance. They can also visit this website or call the anti-scam hotline on 1800-722-6688 for more information."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/activist-in-unauthorised-protest-at-ica-building-faces-jail-after-saying-he-wont-pay-3200-fine-in-full,Activist in unauthorised protest near ICA building gets 3 days' jail for refusing to pay full fine,"SINGAPORE - Local activist Goh Keow Wah, better known as Gilbert Goh, who was fined $3,200 on Friday (Aug 19) for offences including taking part in a protest without a permit, will spend three days behind bars after the court heard that he will not be paying the full sum. Goh, 61, was earlier convicted of one count each of refusing to sign a police statement, as well as an offence under the Public Order Act. He was fined $2,000 on Friday for taking part in a public assembly to publicise a cause without a permit outside the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) Building in Kallang Road on May 1 last year. He was also fined $1,200 for refusing to sign a statement which he later gave to the police.  But, following the sentencing, defence lawyer Lim Tean told Deputy Principal District Judge Luke Tan that his client would only pay the $2,000 fine. Goh opted to serve the default jail term of three days for his other offence. During last year's assembly, he carried a placard that read, ""Please ban all flights from India we are not racist! Just being cautious."", and later posted pictures of his activity on Facebook. His protest took place a week after Singapore barred all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors who had been in India in the past 14 days from entering or transiting here due to a surge in Covid-19 cases in India at the time. The court heard that Goh had refused to sign the statement recorded by a police officer at the Bedok Police Division on May 11 last year. In their submissions, Deputy Public Prosecutors Andre Chong and Yohanes Ng stated that by raising the placard near the ICA Building, Goh was plainly publicising a cause. The prosecutors added: ""The accused admitted that he knew that it was a requirement to apply for a police permit. He conceded that he did not bother applying for one. ""His claim that he would not have been given one if he had applied is purely speculative and, in any event, irrelevant."" The prosecutors also said that his subsequent Facebook posts were illustrative of his motive for staging the protest. They added: ""A plain reading of the contents of his Facebook posts, which were sensationalist and provocative, shows that he intended by his actions to stir up anti-foreigner sentiment."" According to court documents, Goh's Facebook post dated May 22 last year had the caption: ""Stop Singaporean genocide close the border."" It was superimposed over a photo of his protest. In his defence, Goh had claimed that he was not publicising a cause and that he had ""valid reasons"" for not signing the statement later. The prosecutors said his explanation for failing to sign the statement was not that he was not required to do so. Instead, he had stated: ""I do not wish to sign this statement as I am not given a copy and I do not have any defence for myself."" On Friday, DPP Chong urged the court to sentence Goh to a total fine of between $3,700 and $4,200. He said that Goh's conduct was aimed at unravelling Singapore's social fabric and that the activist had shown a complete lack of remorse. Pleading for his client to be given a total fine of not more than $1,500, Mr Lim said that the prosecution had unfairly tried to paint Goh as somebody who was out to create resentment against foreigners. The lawyer told the court that Goh was not a person who would create divisiveness, stressing that the activist had performed charitable work and brought relief to the homeless. Goh later addressed the court, stating that he is neither anti-foreigner nor xenophobic."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/bullying-in-schools-five-incidents-involving-student-victims,Bullying in schools: Five incidents involving student victims,"SINGAPORE - On Tuesday (Aug 16), a teenage girl was filmed being beaten up by three 15-year-old girls in the multi-storey carpark of Block 269 Compassvale Link. The girl was punched in the face multiple times by her three assailants, hit with a pair of rubber sandals, and dragged to the ground by the hair. Two teenage boys, who were standing nearby, did not intervene. Three girls were arrested on Wednesday for wrongful confinement and are under investigation for voluntarily causing hurt. The Straits Times looks at five other cases of bullying involving students. A video of two teenage girls cornering another went viral earlier this year, after it was uploaded on Facebook group Complaint Singapore on Jan 17. The victim, who was in her school uniform, was chased by one girl, while another one grabbed her by her ponytail, causing her to fall to the ground. She was then kicked repeatedly. Declining to reveal which school the students are from, a Ministry of Education spokesman said that the school had counselled the students involved and engaged their parents. On March 22 last year, a video clip of some Ngee Ann Polytechnic students urinating on two other male students, who were naked and squatting in a campus toilet, was circulated online. In the video, when one of the victims tried to clean himself, another student shouted: ""No showering!"" After the incident, Ngee Ann Polytechnic said that the 28 students involved - all boys in their second or third year - would be disciplined. Punishments ranged from corrective work orders to suspension. The school also added an anti-hazing policy to its student code of conduct and said that educational efforts to emphasise the importance of mutual respect and responsible behaviour would be stepped up. On March 12 last year, a video was uploaded on Instagram showing a young man from ITE College Central taunting one of his schoolmates in a toilet on campus. In the video, the young man grabbed the victim by his left arm while repeatedly asking him ""What's wrong with you?"". He then ripped off the victim's mask, slapped him and hurled vulgarities at him. Following the incident, ITE College Central expelled the bully and said it had contacted the victim and his family and extended support to them. This incident, which took place in March 2020, involved Primary 5 pupils writing insulting notes to their classmate, an 11-year-old girl. The victim's sister uploaded photos of these notes to her Twitter account. The notes had insults such as ""you are dumbo the elephant"" and ""you look so ugly and you really turn me down, you make puke (sic)"". The Twitter user said that previously, the bullies had scribbled on her sister's uniform with markers and called her names. She added that her sister was one of only a handful of Malay pupils in Mee Toh School. A spokesman for Mee Toh School said that the pupils involved were counselled and disciplined and their parents were informed. The Primary 5 pupils responsible for the bullying also apologised to the victim. In March 2019, a Secondary 1 girl started to receive unkind comments on anonymous messaging platform Tellonym, which was popular among teenagers then. The comments ranged from taunts calling her an ""idiot"" to comments that ""she should kill herself"". The girl was also bullied by two boys in her class, one of whom threw a pack of biscuits at her face. Although the incidents continued for months until October 2019, the girl alleged that her school did not take any action against the culprits. In February 2020, the bullying resumed, with one classmate insulting the girl, who has dyslexia, over her learning disorder. Responding to media queries in 2020, the school, which was not named in previous reports, said that it had counselled the girl but regretted that the support it provided was inadequate. Correction note: The story has been updated for clarity. An earlier version mentioned that the Secondary school girl with dyslexia had written about these experiences in a Facebook post. The Facebook post was written by a family friend, which included a letter written by the girl recounting her experiences. "
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/over-4-years-jail-for-one-of-3-brothers-leading-organised-criminal-group,Over 4 years' jail for one of 3 brothers leading organised criminal group,"SINGAPORE - He was one of the three leaders of an organised criminal group involved in unlawful gambling activities that generated a revenue of about $26.64 million from June 1 to Nov 27, 2016. Seet Sian Thian, 74, was on Thursday (Aug 18) sentenced to 4½ years' jail and given a fine of $141,000 after he pleaded guilty to four charges, including two under the Organised Crime Act. He will have to spend an additional 71 days behind bars if the fine is not paid. The court heard that the trio are brothers. In March, another leader, Seet Seo Boon, then 57, was sentenced to nine years, eight months and two weeks' jail as well as given a fine of $620,000. The case involving the pair's sibling, Seet Seow Huat, 67, who is believed to be the third leader, is still pending. The trio's brother, Seet Siau Khuang, 73, who was not one of the leaders, was sentenced in April to four weeks' jail and given a fine of $30,000 over unrelated unlawful gambling activities. He still has pending charges, including one under the Organised Crime Act. For the current case, Deputy Public Prosecutors Chong Yong and Lee Wei Liang stated in court documents that the Seet brothers had been collecting illegal 4D bets on behalf of unknown persons prior to 2011. The DPPs added that in 2011, a group of men, including Seet Seow Huat and Seet Seo Boon, decided to set up their own remote gambling website to facilitate the collection of illegal 4D bets from agents and punters. Seet Seo Boon then recruited a Malaysian man, known only as ""Guo Zhi"", to help him in creating the online betting platform. The website was launched in mid-2011. The brothers then expanded their illegal remote gambling operations by personally and actively recruiting other agents as well as shareholders, who would collect illegal 4D bets from punters on their behalf. The brothers also actively encouraged members of the organised criminal group to refer and recruit other individuals into it. The purpose of the recruitment exercise was to increase the revenue of the group and cushion the losses by spreading them among its members. Seet Sian Thian was later invited to the group and another remote gambling website was launched in 2013. He also asked his wife, Wong Choi San, 66, to recruit her friends to place illegal bets. Her case is still pending. Seet Sian Thian earned a commission from the total value of bets placed through the two websites. He also earned an additional 5 per cent from the total winnings arising from his agents and punters' bets. The DPPs told the court that Seet Sian Thian earned an estimated profit of at least $3,000 per month from the bets collected through one of the websites alone. But his illegal activities came to an end when police officers acted on information and turned up at his home in November 2016 to arrest him. Another 48 individuals were also caught at around the same time over their involvement in the organised criminal group. The Organised Crime Act - aimed at fighting crime syndicates - was passed in Parliament in 2015 and took effect in June 2016. On Nov 16, 2017, six people, including Seet Seo Boon, became the first to be charged under the Act. If convicted, anyone who is a member of a locally linked organised criminal group can be jailed for up to five years and fined up to $100,000."

Pi Jiapeng, 26, and his Thai wife Pansuk Siriwipa, 27, have both engaged lawyers to represent them. Ms Bhargavan Sujatha from Gavan Law Practice is acting for Pi, while Mr Johannes Hadi from Eugene Thuraisingam is representing Pansuk. A prosecutor told the court on Friday (Aug 19) that more time is needed for investigations as the case is complex, involving more than 180 police reports. He said: ""It involves losses of more than $20 million and the investigation officer needs more time to find out the whereabouts of the funds received by the two companies (Tradenation and Tradeluxury)."" The duo were each slapped with three charges on Aug 12 - two for cheating and one charge of leaving Singapore illegally. They are accused of being involved in a conspiracy to cheat customers of Tradenation and Tradeluxury between January and June. The pair had allegedly duped victims into believing they would be sold watches and luxury handbags, but had no intention to deliver the items. Arrest warrants and Interpol red notices were issued against them after more than 180 police reports were lodged against the two companies they were involved in. Deputy Public Prosecutor David Koh had said on Aug 12 that victims paid more than $20 million but did not receive their goods. The specific sum involved was not mentioned in court documents. Pi, who was born in Fujian province in China, was initially arrested by the Singapore Police Force (SPF) on June 27. He had his passport impounded and was released on $15,000 bail the next day. Pansuk was assisting the police with investigations and surrendered her passport to officers on June 30. But they became uncontactable and allegedly fled Singapore illegally via the land border on July 4. Two Malaysian men Mohamed Alias, 40, and Mohamad Fazli Abdul Rahman, 38, were earlier charged in relation to this matter. Alias and Fazli purportedly helped the couple flee the country by letting them hide in the container compartment of a Malaysia-registered lorry, which then passed through Tuas Checkpoint. Five weeks later, the Royal Thai Police informed SPF that Pi and Pansuk may have been staying in a Johor Bahru hotel. The SPF then asked the Royal Malaysia Police to locate them. They arrested the couple on Aug 11 in JB and handed them over to the SPF that day. They were refused bail on Aug 12 after a judge agreed with the prosecution that they were flight risks."

When its officers raided a unit at Boon Lay Drive that morning, two men, aged 37 and 39, struggled violently in a bid to escape. The officers used necessary force to subdue and arrest them, said CNB. They also arrested a 41-year-old woman who was hiding behind a condiments rack in the unit. About 26g of cannabis, three tablets believed to be controlled drugs and various drug paraphernalia were seized, while about 26g of heroin and 10g of ""Ice"" were found among one of the men's belongings. The officers also recovered a blue Ikea bag from a rubbish chute containing seven bundles and packets that had about 2.52kg of heroin and various drug paraphernalia, which the suspects were believed to have tried to dispose of. In a second operation on the same day, CNB officers raided a unit at Fernvale Street and arrested a 30-year-old man and 28-year-old woman. About 1.13kg of heroin, 4g of ""Ice"", 2g of vegetable matter believed to contain controlled drugs, one tablet believed to be a controlled drug, and various drug paraphernalia were found and seized. In a follow-up operation that evening, CNB officers stopped a vehicle at Clementi Road and arrested two men aged 29 and 40. About 85g of heroin and one tablet believed to be a controlled drug were recovered from the vehicle. CNB said the drug seizures have an estimated street value of $268,000. The more than 3.7kg of heroin seized can feed the addiction of about 1,780 abusers for a week. Those found guilty of trafficking more than 15g of pure heroin may face the death penalty. Investigations are ongoing."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/woman-has-charge-of-dishonestly-receiving-10k-from-firearm-robbery-withdrawn,Woman has charge of dishonestly receiving $10k from firearm robbery withdrawn,"SINGAPORE - A woman whose friend is linked to the first firearm robbery in Singapore in years had a charge of dishonestly retaining $10,000 stolen in the crime withdrawn earlier this month. Nur Shana Mohd Taib, 35, was accused of receiving the sum from then-Aetos officer Mahadi Muhamad Mukhtar, 38, who allegedly robbed a licensed moneylender of more than $24,000 while armed with his service revolver. Nur Shana was charged in April last year but after more than a year of legal proceedings, she was granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal following a pre-trial conference at the State Courts. This means, she cannot be charged again with the same offence. Responding to queries from The Straits Times, the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) on Thursday (Aug 18) said: ""After careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case, the prosecution applied for a discharge amounting to an acquittal in relation to the charge against (Nur Shana)."" It was granted by the court on Aug 4. The AGC spokesman did not give the reasons behind the prosecution's application. Mahadi had allegedly robbed OT Credit, a licensed moneylender located at Block 135 Jurong Gateway Road, on April 12 last year. Aetos is a security firm where some officers are issued with M85 Taurus revolvers. Mahadi, who was not in uniform, is said to have shown a handwritten note that told OT Credit's employees that they were being robbed and that he was armed with a gun. After taking the money, the police said Mahadi reported for work at the Aetos headquarters in Corporation Drive. Mahadi is accused of later depositing part of the stolen cash into Nur Shana's bank account. He was arrested within five hours of the robbery. As his case is still pending, it has not been mentioned if the $10,000 sum has been recovered. The robbery last year was the first time in 15 years that a gun was used in such an offence. The last armed robbery involving a firearm happened in 2006 at a 4-D outlet at Sun Plaza shopping centre. OT Credit was also targeted by armed robbers in November 2020 when a group of men took $48,000 in cash while armed with knives. The three men involved were later arrested and two were jailed. The third man, who was a teenager at the time, was ordered to undergo reformative training, where offenders are detained in a centre and made to follow a strict regimen that can include foot drills and counselling."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/briton-fined-8000-for-refusing-to-wear-mask-in-city-square-mall,"Briton fined $8,000 for refusing to wear mask in City Square Mall","SINGAPORE - A 55-year-old Briton who repeatedly refused to wear a mask in public when it was mandatory to do so has been fined $8,000 after pleading guilty to one count of breaching Covid-19 regulations. Mockridge Philip Richard, a Singapore permanent resident, had refused to wear a mask in City Square Mall on May 16 last year. Two similar charges involving him not wearing a mask on two separate occasions - in Sengkang MRT station in November 2020 and Serangoon MRT station in December that year - were taken into consideration on Thursday (Aug 18) for his sentencing. The court heard that Mockridge was defiant when police officers approached him in MOS Burger in City Square Mall. He had his mask pulled down over his chin, even though he was not eating or drinking. When told to mask up, Mockridge said: ""Are you sure about that? I'm not so sure"", and asked to see their identification. He then walked away from the officers, still unmasked, to collect his packed food from the restaurant counter. One of the officers, Sergeant Shawn Ang Yi Xiang asked if he had an issue with wearing a mask to which Mockridge replied: ""Which law are you referring to?"" He then took his mobile phone out and began recording the exchange. After Sgt Ang read out the law, Mockridge said: ""And if I don't, what will you do?"" Sgt Ang then informed him that composition fines were usually given to first- and second-time offenders, while subsequent repeat offenders will be prosecuted in court. Mockridge then said: ""So you're threatening to put me in a cage?"" He maintained that the officer was threatening him and remained unmasked throughout the exchange. Seeking a $10,000 fine, Deputy Public Prosecutor Wu Yu Jie said Mockridge was unmasked for at least 15 minutes at the mall and had no reason for not wearing one. ""The accused was already being investigated for the two incidents (in 2020). Despite having encountered the police twice for failing to wear a mask, he remained defiant and committed this third breach,"" he said. Mockridge said in mitigation that he ""was not entirely sure of what the law was"". For each offence of flouting Covid-19 rules, he could have been fined up to $10,000 and jailed for up to six months."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/police-investigating-after-video-shows-three-girls-pummel-teen-in-sengkang-carpark,3 teenage girls arrested after assault of another girl at Sengkang carpark,"SINGAPORE - A teenage girl's brutal beating by three girls in a Sengkang carpark on Tuesday evening (Aug 16) is being investigated by the police, after videos of the incident were circulated on social media. In the videos, the trio can be seen punching, kicking, slapping and throwing rubber sandals at the victim who tries to protect herself by covering her face. Two teenage boys, who are standing nearby, do not intervene during the attack. Three girls, all aged 15, have been arrested for wrongful confinement and are under investigation for voluntarily causing hurt. The police said they were alerted to the incident at about 9.30pm on Tuesday. The trio are alleged to have assaulted the victim at the multi-storey carpark of Block 269 Compassvale Link. ""The female teenager sustained injuries but did not require immediate conveyance to hospital. She subsequently sought medical attention,"" said a police spokesman, who added that the teenagers involved are believed to be known to one another. Three videos of the incident were uploaded online on Wednesday. The first video, which is about one and a half minutes long, shows the victim in white cowering on the floor as one of the three assailants, dressed in black, pulls her hair and punches the top of her head three times. A second assailant then kicks the victim in the head repeatedly before throwing rubber sandals at her. In the second video, which is about 48 seconds long, the trio can be seen showing a video on mobile phone to the victim. They then throw an unknown liquid at her, before one of them drags her to the ground by the hair and kicks her in the chest. The victim scrambles towards one of the teen boys dressed in red, hiding behind him as the trio warn the boy to ""let her go"". In the third video, which is about 55 seconds long, the trio hit the girl as the two teen boys look on. One of the boys seemingly tries to protect the victim as one of the assailants grabs her by the hair and punches her face eight times. In the video, the attackers accuse the victim of causing relationship troubles for others by bad-mouthing them. The boys in the video are believed to be wearing T-shirts from Jurong Secondary School. The Straits Times has contacted the school for comment. Since the videos were uploaded, they have been shared more than 10,000 times, with netizens calling for the school and police to take stern action."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/ex-lawyer-who-climbed-into-neighbours-balcony-to-watch-her-shower-jailed-12-weeks,'Stressed' lawyer jailed 12 weeks after climbing into neighbour's balcony to watch her shower,"SINGAPORE - To watch his neighbour shower, he climbed over a parapet separating their balconies to get into her home. Nicholas Yeo Shao Yi, 32, who was a lawyer at the time, did that twice and even filmed the woman - who is in her 20s - showering on the first occasion. Yeo was on Thursday (Aug 18) sentenced to 12 weeks' jail after pleading guilty to a charge of using his mobile phone to observe his neighbour showering and another of filming her. Another two charges of committing criminal trespass were taken into consideration for his sentencing. The court heard that Yeo, who committed the offences over a few months in 2020, was experiencing work-related stress due to the April to June circuit breaker that year. He was formerly employed at top law firm Allen & Gledhill but has since resigned. He lived in a terraced house that shares an adjoining wall with his next-door neighbour, whose master bedroom toilet looks out onto a small balcony through a window. As their toilets were next to each other, Yeo could tell when the victim - she cannot be named due to a gag order to protect her identity - was in the shower by listening out for her voice or the sound of videos playing. On the evening of Nov 23, 2020, he deduced that she was bathing and climbed over the parapet and into her balcony to film her. He held his phone outside the shower window, but the victim caught a glimpse of the phone before he could start recording. She shouted in alarm and saw Yeo fleeing back to his house. The victim and her husband then went over to Yeo’s home to confront him. He kept apologising and asked if they could resolve the matter in any other way or speak elsewhere. The victim did not find incriminating material on his mobile phones when he offered them to her to check, but she called the police anyway. Investigations revealed that several months before the November 2020 incident, the accused had climbed into the balcony and successfully filmed her showering. He later deleted the video. The police seized six of his electronic devices - two laptops and four iPhones. They did not find further obscene material on the gadgets. Deputy Public Prosecutor Yvonne Poon told the court there was premeditation involved as Yeo would wait till he could sense that the victim was in the toilet to commit his crimes. She also noted that there was a risk of the video recorded by Yeo getting disseminated. In mitigation, Yeo's lawyer, Mr Shashi Nathan from Withers KhattarWong, said his client was suffering from generalised anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, which had contributed to his offending. He added that Yeo, who is now working in a private enterprise, was a high-achieving individual who had acted out of character.  ""Nicholas is a young man who had a good career in front of him but that career is over. He is remorseful for what he has done and wants a fresh start,"" said Mr Nathan. For using his phone to observe the victim in a private act, Yeo could have been jailed for up to two years, fined, or caned, or any combination of the three. The same maximum penalty applies for recording the victim showering."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/9-months-jail-for-hjh-maimunah-catering-shareholder-who-threw-molotov-cocktail-at-ex-wifes-house,Jail for Hjh Maimunah Catering shareholder who threw Molotov cocktail at ex-wife's house,"SINGAPORE - A shareholder of food and beverage company Hjh Maimunah Catering was so unhappy with his former wife that he drove to her house during circuit breaker and flung a Molotov cocktail at it, causing damage to the landed property. Singapore imposed the circuit breaker between April 7 and June 1, 2020 to curb the spread of Covid-19. Earlier media reports had identified the offender Ismail Didih Ibrahim as one of the owners of the popular Hjh Maimunah restaurant in Jalan Pisang near Arab Street. But court documents state that at the time of the offences, he was a manager for his parents' eatery. Ismail, 37, was on Thursday (Aug 18) sentenced to nine months' jail after he pleaded guilty to one count each of committing an act of mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to cause damage, as well as an offence under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act. Ismail and the woman had tied the knot in 2017 but got divorced two years later. Bent on revenge, he drove to her Telok Kurau house on May 12, 2020, armed with items including a half-filled bottle of thinner and a spray can of black paint. He also took along a raincoat to disguise himself that evening. In earlier proceedings, Deputy Public Prosecutor Chong Kee En told the court: ""(Ismail) was seen on CCTV (closed-circuit television) footage going to the boot of his car and preparing a Molotov cocktail by pouring repeatedly the paint thinner into (an) empty bottle and stuffing rags on the top. ""At times, he would glance around the mostly deserted street to see if anyone was watching him. After about five minutes of preparation, the accused then walked over to the victim's house... wearing the raincoat."" After spraying ""O$P$"" (owe money, pay money) on the property even though the woman's family had not borrowed cash from a loan shark, Ismail flung the lit Molotov cocktail at the house, causing a fire when the bottle shattered. He then left the scene. The woman, then 32, and her family members were not aware of the incident at first as they were on an upper floor. One of their neighbours, however, spotted the blaze and put out the fire with her own family members. They then alerted the victim's family and the police were subsequently called. DPP Chong said that the fire caused about $6,000 in damage to items including some walls and pillars. Ismail has since made voluntary restitution of $5,000 to his former wife and donated $3,000 to three charities of her choice. Police officers initially thought the case was linked to illegal moneylending activities, but investigations later revealed that Ismail had spray-painted the message out of malice. Nobody was physically injured in the Molotov cocktail attack, but Ismail's former wife was so traumatised that she had to attend counselling sessions. Her family also spent about $600 to install CCTV cameras around their house as they did not feel safe following the incident. DPP Chong said that three psychiatrists had observed Ismail and the trio agreed that he had a relapse of his major depressive disorder. The prosecutor added: ""However, upon careful review of their reports, the diagnoses of all three psychiatrists are more or less (in agreement), in that although the initial idea to attack the victim's house with a Molotov cocktail could have been impulsive, the actual execution of the attack was intentional and showed significant premeditation and was unclouded by his depression."" Ismail's bail was set at $20,000 on Thursday and he was ordered to surrender himself at the State Courts on Sept 14 to begin serving his sentence."

Ms Wu had in December 2020 posted six Instagram stories titled ""Cheater of 2020"", suggesting that Ms Wong had been unfaithful to her former husband, footballer Anders Aplin. Ms Wong then sued Ms Wu for defamation. Ms Wong's lawyer, Mr Akesh Abhilash from Harry Elias Partnership, told The Straits Times on Wednesday (Aug 17) that he was pleased that the dispute was resolved amicably ""with (his) client's reputation being vindicated"" by the apology and complete retraction of the allegations. He took over the case on July 5 after a High Court judge dismissed Ms Wong's appeal to withhold diary entries and correspondence between her and two men Ms Wu accused her of being intimate with. Ms Wong - communicating through her lawyer - said she accepted Ms Wu's apology and added: ""I am glad that we can now move forward with our lives."" In an Instagram story post on Wednesday, Ms Wu said that her comments towards Ms Wong, whom she did not know personally, were unnecessary and apologised for the hurt she had caused the influencer. ""The dispute has attracted much unnecessary publicity which has hurt the both of us, our close friends and our families. I sincerely do not believe that this dispute should continue,"" wrote Ms Wu. The terms of the resolution were settled out of court and are confidential. Ms Wu published the disputed Instagram stories while Ms Wong and Mr Aplin were in the midst of a marriage annulment. The proceedings began in April 2020 and their marriage was legally annulled around March last year. Ms Wong claimed the stories damaged her image and reputation on social media, which she was largely dependent on ""to attract and obtain business deals on partnerships"" to earn a living. The influencer argued that the stories meant that she had sex with her wedding emcee on her wedding night and that she was promiscuous, among other things. Ms Wu had claimed that the stories were true and that Ms Wong had been ""more than intimate"" with at least two men while she was in a romantic relationship with Mr Aplin. Ms Wu's lawyers, Mr Gerard Quek and Mr Daniel Ling from PDLegal, told ST on Wednesday that their client is happy that the matter has been resolved and urged that the parties be allowed to move on."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/bouncer-gets-jail-for-tipping-off-nightlife-spots-about-raids-hitting-man-with-car-thrice,"Bouncer gets jail for tipping off nightlife spots about raids, hitting man with car thrice","SINGAPORE - When the police raided nightlife spots where he worked, or when he spotted police vehicles in the area, a bouncer would tip off other outlets so they could cover their tracks before the cops arrived. Aaron Chua Jun Hao, 26, was a member of two WhatsApp groups in which he sent more than 60 tip-off messages between January 2019 and February 2020. The Singaporean, who had earlier been convicted of driving his car into a man three times in July 2019, was on Wednesday (Aug 17) sentenced to 17 weeks' jail and given a $3,000 fine. He had pleaded guilty to eight charges in total - six of obstructing the course of justice and a count each of affray and causing hurt by a rash act. The court heard that the police found out about the WhatsApp groups while investigating other criminal cases. They discovered that Chua was a member of ""Night Owl"" and ""UncleValet"" - two chat groups in messaging platform WhatsApp - whose members comprised mostly of bouncers and employees of other nightlife establishments. Using code words, the members posted tip-off messages that included the licence plate numbers of police vehicles spotted, the location of raids and the size of enforcement teams. Eight other alleged members of ""Night Owl"" are set to plead guilty on Friday. They are aged 29 to 48. In one such message, Chua had written ""Pandora CV now"", which investigations found to mean plainclothes policemen were at Club Pandora in Rochor. In another message, he had written ""2pax ssb at middle road do visiting clubs"", which conveys that two people from the Secret Societies Branch of the police's Criminal Investigations Department were raiding clubs. For the offence of causing hurt by a rash act, Chua had in April last year admitted to hitting Shaun Koh Kim Guan, then 21, with his car three times in order to catch him. Earlier reports stated that Chua was drinking alone when he saw an altercation involving a man wielding a knife. He decided to help by chasing the perpetrator in his car. Each time the man got up to flee, Chua drove his car and hit him in the back again. By the third instance, other bouncers had caught up with Koh, who suffered backaches as a result, and pinned him to the ground. Regarding the affray offence, Chua was drinking at a pub in the Katong area in April this year when he got into a dispute with another patron. Mr Cheng Si Ren had accused him of kicking the pub's toilet door several times while his girlfriend was using it. Shortly after, a fight broke out involving Chua, Mr Cheng and their friends - at least 11 people. Chua's lawyer, Mr Anil Singh Sandhu from Kertar & Sandhu, said in mitigation that his client had given his full cooperation to the authorities during investigations and is deeply remorseful for his actions. ""Aaron unreservedly apologises that he was wrong in driving his vehicle into Shaun's back thrice. However, it must be emphasised that his actions were always guided by the altruistic motive of securing the latter's arrest,"" he said. Mr Anil added that Chua had lost his security licence due to his offences, which his client sees ""as a major setback in his employability in the industry"". For each offence of obstructing the course of justice, Chua could have been jailed for up to seven years and fined. For causing hurt by a rash act, he could have been jailed for up to a year and fined up to $5,000. The same maximum penalty applies for affray."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/4-people-allegedly-linked-to-wirecard-case-in-spore-charged-with-criminal-breach-of-trust,4 people allegedly linked to Wirecard case charged,"SINGAPORE - Three people who used to work for Wirecard Asia Holding (WAH) - a Singapore subsidiary of German payment processing company Wirecard AG - and a director of another firm are now accused of being part of a conspiracy to misappropriate from WAH various amounts of up to $100,000 on each occasion. The three former employees are: See Lee Wee, 29, James Aga Wardhana, 39, and Chai Ai Lim, 43. The fourth person accused is Henry Yeo Chiew Hai, 66, a director at Jacobson Fareast Marketing Services that deals with textiles and leathers. All four were charged in a Singapore district court on Wednesday (Aug 17) with offences including criminal breach of trust. They were each handed between two and nine charges. All of them are Singaporeans except for Wardhana, who is an Indonesian. They are said to have conspired with WAH's then vice-president of controlling and finance, Mr Edo Kurniawan, to commit the offences in 2018. Mr Kurniawan had left Singapore before investigations started on their alleged offences and a warrant has been issued for his arrest. Details about his nationality were not disclosed in court documents. Three others, also said to be linked to the Wirecard case, were charged in court earlier. They are: Briton James Henry O'Sullivan, 47; R. Shanmugaratnam, 56, who was a director at local accounting firm Citadelle Corporate Services; and Thilagaratnam Rajaratnam, 58, a former director at a firm called Strategic Corporate Investments. The trio's cases are still pending. In a statement on Wednesday, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) said that Wardhana, See and Yeo are also accused of money laundering. They had allegedly transferred most of the misappropriated amounts to other individuals. Wardhana and Yeo have also been charged with falsification of accounts. The SPF added that Wardhana had allegedly abetted Yeo to falsify four invoices totalling $184,870 from Jacobson Fareast Marketing Services to WAH. The cases involving See, Wardhana, Chai and Yeo have been adjourned to September. The Straits Times previously reported that Wirecard Singapore had been providing payment processing services to about 1,900 companies here before the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) ordered it to stop on Sept 30, 2020. MAS also directed the firm to return all customers' funds within two weeks. Wirecard filed for insolvency in Germany in June 2020 after admitting that €1.9 billion (S$3.2 billion) in cash was missing from its accounts. The company's former chief executive Markus Braun and several other top executives were then arrested. German prosecutors later said that they charged Braun and two other high-ranking managers over their alleged offences that led to the collapse of the payment company. The trio are accused of market manipulation, embezzlement and fraud on a commercial scale. Locally, for each count of criminal breach of trust, an offender can be jailed for up to 15 years and fined. For each count of falsification of accounts, an offender can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined."

Ang Yew Teck, who befriended Ng while they were in Changi Prison in remand in July last year, was separately hit with a $23.3 million fine over his involvement in a cigarette smuggling business. The 50-year-old had conspired to arrange for Ng, 35, to be driven across the Causeway for $5 million with a 10 per cent deposit to be paid first. But Ng did not pay the deposit. On Tuesday (Aug 16), Ang was sentenced to four months' jail for conspiring to obstruct justice. In total, he was sentenced to a jail term of three years, eight months and one week, and a fine of $23,312,000 for offences that include possessing contraband cigarettes and driving without a licence. He was also disqualified from holding or obtaining driving licences for a year after his release. The prosecution said Ang's case involved the fourth-largest seizure of illegal cigarettes in Singapore . Ang did not pay the fines and will spend an additional 23 months and 110 days behind bars. Ng, the former director of Envy Global Trading and Envy Asset Management, is facing 105 charges for his alleged involvement in a US$1.1 billion ($1.52 billion) nickel trading scam. The court heard that days after being released from Changi Prison on Aug 17 last year, Ang met Ng and told him that he would try to find information on how the latter could flee Singapore and how much it would cost. After the meeting, Ang contacted Shawn Liew Cheng Long, 36, to find out how Ng could leave Singapore. Ang told Liew that Ng was involved in one of the largest cheating or criminal breach of trust cases in Singapore. Liew, whose case is still pending, told Ang that their former boss, whom they used to smuggle contraband cigarettes for, may know of how to do it. The former boss was identified only as ""Xiao Li"". After Liew ascertained the costs involved from Xiao Li, Ang contacted Ng and arranged a meeting in October last year. Liew informed Ng that he would need $5 million to arrange for Ng to leave Singapore and a 10 per cent deposit. Liew and Ang told Ng that arrangements could be made for him to leave Singapore for Malaysia by car and not by boat, and that the remaining details would be finalised only after they had received the deposit. After the meeting, Ang contacted Ng several times to ask if he would be able to pay the deposit, but Ng never paid it. As for the Customs charges, Ang was accused of possessing duty-unpaid cigarettes that were smuggled into Singapore from Malaysia in water tanks that were welded shut. On May 13 last year, Ang was caught with 9,049 cartons containing 200 sticks, and eight packets containing 20 sticks. They were assorted brands of duty-unpaid cigarettes weighing a total of 1,625.076kg. The unpaid excise duty for these cigarettes was $772,852.92. Ang also admitted having 19 cartons containing 160 sticks, and 13 cartons containing 200 sticks, of assorted brands of duty unpaid cigarettes found in his car which weighed a total of 6.806kg. The unpaid excise duty for these cigarettes was $3,706.36. Ang said that he had intended to sell the cigarettes found in his car to the people living in his neighbourhood. He had also driven a car the day he was caught without a valid driving licence or motor insurance. For obstructing justice, Ang could have been jailed for up to seven years, fined, or both."

The youth, who was 16 when he committed the crimes, told his friends he would help them invest in the foreign exchange and cryptocurrency markets. He claimed that he had made money trading Bitcoin, and even guaranteed them fixed returns if they invested through him. But the youth, who is now 20, wanted some of the money to buy items used in online games such as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, which he had planned to later sell for a profit. As he knew his friends would not give him the money, he decided to lie to them instead. In total, he cheated his victims of $332,067. The youth, who cannot be named as he was under 18 years of age when he committed the crimes, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to three counts of cheating three people. Four other similar charges will be taken into account for his sentencing. Probation and reformative training reports were called for and he is scheduled to return to court on Aug 23. The three victims in the charges he pleaded guilty to were his schoolmates. They were 17 years old at the time. The victims all filed police reports when they did not receive the promised returns on their purported investments. The court heard that one of them had given him $106,050 over at least 26 occasions between May 8, 2018 and Aug 11 that year. The accused gave him $40,870 as purported returns on his investments. Another victim, a classmate of the youth, gave him $188,847 over at least 35 occasions between January 2018 and Aug 18 that year. He gave this friend $40,695 as purported returns on his investments. The third victim gave $5,000 to the accused as an investment and did not receive any returns. The prosecution called for a deterrent sentence, arguing that there has been an increase in scam cases in Singapore. It also noted that the amount involved was high and the accused had deceived his victims on 84 occasions. For cheating, offenders face a jail term of up to 10 years and a fine."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/2-transnational-scam-syndicates-busted-in-joint-singapore-malaysia-police-operations,2 transnational scam syndicates busted in joint Singapore-Malaysia police operations,"SINGAPORE - The police in Singapore and Malaysia have worked together to cripple two transnational scam syndicates, and arrested 13 people in simultaneous raids carried out in Kuala Lumpur, Johor and Singapore. The syndicates, which were allegedly involved in money laundering activities, caused losses totalling more than $1.3 million. They targeted more than 60 victims in Singapore alone, as well as victims in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. The scams reported in Singapore varied from investment and job scams to fake gambling platforms, sexual services and sextortion, government official impersonations and loan scams. In a media release, the Singapore Police Force said its Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) and Royal Malaysia Police's Commercial Crime Investigation Department have been working together since July to share critical information based on findings from reported scam cases. On Aug 10, two female and seven male Malaysians aged between 19 and 39 were arrested by the Malaysian police for their suspected involvement in cross-border money laundering following simultaneous raids at two apartment complexes in Kuala Lumpur and Johor. At the same time, officers from the Anti-Scam Command in Singapore arrested two men and two women, aged between 18 and 49, for their suspected involvement in the money laundering syndicate by handing over their personal bank accounts or relinquishing their Singpass accounts. Investigations of the suspects arrested in Singapore are ongoing. Police said that another 24 individuals are helping in investigations. Those found guilty of facilitating unauthorised access to computer material can be jailed for up to two years and fined. Those convicted of unlawfully disclosing access codes can be jailed for up to three years and fined. CAD director David Chew urged the public to stay away from the lure of easy money by not responding to jobs that involve the abuse of Singpass or bank accounts. ""The Internet continues to be used to deceive victims as well as recruit money launderers, often with promises of quick monetary returns,"" said Mr Chew, noting that cyber-enabled scams continue to be an area of serious concern. ""We will take firm action against the money mules in Singapore who sell their bank accounts and Singpass details to these syndicates or knowingly participate in the laundering of their proceeds of crime."" He added that the police will continue to collaborate with their foreign law enforcement counterparts to detect and deter transnational syndicates who prey on citizens. Last year, the police's Anti-Scam Division busted 16 transnational syndicates and arrested 230 syndicate members as part of Project Icons (International Cooperation On Negating Scams). The project focuses on intensive intelligence-sharing with overseas law enforcement agencies to tackle scammers who are often part of organised syndicates that operate overseas and under the radar."

The authority will be further empowered under the Gambling Control Act, which took effect this month, to regulate online gambling platforms and take action against advertisements promoting illegal services. Speaking to reporters at the inauguration event at Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre on Tuesday (Aug 16), Mr Ian Lee, GRA senior assistant director (Policy and Planning), said the authority will be able to take further action against those who advertise unlawful gambling if they do not comply with an order to remove it. Under the Gambling Control Act, a person who is found guilty of advertising unlawful gambling can be fined up to $20,000. But if they do not comply with an order to remove the advertisement, they can be fined up to $50,000, jailed for up to two years, or both. Even so, it will be challenging to take down such websites, said Mr Lee. ""Operators who are based overseas can still easily offer their products to Singapore... We recognise it is not possible to enforce legislation when they are based overseas, but we can still (take action) through the blocking channel."" The GRA also has the power to block access to online remote gambling services by directing the Infocomm Media Development Authority to issue such an order to Internet service providers. ""Even if we take down one website, they can easily use another domain. It's a cat-and-mouse issue. But we continue to focus on removing websites which cause the most harm to users in Singapore,"" said Mr Lee."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/gambling-regulatory-authority-inaugurated-in-spore-as-new-products-emerge,Gambling Regulatory Authority inaugurated in S'pore as new products emerge,"SINGAPORE - A central body that aims to stay ahead of new and global trends, and respond more adequately to emerging gambling products, was inaugurated on Tuesday (Aug 16). The Gambling Regulatory Authority (GRA) will regulate a sweeping range of gambling services, including those offered in casinos and lotteries, as well as sports betting and loot boxes in online video games. This comes amid shifting trends and a blurring of the line between gambling and gaming. The GRA takes over from the Casino Regulatory Authority, which was established in 2008 to oversee Singapore's two integrated resorts - Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World Sentosa. At the inauguration ceremony at Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre on Tuesday, Mrs Josephine Teo, Second Minister for Home Affairs, said the formation of the GRA is an important next step for gambling regulation in Singapore given how the landscape will be very different in five years. Mrs Teo, who is also Minister for Communications and Information, noted how technology developments have made it easier for people to gamble any time and anywhere, widening the scale and scope of online gambling. Shifting consumer preferences have also given rise to new gambling products and the boundaries between gambling and gaming have blurred, she said. Mrs Teo said: ""There are more and more variants of gaming, gambling and games of chance, such as those involving cryptocurrencies or using crypto technology."" When asked about upcoming initiatives, a GRA spokesman said that a $100 prize cap on mystery boxes, previously proposed by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), may come into effect as early as next year. The spokesman added: ""The cap will prevent the inducement effect of high-value items and the normalisation of gambling among youth."" In the coming months, the authority will also focus on streamlining its processes for approving licences, as the number of licences it issues is expected to increase significantly. This comes as under the Gambling Control Act, which took effect this month, private establishments will have to get a licence to organise player-to-player games such as mahjong. In her speech on Tuesday, Mrs Teo also mentioned that the Casino Control Act will be reviewed to enhance the casino regulatory regime. MHA said more details will be shared when ready. Counsellors and gaming experts said the move to strengthen regulation will address the higher risks posed by online gambling and ensure social safeguards are in place. Ms Tham Yuen Han, executive director of We Care Community Services, a charity that treats gambling addiction, said: ""The accessibility and convenience of online gambling worsens the risk of addictions progressing, as these platforms operate 24/7. ""Some of our clients have spent tens of thousands (of dollars) on such platforms and these financial consequences can take a toll on families, especially when gamblers turn to illegal moneylenders to fuel their addiction."" Mr Lai Tuck Weng, founder of marketing consultancy Edge Digital, which specialises in gaming and technology, hopes that as online games of chance with gambling elements now fall under the GRA's regulation, there will be greater transparency in how such platforms operate. He said: ""While the probabilities of winning in card games, such as blackjack, are known, for online games of chance it is different, as these games may track the player's history and risk tolerance and directly manipulate game outcomes."" Parents The Straits Times spoke to said they were glad that loot boxes within video games would be regulated by the GRA. Loot boxes are virtual goodie bags gamers buy with real cash that provide random rewards. But the chance of obtaining these rewards can be as low as 0.00005 per cent. Mr Lai added that while loot boxes may cost only a few dollars individually, gamers have spent thousands of dollars to buy these boxes to upgrade their characters. Ms Junia Tan, 44, who has five children aged five to 16, said: ""Even though these are just games, children may not fully understand the opportunity cost of the money they are spending."" The parenting coach added: ""This legislation sends a signal to kids to recognise that gaming platforms can be fun, but also pose dangers."""

Abdul Hakim Jamil, 30, Muhammad Yusri Ramlee, 26, and 22-year-old Muhammad Fikri Junaidi each face one charge of being part of an unlawful assembly that had a common object of hurting two men identified in court documents as Mr Mizra Abdul Azman, 33, and Mr Abdul Figo Abdul Haleem, 20. All three men have been placed in remand and are scheduled to return to court on Aug 23. Two other men, Muhammad Fadzli Junaidi, 34, and Muhammad Faiz Junaidi, 29, were also said to have been involved in the brawl on Sunday at around 5.10am, but they were not charged on Tuesday. On Monday night, the police said they arrested the three men with the aid of images from police cameras and closed-circuit television footage. In a 14-second video shared on WhatsApp chat groups on Sunday, a group of about 20 men were seen beating up two men. The police said they were alerted to the incident at about 5.15am on Sunday. All the suspects involved in the fight fled before the police arrived at the scene, but there was a police camera facing the area where it took place. Last week, The Straits Times reported that operators in Orchard Towers had been given official notice in July that their public entertainment licences would not be renewed beyond May 2023. The police said law and order in Orchard Towers remains a concern and has not improved over the years. For rioting, offenders can be jailed for up to seven years and caned."

Rajama Samuel Doctorian Purba, an Indonesian who was then taking a diploma course at a private school here, pleaded to a charge of raping the victim at his rented apartment in November 2020. Two other charges, one for molesting the victim and one for possession of obscene films, were taken into consideration. The High Court heard that Rajama shared the condominium unit with another Indonesian, Mr Anthony Aditya Tedjawisastra, 19, who was also studying at a private school here. On the afternoon of Nov 6, 2020, the victim was invited by her friend to a gathering at the apartment to celebrate his birthday. The friend was a course mate of Mr Anthony, who organised the gathering. She was initially hesitant to attend the gathering as she did not know anyone but eventually decided to go as it was to celebrate her friend's birthday. At the apartment that night, after some introductions, the victim, her friend, Rajama and Mr Anthony sat in the living room, playing card games and having alcoholic drinks. After a few rounds of games, the victim became dizzy and wanted to vomit. Rajama supported her and led her to the toilet in his bedroom, while the other two people remained in the living room. Once in his room, Rajama locked the door and took the girl to the toilet. After she was done vomiting, he cleaned up after her and realised that she was unconscious. Rajama then placed her on his bed, lifted her shirt and bra and groped her. When she did not react, he raped her. The victim felt the accused raping her but could not resist or move her body as she was intoxicated. After Rajama stopped, he dressed the victim up, helped her to the toilet, where she vomited again, and left her there. Later, when Mr Anthony entered the room, he told Rajama off for leaving her on the toilet floor. Rajama then confessed that he had sex with the victim. The victim left the unit at about 4am, supported by her friend. She later told him what Rajama had done to her. She made a police report that night."

Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam said this in a Facebook post where he spoke about the case of the couple allegedly involved in a luxury goods scam involving undelivered items worth $32 million. Pi Jiapeng, 26, and Thai national Pansuk Siriwipa, 27, had fled Singapore on July 4, but were arrested in Malaysia and returned here on Aug 11. They have since been charged. In a Facebook post on Monday (Aug 15), Mr Shanmugam said the matter would now be dealt with by the courts. ""I've often said before: one, if you've committed an offence, you are likely to be caught; two, when you are arrested, if you are guilty, then the facts are likely to be found and presented, and you are likely to be found guilty; and three, you are then likely to serve the sentence,"" he said. ""Our police have very good linkages with regional police forces. They use their leads, and work closely with their regional counterparts."" Pi and Pansuk met on a dating application in 2019 and tied the knot in 2020. They started Tradenation and Tradeluxury in April 2021, dealing in luxury watches and bags by taking advanced payments for the items. Trouble began to surface in June this year as customers started noticing significant delays in getting their goods. They confronted the couple and more than 180 police reports were made against them. Pi was arrested on June 27 and his passport was impounded before he was released on bail the next day. Pansuk was not arrested, but was assisting in police investigations and had surrendered her passport on June 30. On July 4, the couple fled Singapore illegally by hiding in the container compartment of a Malaysia-registered lorry. A 40-year-old Malaysian lorry driver who allegedly snuck them across the border via Tuas Checkpoint and a 38-year-old Malaysian who allegedly conspired with the driver have also been charged. Following their escape, the police said on July 19 that warrants of arrest and Interpol red notices had been issued against the couple. On Aug 10, the Royal Thai Police tipped off the Singapore Police Force (SPF) with information that the couple may be staying in a hotel in Johor Bahru. The SPF then sought the assistance of the Royal Malaysia Police, which then nabbed the couple as they were checking in to a budget hotel in Skudai, Johor. They returned to Singapore on Aug 11. The couple were charged on Aug 12, and each face two cheating charges and another charge of leaving Singapore illegally. Pi had said in court that they were wrong to leave Singapore illegally, and claimed they were under a lot of pressure and had death threats directed at them. The court ordered for the duo to be remanded for a week. Their cases are expected to be heard again on Aug 19. Pi and Pansuk each face up to 10 years' jail and a fine for each count of cheating. For fleeing the country illegally, they may be jailed for up to six months and fined."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/six-exam-cheats-allowed-to-withdraw-applications-to-be-called-to-the-bar,Six trainee lawyers who cheated in exam withdraw Bar admission applications,"SINGAPORE - Six aspiring lawyers who cheated in the 2020 Bar exam were allowed on Monday (Aug 15) to withdraw their applications to be called to the Bar. The six are Ms Monisha Devaraj, Mr Kushal Atul Shah, Mr Sreeraam Ravenderan, Ms Lynn Kuek Yi Ting, Mr Matthew Chow Jun Feng and Mr Lionel Wong Choong Yoong. In April, they had appeared before High Court judge Choo Han Teck to be admitted to the Bar. Then, the judge had adjourned their admission applications by six months to a year, after the Attorney-General said the six were not fit and proper persons to be admitted to the Bar because they had cheated in the exam. On Monday, the six appeared before Justice Choo again, represented by their respective counsel. This time, they asked the court for leave, or permission, to withdraw their Bar admission applications. The six are among 11 candidates caught cheating in Part B of the Bar exam which was held online at the end of 2020. All had to retake the exam in the following year. Another candidate, Mr Leon Tay Quan Li, was the first of the 11 to seek a withdrawal. In May, Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon allowed Mr Tay to withdraw his application to be called to the Bar, on condition that he was not to bring a fresh application for at least five years. The Chief Justice also required Mr Tay to give his word that, when he brings a fresh application, he would have to satisfy any requirements by the Attorney-General, Law Society, Singapore Institute of Legal Education (Sile) or the court as to his fitness for admission. On Monday, CJ Menon’s decision was cited by the lawyers representing the six law graduates, the Attorney-General and the Law Society. Senior Counsel N. Sreenivasan, who acts for three of them, said they have realised that the six-month adjournment period will not be sufficient for them to show that they are fit and proper to be admitted as lawyers. Mr Sreenivasan said his clients will not make any new application without “deep and considered reflection”.  The other lawyers echoed his sentiments. Mr Low Chai Chong, who acts for Mr Chow, said his client accepts that the period from now till November is too short for him to be able to redeem himself. There were no objections to the withdrawals. Justice Choo granted permission to all six to withdraw their applications, saying that they were free to apply again. While the judge did not impose specific conditions, he suggested that they find work as paralegals or in similar endeavours, so that a respected mentor can attest to their suitability to be lawyers. Ms Monisha, Mr Shah, Mr Sreeraam, Mr Chow and Mr Wong had shared answers in six papers through WhatsApp. They admitted their conduct as soon as the Sile, which conducts the exam and the course leading to the exam, began its inquiry. Ms Kuek denied cheating but the institute rejected her explanation and found that she had colluded with Mr Tay and cheated in three papers. Ms Kuek and Mr Tay had explained that they had similar answers because they studied together and shared study notes. But the Sile said their answers in three papers contained the same pattern and errors."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/man-gets-jail-for-hitting-certis-cisco-officer-with-car-twice-verbally-abusing-him,"Man gets jail for hitting Certis Cisco officer with car twice, verbally abusing him","SINGAPORE - When he was caught by an auxiliary police officer for leaving Singapore General Hospital (SGH) via an unauthorised exit, Yeo Yong Hao verbally abused the officer and later hit him with his car twice. The officer suffered bruises on his left leg and was given three days' sick leave as a result. On Monday (Aug 15), Yeo, 31, was sentenced to nine weeks' jail and banned from driving for a year and two months after his release from prison. He had pleaded guilty to one count each of committing a rash act that endangers the personal safety of others and using abusive words towards a public servant. The court heard that Yeo had gone to SGH in April last year to pick up his girlfriend's mother. He wanted to leave the hospital via a glass door that was not accessible to the public and could be opened only by staff. When auxiliary police officer Syahmi Rusydi Sobirin, 25, opened the door with his staff pass, Yeo followed him. Mr Syahmi told Yeo to use another exit but was ignored. Yeo then made derogatory comments about the officer and said he was just a Certis Cisco officer and not a police officer. Mr Syahmi followed Yeo to the carpark and stood in front of his car to stop him from leaving, but Yeo drove forward and hit the officer's leg. This happened again after Yeo confronted the officer and sounded his car horn continually. Deputy Public Prosecutor Emily Zhao said Yeo had used abusive and racially charged language at the officer, and had injured him twice. ""The degree of rashness in this case is very high and borders on being intentional. The accused clearly saw the officer standing in front of the car and knew the officer was telling him to stop,"" she said. For committing a rash act, Yeo could have been jailed for up to six months and fined up to $2,500. The offence of using abusive words towards a public servant carries a maximum punishment of a $5,000 fine and a jail term of up to a year."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/son-of-elderly-woman-who-died-at-ttsh-sues-hospital-and-3-doctors-for-negligence,"Son of elderly woman who died at TTSH sues hospital, 3 doctors for negligence","SINGAPORE - The son of a 74-year-old woman, who died three weeks after a heart attack while she was hospitalised at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), has sued the hospital and three doctors, seeking $800,000. Madam Tan Yaw Lan, who had medical issues including diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and kidney disease, had a heart attack while she was taking a shower - assisted by a nursing intern - on April 23, 2018. She suffered brain damage following the heart attack and was placed in intensive care. She died on May 13, 2018. In 2019, her son Chia Soo Kiang, 47, a public servant with the National Library Board, sued TTSH and the three doctors for negligence, alleging multiple breaches of their duty of care. The purported breaches include the withholding of pre-existing medications for Madam Tan's heart condition and diabetes, failure to refer her to appropriate specialists for her heart condition, and allowing a medically untrained person to handle her. A hearing into the suit opened in the High Court on Monday (Aug 15). A total of 30 witnesses, including medical experts, are lined up to testify - six for Mr Chia and 24 for TTSH and the doctors. Mr Chia's lawyer, Mr Clarence Lun, said in his opening statement: ""Despite the deceased's medical history known to the defendants, the defendants had acted in a callous manner to a high-risk and vulnerable person, even to the extent of permitting an untrained intern nurse to treat the deceased, which resulted in her collapse and delay in responding to the emergency."" TTSH and the doctors - Dr Dorai Raj D. Appadorai, Dr Lee Wei Sheng and Dr Ranjana Acharaya - are represented by Ms Mar Seow Hwei. They contended that all aspects of the treatment and management of the patient were appropriate and met the required standard of care. Madam Tan was admitted to TTSH on April 20, 2018, after she went to the emergency department because of fever and lethargy. She was initially diagnosed with widespread sepsis, a Type 2 heart attack (occurring when the heart needs more oxygen than it can get), diabetes, anaemia and worsening kidney function. The initial treatment plan included stopping aspirin as well as medications furosemide and losartan she took for heart issues and starting her on antibiotics. The next day, Dr Lee referred her to the hospital's cardiovascular medicine department and replaced her usual premixed insulin with a ""sliding scale"" insulin that varies the dose based on blood glucose level. The planned referral was later cancelled by Dr Ranjana. Mr Chia contended that his mother was wrongly diagnosed with a Type 2 heart attack and that a specialist referral would have lowered her risk of death. The defendants said it was appropriate to temporarily withhold aspirin, which carries a risk of bleeding, in view of Madam Tan's sepsis and drop in haemoglobin level. They added that it is usual for hospitalised patients to be placed on sliding scale insulin. They said no specific treatment was required for Madam Tan's Type 2 heart attack as the underlying cause was sepsis, which is the body's life-threatening response to an infection. They added that there was no delay in the resuscitative efforts - the intern called for help immediately and the medical team attended to the patient immediately. They said Dr Dorai Raj, the consultant on call on the night of April 20, did not personally review Madam Tan and was not consulted on her case, and thus, did not owe her a duty of care. The trial continues on Tuesday."
