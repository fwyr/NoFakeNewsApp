https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/new-research-centre-in-ntu-to-further-drive-robotics-role-in-spores-development,New research centre in NTU to further drive robotics' role in S'pore's development,"SINGAPORE - A new $45 million research centre at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will draw on the expertise of various scientists and delve into robotics research to be applied in logistics, manufacturing and eldercare. Scientists at the Centre for Advanced Robotics Technology Innovation, housed at the NTU School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, will also collaborate with researchers from the National University of Singapore and Agency for Science, Technology and Research to develop projects in robotics technologies.  The centre, supported by the National Research Foundation, Singapore, has more than 20 research staff, with the number expected to grow to 50 by next year at full capacity. It will also have about 20 PhD students. Speaking at its opening on Monday (Aug 15), Manpower Minister Tan See Leng said automation and robotics will be needed to supplement Singapore’s shrinking workforce - which is why the country has to focus on the development of robotics technology. “This will help our companies to create new and transformative products and services, enhance Singapore’s competitiveness and create good, value-added, high-paying jobs for Singaporeans,” noted Dr Tan, who is also Second Minister for Trade and Industry. Dr Tan said three key groups - researchers, companies and workers - can seize opportunities arising from the growth of robotics, and added that it was important researchers develop projects that can be applied in industry and work closely with companies, even as the Government identifies robotics as a national priority in its research and development plan. The centre is led by Professor Xie Lihua, a professor of electrical and electronic engineering at NTU. Its co-directors are two robotics experts - Professor Chen I-Ming from NTU and Professor Cecilia Laschi from NUS. It has 14 ongoing projects, with three more on the way. Prof Xie said the three research areas identified are important for Singapore and they each face a manpower crunch after the Covid-19 pandemic. Adopting robotics in manufacturing and logistics can boost productivity, he added. In eldercare, Prof Laschi said one area it is exploring is giving robots learning capabilities using machine learning, so that they can master new skills and forms of interactions with humans. In one logistics project, Professor Wang Danwei is working on developing an autonomous navigation system for vehicles used in places such as ports and warehouses to move containers or goods around. Separately, Professor Hu Guoqiang is developing solutions to allow robots and humans to work together more efficiently and safely in manufacturing processes like precision engineering. “The goal is for robots to carry out the tedious tasks that humans don’t want to do themselves, and work with humans, not to replace them,” he said. Dr Tan said in his speech that the pandemic has spurred demand for robotic technology and automation of processes, and robots have been deployed worldwide to help fight the crisis, like alleviating the load on healthcare systems for instance. “Here in Singapore, as our labour market grew tighter, our companies also found new and innovative ways to operate on a leaner workforce, by depending on automation and technology,” he noted. Workers, too, can pursue good jobs in the robotics sector, said Dr Tan, as the Government supports them in upgrading their skills. “I understand the anxieties that some workers might have about whether they would be replaced by robots in their jobs,” he added, acknowledging that some jobs, such as those involving highly repetitive and labour-intensive tasks, will be disrupted. “But this will also free up workers to take up other more productive and value-added jobs, for example, in operating and maintaining robots,” he said, encouraging workers to undergo training in new skills."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/nutrition-label-for-drinks-sellers-coffee-shop-association-unsure-how-sugar-fat-levels-will-be-measured,"Nutrition labels: Great, but how to measure it, drinks sellers ask","SINGAPORE - Drink stall owners and a coffee shop association welcome the move requiring drinks to be labelled with a Nutri-Grade mark by the end of next year, but are unsure how the nutrition content will be measured. On Thursday (Aug 11), Health Minister Ong Ye Kung announced that outlets selling freshly prepared drinks with a very high level of sugar and saturated fat content must label them with a Nutri-Grade mark in their menus by the end of next year. Such beverages include freshly brewed coffee, freshly squeezed juices and bubble tea. The coffee shop association and drink sellers told The Straits Times on Friday that more customers are asking for healthier options for their coffee fix in recent years. Mr Hong Poh Hin, chairman of the Foochow Coffee Restaurant and Bar Merchants Association, which represents more than 400 coffee shops, said up to 70 per cent of consumers ask for lower-sugar or even no-sugar options for their coffee. But the association is unsure how the nutrition content of the drinks can be determined, said Mr Hong, adding that he hopes the Government can provide more help and clarity. He noted that each cup of coffee or tea may have different amounts of sugar added as they are freshly brewed and prepared. ""How do you bring a sample (to a lab) for testing? It's a bit difficult,"" said Mr Hong. He suggested that coffee stall owners not add any sugar in their coffee by default. ""Consumers can decide how much sugar they want and add it themselves,"" he added. At Bukit Timah Market and Food Centre, a fruit juice stall owner who wants to be known as Mr Yao is also uncertain how the amount of sugar will be measured. The 29-year-old's stall offers a menu of about 30 kinds of fruit, such as apple, banana and honeydew. Customers can combine different types of fruit in their drink. ""I think it's nearly impossible for us because we have so many mixtures. Can you imagine if I have to count (the sugar content) of 20 per cent apple, 20 per cent orange. How am I going to do it?"" said Mr Yao. ""We're unlike a bubble tea shop, where there is a definite recipe to follow, so they know (the sugar content) immediately."" But some coffee drink sellers said they support the new requirements as many of their customers are already switching to healthier drink choices. Mr Sow Tek Siong, who owns Tek Siong Drinks Stall at 84 Marine Parade Central Market and Food Centre, said that over the past three years, half of his customers have been requesting sugarless coffee and tea. ""Many customers said they prefer drinking their coffee and tea with no or less sugar as they find them healthier,"" said the 51-year-old, who has been running the drink stall for 15 years. At the same food centre, Coffee Queen co-owner Angie Nguyen said 60 per cent to 70 per cent of her customers ask for less sugar in their coffee or tea. ""Many people now want to stay healthy and are choosing the healthier choice,"" said the 33-year-old. Consumers also welcomed the Nutri-Grade label requirement as they said it would help them choose a healthier drink. Pre-school educator Joen Ong, 29, who drinks bubble tea twice a week, said she already orders drinks without milk, and opts for a sugar level of 50 per cent. Ms Ong said the new labelling scheme will make a bigger difference in her choices. ""I have a sugar addiction that's hard to stop, but with the information on sugar content, I am more likely to make healthier choices."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/tour-packages-to-see-northern-lights-european-christmas-markets-hot-tickets-as-natas-fair-returns,"Northern Lights, European Christmas market tours popular as Natas fair returns","SINGAPORE - The Natas travel fair is back and so are the crowds, snapping up tour packages to destinations like Hokkaido, Finland for the Northern Lights, and Christmas markets in Europe. The three-day National Association of Travel Agents Singapore fair, last held in August 2019, kicked off on Friday (Aug 12) at the Singapore Expo Hall 5 with more than 40 exhibitors. They include travel agencies, national tourist organisations and travel insurance providers. The organisers are expecting 80,000 to 100,000 visitors this year, on a par with pre-pandemic attendance figures. Minister of State for Trade and Industry Alvin Tan noted at the fair's opening ceremony that outbound travel has picked up pace, with more than 311,000 departures in May this year, a tenfold increase from the previous year. Natas president Steven Ler said: ""Thanks to the pent-up demand over the last two years, we're expecting the surge of holidaymakers to gain momentum as we go through the rest of the year."" Travel agencies The Straits Times spoke to said they are expecting strong demand at the fair this year after a three-year hiatus. ""After Covid-19, people are willing to spend more on travel... For many, seeing the Northern Lights is a bucket list item,"" said EU Holidays director Ong Han Jie. The Northern Lights are typically visible only from November to March. Besides European destinations like Switzerland and Italy, Japan is also highly sought-after, despite the country allowing only package tours for now. ""From now until December, we have 60 groups departing for Japan, but we're going to add 10 to 20 more,"" said Mr Ong. Chan Brothers Travel has also seen a ""red hot"" take-up rate for similar destinations, according to its senior marketing communications manager Jeremiah Wong. Besides Japan and Western Europe, Turkey has also been popular with its customers. New travel trends have also emerged, with more customers willing to take tour packages instead of making travel arrangements on their own. ""Besides repeat and new customers, there has been a substantial shift this time round, where people who might not have considered taking group tours in the past have switched over from free-and-easy travel,"" he noted. ""Many of them are younger customers who are travelling with their parents, and who want peace of mind about (country-specific) pandemic restrictions."" Another major player, Trafalgar, is seeing plenty of interest in trips to see the Northern Lights, as well as multi-city trips to see the Christmas markets around Europe. ""People have been saving up, so they don't mind spending more now... They are also looking for longer and more meaningful trips,"" said Ms Celest Quek, marketing communications director for Asia at The Travel Corporation, whose brands include Trafalgar and Uniworld River Cruises. Among travellers who were scouting for deals at the Natas fair on Friday was university student Alan Tan. The 21-year-old is planning to head to Finland in December for about two weeks to see the Northern Lights with his family. His family's budget for the trip is up to $10,000 for everything, including the tour package, airfare and food. ""I haven't been on any trips since Covid-19 hit, so I'm really looking forward to this one,"" said Mr Tan, who was specifically looking for packages that included a visit to the Santa Claus Village in Lapland, and to see huskies. Others like Mr Yeo Jia Wei, 26, who works in logistics, is looking at a destination closer to home - a week-long trip to South Korea with his friends. For his first holiday overseas in more than 2½ years, he said he is willing to spend $1,500 on the trip, which is $500 more than what he used to spend on trips pre-pandemic. ""Plane ticket prices increased a lot when countries opened up their borders, but even though travelling is more expensive now, I believe it is well worth splurging on,"" said Mr Yeo, who is planning to head to the fair this weekend."

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/singlife-aviva-national-service-affordable-coverage-1-million-insurance-coverage,Life after NS: How to get $1 million in insurance protection,"You may know that your son is covered by some form of insurance while he’s serving his National Service (NS), but chances are, he hasn’t told you that he can actually extend that coverage till he’s 70 and be covered for up to $1 million! Who can blame him; between IPPT training, area cleaning and tekan sessions, he probably has more pressing matters on his mind. Ever wondered what Kumar was like in NS? Watch the video below. Since July 2016, the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF), Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and Home Team have provided all full-time national servicemen (NSFs) and operationally ready national servicemen (NSmen) with free group term life and group personal accident insurance cover, as long as they are on official duties. All NSFs and NSmen will automatically receive S$150,000 of Group Term Life and S$150,000 of Group Personal Accident coverage under what is known as the Core Scheme. The Group Term Life insurance covers insured members in the event of death and total disability as long as they are in service. Meanwhile, the Group Personal Accident policy also covers death and total and permanent disability, but also dismemberment and injuries such as burns or fractures. Pre-existing medical conditions are covered under the Core Scheme. Apart from NSFs and NSmen, Regulars and NS volunteers will also enjoy the same coverage during their period of service. This group insurance coverage is underwritten by leading insurer Singlife with Aviva. The good news is that NSmen can continue with the cover – and even enhance their protection – when they are no longer in active full-time service, or employment as a Regular. They can do this by buying additional insurance cover at very affordable premiums through the Voluntary Scheme. The main plans that can be bought are similar to the Core Scheme: Group Term Life and Group Personal Accident. The Voluntary Scheme was designed to provide long-term affordable protection for NSFs, NSmen, as well as their family members. For just S$1 per month, they can be covered for S$100,000 under the group personal accident coverage, and S$4.101 per month for S$100,000 under the group term life insurance. There is also no underwriting required for the first S$250,000 sum assured for the group term life insurance, and no underwriting required for the group personal accident plan. These plans are portable, that is. They carry on even if the insured leaves the service. For Group Term Life, you can even extend your coverage to a whopping $1 million for $1.372 a day. Meanwhile, the Group Personal Accident policy allows you to purchase coverage of up to S$600,000. The premiums for these policies are also fixed up to age 65, which means that you pay the same amount upon renewal every year until you’re 65.  What’s more, insured members’ spouses and children can also be covered at the same rate. The spouse can choose to carry on with the plan in the event of the member’s death. Don’t worry if your son has completed his full-time National Service and neglected to extend his coverage. NSmen can still sign up for these Voluntary Schemes even after they have ORD-ed, before they reach the Statutory Age for NS Liability; which is 40 years of age for Non-Officers, or WOSES (Warrant Officers, Specialists and Enlistees), and 50 years of age for Officers. Beyond the comprehensive coverage, there are also attractive perks on offer for those who sign up. For instance, Voluntary Scheme members can enjoy discounts on Singlife’s general insurance plans like car, travel and home insurance. Discounts can be as high as 56 per cent, and insured members’ immediate family members – spouse, children, parents and siblings – can enjoy the same privileges. Whether your son is serving his NS with MINDEF or, MHA, the Group Term Life Insurance is an attractive and affordable option for people like him; those who are young and making financial plans for the first time. It is a protection plan that he can build on as he crosses certain life stages after his “ORD loh” cheer – whether it’s getting into university or starting a career – without breaking the bank. He can also buy riders to cover Critical Illness, which are more affordable when one is younger. You should be proud that your son is serving his duty protecting the nation, but there’s no reason why he shouldn’t start planning for life after NS.   To find out more about MINDEF & MHA Group Insurance Scheme, click here.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/close-shave-for-woman-as-three-ceiling-beams-fall-3-floors-in-far-east-plaza,Close shave for woman as three ceiling beams fall 3 floors in Far East Plaza,"SINGAPORE - A woman in Far East Plaza had a narrow escape when three long wooden beams broke from the high ceiling and landed on the second-floor concourse on Wednesday morning (Aug 10). She was sitting on a red bench at the edge of the concourse when the grey beams crashed onto the floor mere metres from her. An employee of a tailor shop next to the concourse said he rushed out when he heard a loud crash and saw the woman hurrying away. She was the only person in the concourse when the incident occurred around 9.45am, said the employee who wanted to be known only as Mr Eric. ""Luckily, the incident happened early in the morning. If there had been more footfall, someone could have got badly hurt,"" he said, adding that most shops in the Orchard mall open after 10am. In response to queries from The Straits Times, the Far East Plaza management said the incident happened when a technician was about to lower the high bay lights from the ceiling to replace a faulty lamp. He inadvertently reversed the direction of the winch, or lifting device, which caused the light fitting to move towards the ceiling trellis. ""The impact caused three pieces of trellis to dislodge and fall from level five to level two. A lady was at the concourse at the time. Fortunately, nobody was injured,"" the mall's management said in its e-mail reply, adding that the concourse was immediately cordoned off. The mall's contractor is expected to carry out repairs on the trellis after the mall closed on Wednesday evening. The concourse will reopen after a thorough inspection, said Far East Plaza's management. When ST visited the strata mall at 3.30pm, the concourse had been fenced off with barriers circling the red bench. There was a gap in the level five ceiling above the bench, and one beam seemed to be hanging after being partially dislodged. The normally quiet morning of retailers and workers - especially those from cafes and coffee shops that had opened before 9am - was jolted by the loud sound of the beams hitting the ground. A number of people from the third to fifth storeys rushed out of their shops to check the commotion, said Mr Eric. A worker, known only as Mr Lim, at Isle Cafe coffee shop next to the concourse said he saw some mall employees rush to clear the debris and fence off the area. Mr Eric said this is the second incident in Far East Plaza recently. On July 10, two glass panels fell to the floor below after a shopper kicked them. No one was injured. ""The area was cordoned off and the glass shards were swept away,"" he said. One of Singapore's oldest shopping complexes, Far East Plaza was opened in 1982."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/broken-pipe-that-caused-water-leakage-in-westgate-shopping-mall-fixed,Broken pipe that caused water leakage in Westgate shopping mall fixed,"SINGAPORE- A broken pipe which caused water to leak from the ceiling of the atrium in Westgate mall has been fixed and the atrium reopened on Tuesday (Aug 9). The leak happened on Monday at about 8.15pm in the mall in Jurong East. In an update on its Facebook page on Tuesday morning, the mall, which is managed by CapitaLand, said the atrium has been cleared up and reopened. This is the second water leakage incident to hit malls within three days. The first incident happened in Nex shopping mall in Serangoon on Saturday. Videos of the Westgate mall incident uploaded on social media showed a stream of water trickling down from a cracked false ceiling onto the second-storey atrium, where a food and lifestyle fair was being held, and a crowd gathering to watch. A store owner at the mall told Chinese news outfit Shin Min Daily News that the merchants at the fair had to move their carts and goods away. The merchants also decided to close their stalls half an hour earlier at about 8.30pm. A Westgate spokesman said on Wednesday that the mall will follow up with its tenants and vendors who were affected and take necessary actions, such as offering fair vendors complimentary participation in a future roadshow.
  Just days earlier on Saturday, water leakage at Nex was linked to parts of the false ceiling in the basement of the mall collapsing. Several shops at the two basement levels had to suspend operations for about a day and reopened on Monday. The mall's spokesman said it was alerted to a water backflow incident at around 6pm on Saturday. A plumbing issue from a tenant's floor trap caused the backflow and water to spread to the retail area on the first storey. The choke was resolved by 11pm, but remnant water continued to leak from the unit and affected some tenants at the basement levels."

In an attempt to boost sales, the 52-year-old will be one of nearly 50 heartland hawkers and merchants from the market as well as Tanjong Pagar Plaza Market and Food Centre to list products on e-commerce platform Lazada in the coming months. Ms Wong, whose clothing and fashion accessories business is half of what it was pre-pandemic, said: ""Everyone is going online, maybe there's a chance that it will help. I want to try."" Lazada aims to launch the Tanjong Pagar-Tiong Bahru Marketplace, with products such as food, clothes and health products, in October, and to bring on board more merchants from the more than 350 stalls at both locations. It is the third such partnership for Lazada, who also worked with One Kampong Gelam and Radin Mas SMC to launch marketplaces in April and May respectively, involving hundreds of heartland businesses. According to a Lazada spokesman, the One Kampong Gelam Marketplace generated five-figure sales within the first three months. Lazada chief executive Loh Wee Lee, Tanjong Pagar Plaza Market and Food Centre Association chairman Quek Tai Yong and Tiong Bahru Market Hawkers' Association chairman Loh Teck Seng signed a memorandum of understanding at Tiong Bahru Market to launch the initiative on Friday (Aug 5). According to the associations, about half of the participating stallholders are above the age of 60 and not tech-savvy. Mr Quek, 69, who runs a fish maw soup stall, said he joined the initiative to keep up with the times. ""I joined because I believe in lifelong learning,"" he said in Mandarin. ""Some stallholders in their 40s and 50s don't know how to use these platforms too, but it's important to learn."" For the first 90 days after stallholders list products on Lazada, they will receive training on everything from product photography to optimising the names for their listings, as well as when to launch promotions. But one potential hurdle is that all training and technical support will be provided in English, which worries stallholders like Mr Gan Beng Chong, 66, who does not speak the language. The clothing store owner said in Mandarin: ""It would be best if they have training in Chinese as well because most of the shop owners in the market are Chinese-speaking, we're not good at speaking English."" He plans to ask other merchants who are bilingual for help, although he does not want to trouble them too much. Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Indranee Rajah, who is also adviser to Tanjong Pagar GRC Grassroots Organisations, said at the signing that the initiative aims to bring the wide array of unique products at both markets to a broader clientele. Another stallholder, Mr Loo Lian Seng, 57, said he plans to list niche kitchenware such as hand-painted rooster bowls, charcoal stoves and wooden rice barrels from his store selling kitchenware and household items to stand out from the crowd and attract more customers. ""I hope it will not be a one-time purchase that they forget about,"" he said. ""Hopefully, they will come down to collect and see more things in the store."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/spore-travellers-can-use-dbs-and-ocbc-apps-to-pay-in-thailand,S'pore travellers can use DBS and OCBC apps to pay in Thailand,"SINGAPORE - Singaporeans going to Thailand can scan QR codes there and make payments using DBS PayLah! and OCBC Pay Anyone apps at more than eight million merchants, retailers and facilities such as train stations across tourist hot spots in Bangkok, Pattaya and Phuket. UOB TMRW users will be able to do so from next year. Merchants here can also accept payments from visiting Thai nationals who use apps or e-wallets from participating banks. The banks include Bank of Ayudhya, Bangkok Bank and Krungthai Bank. This comes after a tie-up between Network for Electronic Transfers (Nets) and Thailand's National ITMX to facilitate inbound and outbound payments between both countries. Singaporeans shopping at places such as Chatuchak Weekend Market and Platinum Mall in Bangkok can look out for a PromptPay QR code. They can then use the DBS PayLah! or OCBC Pay Anyone app to scan the QR code, which will get them to confirm the amount to be paid in baht, view the exchange rate, and pay the final amount in Singapore dollars. Mr Lawrence Chan, chief executive of Nets Group, said: ""Singapore consumers travelling to Thailand can look forward to shopping without hassle. More small merchants that previously accepted cash only are now able to accept QR payments through this service."" He added that merchants in Singapore can also increase their customer base by offering more digital payment options to travellers from Thailand. ""Having a QR payment option with competitive exchange rates will increase convenience for shoppers as they no longer need to worry about having cash on hand,"" said Mr Chan. Mr Ngai Yi Li, 27, who was in Thailand last month, said the DBS PayLah! app will come in handy when he goes there again with his friends in mid-August. The financial consultant, who frequently travelled to Bangkok before Covid-19 hit, said: “This is a really convenient option because I don’t really feel comfortable carrying too much cash around, especially in crowded areas. “So I think I’ll definitely be using the QR codes to purchase things, like my train tickets, so it’s less of a hassle. I just hope that many streetside food stalls and boutique shops there will have the option for us to pay via the app too.”"
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/sfa-suspension-a-surprise-to-local-kueh-manufacturers,SFA suspension a surprise to some Singapore kueh manufacturers,"SINGAPORE - Some local kueh manufacturers were taken by surprise last month when they were told by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) that the production of various kueh products would be suspended due to the improper use of food additives. The suspension came three months after SFA performed inspections in April and found high levels of benzoic acid and sorbic acid in various kueh products by nine local kueh manufacturers. Both chemicals are used in food preservation and allowed in only the filling of kueh products, within permissible limits. Mr Sebastian Ong, operations manager at Tongli Food Manufacturing, told The Straits Times on Thursday (Aug 4) that his company was informed in April that the additives were not allowed in kueh. At the time, the company's yam cake was found to have contained the additives. Mr Ong said: ""We were shocked by the suspension in July because we had already stopped using the additives in April when we were told they were not allowed. We stopped using them immediately. And we made changes to our yam cake recipe to make sure that it was safe."" Changing the recipe took almost a month of trial and error, added Mr Ong. ""It was not easy. We had to make sure that the kueh could last on the shelf for a certain amount of time and also had to ensure that the texture and taste was not compromised. It took us about three weeks of recipe testing."" Mr Ong said business dropped by about 10 per cent since the company stopped production of its yam cake to make the necessary recipe changes. SFA suspended the operations of nine manufacturers on July 26. On July 28, Tiong Bahru Tian Bo Shui Kueh, which owns the popular Jian Bo brand of chwee kueh, had its suspension lifted when it was able to produce test results showing its current products did not contain sorbic acid. Four more manufacturers - Thomson Foodstuff Manufacturing, Delight Baker, AMK Nonya Kueh and Lim Food Industries - had their suspensions lifted on Tuesday. The remaining four manufacturers - Chit Guan Foodstuff, Sin Hwa Coconuts Industrial, Tongli Food Manufacturing and Toh Chuan Kee Foodstuff - had their suspensions lifted on Wednesday, after they, too, provided test results which showed that their current production was free from benzoic or sorbic acid. In a Facebook post on Tuesday, AMK Nonya Kueh said: ""We do not use any benzoic acid in our process and will work closely with SFA to make sure our suppliers abide by the regulations. After this incident, we will be more careful in using the right suppliers and will constantly seek better supplier alternatives."" ST reached out to AMK Nonya Kueh and the other seven manufacturers for comments on the situation but the companies either did not get back by the time of reporting or declined to comment. According to SFA, benzoic and sorbic acid are allowed for addition into fillings like red bean paste and lotus paste as they help to extend the shelf life of the fillings. SFA said kueh products are typically made fresh for sale, have a short shelf life, are displayed at room temperature and sold for consumption within the same day, or the next, if refrigerated. Hence, the further addition of benzoic and sorbic acid into kueh products is not considered to be justified."

The prawns, which were from Malaysia and China, were seized after the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) found them during a check at Sheng Hai Foods' cold store on March 16 last year. Yu Fulong, sole director of Sheng Hai Foods, was fined for failing to prevent the offence from being committed at the cold store in Senoko Drive near Woodlands, said the SFA on Wednesday (Aug 3). SFA said food imports to Singapore must meet its requirements. It added: ""Food can be imported only by licensed importers, and every consignment must be declared and accompanied by a valid import permit. ""Illegally imported food products are of unknown sources and pose a food safety risk."" Those convicted of possessing seafood products imported without a valid permit for the purpose of selling can be jailed for up to two years, fined up to $50,000, or both. Repeat offenders can be jailed for up to three years, fined up to $100,000, or both. The agency also said in a separate statement on Wednesday that an online grocer, BHL Supplies, was fined $13,500 on Wednesday for illegally operating an unlicensed cold store. Its director, Kitson Leong Qing Hao, was also fined $10,000 for failing to prevent the offences from being committed. The agency said its officers discovered the illegal walk-in freezer on Aug 19 last year at BHL Supplies' premises in Gambas Crescent in Sembawang. The freezer was storing various processed meat and seafood products. About 680kg of meat and seafood products were seized. Said SFA: ""Illegal storage of meat and seafood at unlicensed facilities poses a food safety risk. ""All raw meat and seafood storage facilities must be licensed and are required to meet SFA's requirements and food safety standards. ""SFA routinely inspects these licensed premises to ensure compliance."" Those found guilty of possessing any meat or seafood products which have been kept in unlicensed cold stores for the purpose of selling or supplying these products can be jailed for up to two years, fined up to $50,000, or both. Repeat offenders can be jailed for up to three years, fined up to $100,000, or both."

This follows a recall by the European Commission Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed, said SFA on Tuesday. The recall is ongoing. Mai Tai cocktails are typically made with rum, orange curacao, fresh lime juice and orgeat - a syrup made from almonds. SFA added that the presence of almonds does not pose a food safety issue to consumers at large, except for those who are allergic to the ingredient. Under the food regulation laws here, food products containing ingredients that are known to cause hypersensitivity must be declared on food packaging labels to safeguard public health. Consumers who have purchased the product are advised to contact their point of purchase for inquiries."

In addition to importing chickens, these companies also own chicken farms in Malaysia and slaughterhouses here, forcing them to reduce the salaries or working hours of senior and other processing staff after they had already cut the working hours of their slaughterhouse workers earlier."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/departure-of-departmental-stores-from-the-orchard-road-belt-in-recent-years,Departure of departmental stores from the Orchard Road belt in recent years,"SINGAPORE - A number of department stores have left Singapore's premier shopping destination of Orchard Road in recent years, although experts told The Straits Times the departures are part of an ongoing evolution of Orchard Road into a lifestyle destination. Here are the once-household names that have exited the prime retail belt in recent times. Earlier this month, department store OG announced plans to close its Orchard Point outlet in October this year, after an 18-year tenure. An OG spokesman said the closure was part of its long-term strategy to open more outlets closer to its customers in the suburbs. OG agreed to lease its Orchard Point outlet location to a local business that will set up its flagship store and transform the space into a mega-mart concept, specialising in fresh food and groceries. Staff will be transferred to OG's remaining two outlets at Albert Complex and People's Park. After 162 years , Robinsons closed its last two outlets at The Heeren and Raffles City in December 2020 and January last year respectively. It cited reasons such as shifting consumer buying patterns and high rent prices, whose impact made worse by the pandemic. In 2014, it closed its outlet at The Centrepoint, after 31 years as the mall's anchor tenant. In June last year, Robinsons returned as an online store, Robinsons Department Stores Online. Home appliance megastore Courts took over Robinsons' prime retail spot at The Heeren in November last year. Established in the 1950s, the Singapore brand closed its six-story flagship store at The Centrepoint in September 2019, after five years as the mall's anchor tenant. Metro's outlet stores at Paragon and Causeway Point are operating. Sports goods giant Decathlon replaced Metro as anchor tenant in September 2020. The chain's last store closed in Plaza Singapura in December 2016. At the time of the closure, John Little was the oldest department store in Singapore, having been in the country for 174 years. Over the years it also had stores at Marina Square, White Sands and Tiong Bahru Plaza, among other locations. The brand has made minor appearances from time to time in the form of pop-up stores, such as at Suntec City in 2017 and Singpost Centre in 2018. Correction note: In an earlier version of the story, we said that Metro is an Indonesian brand. This is incorrect. Metro is a Singapore brand. We are sorry for the error."

Global Psytech, led by founder Hanizah Yon, was able to do this with a fintech product it developed to understand the borrower's behaviour and assign him an alternative credit score. Pacific Islanders will likely be the next group of people the Malaysian firm is helping - the firm was one of five winning fintech companies in a competition to improve fintech infrastructure in the Pacific Islands that ran from Wednesday (July 27) to Friday. The results of the Pacific Islands Fintech Innovation Challenge 2022 were announced at the closing ceremony on Friday. The event is organised by the United Nations Capital Development Fund, in partnership with Australia's Market Development Facility and the Asian Development Bank. It is aimed at making digital payments and other fintech products accessible to Pacific Islanders in Fiji, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Tonga and Samoa. ""With the current banking situation in the Pacific Islands, we can't sit back and do nothing. We hope that all the brains participating in this challenge can come up with innovative solutions that can help communities in the Pacific Islands,"" said Mr Henry Puna, secretary-general of the Pacific Islands Forum, at the opening ceremony on Wednesday at Prudential Tower in Singapore. Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, who was the guest of honour at the opening event, said: ""The Pacific Islands have always been known for their robust, entrepreneurial people. We believe fintech solutions will help to uplift the prospects for micro-business owners across the Pacific region."" The four other winners were data tech firm Yabx from India, software services provider IT Galax from Fiji, and MIHTS and Windcave from Australia. There were 11 finalists from a field of 51 challengers. The winning firms will get up to US$50,000 (S$69,000) in grants. They will be putting their ideas into practice with partners in the Pacific Islands in the coming months."

Besides having breakfast and lunch options and a supermarket, family-friendly entertainment such as cinemas or play areas, co-working spaces for the office crowd, and tourist-friendly services such as money changers and boutique spas could help to attract regular footfall, they told The Straits Times."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/nightlife-destination-clarke-quay-to-have-day-and-night-offerings-in-2023-after-year-long-revamp,Clarke Quay to have day and night offerings in 2023 after year-long revamp,"SINGAPORE - Nightlife destination Clarke Quay is refreshing its tenant mix to have day and night offerings after a year-long revamp. CapitaLand, which owns and manages the property, said on Tuesday (July 26) that the $62 million revamp will begin in the third quarter of 2022 and be completed in the third quarter of 2023, with Clarke Quay to be operational throughout. Clarke Quay is owned by CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust and managed by CapitaLand Investment. Work on the historical area includes upgrading cooling systems and repainting its conservation buildings. New tenants will join the fold, adding day activities as well as breakfast and lunch options when the revamp - which comes as tourists return to Singapore - is completed. They include music store Swee Lee, a grocery with in-store dining by FairPrice Finest, and a beauty salon and pottery-themed cafe Catching the Waves by Initia Group. To attract crowds in the day, existing key tenants Zouk Group and 1-Group will expand their day-to-night offerings, said CapitaLand. Slingshot, a thrill ride that catapults riders almost 70m into the air and reaches a speed of 160kmh, will give adrenaline junkies something to look forward to. CapitaLand said it has pre-commitment from tenants and leases in advanced negotiations for more than 70 per cent of Clarke Quay's net lettable area from the revamp's completion date. About 34 per cent of the total project cost will go towards green features, said CapitaLand, which added that the revamp is expected to meet the Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark GoldPlus certification standards. These features include a more energy-efficient chiller and a new canopy. CapitaLand said the canopy can reduce solar heat gain by up to 70 per cent while letting daylight through. A new multi-directional fan will be installed to improve air circulation, cutting energy usage by more than 50 per cent compared with the current single-directional fan. The new fan also has a mist cooling function that lowers temperatures by about 2 deg C without leaving water droplets on surfaces, said CapitaLand. It added that the refreshed property will be branded CQ @ Clarke Quay. Rejuvenation works will be led by local firms Meta Architecture and Formwerkz Architects. The firms' plans are focused on uncovering the area's history and telling hidden stories, said CapitaLand. The facade of Block B's warehouses will be repainted according to its original colours, while visitors can find out more about Clarke Quay's history through heritage panels, cast-iron manhole covers and bronze plate tiles. Read Bridge, which connects Clarke Quay to Boat Quay, will have upgraded steps that double as seats, along with a new accessibility ramp and lookout points. In future, Clarke Quay will also be connected to residential development CanningHill Piers - which is being built by CapitaLand Development and City Developments on the former Liang Court's site and should be completed in 2025 - by a riverfront promenade situated on an existing road that separates the residential development from the river. Swee Lee chief executive Kuok Meng Ru said its new outlet, spanning about 6,000 sq ft, will open in mid-2023. “Given its central location, international recognition and historical significance, we saw the repositioning of CQ @ Clarke Quay as an exciting opportunity to expand Swee Lee’s footprint at home in Singapore,” he said. He added that the new showroom will have a wide range of notable brands, and also have a click-and-collect counter that integrates online and offline shopping. Besides musical instruments, the store will have music lifestyle products and Swee Lee Social Club, a cafe and social event space. A FairPrice spokesman said on Wednesday that the FairPrice Finest outlet will have a diverse range of products such as organic and deli foods at competitive prices, as well as basic daily essentials that are priced the same across all other FairPrice-operated supermarkets. More details will be shared later in the year, he added."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/how-a-single-device-can-transform-hybrid-work-spaces,How a single device can transform hybrid work spaces,"The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in an irreversible shift in the way work is done. Still, despite employees having spent more time working from home in the past two years, many home offices are not well-equipped to provide a conducive environment to support hybrid work arrangements. Excessive desktop clutter. Limited space. Noisy working environments. These are just some of the issues that have plagued employees since the start of the pandemic. Leading computer peripherals and video conferencing solutions company, Logitech, through extensive consumer research, has rolled out an all-in-one solution to address the problems employees faced while working from home — the Logi Dock. A dock station, desktop speaker, microphone and charger all packed in one compact device, Logitech’s latest productivity gadget aims to solve the issues remote workers have been facing in a single fell swoop. Its sleek, minimalist aesthetics aside, the true beauty of the Dock lies in how it is designed to fit seamlessly into your existing workflow.  For one, the setup process for the Logi Dock is essentially plug-and-play; employees can set up their own work-from-home office without the assistance of company tech support.  And when it comes to connectivity, most other docking stations pale in comparison.  Two USB-A ports, three USB-C ports and an upstream USB-C port mean that you can connect as many devices as you need, from external hard drives, webcams and even desktop fans for those especially hot days. Whether you use a Mac, PC or Chromebook, the Logi Dock gets rid of unnecessary chargers and power cords, effectively decluttering your desktop and workspace for increased productivity. Beyond that, a DisplayPort and HDMI port provide support for multi-monitor setups, allowing you to keep an eye on a second screen at all times. Need to refer to some spreadsheets on a secondary monitor, or even just keep a playlist of music open? The Logi Dock will let you do just that. But the most unique feature of the Logi Dock is how it doesn’t just connect peripherals: It integrates your entire workday seamlessly.  Certified for Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and Zoom, the Logi Dock works seamlessly with the most commonly used video conferencing platforms today, meaning you won’t have to worry about compatibility issues.  Logitech’s included Logi Tune software not only allows you to fine-tune the settings of the Logi Dock and your connected Logitech webcams and headsets, but also syncs your Microsoft Office 365 Calendar or Google Calendar with the Logi Dock. This effectively turns the Logi Dock into a personal assistant atop your desk: When Logi Tune detects a meeting in your calendar, the ambient light at the bottom of the Logi Dock will light up to notify you. A single touch of the centre button will then connect you to your next meeting. Meeting start/end button aside, the Logi Dock keeps its interface simple with just four other capacitive touch buttons: A dedicated mute button, camera button and volume controls mean that fumbling with menus and settings mid-meeting is now a thing of the past. The Logi Dock isn’t just poised to transform home offices. Rather than continue the tradition of large, multi-person meeting rooms, companies are increasingly opting to replace them with meeting pods — single-person workspaces aimed at giving employees more autonomy and individual space for focus work.  But outfitting these single-person “phone booths” with the necessary infrastructure is time-consuming and costly. Many offices struggle with unwieldy solutions for video conferencing, such as the usage of multiple software and output/input devices that will inevitably result in compatibility issues. This is where the Logi Dock comes in as a one-stop solution, letting companies equip their one-person working spaces with a single video conferencing tool for the job.  Because the Dock isn’t just a docking station for peripherals: It’s also equipped with six beamforming microphones for maximum clarity, and with the help from advanced algorithms, filters out background noise. No more yelling into the microphone, and no more clients or colleagues asking you to repeat that last sentence. And when it comes to audio output, the Logi Dock delivers in spades. The custom-designed 55mm neodymium drivers replicate vocals and instruments alike with sparkling clarity. Passive radiators on each side add weight and emphasis to bass response. The whole Dock is encased in an anti-vibration enclosure, ensuring what comes out of the speakers is distortion free, even when the volume is turned up. So whether you’re just taking notes on your next online meeting, or playing some music to get you through your work day, the Logi Dock will handle all your audio needs with aplomb. There’s a revolution sweeping through offices all over the world, and Logitech is leading the charge with the Logi Dock.  Pre-order now with Logitech to transform your workflow."

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/og-to-shut-orchard-point-outlet-after-18-years-to-be-replaced-by-fresh-food-and-grocery-store,"Pre-opening queues, crowds at OG's Orchard Point outlet after announcement of closure","SINGAPORE - Queues formed outside the entrances of department store OG at Orchard Point on Friday morning (July 22), the day after the retailer announced it would be shutting the outlet in October.  There were around 50 people each at the store’s two main entrances. Queues started forming just before it opened at 11am.  Customers entered in an orderly fashion, with most flocking to the first level’s womenswear section, and the fourth floor’s homeware and electronics sections. OG, the latest familiar name to close its doors in Orchard Road, said on Thursday that it would be shutting the Orchard Point outlet after an 18-year run to make way for a new store specialising in fresh food and groceries. It did not reveal the name of the new tenant taking over the space. A spokesman for OG told The Straits Times that over the years, many different businesses have approached it to lease the building’s shopping podium. “But last year, one local business pitched to us their vision to establish their flagship store at our Orchard Road location, building on their strength in fresh food and grocery to create a landmark experiential space that would have live seafood, differentiated food and beverage, and exclusive merchandise,” the spokesman said. “We then accepted their proposal to transform the space into a mega-mart concept store and leased the space to them.” The Orchard Road stalwart, which sits between The Centrepoint and Orchard Plaza, also announced a moving-out sale on its Facebook page, with clearance deals of up to 90 per cent off. Among the customers picking up deals was Ms Aisyah Binsmit, 45, who is self-employed. She had seen the news about the store’s closing from messages circulating in her WhatsApp groups. “I was not planning to come down today, but I missed the Robinsons and Isetan closing sales, so I thought I would swing by,” said Ms Aisyah, who bought shoes and a wallet during her shopping trip.  Robinsons had closed its remaining two department stores at The Heeren in December 2020 and at Raffles City in January 2021, while Japanese retail giant Isetan shut down its Westgate store in Jurong East in 2020 and its Parkway Parade outlet in March this year. Ms Aisyah lamented the loss of department stores, which she said are a convenient one-stop shop.  “All the department stores are closing one by one; it’s so sad,” she said. “I’m old school, I don’t do boutiques... This is familiar and easy and quick.” It was a sentiment mirrored by sales manager Cassandra Teo.  Ms Teo, 45, was not aware of the department store was closing and decided to walk in to check out why it was crowded.  She noted how some familiar department store names have either closed down all their stores or scaled down their operations here.  “Names like Sogo, Metro and OG don’t resonate with the new generation, but the older generation grew up with these names and there is a familiarity,” she said. Home-grown retailer OG, whose operations date back to the 1960s, bought the Orchard Point building in 2003 and opened its outlet there in January 2004 after renovations.  The retailer has two other outlets at Albert Complex and People’s Park. “As part of our long-term strategy, we are looking to open more outlets closer to our suburban customers,” said the OG spokesman. OG said it hopes to add stores in the heartlands, where the majority of its customers live. “We prefer to own the property that we operate in and are evaluating locations outside of the city,” the spokesman added. Staff whom ST spoke to said they have not yet been told what would happen to their jobs once the Orchard Point outlet closes in October. In response to queries from ST, OG’s spokesman said that staff from the outlet will be redeployed to the remaining two outlets, or to OG's e-commerce business. “The OG staff will be transferred (to the other outlets) but we have not heard what will happen to the promoters,” said a promoter, who wanted to be known only as Ms Lim. The 59-year-old has worked as a promoter at OG for the last 18 years. She remained cheerful while serving customers on Friday.  “Once they announced we were closing, we were very sad because many of us have worked here for many years,” said Ms Lim.  She expects the store to remain crowded this weekend, and all the way till it closes in a few months’ time.  “A lot of customers have told us, ‘Please tell your boss to stay here, we like it here...' but we can’t do anything,” she added. "
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/new-facility-opens-in-tuas-for-firms-to-loan-equipment-and-produce-plant-based-protein,New facility opens in Tuas for firms to produce plant-based protein like meatless patties,"SINGAPORE - Consumers may have access to more varieties of plant-based protein including meatless patties with the opening of a new contract manufacturing facility in Tuas. The 11,000 square foot facility will allow different firms to use specialised equipment to scale-up production of their plant-based proteins without purchasing their own machines, said Cremer Sustainable Foods on Wednesday (July 20). A joint venture between Asia Sustainable Foods (ASF) Platform, a company owned by Temasek, and German agri-food multinational company Cremer, the plant will be able to produce 1,300 tonnes of plant protein per year. That is the equivalent to the protein in 4.3 million chicken breasts. Mr Mathys Boeren, chief executive of ASF, said that 1,000 of the plant's manufacturing capacity has already been contracted by a client. Manufacturing of these contracted plant-based proteins will begin on Aug 1. Mr Boeren said another four to five companies are currently in talks to manufacture their plant-based protein products at the site. ""The ASF's aim is to accelerate the commercialisation of sustainable food products,"" he added. Mr Boeren said this uptake can happen if agri-tech firms are provided with end-to-end support to create their products and make them available to the mass market in a cost effective way. Mr Damian Krueger, general manager of sustainable nutrition at Cremer, said the plant has specialised manufacturing machine including the high moisture extruder. It is able to take plant protein from a range of sources and mould them into different forms including meatballs, popcorn chicken and patties. Mr Krueger said the specifics of the protein manufactured will depend on the client that uses the facility. Minister of State for Trade and Industry Low Yen Ling said the facility would further position Singapore as the nexus for agri-food trade in Asia. Ms Low said: ""With partners like Temasek and Cremer, Singapore hopes to bring together innovators in this field, strengthen our agri-food ecosystem, foster greater knowledge sharing across the industry, and ultimately create a more sustainable future."""

Upticks in the economy have led to an increase in retail sales over the past few months, noted guest of honour and Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Indranee Rajah. She opened the 17th edition of the jewellery show at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre at integrated resort Marina Bay Sands on Thursday (July 14). Singapore's gross domestic product grew 4.8 per cent year on year in the second quarter, led by the manufacturing sector, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry on Thursday. While it was faster than the upwardly revised 4 per cent in the first quarter, it was weaker than the 5.4 per cent economists had expected in a Bloomberg poll. The economic growth was backed by strong visitor arrivals to Singapore, which crossed 1.5 million in the first half of the year. Singapore expects four million to six million visitor arrivals this year, according to a Singapore Tourism Board forecast announced on Thursday. ""Just recently, in May 2022, retailers of watches and jewellery recorded higher sales of more than 60 per cent year on year,"" said Ms Indranee. ""The jewellery sector can continue to see improved business performance as economic recovery is expected to continue, and as we head towards the year-end festive season,"" she added. The growth has been seen across the spectrum for both high- and lower-end pieces, said retailers The Straits Times spoke to. Russian mining giant Alrosa PJSC supplies about a third of the world's raw gems, and sanctions by the United States against the company have put a squeeze on the world's diamond supply. Mr Ronald Low, gemologist from home-grown and family-run bespoke jeweller Ivy Masterpiece said there was a surge of people buying jewellery during Covid-19, when people had a lot more disposable income to spend and one avenue they could do it was in luxury goods. ""As the markets did open up when travel curbs eased, the demand is still really high, but supply is still at a bottleneck because of Covid-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war,"" he added. He said this has caused the price of diamonds the company buys from suppliers to go up by about 20 per cent. Similarly, fine jeweller Infiniti Jewels marketing manager Kabil Raj said prices of diamonds it buys from suppliers have gone up by about 10 per cent since the Russia-Ukraine war. But he said people who are investing in gems now to beat the goods and services tax (GST) hike from 7 per cent to 8 per cent next year are a minority so far. He said: ""The love for jewellery is always there, and people continue to purchase gems for weddings and engagements, or even for investments... The appetite for the jewellery market is still strong and the only thing that would change that is mines running out. It was a sentiment mirrored by Singapore Jewellers Association president Ho Nai Chuen, who said the strong demand for jewellery here has reinforced the belief that jewellery is a good investment to hedge against inflation. ""Three things hold true during a pandemic - the number of marriages increase, birth rates go up, and people in general buy more jewellery as a good source of investment,"" said Mr Ho. The number of marriages last year rose sharply, with a 25.1 per cent jump from 2020, while there was only a marginal 0.2 per cent rise in births last year, compared with 2020. Mr Ho also noted how growth in retail sales, which rose 17.8 per cent year on year in May, was primarily led by higher spending in goods such as watches and jewellery. This marked a third consecutive month of increase in retail sales. ""This good news will give confidence to our local jewellers to continue pursuing innovation, embracing technology, adopting sustainability and brave crossing borders to seek to globalise their businesses,"" he said. The expo was organised by Conference and Exhibition Management Services, alongside the Singapore Jewellers Association, and features 200 brands from Singapore and around the world. Among the highlights is a $1.25 million necklace made up of more than 34 carats of natural unheated pigeon blood Burma ruby and more than 20 carats of diamonds."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/spore-expects-4-to-6-million-visitors-in-2022-top-visitor-markets-are-indonesia-india-and-malaysia,S'pore expects 4 to 6 million visitors in 2022,"SINGAPORE - As global travel picks up, four to six million visitors will be expected in Singapore this year, said the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) on Thursday (July 14). In the first half of 2022, there were 1.5 million visitor arrivals - nearly 12 times more, compared with the same period last year. The top five visitor markets were Indonesia, India, Malaysia, Australia and the Philippines, accounting for more than half the total visitor arrivals from January to June. Visitors from Indonesia, India and Malaysia, in particular, registered the highest year-on-year growth in numbers. The average length of stay for visitors also more than doubled in the first half of the year, with visitors staying for about 7.1 days, compared with 3.4 days in 2019. Tourism receipts reached an estimated $1.3 billion in the first quarter of the year, more than 200 per cent more than for the same period last year. However, STB said tourism flows will face some challenges for the rest of the year because of the volatile global political and economic environment, and the evolving health situation. STB said: ""We remain cautiously optimistic and anticipate a strong performance from key source markets this year, given a strong pipeline of events such as the Formula 1 Singapore Airlines Singapore Grand Prix 2022 and the Bloomberg New Economy Forum."" Just before the pandemic, Singapore saw record visitor arrivals in 2019 with 19.1 million arrivals. In 2018, visitor arrivals  hit 18.5 million.  Though STB’s projection of four to six million is a fraction of pre-pandemic numbers, Professor Lawrence Loh from the National University of Singapore Business School said it still shows a “notable momentum” for the recovering tourism industry.  “We are reaching a point where we are seeing a potential ignition or catalysis of international travel,” said Prof Loh.  “It’s very respectable, given that we really started opening up only towards the mid-year... Looking ahead to next year and the years to come, it augurs well for Singapore’s international visitor arrivals,” he added.  Booking platform Klook has already seen close to a 150 per cent increase in inbound bookings to Singapore. Aside from source markets such as Indonesia, India and Malaysia, Klook has seen robust interest from other countries in the region, such as the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. General manager for Klook in Singapore, Ms Sarah Wan, expects this trend to continue towards the year-end travel season. “In the past two years, Singapore has been successful at protecting its tourism infrastructure, which has helped it strongly capture this first wave of revenge travel in Asia,” said Ms Wan.  “With the revival of events, as well as other facets of our tourism landscape such as cruises, our outlook remains optimistic for this year,” she said. She added that Singapore’s recovery continues to outpace the region's, especially when it comes to high-value visitors, with a 75 per cent increase in average spend, as compared with 2019.  Experts like Mr Paul Kent, partner for advisory at KPMG in Singapore, said a game changer for Singapore has been the major events that it has managed to attract here.  “Convincing international players to host large numbers of visitors in Singapore has been an endorsement for the country,” said Mr Kent.  “It essentially communicates to the world that Singapore is one of the safest countries in the world with good Covid-19 protocols, while also being a place of interest in Asia... For instance, the nation has been described as a microcosm of modern Asia and a stress-free travel destination.”  Despite the forecast, he said, it does not mean Singapore is out of the woods, as restrictions in Singapore could still be tightened should the Covid-19 situation worsen.  He added: “We’re also seeing global inflation posing great concerns, with the market taking a more cautious viewpoint that a recession might be coming soon. Eyes will be on the various policy measures put in place to manage these challenges - all of which have implications for private and business spending, alongside general economic recovery.” STB chief executive Keith Tan said the encouraging growth in visitor arrivals and tourism receipts signal strong pent-up demand, and underscore Singapore's continued appeal as a vibrant and attractive destination for leisure and business travellers. He said: ""While the pandemic is certainly not over yet, we are confident that Singapore's very rich calendar of events, as well as new and refreshed tourism offerings, will continue to attract visitors for the rest of 2022 and beyond."""

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/competition-challenges-tertiary-students-to-tackle-problems-in-retail-industry,Competition challenges tertiary students to tackle problems in retail industry,"SINGAPORE - A subscription service for emergency firefighting supplies, a mobile app for gig workers and a reusable grocery delivery crate were the top three projects in a competition to solve issues faced by the local retail industry. The SRA Retail Reimagined Innovation Challenge 2022 was organised by the Singapore Retailers Association (SRA). The winning groups - Team Commersseurs, Team X-3 and Team Biodynamic - were picked from 42 teams comprising 163 members from 11 institutes of higher learning in the preliminary round, which took place in June. They presented their projects in the final round on Tuesday (July 12) to a judging panel comprising representatives from SRA, Enterprise Singapore and retail companies. For the competition, SRA worked with 10 partners from the retail industry to develop challenge statements, including how retailers can leverage e-commerce and digitalisation, and how they can adapt to changes brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. The partners included supermarket chain FairPrice, emergency products store EmergencyBiz and perfume store Scent by Six. Each team had to submit a solution for one of the 10 prescribed challenges. The finalists were judged according to four criteria: effectiveness, feasibility, viability and the quality of their presentation. The winner, Team Commersseurs, comprised Ms Teng Ting, 22, Mr Chua Jia Sheng, 25, and Mr Chng Chun Kang, 25, from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), and Ms Tan Xuan Wen, 22, from the National University of Singapore (NUS). They impressed the judges with a marketing pitch for emergency products using a subscription-based business model. The team won $5,000 in cash and $2,000 worth of shopping vouchers. It proposed that households subscribe to a plan, priced between $8 and $15 monthly, which includes a fire extinguisher, medical aid kit and lessons on how to use the equipment to douse a fire. SRA council member Jason Lee said: ""What stood out for us about their project was that they weren't just dreaming for the moon... but were mindful that their project was applicable and executable."" The competition showed the students real-time challenges faced by retailers. Mr Alan Yeo, director of retail and design at Enterprise Singapore, who was also the guest of honour at the event, said: ""Competitions like these are important because they help retailers work with the community to inspire and come up with out-of-the-box solutions, and tackle problems with fresh perspectives."" The second prize went to Team X-3 from Temasek Polytechnic, which developed a mobile app that connects gig economy workers such as delivery riders and sales staff with retail brands to deal with manpower shortage. The third prize winner, Team Biodynamic from NTU, NUS and the Singapore Institute of Technology, partnered FairPrice to devise a system using reusable crates instead of plastic bags to pack online delivery orders of grocery items to reduce packaging waste. Team Commersseurs' Mr Chua said his group plan to kick off their project soon by acquiring seed funding from private investors and see it through to execution. Referring to the recent spate of fires, he said: ""We think that fire safety is a very real concern... With our project, we hope that people and property lost because of fires will become a thing of the past."""

The new addition comes after the home port in Singapore resumed operations on June 15, the company said on Friday (July 8). The dual home port is designed to cater to the needs of the 10 million people in central Peninsular Malaysia, who live within a short distance of Port Klang, the embarkation port in Kuala Lumpur. Mr Michael Goh, the president of Resorts World Cruises, said: ""Resorts World Cruises is excited to take the lead for the cruise sector to increase in-and-outbound tourist numbers for Singapore; and to bring cruising to the 'doorsteps' of Malaysians residing in central Peninsular Malaysia as they can depart from Kuala Lumpur, which is convenient and affordable."" The cruise line will be offering two- and three-night cruises, starting at $230 and $330. Travellers from Singapore will be able to depart on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays. From July 22, the two-night High Seas Weekend Getaway cruises departing on Fridays will be reintroduced. After almost two years of ""cruises to nowhere"" due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the cruise sector is properly resuming operations again. Singapore had ceased port calls for cruise ships since March 2020. Genting Dream is also the first OIC/SMIIC (Organisation of Islamic Cooperation/Standards and Metrology Institute for Islamic Countries) standard halal-friendly cruise ship in the world, aiming to appeal to a significant segment of Malaysian and international travellers. Along with inclusive offerings on board, there will also be dining at the Dream Dining restaurant and a wide spread of international and Asian cuisine, with a dedicated section for certified halal, vegetarian and Jain cuisine at The Lido restaurant. An all-day snack corner will also be available. For entertainment purposes, the cruise liner offers international stage performances and movie screenings at the Zodiac theatre, which can accommodate 1,000 people. There will also be offerings for those who wish to participate in water activities and recreational options for families. All crew and guests are required to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19. Guests will also have to undergo a self-paid pre-cruise antigen rapid test one day before departure."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/chicken-sellers-pushing-on-with-business-but-hopeful-for-end-to-malaysias-ban,Chicken sellers pushing on with business but hopeful for end to Malaysia's ban,"SINGAPORE - Though they have pushed on with the business by selling chicken from other countries, poultry sellers in Singapore are still eager for the Malaysian chicken export ban to end. Most poultry sellers at four markets The Straits Times visited on Thursday (July 7) said that they are looking forward to Malaysia lifting the export ban on commercial broiler chicken as there is still demand from their customers for the product. Malaysia partially lifted the ban last month, allowing exports of kampung chicken and black chicken. Some wet market poultry sellers have experienced a dip in business even after they pivoted to kampung or frozen chicken. This is despite recent efforts to diversify Singapore's chicken supply, such as increasing imports from Thailand and the impending imports from Indonesia. Mr Abdul Rahman, 62, owner of Fresh & Frozen Meat Supplier at Rivervale Plaza, said sales have dropped by about 30 per cent since the ban, as customers still prefer chicken from Malaysia. He said: ""Now, we are selling frozen chicken from Brazil. We don't have any other chicken to sell. Some customers don't like the frozen chicken, and they still ask for the fresh chicken."" Over at Geylang Serai Market, Mr Hashim Abbas, 73, owner of Hashim Abbas Supplier of Fresh & Frozen Chicken & Meat, said he now sells frozen chicken from Brazil and Thailand, and kampung chicken from Malaysia. Overall, prices at his stall have increased by about 50 cents per kg of chicken and this has led to a drop of 50 per cent in sales. Madam Roslina Onm, 55, owner of Jaafar Fresh and Frozen Chicken at Geylang Serai Market, said that though business has been stable as most of her customers are willing to accept chicken from other sources, she still hopes for the ban to end soon. She said: ""We are excited for the chicken to come back from Malaysia because many customers prefer it. We don't have a choice now but to sell the frozen chicken. But fresh chicken is nicer."" Malaysia imposed a ban on chicken exports from June 1 due to a shortage in the country. Exports were halted so that prices and supplies there could stabilise. While kampung chicken and black chicken from Malaysia are now available in Singapore, commercial broiler chicken - which makes up the majority of Singapore's chicken imports from Malaysia - is still banned. According to the Singapore Food Agency, 34 per cent of Singapore's chicken supply comes from Malaysia, with most chickens imported live and slaughtered here. Hawker stalls that sell mainly chicken dishes have also been affected by the export ban. Chicken rice stall owners that ST spoke to said they have had to increase the price of their dish by 50 cents to $1 to continue making a profit. Ms Xu Haixia, 42, who owns Teck Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice at Kovan 209 Market & Food Centre, said a plate of chicken rice from her stall now costs $4.50, up from $3.50. She said: ""Prices have been adjusted upwards due to supply constraints for frozen chicken. Business has also decreased because the taste of frozen chicken is different."" A check with supermarket chains here found that chicken supply has remained stable.  A spokesman for FairPrice said it is working with the authorities and its partners to bring in chicken supplies from Indonesia. The spokesman added: “We will continue to expand our network and grow our food sources to provide more options for our customers.”  A spokesman for Sheng Siong noted that the approval of Indonesia as another source of supply for chicken meat will enhance its diversification efforts and said that its stocks of frozen chicken “remain robust”.  Consumers ST spoke to said they have been buying less chicken, and now buy more fish or other meats instead. Senior property officer Affandi Junaidi, 51, said that while he used to buy fresh chicken that came from Malaysia, he has since swopped to frozen chicken and does not mind which country it comes from. He said: ""If Singapore can get alternative sources for chicken they should leverage it. It makes no difference to me if the chicken is from Indonesia."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/8000-fine-for-man-who-illegally-imported-meat-seafood-products-from-china,"$8,000 fine for man who illegally imported meat, seafood products from China","SINGAPORE - A 54-year-old man was fined $8,000 on Wednesday (July 6) after he was found to have illegally imported food products from China. Singaporean Lui Whatt Beng, the sole proprietor of Lui Fammart, imported meat and seafood products along with other processed food items and sold them online, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) said in a statement on Wednesday. SFA said that in November last year, its officers seized about 21kg of seafood and meat products and 240kg of processed food products including beancurd and instant noodle sauces during an operation. Investigations by SFA later revealed that Lui had imported the products from China. Food can be imported to Singapore only through licensed importers. Each consignment has to be declared and bear a valid import permit. SFA said: “In Singapore, all food importers are required to apply for an SFA import licence and comply with relevant legislation governed by SFA before importing food into Singapore.  “Depending on the types of imported food, specific conditions and requirements would apply. Illegally imported food products are of unknown sources and poses food safety risk.” For illegally importing meat and seafood products, Lui could have been fined up to $50,000 and faced a jail term of up to two years. For illegally importing processed food products, he could have received an additional fine of up to $1,000. Consumers who come across the sale of illegal food products are advised to not patronise such platforms, said SFA. They can also provide feedback via an online feedback form or call SFA's contact centre at 6805 2871 to provide details for follow-up investigations."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/customer-satisfaction-in-retail-sector-dips-but-rises-for-info-communications-sector-smu-study,Customer satisfaction in retail dips but rises in infocommunications sector: SMU study,"SINGAPORE - Takashimaya department store, supermarket chain Sheng Siong as well as fashion labels Uniqlo and Zalora have received the thumbs up from consumers but a study shows that customer satisfaction in the retail sector has declined. These findings, revealed on Wednesday (July 6), come from an annual study by the Institute of Service Excellence (ISE) at Singapore Management University. The study shows that customer satisfaction in the retail sector - which comprises department stores, fashion apparel, supermarkets and e-commerce - fell by 1.5 per cent compared with last year, scoring 71.3 points out of a possible 100. The other sector that was tracked - infocommunications - saw customer satisfaction improving by 1.9 per cent, with 69.8 points, reversing two years of decline. The study, which computes customer satisfaction scores at the national, sector, sub-sector and company levels, involved face-to-face and online interviews, with 4,800 local consumers polled between January and April this year. Ms Neeta Lachmandas, ISE executive director, said the customer satisfaction index provides a compass for businesses on areas that they need to focus on and what their customers find important to attract their patronage again. ""In all, the studies that we have been doing, we actually do see that customer satisfaction studies have a positive correlation with the business performance of the company,"" she added. The findings come a day after the Department of Statistics revealed that retail sales surged 17.8 per cent year on year in May, extending a 12.1 per cent growth in April. Ms Lachmandas, who noted that the retail sector has picked up in recent months, added that Singapore's relaxation of Covid-19 measures has led to a lot of stores reopening. The department store sub-sector scored 70.9 points (a 2.4 per cent dip year on year)  while the fashion apparel one logged 72.1 points (a decline of 1.7 per cent). Takashimaya headed the department store sub-sector with 76.3 points (a 0.7 per cent increase). Uniqlo, which topped the fashion apparel sub-sector, had 75.9 points (a 4.7 per cent rise). The supermarket sub-sector's 71.4 points marked a decline of 0.8 per cent, while the e-commerce sub-sector had 70.8 points (down by 0.5 per cent). Sheng Siong, which topped the supermarket sub-sector, scored 75 per cent (a dip of 0.2 per cent), while Zalora, which headed the e-commerce sub-sector, had 75.1 points (a 4.5 per cent increase). The study shows that customers of department stores and fashion apparel outlets had lower levels of customer loyalty, with scores falling by 4 per cent and 3.5 per cent, respectively. Customer loyalty in the study is defined as the likelihood of consumers repurchasing from the store or brand, and their tolerances towards price changes, said ISE. Some key drivers to improving customer loyalty include product-related attributes such as variety and quality, as well as in-store experiences such as promotions, pricing and store design. There are also large differences in customer satisfaction and loyalty levels between customers who did their shopping in a physical store and those who had an ""omni-channel experience"" via online and in-store. For example, fashion apparel sub-sector respondents who indicated that they had only physical store experience had a customer loyalty score of 70.2 points. However, those with an omni-channel experience achieved 76.6 points. Another observation is the prevalence of cashless payments and its impact on customer experience. The study saw cashless payment usage surge from 44.8 per cent in 2018 to 82.9 per cent in 2022. Cashless payment is linked to the use of physical credit and debit cards, Nets or mobile wallets such as Apple Pay and GrabPay. Although the growth in cashless payment had been on an upward trajectory before the pandemic, the outbreak seems to have accelerated the adoption, Ms Lachmandas said. Retail customers who went cashless gave a satisfaction rating of 7.51 points, on a scale of 1 to 10, for the payment process, significantly better than those using cash, with an average rating of 7.17 points. In the infocommunications sector, the mobile telecommunications sub-sector logged 70 points (a 1.2 per cent rise), while the broadband sub-sector's 68.3 points represented a 2.2 per cent increase. The other two sub-sectors are video streaming service with 72.7 points (a 0.9 per cent dip) and pay TV with 69.6 points. The score for pay TV is not comparable to previous years due to a change in data collection methodology, moving from face-to-face interviews to online surveys. StarHub topped the mobile telecommunications sub-sector with 70.8 points (a 0.8 per cent increase) and pay TV sub-sector with 70.7 points. Singtel headed the broadband sub-sector with 68.8 points (a 3.5 per cent increase) while Disney+, a new inclusion in this year's study, topped the video streaming services sub-sector. Within the mobile telecommunications sub-sector, the year-on-year increase in the satisfaction score was driven by significant improvements by mobile virtual network operators such as Circles.Life, Gomo and MyRepublic. These operators saw marked progress in key drivers of customer satisfaction, such as product and service quality, as well as perceived value. A spokesman said it prides itself on delivering good service and is glad that the efforts of its front-liners are recognised by customers. “Given the manpower shortage we are facing, we will try our best to uphold our service standards in our ""all for you"" spirit, added the spokesman.  A spokesman said its priority has always been improving customers’ online and in-store shopping experience. The company continues to introduce new features, including offering Online Returns Box and same day Click & Collect service at its outlet in The Clementi Mall.  “We look forward to expanding our services and introducing new initiatives... and ensure a seamless and enjoyable shopping journey both online and in-store,” added the spokesman. StarHub said it is heartened and humbled by its customers’ rating. “With their continued support, we took pole position in both mobile and TV, while our broadband score held strong amid fierce competition, differentiated by small percentage points among all three operators,” it noted."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/hdb-will-review-policies-coffee-shop-food-affordability-if-necessary-desmond-lee,HDB will review policies for coffee shop food affordability if necessary,"SINGAPORE - The Housing Board regularly monitors the resale market for HDB coffee shop transactions, as well as the prices of food, and ""will not hesitate to review its policies to address affordability concerns"", said National Development Minister Desmond Lee. Mr Lee was replying via written response on Tuesday (July 5) to parliamentary questions on efforts to keep food prices affordable, after several multimillion-dollar transactions for coffee shops came under the spotlight in recent weeks. The questions came from MPs Jamus Lim (Sengkang GRC), Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC), Shawn Huang (Jurong GRC), Foo Mee Har (West Coast GRC) and Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok), as well as non-constituency MP Hazel Poa. The queries arose after news reports last month that a coffee shop in Tampines Street 21 was sold for a record $41.68 million, while a Yishun Street 81 coffee shop changed hands for $40 million. Some tenants at the Tampines coffee shop told The Straits Times that rents there have surged since April. Mr Lee said that there are currently more than 770 HDB coffee shops, of which 400 were sold by the statutory board in the 1990s to ""encourage private-sector ownership in running these coffee shops"". HDB stopped selling coffee shops in 1998. While the Tampines and Yishun coffee shops that were sold for record prices were privately owned, such transactions are a minority, Mr Lee said. He added that 70 per cent of resale transactions of sold coffee shops since 2010 were below $10 million, with an average of 15 transactions yearly since 2010. While Mr Murali had asked if the Government will introduce rent control measures for stallholders at eating houses in mature estates, which are where high-value sales ""seem to be taking place"", Mr Lee replied that such restrictions may result in unintended impacts. ""For example, by controlling rent, we could end up reducing the incentive for coffee shop owners to invest in improving their coffee shops to provide better services and facilities to customers,"" Mr Lee said in his written reply. Instead, Mr Lee said, HDB currently ensures that people can easily access affordable and quality food within public housing estates through a good supply of coffee shops, and regulation of price-quality tenders for coffee shops run by HDB. For example, the two coffee shops in Tampines and Yishun have five and seven other coffee shops, respectively, within a 400m radius. Mr Lee also said the Bukit Batok Street 11 coffee shop that was sold for $31 million in 2015 has six other coffee shops within the vicinity. He added that food prices at the coffee shop are only ""marginally higher"" by 10 to 20 cents, while a cup of coffee is the same price as that at other nearby coffee shops. He revealed that HDB will complete another 30 coffee shops in the next four years, in addition to the 34 new ones in the past four years. This is in addition to more than 100 hawker centres here, with four more to start operations this year, and seven being planned or under construction. Another way prices have been kept affordable is via the regulation of price-quality tenders, started in 2018 in HDB coffee shops. Factors such as the availability of budget meals, good track record and community initiatives made up half of the points assigned to asses the quality of the operator. Such operators typically provide budget food options at every stall, priced at around $3, said Mr Lee. ""We are mindful of the need to ensure that residents have access to affordable cooked food options, and of the potential impact of resale transactions,"" he said. ""Ultimately, consumers must be given the choice to go elsewhere. This applies to stallholders as well. If the rents set by coffee shop owners are too high, stallholders could move to other eating establishments, resulting in vacant stalls and holding costs for the owners."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/eight-disruptions-to-digital-banking-services-of-4-major-banks-since-july-2021-tharman,Eight disruptions to digital banking services of 4 major banks since July 2021: Tharman,"SINGAPORE - There have been eight disruptions to the digital banking services of four major banks since July last year, said Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for Social Policies Tharman Shanmugaratnam. The incidents, reported by DBS Bank, OCBC Bank, UOB and Citibank, affected between 500 and 37,000 customers, and were mostly resolved within three hours. DBS faced the longest interruption, lasting 39 hours, said Mr Tharman, who was responding on behalf of the Prime Minister in a written parliamentary reply to Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong GRC). ""The root causes of these incidents lay mainly within the banks themselves - such as software misconfigurations, system malfunctions, and errors that were introduced when the banks were making system changes,"" he said, adding that one of the incidents was related to an outage in a third-party cloud service provider. Mr Tharman, who is also chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), said the financial regulator takes all IT incidents that affect the availability of digital banking services seriously. MAS requires banks to be able to recover systems supporting critical banking services such as fund transfers and payment services within four hours following any disruption. The total unscheduled downtime for each critical system must not exceed four hours within any 12-month period, he said. Banks that breach these requirements will face ""supervisory action"" from MAS. This can include requiring the bank to hold additional capital, said Mr Tharman, citing the prolonged DBS outage last November as an example. DBS had to set aside another $930 million in capital to buffer against unexpected losses and keep itself solvent in a crisis. Mr Tharman also said MAS directed the bank to appoint an independent expert to conduct a comprehensive review of the incident, including its controls and recovery actions and how a similar incident can be prevented in future. It also directed DBS to rectify all shortcomings identified from the review and implement measures to ensure that any future disruption to its digital banking services is resolved quickly and adequately, he added. ""The recent incidents highlight the need for banks to continually review their IT resilience strategy, and ensure that there is sufficient redundancy and fault tolerance built into their digital banking IT infrastructure."" Mr Tharman also noted that MAS recently published a set of new Business Continuity Management Guidelines that set out measures financial institutions can take to sustain critical business services and minimise service disruptions. The guidelines include identifying how resources such as systems and manpower depend on each other to deliver critical business services, and addressing any gaps that could hinder the effective recovery of these services during an outage. Mr Tharman added: ""Globally, financial institutions are increasingly relying on third-party services such as public cloud computing. This increases financial institutions' exposure to third-party risks."" He said MAS has been working closely with the industry, global financial regulators and leading service providers on best practices to manage third-party risks, such as collaborating with the Association of Banks in Singapore to issue guidelines on sound cloud computing practices. ""The technology landscape that banks operate in is becoming more complex. It is hence critical that banks continually maintain and uplift the security and resiliency of their IT systems so as to maintain stability and trust in the banking system."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/pandemic-backup-plans-help-kfc-continue-serving-up-chicken-amid-disruptions,Pandemic backup plans help KFC continue serving up chicken amid disruptions,"SINGAPORE - When Malaysia banned exports of fresh chicken on June 1, businesses that depend on the supply - such as some chicken rice stalls - had to stop temporarily or increase their prices, but not KFC Singapore. The fast-food chain quickly switched to serving frozen chicken and continued operating its 80 outlets islandwide without disruption. It was able to bring in more frozen chicken as it could tap backup plans that were put in place amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Many of its frozen chicken sources, including suppliers across Asia and even the United States, had already been secured from the end of last year. ""What the pandemic taught us is that you need backups, and backups of backups to sustain the business,"" said Ms Lynette Lee, general manager of KFC Singapore. Still, she noted that the chain had not experienced supply disruptions of this scale in the past. Before the ban, KFC used mainly fresh chicken from local suppliers which imported live chickens from Malaysia on a daily basis and then slaughtered them. The chain would then marinate the chicken and send it to its stores, said Ms Lee, speaking to The Straits Times on Monday (July 4). Malaysia, which introduced its chicken ban with the aim of stabilising production and prices, has partially lifted it, allowing Singapore to bring in live kampung and black chickens since mid-June. But it is uncertain when the usual supplies of fresh meat will resume. It is also celebrations as usual for KFC, which is marking its 45th anniversary in Singapore this week. As part of the celebrations, there is a pop-up experience outside VivoCity mall that runs from July 6 to 10. Visitors will be able to win limited-edition KFC plush toys and food vouchers at claw machines, and take part in other activities in interactive zones. The first 4,500 to visit the #MEANDMYKFC Installation will receive a free two-piece chicken voucher. Islandwide, there will also be special weekly $4.50 deals at KFC outlets for the month of July. KFC’s $5 value meals, its menu staple, remain among the lowest-priced meals offered by fast-food chains here. ""We'll manage prices based on market forces, but we want to keep it affordable for the customer,"" said Ms Lee, who added that the chain is prepared for future supply shocks, if any. ""But when fresh chickens come back, we and our suppliers are ready to switch back."""

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/full-house-as-spores-largest-nightclub-marquee-reopens-after-two-years,Full house as S'pore's largest nightclub Marquee reopens after two years,"SINGAPORE - Singapore's largest nightclub, Marquee, reopened to snaking queues that spilt over two floors at Marina Bay Sands' (MBS) The Shoppes on Friday (July 1). The line started forming at 8.30pm, with those in it undeterred by the expected long wait - they knew those who snagged sold-out tickets to the reopening would be first through the doors from 10pm. At the front of the queue was 27-year-old Singaporean Vicki T., who entered the club at 11pm. This is her first visit to a club since the Covid-19 pandemic shuttered nightspots here. ""I know I'll have to keep my mask on throughout, and can take it off only when I'm drinking, but that's all right,"" said Ms Vicki, who is currently between jobs. Inside the 2,300 sq m club, a packed dance floor awaits, the first time this is happening in 28 months. But for many clubbers, it was to the queue once again, in lines to take a ride on the indoor eight-armed ferris wheel and three-storey-slides, old favourites from the time the club first opened its doors in July 2019. Ms Low Kaiying, 26, is a Marquee returnee, so she knew what she wanted to do once past the doors. ""It was quite fun to go on the ferris wheel before the crowd filled,"" she said. It was her first time at a club in two years too. Although major nightlife players like Zouk in Clarke Quay and Ce La Vi, located atop MBS, reopened soon after nightlife establishments were allowed to do so in end-April, up until June 14, nightclub patrons needed to obtain a negative antigen rapid test (ART) result to enter nightlife venues, where there is a dance floor. Ms Low, who saw the ART requirement as a deterrent, said the timing of Marquee's reopening was perfect, as she moved on to the dance floor. As the crowd picked up, illuminated bottle trains dotted the three-level venue, as security guards stationed at entry points to the dance floor kept order by making sure that patrons were masked up and not carrying drinks. A spokesman for Marquee said of the club's decision to open in July: ""Although nightlife could resume in April, we decided to give ourselves more time to refine our processes and prepare our team so that we can welcome guests back safely and responsibly this weekend. ""The further easing of restrictions in the past month also marks another step towards returning to normalcy for nightlife, and we hope this allows us to deliver the same great party experience at Marquee as before."" However, the requirement to remain masked up while on the dance floor still remains. There was a strong turnout on Friday night, with clubbers dressed to the nines joining the queue over the course of the night. A sign indicating that the club was full capacity was on standby at the side of the entrance. At its full capacity, The Straits Times understands that Marquee can hold around 2,000 patrons. Before it closed its doors in March 2020, the club was known for hosting big name DJs and music acts on an almost weekly basis - including the likes of Swedish DJ Alesso, European DJ trio Above & Beyond and American rapper A$AP Rocky. In the coming weeks, Marquee will welcome back international DJs, set to be some of the largest names to play here since the pandemic halted live shows. The club is also open on Saturday and while online tickets are sold out, limited tickets priced at $40 will be available at the door. Clubbers like Ms Vicki are looking forward to Singapore's nightlife getting into full swing, and for her, Friday is likely the first of many club nights at Marquee, despite a rising number of Covid-19 cases in recent days. She said: ""It's herd immunity - almost everyone has got Covid-19 already so it's a matter of time. ""I'm not worried because I have the vaccines and booster already."""

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/new-deal-makes-it-easier-for-accredited-chinese-engineers-to-work-on-spore-projects,New deal makes it easier for accredited Chinese engineers to work on S'pore projects,"SINGAPORE - To increase competency and plug the shortfall of engineers in sectors such as the built environment, manufacturing and robotics, a new agreement makes it easier for accredited Chinese engineers to work on Singapore projects. Mr Tan Seng Chuan, Institution of Engineers, Singapore (IES) international outreach committee chairman, said: ""Due to industry transformation and the wave of green economy, there is an increasing demand for engineers with new skill sets and competency."" ""I think we need more talented engineers by attracting Chinese engineers to come over to help widen our talent pool,"" he added. IES and the China Association for Science and Technology (Cast) on Thursday (June 30) signed a mutual recognition agreement to reduce barriers to cross-border work by engineers from China and Singapore. Details are still in the works but both organisations will agree on a set of accreditation criteria, such as academic qualifications and the number of years of relevant experience, which will be benchmarked against international standards. In Singapore, this accreditation will be tied to the IES Chartered Engineer Programme, which gives employers a yardstick to judge potential hires. There are also different grades of chartership which will allow chartered engineers to take on different levels of responsibility for projects. Local chartered engineers will benefit from the agreement as well. ""China is a big market. Singapore is a very limited market,"" Mr Tan said, adding that local engineers will have more opportunities to export their knowledge in water conservation, treatment and smart metering, as well as sustainability and urban planning, to China. Since the programme was launched nearly 10 years ago, IES has attracted more than 500 engineers, and hopes to have 5,000 chartered engineers in the next few years, according to Mr Tan. Aside from China, IES has signed mutual recognition agreements with Britain, the Netherlands and Australia, and is in talks to bring on board other countries, especially those in Asean. Minister of State for Trade and Industry Low Yen Ling, who was the guest of honour at the signing ceremony, said Singapore will ""benefit greatly from more exchanges with China"". She said: ""I am very certain that the close collaboration between IES and Cast will contribute to our existing bilateral cooperation in sustainability and the digital economy. ""To advance in areas such as low-carbon energy, green buildings and digital trade, we will need deep technical expertise and novel engineering solutions."" At the signing ceremony, a memorandum of understanding was also inked between IES and Cast to promote information exchange, encourage collaborations between businesses from both countries, engage universities and companies for student exchange programmes, and facilitate the publication of selected papers, articles and journals. Mr Tan said the collaboration will encourage research and development to find engineering solutions such as climate adaptation and mitigation methods to cope with rising sea levels and extreme weather conditions, and ways to reduce carbon emissions. In his speech in Mandarin, Cast vice-president Zhang Yuzhuo said: ""Through our partnership, we'll be able to nurture excellent talents who will help us to carry out more innovations. Talented engineers are the backbone to carry out long-term innovations."""

More than 800 Sheng Siong items have been added to the price comparison app by consumer watchdog Case, bringing the total number of the supermarket's house brand products on Price Kaki to more than 950, and the total number of grocery products listed to more than 6,200. Case president Melvin Yong said the app is on target to list cooked food items from more than 200 coffee shops in the next two months, and 10,000 grocery products by year end. New features, such as letting users buy items directly through the app, are being developed. During a tour of Sheng Siong's distribution centre in Mandai on Friday, he said: ""I found out that the same product can have different prices in different outlets. Geo-tagging on Price Kaki allows consumers to make better purchasing decisions."" Minister of State for Trade and Industry Low Yen Ling, who was also at the facility, said that as at Thursday, the Committee Against Profiteering (CAP) had received about 100 feedback submissions. Around 70 per cent of them were about food and beverage establishments, 15 per cent about non-cooked food items and 15 per cent on miscellaneous issues. Only five cases were specific allegations about GST misrepresentation. ""Especially for this handful of cases, we followed up very swiftly... working with People's Association partners, Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) and Case,"" she said. ""The businesses shared that they had adjusted prices due to an increase in raw materials. They commit that, moving forward, they will be transparent with regard to pricing and be clear with the customer."" Ms Low added that all complaints were one-off cases and the Ministry of Trade and Industry works closely with CCCS to ensure no anti-competitive behaviour. ""What we want is to make sure there really is free market competition and consumers are given choices,"" she added. Sheng Siong also announced that from July 5 to Dec 31 this year, it will give a 4 per cent discount at its outlets to Merdeka Generation seniors on Tuesdays and to Singapore residents aged 60 and above on Wednesdays. The discount is an increase from the 3 per cent in effect currently. The discount is capped at $8 and within a spending limit of $200 per receipt. It does not apply to infant milk powder, cigarettes, alcohol, phone cards and Sheng Siong shopping vouchers. Family members of the senior citizens will also enjoy the discount if they present the seniors' proof of identity, including NRIC, Pioneer Generation or Merdeka Generation cards. Sheng Siong expects the discount to help seniors save more than $4 million this year. It says it has helped this group save more than $12 million since the discount schemes began in 2015. Chief executive officer Lim Hock Chee explained how the supermarket chain has managed to maintain prices despite rising inflation. ""We use digitalisation, such as automatic procurement and electronic invoicing, to reduce labour costs,"" he said in Mandarin, adding that self-checkout kiosks, recently installed in two outlets, will also reduce manpower. The chain sources goods from different places to ensure reasonable prices, he said. With Indonesia now allowed to supply chicken to Singapore, Sheng Siong will consider its cost advantage against that of current sources Brazil and Denmark, said Mr Lim. ""The prices of chicken imported from Europe are competitive because they have high-tech farming methods, so importing chicken from Indonesia might not be cheaper,"" he explained."

Royal Caribbean's Spectrum of the Seas arrived at Malaysia's Port Klang in the morning. On Saturday, Resorts World Cruises' Genting Dream will call at Bintan and Batam in Indonesia, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) said on Friday. Both of these ships are home-ported in Singapore. Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia are the first South-east Asian countries to resume port calls since cruising was halted in March 2020. STB said it expects the cruise industry in Singapore to return to pre-Covid-19-pandemic levels between next year and 2024, given discussions to resume similar calls in more ports across the region. STB chief executive Keith Tan said the resumption of port calls is an important milestone for Singapore and the region. He said: ""Cruising is a key tourism driver, and as Asean's lead coordinator for cruise development, Singapore will continue to work with our counterparts to strengthen the region's attractiveness as a cruising destination and source market."" Before the pandemic, the cruise industry here was enjoying robust growth, with more than 1.8 million passengers in 2019. More than 400 cruise ships across 30 cruise brands also called at Singapore’s ports that year. The pandemic put an end to that, although cruises resumed in Singapore in November 2020 without any port calls. More than half a million passengers have sailed on these cruises to nowhere. Cruises have also seen a new wave of interest, especially from first-time passengers who did not consider cruising a leisure option before the pandemic. These new cruisers are expected to contribute to a strong rebound for the industry, STB said. It added that Singapore is working with other cruise lines to expand their customer base, such as to regional markets like Indonesia and Malaysia, as well as mid- and long-haul markets such as India, Australia, Germany, Britain and the United States. The fly-cruise segment - where international passengers fly to Singapore to take a cruise - is also expected to rebound strongly with the relaxation of border measures. Pre-pandemic, 70 per cent of Singapore's cruise passengers were from this segment. To prepare for the return of such travellers, STB said it will continue to offer the Cruise Development Fund to encourage cruise lines to home-port in Singapore. Agents can also tap this grant to develop and market cruise packages."

As at Thursday (June 30), about $50 million worth of CDC vouchers from the latest tranche has been spent, in what is part of a larger $650 million scheme to help Singapore households with their daily expenses. This tranche, originally intended to be disbursed at a later date between 2022 and 2024, was brought forward to provide Singaporeans with more financial support amid global inflationary pressures resulting from the war in Ukraine and various supply chain issues caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Under the CDC vouchers scheme, all Singaporean households are given $100 to spend at hawker stalls or in heartland merchants. At present, about 17,500 hawkers and heartland merchants are on board the scheme, including hairdressers and beauty salons. Providing the updated redemption rates in a Facebook post on Friday, South West District Mayor Low Yen Ling, who is also chairman of the Mayors' Committee, said that $98 million worth of CDC vouchers from the 2021 tranche has been redeemed. Ms Low said: ""Together, more than $148 million has been spent using the 2021 and 2022 CDC vouchers. This substantial injection of sales into our heartland businesses has energised many small business owners, stallholders and hawkers."" Ms Yeni Lim-Borde, 39, who runs a lifestyle store selling Singapore-themed prints and products, said that business has slowed visibly in the past three weeks with the onset of the fifth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Ms Lim-Borde, whose store is located in a Housing Board shophouse at Block 55 Tiong Bahru Road said that on some weekdays, she has noticed a 50 per cent decrease in footfall. But slower business has been partially cushioned by consumers who support her using the CDC vouchers.  She added: “Customers who used the vouchers were very excited... about being able to purchase lifestyle products like mine… I think it’s such a great idea to give consumers (an) array of options. CDC is not just for food and beverage (businesses).” The CDC vouchers scheme has also benefited Madam Sally Chan, who runs a printing service at Block 164 Bukit Merah Central.  Madam Chan said: “Our business was really affected by Covid-19 because when travel was banned, nobody needed to print photos. “But with the CDC vouchers, customers are more willing to spend, since they don’t have to fork out their own money to print their pictures.”  Thanking Singaporeans for supporting local businesses, Ms Low welcomed more businesses to participate in future tranches of the vouchers over the next two years. She reminded Singaporeans who have yet to claim or spend their CDC vouchers that both the 2021 and 2022 tranches will expire on Dec 31. To claim the CDC vouchers, visit this website. Once on the website, tap into CDC Vouchers 2022 for the latest tranche of vouchers or click on CDC Vouchers 2021 to claim last year's vouchers. After logging in with your Singpass, you will receive a link via SMS that will give you access to the vouchers. This link can then be shared with other members of your household.

In a Facebook post on Thursday (June 30), the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) said Indonesia has been approved as a new source of frozen, chilled and processed chicken meat for the Republic. SFA added that chickens from approved Indonesian establishments can now be imported. Singapore's existing sources include Brazil, Thailand and Australia. Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu also posted about the announcement on Facebook. She said adding Indonesia to Singapore's list of more than 20 accredited countries to import chicken from is another step forward in the country's efforts to diversify sources and enhance the resilience of its food supply. ""Global supplies will continue to face uncertainties, and we must be psychologically prepared for more disruptions and price volatility,"" she added. ""While the Government undertakes long-term planning and proactive actions to safeguard Singapore's food supply, consumers and the food industry also have an important part to play."" Ms Fu said being flexible with food choices and being willing to switch to alternative products when necessary also help increase Singapore's resilience. The announcement that Singapore will have another source of chicken is timely given that Malaysia's chicken export ban, which started on June 1, is still in effect. Exports were halted so that prices and supplies there could stabilise. Although Malaysia has since allowed exports of kampung and black chicken, the more common and affordable broiler chicken - which makes up the majority of Singapore's chicken imports from Malaysia - is still under the ban. According to SFA, 34 per cent of Singapore's chicken supply come from Malaysia. Most of those chickens are imported live and slaughtered here. In its announcement on Thursday, SFA said chickens can be imported only from sources accredited by it to ensure that sources have the required systems, processes and capabilities to supply chicken that can meet Singapore's food safety and animal health standards. It added: ""Individual establishments and the farms would also need to be evaluated and approved. ""The accreditation assessment involves detailed documentary evaluations and on-site audits for verification. The consignments would also be subjected to SFA's inspection, sampling and testing upon import. ""This ensures the continuity of SFA's source diversification strategy without compromising on food safety."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/spore-electricity-tariffs-to-rise-by-about-8-for-q3-amid-global-oil-gas-crunch,"S'pore electricity tariffs to rise by about 8% for Q3 amid global oil, gas crunch","SINGAPORE - About half the households in Singapore will pay higher electricity bills for the next three months, with the electricity tariff for the next quarter going up by about 8 per cent compared with the previous quarter. The electricity tariff for the period July 1 to Sept 30 will be 30.17 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh), excluding the goods and services tax (GST), said grid operator SP Group on Thursday (June 30). This is up from the current rate of 27.94 cents per kWh. The electricity tariff has been rising since April last year. Regulator Energy Market Authority (EMA) told The Straits Times the tariff increase would only apply to half of all residential consumers.  “Consumers on fixed price plans with retailers will not see any price increases until such time when they renew their contracts, where they are likely to see higher prices,” said its spokesman.  Meanwhile, producer and retailer of piped town gas City Energy also announced on Thursday that the gas tariff for households will go up from 21.66 cents per kWh before GST, to 23.09 cents per kWh. The 1.43-cent increase is equivalent to a price hike of 6.6 per cent, and will be in effect from July 1 to Sept 30. Both SP Group and City Energy attributed the price increments to higher fuel costs.  SP Group said the higher energy costs were driven by rising global gas and oil prices exacerbated by the conflict in Ukraine. The grid operator said the average monthly electricity bill for families living in a HDB four-room flat will increase by $8.25 excluding GST to $111.63. While demand was expected to ease as the winter demand cooled off, market fundamentals have been severely exacerbated by the rippling effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb 24. The war, which is entering its fifth month, has resulted in wide ranging sanctions against Russia’s energy exports, which includes crude oil, diesel and piped gas. This has forced countries in Europe to scour the world for alternatives, putting them in direct and sometimes fierce competition with the rest of the world, including Singapore. The Republic depends on imported gas for about 95 per cent of its electricity needs and is vulnerable to any shifts in supply-demand fundamentals globally. The electricity tariff in Singapore is calculated from four components. Fuel costs, which reflect the cost of imported natural gas and tracks the price of oil, make up about half of the tariff.  On Thursday, benchmark Brent crude oil prices were trading close to US$116 a barrel, while around the same time last year markets were dealing around US$75 to US$76 a barrel. This represents a rise of around 52 percent over a period of 12 months, clearly reflecting the sheer scale by which prices have structurally shifted.  The rest of the tariff covers other costs related to activities such as maintenance of power plants, meter-reading and transporting electricity through the grid. Rystad Energy, an independent energy research and business intelligence company, said the outlook for Asia and Singapore will be tough especially as European nations compete for alternative supplies. “Unfortunately this means Asia will need to cede LNG (liquefied natural gas)  to Europe during this time and the focus in the region will turn towards more burning of coal and or fuel oil wherever possible,” it said. “Singapore’s dependence on gas also means it is more exposed to this market than most other Asian countries, though economically we are still in a position to compete for marginal supplies."" In a media briefing in Singapore on Wednesday evening, global energy giant Shell’s chief executive Ben van Beurden said LNG will continue to remain expensive, and the reality was that spot buyers would face stiff competition. Last week, the Government announced that it would be providing a $100 utilities credit to every Singaporean household as part of a $1.5 billion support package to help lower-income families and vulnerable groups amid rising global inflation. The EMA had also previously noted that the Household Support Package introduced as part of Budget 2022 will give eligible households double the quantum of their quarterly U-Save vouchers this year, which will help defray the costs of higher electricity bills."

Modelled after the Shimao Tianjie Sky Screen in Beijing, China, the screen, whose location is yet to be disclosed, is set to be 200m long. Some $200 million will be pumped into building it. Beijing's Sky Screen, which stretches above a pedestrian walkway at mixed-use development The Place, is 250m long and 30m wide, and comprises 7,500sq m of LED lights, as well as several sound systems. It was built in 2006 but has been upgraded over the years. Singapore's equivalent will be built by Chinese property management and media company The Place Holdings, which signed a definitive agreement on Wednesday (June 29), with Stellar Lifestyle, which manages retail and advertising space in Singapore's MRT network. ""The location is still being finalised, but once that is done, it will take about one to 1½ years to be constructed,"" said Mr Fan Xianyong, chief executive of The Place Holdings, speaking to the media before the signing of the agreement at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre. Mr Fan added that the sky screen here will be an enhanced version of Beijing's one, and hopes it will serve as a catalyst for new tourism and retail experiences in Singapore. Besides the sky screen, the two firms' collaboration covers the development of various platforms, including a digital and advertising platform, and a last-mile service platform, which will transport merchandise from the nearest distribution hub to the final destination, such as a home or business. The digital platform, in particular, will integrate technological infrastructure such as artificial intelligence and big data. Mr Ji Zenghe, executive chairman of The Place Holdings, said: ""We share the same vision (as Stellar Lifestyle) of utilising new technology advancements and infrastructure to improve the quality of our lives and enabling SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) to integrate into modern business models with new digitalisation capabilities."" Mr Seah Moon Ming, chairman of SMRT Corporation, said it is jointly developing interactive media solutions and innovative business offerings with The Place Holdings. ""We look forward to seeing the enlivened stations and surrounding neighbourhoods that will connect better with commuters and communities,"" added Mr Seah. Tourism experts like Dr Michael Chiam said such an attraction will benefit Singapore as it provides an additional offering for tourists to explore. The senior lecturer in tourism at Ngee Ann Polytechnic said its proposed location will also be important. ""If it can be incorporated into an existing place in Orchard Road, it could certainly help to rejuvenate that area,"" said Dr Chiam, who added that the content on the sky screen must be relevant to Singapore, and there will need to be an element of fun and excitement for the target audience. ""The stakeholders will have to work with the relevant authorities, such as the Urban Redevelopment Authority and Building and Construction Authority, to ensure that the project meets all guidelines and regulations,"" he said. While Singapore is the first city outside China to have a sky screen built by The Place Holdings, The Place Holdings said it also aims to scale and replicate its screens in 10 major cities around the world. The screens will have capabilities such as screening live concerts simultaneously, and eventually, the gamification of the platform for the metaverse."

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/concern-among-singapore-balloon-businesses-as-helium-prices-inflate,Concern among Singapore balloon businesses as the price of helium inflates,"SINGAPORE - Following a global helium shortage, Singapore balloon business owners are feeling the pinch. In an interview with The Straits Times last week, Mr Jacob Tan, owner of local party supplies and decorations shop Misty Daydream, said a 47-litre tank of helium that used to cost about $120 early last year has now spiked to about $360. Requiring about 10 such tanks a week to pump and sell about 5,000 balloons, Mr Tan said he is concerned about the rising price of helium, especially after it went up exponentially recently. The 33-year-old added: ""I asked a supplier who said that the helium from Singapore used to come from Russia, but due to the war between Russia and Ukraine, they are now importing it from the United States, that is why there has been this (recent sharp) increase in price. ""While we have not increased the cost of our balloons yet, we may have to do it soon because the profit margin might not be there to sustain our business."" All five businesses that ST spoke to said there has been a significant increase in the price of helium. Mr Kyle Geronimo, director of operations at Starships Balloons, said: ""Our company is built fundamentally on balloons. The staff are concerned as this is their livelihood. But it is like every other situation that other businesses are facing, and we are trying to find alternatives to cover up the loss."" Mr Geronimo, 26, said the company is looking to diversify into other party supplies and fresh flowers, a move partly driven by the helium shortage. It is also looking into pushing out non-helium balloons such as air-filled ones, which is also an option being explored by Mr Rayner Tan, 34, from online balloon shop BoBoChaCha. Mr Rayner Tan said: ""These air-filled balloons cannot float, so you have to come up with ways to make it more fanciful. For example, flower balloons that don't float can still be bought as a get-well-soon gift or for a birthday or Valentine's day."" But BoBoChaCha's main business comes from helium balloons and he is monitoring the situation closely, and is hoping to not increase the price. ""The balloon market is very competitive and consumers are very price sensitive,"" he said. Earlier this month, news agency AFP reported that the helium supply chain had been disrupted by plant closures in Texas over safety issues, in Qatar due to maintenance and in Russia after a fire that took place prior to the war in Ukraine. The report said that only a handful of countries - led by the US - produce the gas, which is also liquefied to cool magnetic resonance imaging scanners and also used in the manufacturing of semiconductors. The shortage has forced the National Weather Service in the US to reduce the launch of balloons used for forecasting at a handful of its sites. A spokesman for Meteorological Service Singapore said it is monitoring the situation to ensure continuity of its operations. The spokesman said: ""The twice daily launches of weather balloons require about 25 litres of helium gas per day, which is obtained from a local supplier. ""So far, the launches have not been affected by the helium gas shortage."" The spokesman said the data collected by the weather balloons is used by meteorologists to analyse current atmospheric conditions and to support operational forecasting. It is also used for weather prediction models that generate guidance products for the aviation industry and is also exchanged with the international meteorological community."

The complaints include technical issues with payments and inability of consumers to seek refunds. In a blog post on Friday (June 24), Case president Melvin Yong said BNPL services could lead to consumers spending more that they can and making impulsive buys, due to a false perception of increased purchasing power. ""This happens in the credit card landscape, and can just as easily happen with the proliferation of BNPL services,"" said Mr Yong. BNPL services allow buyers to defer or spread out payments for purchases interest-free. Such schemes have also grown in popularity in recent years, as they cover many products online that appeal to young consumers. A report last year by market research firm Milieu Insight had shown that close to a fifth of Singaporeans aged 16 and above have used a BNPL service. The Singapore FinTech Association (SFA) has launched a working group to develop a code of conduct for all BNPL providers, under the guidance of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). During a recent visit to SFA, Mr Yong spoke to members of the BNPL working group on how consumer safeguards can be strengthened for such schemes. He proposed a series of suggestions on what the code of conduct for such services should include. For example, this includes setting limits for consumers and BNPL providers. ""Consumers should be allowed to set purchase limits for themselves, to guard against excessive and untenable monthly instalments,"" said Mr Yong, adding that there should also be a corresponding limit on the maximum quantum of penalty charges that BNPL providers can levy on consumers, to prevent defaults. Advertisements for BNPL services should also be regulated, said Mr Yong. Such advertisements should prominently display the total absolute amount that consumers would pay should they default on their instalments. He also noted that one of the main criticisms of the Singaporean BNPL scene is that credit is ""too accessible"", due to the lack of an assessment of the credit worthiness of its users. Thus, he suggested that a purchase limit for accounts opened by first-time BNPL users and vulnerable accounts, such as people with poor credit ratings and are deemed to be on shaky financial ground. ""These limits can progressively be increased if the consumer is shown to have good credit standing by making timely repayments,"" said Mr Yong. He also proposes a mandatory ceiling, such as $500 a month, on maximum purchases allowed for users aged below 21, as most consumers between 18 and 21 do not earn an income. Other suggestions include having BNPL-related consumer spending data to be included in consumers' credit ratings and providing clear recourse avenues for resolving disputes. Mr Yong also advised the public to protect themselves if they are BNPL users, such as consciously setting reminders and money every month to pay for instalments. ""With proper planning, BNPL will be a value-added service to consumers. Case will continue to work with MAS and the BNPL Working Group to ensure that consumers are protected when using BNPL services, and to ensure that BNPL does not come to mean ""buy now, pain later,"" he added. Consumers whom The Straits Times spoke to welcomed the suggestions, particularly the one allowing them to set purchase limits. Ms Rachel Tan, who uses Atome at Sephora, said this would help to control her spending. She said once she spent $90 at the beauty retailer. ""If I can set a purchase limit, at least I can limit my expenditure, or else I might overspend without knowing,"" said the 27-year-old marketing executive."

The six-storey mall, located at the intersection of East Coast Road and Joo Chiat Road, will have over 150 retail and food and beverage (F&B) stores opening progressively. Over 80 per cent of the mall's tenants are new, including the first Lululemon retail store in the east, and Mr Woofles, the country's first dog club and daycare to be situated within a mall. Returning tenants include F&B outlets Tim Ho Wan and Wine Connection. Among the new features and innovations is a fully automated storefront called Bistro Bytes, where shoppers can mix and match orders from a selection of F&B providers, and pick up their food a few minutes later from automated lockers. The food, from brands such as Pizza Express, My Tampopo and The Pasta Project, is prepared by a central kitchen. Bistro Bytes was developed by the mall's owners Keppel Land, who said this technology will offer tenants greater productivity and higher sales efficiency, as well as the agility to rapidly launch new brands and food offerings to meet fast-changing consumer demands. ""(It) has also helped tenants reduce overhead expenses and mitigate the challenge of hiring service staff amidst a tight labour market,"" said the developer in a statement. The mall now also houses Core Clinic, a medical co-working space for practitioners which has fully fitted-out clinic spaces and medical facilities. The first of its kind in Singapore, it allows medical practitioners to book spaces for use as and when needed, and access a medical concierge. It is located alongside Core Collective, a co-working space targeted at fitness and wellness practitioners, complete with a 650 sq m gym and functional training area, 10 treatment and consultation rooms, and an occupational therapy room. i12 Katong's reopening comes off the back of a bullish retail sector, which has shown positive signs of recovery since the easing of the Covid-19 pandemic and border restrictions. Retail sales increased 12.1 per cent in April year on year, according to figures released by the Department of Statistics at the start of this month, extending the revised 8.8 per cent increase in March. ""The opening is particularly timely as Singapore takes steps towards normalcy and resumes gatherings in the community,"" said Manpower Minister Tan See Leng. Dr Tan, who is also Second Minister for Trade and Industry and MP for Marine Parade GRC, was at the mall's grand opening. ""With the upcoming Marine Parade station on the Thomson East-Coast MRT line only a five-minute walk away, accessibility to i12 will be enhanced even further,"" he added. There are also sustainability features dotted throughout the mall, including electric vehicle chargers in the carpark, and urban farming spaces. For instance, on the fourth floor, there is a vertical urban farming system that grows lettuce, kale and mint. These will be donated to food charity Willing Hearts, which operates a soup kitchen. A food digestor that can break down food waste from F&B outlets and convert it into compost and liquid waste will also be installed at the mall. Keppel Corporation chief executive and Keppel Land chairman Loh Chin Hua noted that residents in Marine Parade will be among the first consumers to enjoy these new concepts. ""Some of these concepts can be exported to other malls, not just in Singapore but other countries where Keppel is present, creating further opportunities for our tenants and partners,"" said Mr Loh."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/singapore-desaru-ferry-services-to-start-operating-from-july-7,Singapore-Desaru ferry services to start from July 7,"SINGAPORE - Singapore-Desaru ferry services will start operations from July 7, connecting Singapore's Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal with Johor's Desaru Coast Ferry Terminal. Tickets and service schedules will be made available online on Desaru Coast's website and Batam Fast's website from June 30. According to a press release issued by the Desaru Coast Destination Resort and Desaru Link Ferry Services on Wednesday (June 22), the ferry services will operate one round trip service per day from Thursday to Sunday. The ferry service of 90 minutes each way will operate with a 330-passenger capacity for the initial months. The frequency and capacity of the ferries will be adjusted if there is high demand for the service, said the operator. Prices were not stated. Industry players and tourists applauded the move to further open up travel between Singapore and Desaru, on the eastern coast of Johor. Currently, it is accessible to travellers from Singapore by a 90-minute drive or a nearly four-hour bus ride from the Woodlands Checkpoint. The general manager of the hotel Four Points by Sheraton Desaru, Mr Maverick Loh, said: “This news was highly anticipated by everyone in the Desaru Coast area. ""I’m confident this will boost visitation to the local businesses and contribute to the thriving social economic hub.” He expects the number of hotel bookings to increase following the start of the ferry service but said he was confident the hotel would have enough manpower to handle any surge in guest numbers. Ms Roslina Arbak, managing director and chief executive of Desaru Development Holdings One, said, ""We thank all government agencies for supporting and working closely with us to facilitate this new international connectivity, which will make Desaru Coast even more accessible to international travellers."" Singaporeans were excited about the new ferry service, with some already making plans to book tickets. Mr Christopher Thung, 32, an auditor, said he was planning a short getaway on an upcoming weekend. “I love travelling via ferry because it gives off more holiday vibes than travelling by road. If you don’t own a car, it’s cumbersome to travel all the way to Desaru. Now with the ferry, I can finally visit Desaru without all the hassle,” he added. Mrs Nisa Rizvi, a Singaporean private banker based in Dubai, said her extended family was already planning a trip to Desaru in July and the new ferry service would make their travel easier. “We had been planning for Desaru and when this news appeared that a ferry will be launched, we were ecstatic. The ferry is so much more convenient, straight up to Desaru,” said Mrs Rizvi, who is in her 40s. Ms Lavinia Rajaram, head of public relations for Asia Expedia Group Brands, said that in the past 30 days, Desaru had accounted for about 20 per cent of search queries on expedia.com.sg for hotels in Johor state. “Desaru has typically been a popular getaway resort town in Johor, Malaysia. However, due to its distance from Singapore’s Woodlands/Tuas checkpoints, many travellers might have considered other destinations instead to avoid the long drive required,” she said in response to queries. Following the approval of the service on Tuesday, however, she said search demand for hotels in Desaru grew by 12 per cent over the average of the past 30 days."

After announcing its reopening date at the start of this month, the club told The Straits Times that tickets will go on sale via marqueesingapore.com on Thursday (June 16) at noon, at $30 for online ticket bookings and $40 at the door. The 2,300 sq m club located next to the Sands Theatre at The Shoppes in Marina Bay Sands has an indoor eight-armed ferris wheel with a photo booth in each pod and a three-storey slide. It has been shut since March 2020. From July 1, it will be open from 10pm to 6am on Fridays, Saturdays and the eve of public holidays and operate at full capacity. For its opening weekend, the club's resident DJs Fvder, Zippy and Kya will take to the decks. Pre-pandemic, the spin-off venture of famed nightclub Marquee in New York City had brought in world-class DJs and entertainers, including Dutch DJs Tiesto and Afrojack and American rapper A$AP Rocky. The reopening will also take place with new safe management measures in effect. Last week, the Health Ministry announced that from Tuesday (June 14), capacity limits for nightlife establishments with dancing will be lifted, and patrons will no longer need to obtain a negative antigen rapid test (ART) result to enter such venues. However, vaccination-differentiated measures will continue to be applied, and operators will still be required to conduct checks on patrons' vaccination status. Patrons will also be required to be masked up on the dance floor. Nightlife is one of the last sectors to be allowed to reopen fully, and not all establishments have survived. Some venues are choosing to cut their losses. ST understands that popular late-night venues Bang Bang and Lulu's Lounge have returned their venues to Pan Pacific Singapore, where the clubs were located side by side. Others are forging ahead, though many are not ready to resume operating at full capacity, citing manpower issues such as finding full-time staff. Major nightclub player Zouk in Clarke Quay said it will ramp up its capacity limit from 500 people to 1,200 people in time for its usual mid-week opening. At full capacity, it can hold 2,000 people, but it is holding off for now, citing manpower constraints. Similarly, Bollywood club Magic Carpet Lounge in Beach Road will continue operating at 75 per cent capacity or about 130 patrons. Others like Club Rumours in Concorde Shopping Mall have gone back to full capacity since the rules lifted on Tuesday. They are glad they do not have to enforce ART any more. Such tests cost partygoers anything from $12 for a supervised one done remotely to $20 for an on-site supervised test at venues. ""The waiting time to enter the club was long due to the ART process, and many patrons were unhappy with the additional cost... there were instances where some just left because they did not want to go ahead with the test,"" said Club Rumours' director, Ms Magesvari Jeganathan. ""It was a hassle."""

For its first trip, a three-day, two-night cruise to nowhere, the ship will sail at half-capacity to ensure smooth operations. Along with the crew, this means close to 3,000 individuals on board. ""It's important to start the new brand correctly,"" said Mr Michael Goh, president and head of international sales of Resorts World Cruises, in an exclusive interview with The Straits Times. ""So for the first few cruises, we're not looking at filling up the ship... Instead, we're trying to manage it at 50 per cent to make sure our guests get the full experience."" The first sailing comes after a troubled few months at the start of the year, when Dream Cruises, the ship's then owner, applied to be wound up in February after its parent company, Genting Hong Kong, folded. It stopped operating its vessel, World Dream, in Singapore, leaving thousands of customers in the lurch and demanding refunds. Resorts World Cruises - owned by Malaysian tycoon Lim Kok Thay - later stepped in to offer credits to affected customers. Bookings for cruises aboard Genting Dream kicked off on May 18. Despite the hiccups, there has already been a strong response from both the domestic and international markets. ""Besides the domestic response, we've been getting a very good response from the overseas market... for example, we got 22,000 cabin bookings from India alone within less than three weeks of announcing (our relaunch),"" added Mr Goh. As part of the relaunch, Genting Dream has introduced some new features on board. The ship is now the first OIC/SMIIC (Organisation of Islamic Cooperation/ Standards and Metrology Institute for Islamic Countries) standard halal-friendly cruise ship in the world and will serve farm-to-fork halal meals out of a certified kitchen on board. Halal food items will take up some sections of the buffet spread in one of the ship's biggest restaurants, The Lido, which has more than 500 seats. ""The halal certification was really important for us to get because we want to cater to different segments of the business... It is something that our Muslim passengers consider before they pick the brands (they cruise with) or the destinations,"" noted Mr Goh. ""We know that this is an important market as in South-east Asia alone. More than 60 per cent of the population is Muslim."" ""But more importantly, it's not just Muslims who enjoy halal food... We could introduce this cuisine to a wider audience,"" he added. Besides the new dining offerings, entertainment options on board have also been refreshed. There will be more resort-style offerings throughout the day, from family-friendly games on the pool deck to Latin-themed nights at Tributes bar and sunset or night foam parties at the splash pool at Zouk Beach club. In the coming months, Genting Dream is going full steam ahead with trips to international destinations. Last week, it announced that its cruises will call at Bintan and Batam from July 1, as well as Kuala Lumpur, Melaka and Penang from July 3. It also plans to include more popular destinations such as Phuket, Krabi and Bali as early as October."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/malaysia-partially-lifts-chicken-ban-to-allow-exports-of-kampung-and-black-chicken,Malaysia partially lifts chicken ban to allow exports of kampung and black chicken,"SINGAPORE -  Malaysia has partially lifted its ban on chicken exports, allowing poultry producers and importers in Singapore to bring in live kampung chickens from across the Causeway. According to importer Kee Song Food, the Malaysian authorities allowed the company to resume importing live kampung chickens on Tuesday (June 14). It will also start bringing in black chicken from Malaysia from Saturday (June 18). Kee Song head of business development James Sim provided The Straits Times with a letter from the Department of Veterinary Services of Malaysia which stated that the Malaysian government has agreed to allow exports of live kampung and black chicken, following a Cabinet decision made on June 8. The letter also stated that the export ban on commercial broiler chicken - larger chickens that make up the bulk of what Singapore typically imports from Malaysia - remains. A top Malaysian government official, who declined to be named, confirmed with ST that the export ban has been partially lifted to allow exports of kampung and black chicken. Mr Sim on Tuesday said Kee Song has already started taking orders for fresh kampung and black chicken. The company's clients include wet market poultry sellers, chicken rice hawkers and restaurants. Malaysia had banned chicken exports on June 1 to stabilise production and prices within the country. Singapore, which imports about a third (34 per cent) of its chicken supply from Malaysia, saw a sharp drop in its supply of fresh chicken in the first two weeks of this month. Most of the chicken Singapore gets from Malaysia is imported live and slaughtered in abattoirs here. Singapore also imports chicken from countries such as Brazil and the United States, but a majority of this is usually frozen. Chicken rice hawkers and wet market poultry sellers here mainly sell broiler chickens. Kampung chicken and black chicken are smaller varieties of chicken which are considered premium and more expensive. Mr Sim said: ""We are bringing in as much kampung chicken as we can, though it is subjected to what is available from the farms. Kampung chicken is a different breed from the broiler chicken. They are slimmer and tougher."" At Kee Song Food, kampung chicken makes up about 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the overall chicken supply. Black chicken makes up about 3 per cent to 5 per cent. Though the company is still unable to import broiler chicken from Malaysia, Mr Sim said the partial lifting of the ban is a good start. ""It shows that there is some improvement on the Malaysia side and I believe there will be better days ahead,"" he said. Smaller players here, like Muslim-owned e-mart Halal Mart, also welcomed the provision to allow kampung chickens to be brought in. “It's good news because a lot of customers prefer to use fresh chicken... they say frozen chicken is not as good, and is tasteless,” Halal Mart partner Kamal Kamarudin told ST. Before the export ban, Halal Mart used to bring in and sell about 50 to 100 broiler chickens a day, and a few hundred kampung chickens a week, depending on demand.  Currently, they sell frozen chicken from Brazil and chicken parts like wings, drumsticks and breast meat. The online store sells directly to customers via home delivery, as well as to some hawkers and restaurants. “Suppliers have not given us an update on prices (for kampung chicken), but I expect it will go up quite a bit,” added Mr Kamal."

The Straits Times spoke to 20 chicken rice hawkers from coffee shops and markets in areas such as Tiong Bahru and Clementi, with most saying the future of their stalls is uncertain. Though these hawkers are still in business, their supply of chilled chicken has dropped by 20 per cent to 50 per cent and some have had to raise prices by about 50 cents per plate. Rather than freshly slaughtered chicken, hawkers are using chilled chicken. The chickens were imported live from Malaysia before the ban kicked in on June 1, processed in Singapore and chilled. Chilled chicken can typically be kept for about two weeks. Seven of the stallholders said should the ban continue into July, they will likely close their stalls temporarily to wait it out. Chicken rice hawkers here typically rely on fresh or chilled chicken, as the texture of frozen chicken is not preferred. Ms Chen Shuang Xian, 72, the owner of Rong Hua Yuan Hainanese Chicken Rice at Bedok South Market and Food Centre, said: ""My supplier stockpiled chilled chicken and I am still getting chicken from them. But I think it will run out by next week as chilled chicken can last for only two weeks. There is nothing my supplier can do about it."" Ms Chen added that prices of chicken have gone up by $1 per kg and she has increased prices at her stall as a result. A plate of chicken rice from her stall now costs $3.50, up from $3. She said she will either close the stall temporarily when chilled chicken is no longer available or switch to selling other dishes which will not require chicken. Mr Cheong Weng Wah, 54, the owner of Tiong Bahru Hainanese Boneless Chicken Rice, said the chicken that he buys for his stall now costs $5.50 per kg, up from $4. He has not raised his prices but said that though his profits have taken a hit, he does not want his customers to pay more. Mr Tan Soon Loie, 60, who runs Aljunied (Soon Kee) Roasted Meat Chicken Rice at 58 New Upper Changi Road, said he will take a break from work when his chilled chicken supply stops. He said: ""I don't really have plans when it runs out. I probably will take a short break. I will not use frozen chicken."" On June 4, Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment Desmond Tan said Singapore can expect more supplies of chilled chicken from Australia and Thailand, as well as frozen chicken from sources such as Brazil and the United States in the coming weeks. Mr Tan added that the country's chicken supply remains stable despite Malaysia's export ban. Some chicken rice hawkers said they plan to sell different dishes or use frozen chicken to continue making a living. Mr Wang Tianxin, who is in his 50s and runs Shun Feng Chicken Rice and Noodles at 216 Bedok Food Centre and Market, said he will sell chicken chop instead. He said: ""(In this way) I can use frozen chicken. I have no choice, I got to survive."" He currently receives 20 per cent less chicken than usual due to a lack of stock and said business has also dropped by the same amount. Mr Yeoh Choon Meng, 55, who owns Leng Heng Chicken Rice at East Coast Lagoon Food Village, said he will consider switching to frozen chicken. He added: ""I think customers would be okay with me using frozen chicken. With frozen chicken, I can still make roast chicken.

In a release on Wednesday (June 8), the Swedish furniture company said that it was recalling the espresso maker as it could burst while in use. ""Safety is a top priority for Ikea and therefore we are recalling Metallisk espresso maker with the stainless-steel safety valve due to an increased risk of the product bursting during use,"" Ikea said. The model recalled is silver or grey in colour. Ikea Singapore said there have been no reports of incidents here and added that no other units are affected by the recall.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/chicken-still-available-at-singapore-markets-1-week-after-malaysia-export-ban,Chicken still available at Singapore markets a week after Malaysia export ban,"SINGAPORE - One week into Malaysia's chicken export ban, raw chicken can still be found at wet market poultry stalls here, though stocks are lower than usual. At wet markets The Straits Times visited on Wednesday (June 8) morning, including 216 Bedok Food Centre and Market and Ghim Moh Market and Food Centre, poultry stalls that mainly stocked fresh chicken were closed. Stall owners who had spoken with ST last week said they would likely keep their stalls closed until the ban was lifted. But chicken still remains on the menu. Over at Geylang Serai market, poultry stalls were still in business, selling chilled or frozen chicken. Those that sold chilled chicken, which can typically last about two weeks in storage, said that the current supply was likely to last one more week. Mr Fabian Lim, 62, who works at Lam P.K Poultry Supply at Geylang Serai market, said: ""I still have supply, but it is old stock, which has probably been chilled for a week. I think chilled chicken supplies will last only till the middle of this month. After that, I will sell frozen chicken."" His stall is currently selling about 20 per cent of their usual supply. Mr Husni Hashim, 56, owner of Muhamad Ali Fresh and Frozen Meat Supplier at Geylang Serai market, said he had switched to selling frozen chicken, since fresh chicken was no longer available. He said: ""I realised my customers do not mind if my chicken is frozen or fresh; so long as they want to eat chicken, they are willing to buy frozen chicken."" He added he was looking for alternative suppliers to get more frozen chicken stock. Mr Win Hong, 44, owner of Winthrop Hong Group at Ghim Moh Market and Food Centre, said his stall was still selling chilled chicken. Mr Hong said: ""Before the ban, the suppliers slaughtered more chicken to keep for us. We have our own way of keeping it fresh, like vacuum-packing. ""The local suppliers have also really done their part: When the ban was announced, they brought in more chickens to process so that we can continue selling."" He said his current supply would last through the month. But it has not been business as usual for some suppliers here, who have halted production lines and asked staff to clear their annual leave since imports of fresh chicken from across the Causeway have stopped. Malaysian authorities imposed a ban on chicken exports on June 1 amid a shortage of the product. Exports were halted so that prices and supply in the country could stabilise. According to the Singapore Food Agency, 34 per cent of Singapore's chicken supply comes from Malaysia, with most being imported live for slaughtering here. Since the start of the month, chicken importer Kee Song has asked some staff to clear their annual leave and use this period to take a break from work. Kee Song head of business development James Sim said: ""Usually we operate daily, without (taking time off for) any public holidays or weekends. So now is a good time for the staff to actually use their annual leave and take a break to recharge and spend time with their families, since it is also the June school holidays."" Kee Song had ramped up production by 30 to 40 per cent after Malaysia announced the impending export ban on May 26. Staff had to work extra shifts to help the firm stockpile around 10 days' worth of chicken. Mr Sim added that the company also has plans to send staff for training courses to update their skills in food hygiene, food handling and customer service. As it is still uncertain when the ban will be lifted, Mr Sim said the company was also looking at alternative sources for chilled or frozen chicken, including from countries such as Thailand, New Zealand and Australia."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/resorts-world-cruises-to-offer-cruises-to-malaysia-and-indonesia-from-july,Resorts World Cruises to offer cruises to Malaysia and Indonesia from July,"SINGAPORE - Cruise-goers are set to get another option to sail internationally as Resorts World Cruises looks to start trips to Malaysia and Indonesia on July 1. Its cruises will call at Bintan and Batam as well as Kuala Lumpur, Melaka and Penang, the company said on Tuesday (June 7).  It also plans to include more popular destinations such as Phuket, Krabi and Bali as early as October this year, said president Michael Goh.  This comes as Royal Caribbean - one of Resorts World Cruises’ major competitors here - announced that its ships would begin calling at Malaysian ports, including Penang and Port Klang, from the end of this month.  The July 1 date for international destinations is several months sooner than the company’s earlier announced plan for trips to Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia to begin at the end of September.  Cruises to Indonesia will begin with a two-night Bintan and Batam Weekend Getaway Cruise on July 1, said Mr Goh.  On July 3, the ship will sail for Kuala Lumpur, Melaka and Penang, he added.  Ms Annie Chang, director for cruises at STB, said the expansion of Resorts World Cruises’ destination list strengthens Singapore’s cruise offerings and gives more options for domestic and international cruise-goers.  She added: “We are delighted that Resorts World Cruises has added destinations to its cruises as more ports in the region reopen.  “STB will continue to work closely with our regional counterparts to re-open more ports and re-invigorate the cruise industry in South-east Asia.”  The international cruise industry in Singapore has been largely dormant for more than two years due to the Covid-19 pandemic, apart from cruises-to-nowhere, which have been operating since November 2020. Resorts World Cruises’ trips to Malaysia and Indonesia will be made on its flagship, Genting Dream which is currently preparing for its maiden voyage under new management - a cruise to nowhere scheduled for June 15. The ship was previously owned by Dream Cruises, which applied to be wound up in February after its parent company Genting Hong Kong folded in a move that left customers here in the lurch. Resorts World Cruises - owned by Malaysian tycoon Lim Kok Thay - later stepped in to offer credits to affected customers.  The company is offering complimentary cruise credits of the equivalent value for all paid passengers affected by Dream Cruises’ cancellations in Singapore between March 2 and Aug 31 this year."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/durian-prices-up-as-bad-weather-hits-harvest-and-labour-fertiliser-costs-rise,"Durian prices up as bad weather hits harvest and labour, fertiliser costs rise","SINGAPORE - He was not keen on increasing durian prices, but Mr Zen Ho, the founder of Durian Empire, has been forced to charge more for the ""king of fruits"" this season. The price of Malaysia's musang king durians at Punggol's Durian Empire was between $15 and $18 per kg pre-pandemic, but Mr Ho estimates that the variety will cost anywhere between $20 and $25 per kg now. Mr Ho, 39, said: ""The cost price of durians is higher than last season because harvest is poorer this year. ""The season is getting longer and the harvest is spread out over a longer period. We need stamina to still be in the game."" The durian season started in June and is expected to run till September. Singapore gets 89 per cent of its durians from Malaysia, with the rest coming from Thailand and the Philippines, according to the Singapore Food Agency in 2020. Malaysian newspaper The Star in February and May projected durian prices to be 40 per cent higher now than last year due to rising fertiliser and labour prices, and bad weather impacting the pollination of durian flowers. Mr Wong Hua Chian, the owner of Malaysian supplier Pochi Durian Trading, based in Johor, said prices have gone up due to bad weather in March, which led to only 20 per cent to 30 per cent of the crop bearing fruit. Demand from China, Hong Kong and Europe has further limited supply. The company supplies durians to seven Singapore sellers, and Mr Wong, 36, said: ""We must strike a balance between China's and Singapore's demands as it all depends on market forces and who will buy the durian at a more competitive price."" Mr Teoh See Yong, who operates fruit stall Durian 36 in Geylang, said his Malaysian suppliers have told him that prices have gone up due to a shortage of foreign labour and increase in fertiliser costs. For premium durian varieties from Malaysia such as musang king and black thorn, the prices are expected to double this season. Most durian lovers here prefer the Malaysian varieties. Mr Teoh, 37, said: ""Malaysian durians have a strong and pungent aroma as they fall naturally from the tree as opposed to Thailand's durians being cut off from the tree. ""Singaporeans prefer the natural, pungent aroma of Malaysian durians than the milder aroma of Thai durians."" To get their fix, some Singaporeans are booking durian tours to Malaysia. Transtar Travel has been marketing durian trips to Yong Peng, Johor, since May 19. It has 50 confirmed bookings for one-day trips in the peak months of June and July. Branch manager Ng Swee Khwan, 41, said: ""Such tours could become more popular as the durian season peaks in July, with more people keen to get out and travel."" She added: ""Also, during the (Covid-19) pandemic, so many could not travel. Now that the borders have opened up, people are looking forward to going on a trip."" Long-time durian lover Tng Meng Hua is unfazed at the price hike, though. He was eating a durian dessert at 99 Old Trees, a durian dessert and fruit shop in Outram Park which has been operating for four years. He loves the musang king and black thorn varieties from Malaysia, and is willing to pay more for them. ""My preference has not changed much, and as long as I find them delicious, I will continue to eat them,"" the 52-year-old, who works in printing, said."

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/wellness-will-be-key-component-of-singapores-tourism-offerings-in-next-5-to-10-years-stb-chief,Wellness will be key component of Singapore's tourism offerings in next 5 to 10 years: STB chief,"SINGAPORE - Wellness will be a key part of Singapore's tourism offerings in the next five to 10 years, and events like the inaugural Wellness Festival will help kick-start this movement, said Singapore Tourism Board (STB) chief executive Keith Tan on Friday (June 3). But to build Singapore's reputation in that field, domestic demand will also have to be built up and factored in, he added. Mr Tan was speaking on a panel about shaping Singapore as an urban wellness haven at the Wellness Symposium, held at Gardens by the Bay. The symposium, organised by Enterprise Singapore, brought together business leaders, industry experts and professionals to share insights on the market opportunities and consumer demand in spiritual, mental and preventive health. ""Singapore is not known as a wellness destination and, frankly, if you ask a lot of locals, they don't associate Singapore with (that). But when you survey the landscape and see what's out there (with) companies that provide wellness solutions, there's a lot available that's underappreciated and not well known,"" he said. Mr Tan cited Singapore's reputation as a foodie destination, where visitors can get a plethora of options, whether it costs $5, $50 or $500. ""I see that for the wellness sector too, where we are on this journey... It's not quite at the same stature where food is, but we can get there,"" he said. He added that this will require the joint efforts of the industry and government agencies, so that in five to 10 years' time, Singapore will be known not just for its food and attractions, but also for its wellness offerings. ""(But) Singapore cannot establish a reputation as an urban wellness destination if we don't have a baseline of domestic advocates and domestic demand... (Hence) it's crucial that we build something that appeals to locals because, without it, it would be an inauthentic experience for foreigners,"" he said. The other panellists were Mr Aaron Boey, traditional Chinese medicine giant Eu Yan Sang's chief executive; Ms Fiona Tan, wellness brand Como Shambhala Group's general manager; and Ms Summer Song, founder of cultural experience creators Cultured Generation. The session was moderated by McKinsey & Company senior partner Diaan-Yi Lin. The 10-day Wellness Festival - which runs from Friday to June 12 and has more than 130 free and ticketed activities islandwide - is among the first steps in making Singapore's wellness offerings more easily discoverable by locals and visitors. Organised by STB, the festival features everything from forest bathing at Jewel Changi Airport to equine therapy with horses at the Singapore Turf Club Riding Centre, to yoga on the Marina Bay Sands SkyPark Observation Deck. There are also several large-scale attractions such as The Wellness Sensorium, a multi-sensory pop-up experience at The Meadow at Gardens by the Bay, which will have six zones with activities like stone stacking, and a light-and-sound bath to induce a state of calm. ""The festival is just an event by itself, but it's a rallying call to the industry to step up and help support our efforts, so that Singapore can become better known as a wellness destination,"" said STB's Mr Tan. That rallying call was echoed by Minister of State for Trade and Industry Alvin Tan, who delivered the opening address at the symposium. He noted the potential of the wellness industry, citing figures by the non-profit Global Wellness Institute, which said in 2020 that the global wellness economy was valued at US$4.4 trillion (S$6 trillion), US$1.5 trillion in the Asia-Pacific region, and US$12 billion in Singapore. He called on industry players to capitalise on this. ""Wellness is an emerging sector which presents many opportunities for our tourism sector and Singapore is very well positioned to capture these opportunities... because we have a wide variety of accessible, innovative and 'must-do' wellness experiences,"" said Mr Alvin Tan, who is also Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth. The festival is also part of Singapore's post- Covid-19-pandemic recovery plans. In April, STB announced that close to $500 million has been set aside to support the Singapore tourism sector's recovery plans in the coming years. One key move is to develop Singapore as a sustainable urban destination to draw eco-conscious travellers, a growing tourism segment. To differentiate Singapore from other destinations, attractions and events will be curated and created with a sustainability and wellness focus. STB's Mr Tan said Singapore will never be nor aspire to be another Bali or Phuket or Koh Samui. And unlike destinations where visitors have to travel a few hours to the mountains or an isolated spa in the wilderness, wellness experiences here are easily available in the heart of the city. ""I would love it if Singapore can be seen as a destination where travellers come for business or leisure, and they go back refreshed, and that Singapore as a destination has taken care of them holistically,"" he said. The Republic is also showing signs of strong, renewed demand in the meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (Mice) sector, having already hosted more than 150 events in the first three months of this year. More than 37,000 delegates attended the events, said STB, which added that the industry is expected to fully recover in two to three years. At least 66 international events are slated for the rest of this year, including the return of the Milken Institute Asia Summit 2022 in September; and Gamescom Asia, the Asia satellite event of the world's largest computer and video games festival, in October."

Beyond just the desire to fly the coop, travellers have also become more intentional about the way they travel.  For example, the Understanding The New Traveller report by global trend forecaster WGSN and commissioned by the Singapore Tourism Board found that the post-pandemic traveller falls into three main profiles: the Wander-Must looking for their next big, no holds barred adventure; the Mindful Explorer who makes efforts to change their way of travelling to minimise their impact on the environment; and the Slow Pacer who is dedicated to carving out downtime through wellness destinations and transformational journeys.  In other words, your next big holiday is likely to look very different. Regardless of the vacation type you prefer, some travel essentials will stay the same.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/chicken-based-dishes-get-pricier-as-malaysias-export-ban-takes-a-toll,Chicken-based dishes get pricier as Malaysia's export ban takes a toll,"SINGAPORE - Chicken-based dishes are getting pricier, as some eateries have already hiked prices, while others are taking a wait-and-see approach, following Malaysia's export ban which began on Wednesday (June 1). Chicken rice chain Boon Tong Kee, which has eight outlets across the island, said it has increased the price of its Signature Boiled (Poached) Chicken dish by 15 per cent to $36 without GST across all its outlets since Wednesday. As there is limited stock of fresh chicken, there will also be a cap on the number of boiled chickens served at each outlet, which is about 50 to 70. The price hike was to compensate for the 10 per cent to 20 per cent increase in the cost of fresh chicken among various suppliers, said Boon Tong Kee's director Jason Thian. The eatery's other signature dish, paper-wrapped chicken, will now be made using frozen chicken. At chicken rice restaurant Sing Swee Kee in Seah Street, operations director Eliss Pang said it may raise prices by 5 per cent to 10 per cent in the future. Ms Pang said it is monitoring the prices of chicken supplies, and hopes they will stabilise so that any drastic price adjustments can be avoided. ""It is not only costs of whole chickens that are affected, there are chicken innards, chicken feet, chicken bones that we use for our soup and rice, and those costs have all increased too,"" she added. Taiwanese fried chicken chain Monga said it has been ""impacted negatively"", both by the high price and short supply. Mr Lem Cheong, director of operations at Baoshi F&B Management which owns the chain, said it may increase the prices of all its products by 30 cents by next week. ""We have already been absorbing the costs for the past few weeks. I believe our customers should be able to empathise; it's the same situation across the board for most in the market,"" said Mr Cheong. Meanwhile, Dickson Nasi Lemak in Joo Chiat has temporarily closed its outlet for this month, and hopes to reopen on July 1 if the ban is lifted. Some staff at the outlet will be moved to another outlet, Champion Bolo Bun, said The Platform Collective, which manages the eatery. It added that some staff from Malaysia have gone back home. ""As at May 2022, we sold dishes like ayam goreng berempah nasi lemak (spiced fried chicken). If the export ban continues, we'll look into launching dishes like ayam rendang, beef rendang and sambal sotong,"" said managing director Hoh Loyi. But some restaurants said they will not be increasing prices. Khansama Tandoori Restaurant in Little India plans to absorb the higher costs. ""We have a high turnover rate and our business is stable, so we will not be making any changes like lowering wages or decreasing the quality of our food,"" said managing partner Rakesh Kumar."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/royal-caribbean-cruise-ships-to-start-sailing-from-singapore-to-malaysia-in-end-june,Royal Caribbean cruise ships to start sailing from S'pore to Malaysia from June 30,"SINGAPORE - Singaporeans will soon have more options for travel, as Royal Caribbean cruise ships will start calling at ports in Malaysia from the end of this month, with stops at Penang and Port Klang. The cruise line said on Thursday (June 2) that it will offer three- and four-night cruises on its ship Spectrum of the Seas from June 30. This marks the start of international cruises from Singapore and the  end of  almost two years of cruises to nowhere -  that began  in November 2020 - as an attempt to bring back cruising safely amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Singapore had ceased port calls for cruise ships since March 2020. According to Royal Caribbean's website, three-night cruises will stop at Penang, while four-night cruises will stop at both Penang and Port Klang. Prices for three-night cruises start from $310, while prices for four-night cruises start from $390. Bookings for these cruises open from Thursday. All guests must have passports with six months validity and should update the MySejahtera tracing app before their cruise. After they complete the pre-departure form in the app, they will receive a Blue Traveller’s Card to present to Malaysian authorities upon disembarkation. The passengers can choose to book a shore excursion when they disembark or opt to move around on their own. Shore excursions include a visit to St. George’s Church in Penang and a trip to the Batu Caves in Kuala Lumpur.  As part of an agreement with the Malaysian authorities, no additional Covid-19 test will be needed on arrival, as long as passengers have fulfilled Royal Caribbean’s existing requirements. These include being fully vaccinated against Covid-19 and undergoing a supervised antigen rapid test a day before boarding the ship. The Singapore Tourism Board' s director of cruise Annie Chang said port calls will provide more vacation options which will hopefully draw in more first-time and repeat cruisers in the coming year as more ports in the region open up. ""We have been working closely with various governments in South-east Asia to align on cruise protocols and policies, and are excited to bring back port calls in Malaysia for sailings as a start,"" she said. STB had been working to set up a few ports of call by year end, with destinations such as Bali in Indonesia and Phuket in Thailand being considered.  Royal Caribbean's Asia-Pacific vice-president and managing director, Ms Angie Stephen, said the cruise line is the first in Singapore to resume port calls. The cruise line added that the Malaysian government requires all visitors to the country to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19. Those who have had only two doses of the Sinovac or Sinopharm vaccine, as well as guests aged 60 and older who have not received their booster shot, are considered to be partially vaccinated by the Malaysian government. They will be required to have a booster shot in order to debark in Malaysia. Royal Caribbean also added that all existing guest bookings will be automatically converted into a destination sailing for Malaysia at no additional cost. Those who have been affected will be informed of the change via e-mail. This means that the cruise line will no longer be offering cruises to nowhere from June 30. Over half a million passengers have gone on close to 360 cruises to nowhere since Singapore restarted cruises, and more than 250,000 residents have sailed with Royal Caribbean. Currently, only two cruise lines operate in Singapore - Royal Caribbean and Resorts World Cruises. Ms Chang added that STB’s discussions with other cruise lines have been positive so far, with some brands eager to deploy their ships back to South-east Asia by late 2022. One of those going on a cruise to Malaysia is Ms Sophie Tan, who had her cruise to nowhere in July converted into a three-night cruise to Penang. She said she would be travelling with three other friends, and added that being able to go to Penang is a bonus as she had initially expected the three-night sailing to stop at Port Klang instead. She said: “I have been anticipating this move by STB and Royal Caribbean for some time now and it’s great that it is in time for the cruise that I booked.  “I’m (a little nervous). My friends haven’t caught Covid-19 before, so we’ll just try to keep our masks on and practise good hygiene nonetheless.”"
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/bookings-for-mice-industry-in-spore-gathering-pace-stb-says-full-recovery-by-2025,Bookings for Mice industry gathering pace; STB says full recovery by 2025,"SINGAPORE- The Republic hosted more than 150 events in the first three months of this year, an indication that recovery is picking up pace for the meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (Mice) industry here. More than 37,000 delegates attended the events, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) said on Wednesday (June 1). Mr Poh Chi Chuan, STB's executive director of exhibitions and conferences, said: ""We have also observed more frequent site inspections and planning visits from event organisers. ""These are sure signs of renewed Mice demand, and as a result of that, we expect more contracts to be signed with event venues and hotels."" STB said at least 66 international events have been secured for the rest of this year, adding that the industry is expected to fully recover in two to three years. In 2021, about 49,000 delegates attended more than 200 events hosted in Singapore. Mice events are no longer subjected to restrictions on group sizes, event capacity limits, or zoning requirements. Safe distancing is also no longer required. Mr Poh said STB's projection is based on the International Air Transport Association's prediction on air passenger numbers recovering in 2024, China's eventual reopening, growing business confidence from organisers and delegates, and a strong pipeline of events. To take advantage of the momentum, STB has launched an enhanced incentive programme for international Mice groups with close to 80 free experiences for delegates. The programme was introduced in 2019 with 54 experiences. The new programme will include a retail segment that will let delegates, especially groups from China, Oceania, South Asia and South-east Asia, go on shopping tours and meet designers. They will have access to exclusive shopping sprees and back-of-house shopping tours, with meet-and-greet sessions with designers. Mr Richard Ireland, president of the Singapore Association of Convention and Exhibition Organisers and Suppliers, said the Mice industry is expecting a steep recovery this year. This is based on pent-up demand, a strong pipeline of new events and early customer bookings. ""The first quarter was a little muted as we really opened only in April without restrictions, so it hasn't been a long time. We are quite confident as an industry that we'd be able to recover by 2023 to 2024,"" said Mr Ireland. One potential headwind is the varied pace of reopening in the region, he added. Singapore relies heavily on regional and international attendees, and it is often viewed as a Mice destination together with the rest of the region. The pace at which the region reopens, and stays open with some consistency, will be critical for the return of a vibrant Mice scene in Asia and Singapore, he said. China, for example, is still largely closed off. Those who can travel there are subjected to measures such as testing and isolation. Prior to the pandemic, the Mice sector supported more than 34,000 direct and indirect jobs, with a value-add of $3.8 billion, or close to 1 per cent of Singapore’s gross domestic product. China and Hong Kong were among the Republic’s top 10 Mice source markets. STB said it will continue to diversify and tap business travel demand from other markets such as Malaysia, Indonesia, India, the United States and Australia. Ms Elaine Chia, Asia-Pacific chief executive of event organiser Comexposium, said a full recovery is dependent on China's travel policies and Covid-19 strategies, given that it is a significant contributor to the Mice sector. She said an optimistic outlook would see full recovery in two years. Mr Jean-François Quentin, group chief executive of Constellar, which manages the Singapore Expo, said the pace of recovery is accelerating for the industry. Bookings for the venue for the second half of 2022 has hit 60 per cent of pre-Covid-19 levels. But he said inflationary pressures as well as supply chain challenges may temper the pace of recovery for at least the next six months to a year. ""There is still a high element of risk that not all event organisers and exhibitors are willing to undertake, with constantly changing travel and health regulations across countries, while two of the largest markets in Asia - China and Japan - remain largely closed,"" he added.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/bloomberg-new-economy-forum-to-be-held-in-singapore-for-3rd-time-in-november,Bloomberg New Economy Forum to be held in S'pore in November,"SINGAPORE - The Bloomberg New Economy Forum will be held in Singapore from Nov 14 to 17, said organiser Bloomberg on Wednesday (June 1). It will be the third time the Republic hosts the forum. Now in its fifth year, the annual event sees top businessmen and government leaders gather to discuss solutions to global challenges. It is one of the most-watched global events and this year, it is scheduled to take place close to the 2022 G20 that will be held in Bali and the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in Bangkok, given the shared interests and high-level commitments of its global delegation. The conference went virtual in 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Last year, it was held at Sentosa's Capella hotel, with strict Covid-19 testing and safety measures implemented for about 300 international business and government leaders present. Current and former heads of state, global chief executives and public sector leaders, including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, billionaire Bill Gates and former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, attended last year. The forum was launched by US media mogul Michael Bloomberg in 2018. Last year, discussions covered five key pillars: climate, cities, finance, trade and public health. Another goal of last year's event was to expand the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, which was formed in 2015 by the Financial Stability Board. Spearheaded by former Bank of England governor Mark Carney and chaired by Mr Bloomberg, the task force issues recommendations to help companies disclose the potential financial impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on their businesses. On May 18 and 19, the inaugural Bloomberg New Economy Gateway Latin America event took place in Panama. The 2022 class of Bloomberg New Economy Catalysts will be announced later this year. Founded last year, Bloomberg New Economy Catalysts is a global community of public and private sector innovators, scientists, policymakers and entrepreneurs working together to transform businesses and governments."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/most-shoppers-comfortable-with-frozen-chicken-or-alternative-meats-as-malaysia-ban-looms,Most shoppers comfortable with frozen chicken or alternative meats as Malaysia ban looms,"SINGAPORE - While a handful of shoppers at wet markets bought more fresh chicken than usual on Tuesday (May 31), others said they would buy only what they need and are comfortable switching to frozen poultry or other meats if fresh chicken is no longer available. Meanwhile, some consumers took the opportunity to tuck into chicken rice and other dishes before Malaysia's export ban on fresh chicken kicks in on Wednesday (June 1). Among the shoppers who spoke to The Straits Times on Tuesday was warehouse operator Han Jun Yin, 42, who bought 10 chickens rather than her usual five at 216 Bedok North Market. She said this was to prepare for the ban, and she plans to freeze the chickens. ""I cook chicken a lot at home, so I am worried I will not have enough. I cannot opt for pork as an alternative as my domestic helper cannot eat it."" Other shoppers were less worried about the ban. Retired factory worker Victor Wong, 72, who was on a grocery run at Bedok South Market & Food Centre, said: ""If there is no supply of fresh chicken, then so be it, I will not die if there is no chicken to eat, as there are so many alternatives."" Sales agent Stanley Ng, 47, who bought one chicken from the same market, said: ""I prefer fresh chicken to frozen chicken, but there is nothing I can do about it. I think hoarding is unnecessary."" At Eunos Crescent Market, housewife Maria Theresa Green, 60, who usually buys chicken fortnightly, said she and her husband are willing to eat less chicken once the ban sets in. ""I don't think the ban will affect me too much. I will eat other foods, like vegetables and fish,"" she added. Malaysia is facing a chicken shortage, with Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob announcing on May 23 that it will halt the export of up to 3.6 million chickens a month from June 1, until domestic prices and production stabilise. Poultry sellers here have also accepted the export ban on fresh chicken by Malaysia, with some saying they will likely use the opportunity to take a break. Mr Ong Huan Koo, 73, owner of Sinmah Poultry Processing at Toa Payoh West Market & Food Centre, said he will close his stall in June. He told ST: ""We cannot compete with larger chains like supermarkets. They at least can continue selling frozen food. But for us wet market stalls which focus on fresh chicken, it's a different story. Taking a break is our best option."" Mr Ong Aik Beng, 58, owner of Seng Lip Fresh Chicken and Duck, added that business has been brisk since the ban was announced. He said: ""There was a huge increase in sales last week when the ban was first announced, resulting in really long queues. I've been working longer hours and it's quite tiring. So I will take this chance to rest and wait until the ban is lifted."" Those who intend to continue selling chicken said they will likely have to raise prices. Mr Mohammad Ismail Abbas, 71, a butcher at Eunos Crescent Market and Food Centre, who sells both frozen and fresh chicken, said he has been keeping chicken prices at his stall stable but will likely make changes soon. He said: ""After the ban, I think I will have to increase prices. It's hard to say how much the suppliers will raise prices. For the time being, I will try to control my prices, but I may need to increase by about 10 per cent soon."" Some eateries and hawker stalls were busy on Tuesday as foodies enjoyed their favourite chicken rice or nasi lemak while the dishes were still prepared with fresh chicken. Ms Sherilyn Tan, 29, was among the lunchtime crowd who loaded up on nasi lemak packets at Dickson Nasi Lemak in Joo Chiat. Ms Tan, who works in technology, decided to drop by the takeaway-only outlet after Dickson announced last Friday that it would close temporarily from June 1 to 30, in the absence of fresh chicken for its signature ayam goreng berempah (spiced fried chicken). ""I came down today after I heard they were going to close,"" said Ms Tan, who picked up five packets. Others like power station worker Lim Kim Siah, 48, was queueing for Tong Fong Fatt chicken rice at Block 18 Bedok South Market. Noting that his family eats chicken rice about twice a week, Mr Lim said: ""We have to be flexible because what can I do about it? There are many other alternatives available."" Like their customers, chicken rice sellers are also prepared to adapt to the ban. ""In times like this, we have to be flexible,"" said Mr Gan Sze Wei, 41, who runs Hong Kong Soy Sauce Chicken at Block 18. Despite chicken dishes accounting for about half his sales, Mr Gan said he is not too worried. ""My supplier is not sure whether he is able to get chicken for me... but I can sell other dishes such as roasted pork and prawn dumpling noodles,"" he said. Mr Bai Jiaofen, 50, who runs Peng You Chicken Rice and Noodles at the same market, is among those who are more concerned. He said: ""We are very worried since it will affect our livelihood, but there is nothing much we can do about it. We will experiment with frozen chicken, but we're not sure if it will taste the same."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/importers-ask-clients-to-accept-chicken-parts-instead-of-ordering-whole-bird,S'pore chicken importers urge clients to accept parts instead of whole bird,"SINGAPORE - Chicken importers facing a Malaysian export ban that kicks in from June 1 are urging their clients to accept whatever parts - such as breast or wing - are available, rather than order the whole bird. For their part, importers are ramping up processing before the ban, stockpiling as much chicken in chillers and freezers while they can to counter uncertainties ahead. ""We are working with our customers and have asked them to switch to different... parts, depending on what's available,"" said Mr James Sim, head of business development at importer Kee Song Food. Its clients include online retailers, supermarket chains, restaurant groups, wet markets and chicken rice stalls. For example, chicken rice stalls that normally opt for whole chickens have been asked to take on parts instead. Malaysia is currently facing a chicken shortage, with Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob announcing on May 23 that it will halt the export of up to 3.6 million chickens a month from June 1, until domestic prices and production stabilise. The Straits Times reported over the weekend that suppliers in Malaysia are working overtime to deliver chickens here. Importers here have also been putting in extended hours. Companies like Kee Song have tripled the usual number of shifts to process fresh chickens before the ban sets in. Last week, the Singapore Food Agency said the Animal & Veterinary Service extended operating hours for inspection of live poultry at Tuas Checkpoint from May 25 to May 31. ""More chickens than usual came in over the weekend... we've brought in about 30 to 40 per cent more chicken per day, but that's all we can process due to limitations of time and labour,"" said Mr Sim, who added that live chickens have to be processed within 24 hours. ""A portion of it will be kept frozen, and I foresee we will be able to last for one to two weeks before stocks are depleted,"" he added. As a company that exclusively imports live chickens from Malaysia, it is expecting to take a 90 per cent to 95 per cent hit in revenue in the coming weeks. Last week, supermarket chain FairPrice said it has a stockpile of frozen chicken that can last for about four months, with another two months of supply on the way. ""The Government has sufficient stockpiles, so the supermarkets should be able to sustain sufficient stocks,"" noted Mr Ma Chin Chew, secretary for the Poultry Merchants' Association. ""It's just that there might be a shortage of fresh chicken for a while."" As for when fresh chicken will run out in Singapore, Mr Ma said it depends on how much stock each company has in its cold stores. He added that many importers here are adopting a wait-and-see approach over whether the ban might last beyond a month. ""I think the supply of chicken will take a few weeks to stabilise,"" he said. ""Right now the chickens are all too small and need time to grow... but once the birds get bigger, then they (Malaysian suppliers) will also have to sell them, otherwise they might have to deal with a surplus of chickens."" He added: ""I don't think many importers here will start bringing in more frozen chicken, because there is so much uncertainty about the ban in Malaysia... it could last a few weeks or more than a month, we don't know."" As for whether trucks carrying chickens that have yet to reach Singapore before June 1 will be turned back, he said permits - which are typically issued a week before - have been issued only up to May 31. ""So if they don't have a permit to export, then they won't be able to bring chickens over,"" he noted. On Monday morning, most customers at wet markets and supermarkets visited by ST said they were buying their usual amount of chicken. However, some like Mr Damien Lee, 35, who is self-employed, wanted to mark their last meal made with fresh chicken before the item becomes unavailable. ""If the prices increase exorbitantly, I may eat less chicken... but I want to eat my last grand chicken meal before that happens with my family (of four),"" said Mr Lee, who purchased two whole fresh chickens from FairPrice Finest at Clementi Mall. ""For now, it is still affordable, but if it increases by $5, that would be a bit overboard... if that happens, we'll probably just eat other meats or more vegetables,"" he added. Others like Mr Samuel Chin, 53, a delivery driver who was shopping at Ghim Moh Market, hope that people will not overbuy. ""Not only will you waste food, you will also waste money if you cannot finish it. I don't know anyone personally who is hoarding (chickens), but (I'm sure) there will be people who hoard, and then end up throwing it away because it's not fresh anymore... Just buy what you need and what you can finish,"" said Mr Chin."

The heat has also been driving more people to public swimming pools and more regular servicing of their air-conditioning systems. On April 1, it hit 36.8 deg C in Admiralty, just 0.2 deg C shy of the all-time high recorded in Tengah on April 17, 1983. There was little respite in May, with the National Environment Agency's Meteorological Service Singapore earlier predicting daily maximum temperatures of between 34 deg C and 35 deg C. Due to high humidity and low wind speeds in urban Singapore, the hot weather is expected to last. But that has been good news for some businesses. Hair salons and barbershops said customers have been opting for shorter hair cuts. Mr Taufiq, 29, said there was a 20 per cent increase in customers in April and May, compared with previous months. He said: ""Almost every conversation with clients would start off with the weather and half of them would say it feels cooler after getting their hair cut."" Be Salon director Sham Adam, 38, said 30 per cent of the hair salon's female customers in the past two months chose hairstyles like the short bob. Ms Teh Sue-Fen, 42, went to Kimage's Tampines branch to have her hair cut from mid-back length to shoulder length. The housewife said: ""Long hair is very uncomfortable in the heat, especially when I sweat and my hair gets damp."" Public swimming pools are also getting more crowded. ActiveSG, which manages sporting activities, said there was a 26 per cent increase in traffic at swimming pools between May 1 and 23 this year compared with the same period in 2019. It added that the high temperatures and easing of Covid-19 measures brought in the crowds recently. There was an average attendance of 23,000 people on each of the first three weekends in May. The highest daily recorded number to date was 32,000 on Sunday (May 22), a Sport Singapore spokesman said. Air-con retailers and service providers said they have received more queries about air-cons. Home appliance brand Europace's product marketing manager Benson To said demand for most cooling products such as air-cons and fans increased by around 50 per cent in April. Air-con servicing companies - Wira Aircon Services, iAircon Singapore and Mr Cool Aircon Services - have also seen an increase in demand for their services. Mr Rafiuddin Ismail, 38, managing director of Wira Aircon Services, said: ""For the past three weeks, urgent requests for servicing within a day have increased by 40 per cent, with most requiring an overhaul of the air-conditioning unit."" Requests for air-con repair and installation services have also increased, and the company has to perform larger-scale jobs such as changing the pipes and condensers of units almost daily, added Mr Rafiuddin. Food and beverage outlets have also been busier lately due to the hot weather. Creatr., a cafe in Stirling Road, specialises in local-inspired dishes but has seen 20 per cent more ice cream being sold, said owner Leon Lim, 33. Aircraft technician Nor Zaihan, 45, was at Three's A Crowd cafe in Tampines, which serves ice cream and waffles. He said he consumes cold drinks or ice cream at least once a day. He added: ""Nothing beats cold desserts in this sweltering heat."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/singapores-sugar-supply-unlikely-to-be-hit-by-indias-export-limit-as-it-is-not-major-source,Sweet relief as sugar supply in S'pore unlikely to be hit by India's export limit ,"SINGAPORE - Singapore consumers need not worry about sugar supplies despite India's decision on Tuesday (May 24) to restrict sugar exports for the first time in six years to prevent a surge in domestic prices. While India is the world's biggest sugar producer and the second biggest exporter behind Brazil, industry players told The Straits Times that Singapore imports minimally from the country. Mr John Cheng, a director at sugar manufacturing business Cheng Yew Heng, said the company imports sugar from countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea and Australia. Imports from India make up less than 5 per cent. Cheng Yew Heng is a major importer of sugar here and the country's oldest sugar manufacturer. A spokesman for sugar importer Hiang Li Traders similarly said Singapore mainly sources its sugar from Thailand and Malaysia. The spokesman said: ""Sugar from India makes up a minimal amount of the local market. So we really shouldn't be affected by India limiting exports."" She added that India regularly imposes sugar export limits towards the end of the year. She said: ""India sugar is harvested once a year. Usually around September, it imposes export quotas because it has to wait for the next harvest to come in so that it can take stock. So it is normal to see India imposing export limits, it is just happening a bit earlier this year. ""But overall, India still has a surplus of sugar, so it is not worrying to us. It is just a matter of time until its local market prices stabilise. Then it will go back to exporting regularly."" A spokesman for the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) said the Republic imports sugar from more than 40 countries, including Australia, India, Malaysia and Thailand. The SFA spokesman said: ""Diversification has been one of our key strategies to ensure and secure a supply of safe food, especially in view of the current volatile global food security situation. Should there be a disruption to any one source, we will work with importers to tap alternative sources to keep supply stable."" Sugar prices in Singapore have also remained stable in the past few months, according to supermarkets. A FairPrice spokesman said: ""We import sugar from Thailand, South Africa, China, Malaysia and Singapore to ensure daily essentials remain available and affordable for all. We continue to monitor the situation and work closely with suppliers to ensure that supplies and prices of daily essentials remain stable for our customers."" But while Singapore has various options for the supply of sugar, prices might inevitably increase due to higher demand globally. Mr Cheng said: ""Other countries might look to alternative sources of sugar if they cannot buy from India, sources such as Thailand and Malaysia... So that will push up prices overall. But it won't happen immediately."" He added that sugar prices have fluctuated in recent years due to factors such as higher manufacturing and logistic costs. He said: ""No need to panic that there won't be enough sugar to go around. Importers here are also making sure that they will have enough supply. There are many sources out there for sugar."""

The upcoming themed zone at USS, inspired by the Despicable Me film franchise, is set to open in 2024, and is part of the Republic's post-pandemic tourism recovery plans. It will take over the former Madagascar zone. Mr Alvin Tan, Minister of State for Trade and Industry, and Culture, Community and Youth, attended the groundbreaking event on Thursday. In a speech, he said: ""Before Covid-19, we had about four million visitors per year (to USS) and I'm hopeful - and very optimistic that with the easing of restrictions and opening of travel in earnest - that we will see more people coming in to Sentosa, Universal Studios and Minion Land when we open in 2024.""  The new zone will comprise multiple rides, including one that will be a world first and exclusive to USS. Details on the ride have not been announced. It will also house Despicable Me Minion Mayhem, an immersive motion-simulator 3D ride. The ride is also available at Universal Studios' locations in Florida, Hollywood, Japan and Beijing. The zone will have restaurants and themed shops, with Minion-themed food items and merchandise. Construction of Minion Land will be done in line with sustainability efforts laid out by the Sustainable Sentosa road map launched last year. Its goal is to eventually bring the island's emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases down to net zero by 2030. ""With Minion Land, we aim to attain the zero-energy building certification from the Building and Construction Authority when it opens,"" said Mr Tan Hee Teck, chief executive of Resorts World Sentosa (RWS). ""(It) will then be the first attraction in Singapore, and possibly in this region, to be powered by renewable energy."" Besides being part of Singapore's tourism revival efforts, Minion Land is also part of the first phase of a $4.5 billion mega expansion of RWS by Genting Singapore. The first-phase expansion includes rebranding the SEA Aquarium as the Singapore Oceanarium, which will be three times the size of the current aquarium. RWS will also refurbish the Resorts World Convention Centre, as well as three hotels - Hard Rock Hotel Singapore, Hotel Michael and Festive Hotel - in phases from the second quarter of this year through to 2023."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/fresh-chicken-snapped-up-at-wet-markets-supermarkets-days-after-msia-announces-export-ban,Fresh chicken snapped up in S'pore after Malaysia announces export ban,"SINGAPORE - Several wet markets and supermarkets saw their shelves cleared of fresh chicken on Wednesday morning (May 25) as consumers flocked to stock up on the meat. The increased demand comes on the back of Malaysia announcing that it will halt the export of up to 3.6 million chickens a month from June 1, until domestic prices and production stabilise. At wet markets in Bedok, Ghim Moh, Bishan and MacPherson, poultry stalls said they were sold out from between 8am and 9.30am, at least three to four hours before they usually sell out. Poultry sellers such as Chop Eng Huat at 216 Bedok North wet market sold out by 9am on Wednesday. It typically sells out only at noon. ""I was very busy today. I have not even had a sip of water,"" said Madam Tan Mei Inn, 50, who runs the stall. She said her customers bought twice or even thrice as much chicken today, with some purchasing three to four chickens at one go. ""I had one customer who bought almost $300 worth of chicken and chicken parts... Usually customers don't buy that much at one go,"" she said. Business increased by about 50 per cent at 89 Kampong Chicken and Duck stall, also at the same wet market, which sold out by 9.30am. Stall owner Yeow Wei Min, 61, said he is not raising prices as his supplier has not increased prices yet. ""However, I have let my old customers reserve chickens for the next day,"" said Mr Yeow, who added that some customers were already buying three times as much as they usually buy. Most wet market poultry stall owners The Straits Times spoke to are not planning to restrict how many chickens each customer can buy yet. ""There is no limit to how much one customer can buy, but if a customer orders too many at a time from my stock, I'll (step in) to regulate,"" said Mr Vincent Liow, 47, owner of Ken & Vin Fresh Poultry in Ghim Moh. Fresh chicken was also sold out at most supermarkets that ST visited on Wednesday morning. Several Sheng Siong, FairPrice and Giant outlets in the Bedok area ran out of fresh chicken by 9am, with only frozen chicken items left. When ST visited Giant in Simpang Bedok at around 11.30am, there were only a few boxes of chicken parts such as feet, mid-joints and bones left. Fresh whole chicken had sold out by 8am, according to staff. However, shelves were fully stocked with fresh chicken at CS Fresh by Cold Storage at Great World City. ST has reached out to the supermarkets for comment on the extent of the surge in demand for fresh chicken. Consumers who had missed the early rush for chickens at wet markets and supermarkets did not seem fazed by the lack of them on shelves. But they anticipate that the price of frozen chicken will rise in the coming weeks. ""If there was stock, I would have probably bought one or two more chickens,"" said Ms Nicole Chia, 46, a salesperson shopping at FairPrice in Bedok Central. ""I was not surprised when I saw that fresh chicken was sold out... but I am not too worried as I can turn to frozen chicken or other types of meat."" Housewife Chen Yu Hsing, 45, who was at Tiong Bahru Market, said: ""I guess everyone now is a bit 'kancheong' (Cantonese for 'overly anxious'), and they want to get their hands on chicken before the price goes up, or they're scared it will run out because other people are also rushing to buy it."" All three poultry stalls at the market had shut by 11am when ST visited. ""I can still buy frozen chicken, so I'm not that worried about it,"" said Ms Chen. ""I just hope the price increase for that is not that bad, though I'm sure it will increase too."" Similarly, Mr Lim Hong Yi, 70, a retired store manager, is in no rush to stock up. He said: ""Chicken, especially the type you buy in wet markets, is bought because you want to eat it fresh... If you buy so much now, what's the point? If you put it in your freezer, you might as well buy frozen chicken, because you can't eat three chickens in one day."" He added: ""I won't panic buy. It's not like the last time, where people panic bought toilet paper... At least you can keep toilet paper for a long time, but the chicken you panic buy now will not be fresh when you want to eat it."" Poultry suppliers are also working around the clock to fulfil orders. In a Facebook post on Wednesday, major poultry producer Kee Song Group said it is rushing to fulfil orders in the light of high demand. The company, which has several chicken farms, said its website is experiencing an extremely high volume of traffic. Besides rearing chickens, it also handles the processing, packaging and distribution of fresh chilled and frozen poultry. The Facebook post added: ""Our entire company is on 24 hours' shift to raise our production volume in the coming days to meet our customers' demand."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/singapore-tourism-awards-celebrates-resilience-and-innovation-during-covid-19-pandemic,Light show on Sultan Mosque proves winning formula for Kampong Gelam,"SINGAPORE - The once-vibrant area of Kampong Gelam turned quiet two years ago when the Covid-19 pandemic began, hurting businesses there. In an attempt to bring footfall back to the historic area, the business association for the precinct, One Kampong Gelam, held a light projection show for the first time in April last year, with the Sultan Mosque as the canvas. The five-minute display, which ran twice a day for a month, drew more than 100,000 visitors to the area. As a result, the surrounding shops and eateries enjoyed a 40 per cent increase in sales during the campaign. For its efforts, the association was given the Special Recognition Award at the Singapore Tourism Awards 2022 on Tuesday (May 24). Organised by the Singapore Tourism Board, the award ceremony held at Shangri-La Hotel recognises the resilience and innovation of organisations and individuals in the tourism sector. Projecting a light show onto the mosque's facade was not easy as the organisers had to erect a four-storey-high scaffold that could support four 25kg projectors in a small space opposite the mosque. ""Pre-Covid-19, it was very vibrant and the place was always full house. We wanted to create opportunities for people to visit again. ""At the same time, we wanted to use this chance to educate visitors on what Kampong Gelam is about,"" said the association's spokesman. That same month, the association also turned some of the 5m-high metal hoardings lining Bali Lane and Ophir Road into a 230m-long graffiti wall to attract visitors after businesses expressed concern that people would be put off by construction work and the ensuing noise in the area. The hoardings had gone up around February last year for the construction of the North-South Corridor, a transport route slated for completion in 2027. Efforts of industry players helped to keep tourism offerings in Singapore safe and vibrant, said Minister of State for Trade and Industry, Mr Alvin Tan, who was present at the awards ceremony. ""For anybody in the hospitality and tourism sector, it was in your DNA to be open, to be hospitable, and to welcome people. ""But for two years, you've had to go against that... We've had to close up, (keep a safe) social distance, and do things very differently,"" said Mr Tan, adding that the pandemic has been incredibly difficult for the industry. STB chief executive Keith Tan said the board received 427 nominations for its awards this year. There were 81 finalists across the 24 award categories. One of the finalists for the Outstanding Attraction Experience category was SkyHelix Sentosa, an open-air panoramic ride that opened in December. Mr Buhdy Bok, managing director of Mount Faber Leisure Group, which operates the ride, said being shortlisted for the award within its first year of operations comes as an incredible honour. ""Despite the pandemic, we overcame the odds and opened the attraction ahead of schedule for visitors to experience during the year-end holidays,"" he said, adding that the response from the local crowd has been positive, with seats being sold out in its first month of operations. The attraction has also seen an uptick in international tourists since April."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/spore-eateries-scramble-to-find-other-fresh-chicken-sources-ahead-of-malaysias-export-halt,S'pore eateries scramble to find other fresh chicken sources ahead of Malaysia's export halt,"SINGAPORE - With a week to go before Malaysia's export ban on chickens kicks in on June 1, eateries here are scrambling and working with suppliers to find alternative sources of fresh chicken. On Monday (May 23), Malaysian Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced that his country will halt the export of up to 3.6 million chickens a month from June 1, until domestic prices and production stabilise. Eateries like Taiwanese fried chicken chain Monga said Malaysia's decision will hit their business hard. The chain, which has three outlets here, gets its chicken solely from Malaysia. ""The F&B (food and beverage) industry has already taken a bad hit from Covid-19 and things have only started getting better for us recently... The ban is both untimely and brutal,"" said Mr Lem Cheong, director of operations at Baoshi F&B Management, which owns the Monga chain here. The price increase in chicken was immediate, with its supplier saying that the price will go up by $1.20 per kg as of Tuesday. ""We are keeping our fingers crossed about the price hike after the ban kicks in (on June 1), but we are expecting prices to triple,"" said Mr Cheong, who added that his company is actively sourcing for alternatives. According to the Singapore Food Agency (SFA), about one-third of Singapore's chicken supply is imported from Malaysia. Other major sources include Brazil and the United States. SFA said on Monday it will work with stakeholders to activate supply chains to increase imports of chilled and frozen chickens from alternative sources, or draw from poultry stocks. Both restaurants and hawkers The Straits Times spoke to said getting fresh chickens will be an issue, but frozen chickens should still be available. Veteran chef Damian D'Silva, who runs multicultural, heritage cuisine restaurant Rempapa in Paya Lebar, said: ""Our supplier has indicated that it has already started sourcing from other countries, but even then, fresh chicken will be a problem because of transportation."" His menu includes several signature dishes that use fresh chicken from Johor, including nasi lemak, chicken curry and debal chicken. As for how this will affect taste, he added: ""I think we all know the difference between fresh and frozen (chicken), and we just have to lower our expectations till things improve."" Several hawkers at 84 Marine Parade Central Market and Food Centre said they will not be affected by the ban as they use frozen chicken. One of them is Mr Stan T, 55, who runs curry chicken stall Tip Top Simply Curry. He said there is a possibility that the price of frozen chicken will also increase, but he will try his best not to pass that on to his customers. D'Authentic Nasi Lemak uses frozen chicken bought from NTUC FairPrice. Stall owner Sulaiman Abu, 62, said: ""Overall, I don't think my business will decrease by much... even if I cannot sell chicken. My stall sells other things as well. Others are not as confident about business prospects in the coming months. Ms Jane Yeo, who runs chicken rice stall Yi Lu Fa - which opened only a month ago - expects business to drop by 70 to 80 per cent. All of the stall's chicken comes from Malaysia. ""When I first heard the news, I was stunned, and thought to myself, 'What should I do?' And I felt like crying,"" said Ms Yeo, who is in her 40s. ""We will not close as we also sell roasted pork, but the chicken is the main star. The rest are just supporting characters. ""I really hope that the Government can step in to help us because there is very little we can do."" Big name brands are also assessing their options after the sudden announcement by the Malaysian government. In response to queries from ST, chicken-centric fast-food chain KFC said it works with a diverse group of suppliers, and a portion of its chicken is from Malaysia. ""Since the latest news about Malaysia's decision to halt exports of chicken, we are still assessing the impact of the situation. Our team is working closely with our suppliers to continue serving chicken to our fans in Singapore,"" said its spokesman. McDonald's, which has several chicken dishes on its menu, declined comment. However, smaller players like home-based business Naked Chicken, which sells home-style fried chicken in limited quantities every week, is choosing to shut down for now. In an Instagram post on Monday, it said it will cease operations indefinitely from May 30 as a direct result of the temporary Malaysian export ban. The eatery's chickens, which come from its founders' family business Toh Thye San Farm, are GG French poulet - a high-quality breed from France, and are raised hormone-free, antibiotic-free and cage-free in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. Consumers ST spoke to are resigned to the fact that the cost of living is going up. ""Even if I wanted to stop eating chicken due to the high price, wouldn't everything else also be expensive?"" asked Ms Gloria Cheong, 69, a retired accountant. ""It feels like there's no alternative because everything is expensive and (prices are) increasing. So it's not like we can make major changes in our lifestyle in order to escape the high price... I can say I want to change to other meats, but the other meats will also be pricey."" Financial manager Jesslyn Lee, 42, who has a family of four, said that while the price of chicken is increasing, it is not yet impacting her lifestyle much. ""Maybe when it hits $6 for a regular plate of chicken rice, or over $15 for a whole spring chicken, I might start reconsidering (it as a staple in my family's diet)... For now, I guess it's okay,"" she added."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/some-poultry-sellers-may-shut-stalls-when-chicken-exports-halt-from-malaysia-price-hike-expected,"Some poultry sellers may shut stalls when chicken exports halt from Malaysia, price hike expected","SINGAPORE - Some poultry sellers here said they may have to shut their stalls temporarily when Malaysia halts its exports of chickens in June, while others expect a price hike of about 10 to 30 per cent. Meanwhile, consumers The Straits Times spoke to said they are not worried and will turn to other meats or buy frozen chicken from other countries. Malaysia announced on Monday (May 23) that the country intends to stop exporting chickens in June. Poultry sellers at Bedok North Market and Food Centre, Tiong Bahru Market and Geylang Serai Market told ST on Tuesday morning that the move will heavily impact their business. These are stall operators who mainly get their chicken supply from across the Causeway. Singapore imported about 34 per cent, or close to 73,000 tonnes, of its chicken supply from Malaysia in 2021. Mr Yeow Wei Min, 61, who runs a chicken stall at 216 Bedok North Market and Food Centre, said the impending halt of chicken exports from Malaysia will be disastrous for his business. All of his fresh chicken supply comes from Malaysia. He said: ""There is nothing I can do about it, nor do I have any alternatives. If there is no supply then I will temporarily close my stall and take a rest. If this persists in the long term then I will close down this stall."" Mr Stanley Yow, 52, owner of Stanley Fresh Chicken at Tiong Bahru Market, said: ""If they have 10 chickens, I'll sell 10. If they have 100, I'll sell 100. If they have no chickens, I'll just rest."" Mr Fabian Lim, 62, who works at a poultry stall at Geylang Serai Market, said prices will spike by about 20 to 30 per cent as the stall's fresh chicken is mainly from Malaysia. ""I have no choice but to increase prices, if we buy high than we have to sell high. All I hope for is that imports from other countries like China or Indonesia will increase and balance out the shortage,"" he said. Mr Husni Hashim, 56, who sells poultry at another stall at Geylang Serai Market, said he plans to increase prices for his frozen chicken. He said: ""I will see what happens before deciding the price increase. If customers really want to eat chicken, they have to buy frozen chicken, they have no choice."" Mr Vincent Liow, 47, owner of Ken & Vin Fresh Poultry at Ghim Moh Market, said he will have to increase prices if suppliers raise the cost. All of his fresh chicken is sourced from Malaysia. ""Maybe we temporarily will go for frozen chickens until the export situation improves,"" he said. But not all stall holders are concerned. Mr Hashim Abbas, 73, who runs a poultry stall at Geylang Serai Market, said he is not worried about Malaysia's decision to halt exports of chicken as he believes it will not last long. All of his fresh chicken is from Malaysia, but his stall also sells frozen chicken from various countries including Brazil, Australia and Denmark. ""If Singaporeans cannot buy fresh chicken then there are other alternatives they can opt for like frozen chicken or other types of meat. I trust that the Government will be able to manage prices and supply."" In a report by The Straits Times on Monday, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) said that importers will activate their supply chains to increase imports of chilled chicken from alternative sources, increase the import of frozen chicken from existing suppliers outside of Malaysia, or draw from their stocks of poultry. President of the Consumers Association of Singapore (Case) Melvin Yong said in a Facebook post on Tuesday that the sudden announcement by Malaysia is likely to have an adverse impact on the prices of chicken and related products in Singapore. He encouraged consumers to consider alternative sources of chicken and meat products and frozen options. He said: ""Case understands that SFA is monitoring the situation very closely with relevant stakeholders to minimise the impact of Malaysia's move on our chicken supply."" He added that consumers should also buy what they need, and not buy excessively. Online grocer RedMart and DFI Retail Group, which owns supermarkets Cold Storage and Giant, echoed the call for consumers not to panic buy.  Head of RedMart and Grocery at Lazada Singapore Jolin Huang said: “RedMart has a robust and diverse supply chain, and we import chicken from other countries including New Zealand and Brazil. In the light of the announcement by Malaysia, we will work with our suppliers from other countries to increase their volume and will closely monitor the situation.” A DFI Retail Group spokesman said: “We are currently in discussions with non-Malaysian suppliers to increase imports of chilled poultry as well as other meats to offer more alternatives to consumers.” Chicken suppliers noted that prices for poultry have been fluctuating for the past year due to the pandemic and higher operating costs.  Mr James Sim, head of business development at chicken importer Kee Song Food Corporation, said that rising inflation also impacts retail prices. While Mr Sim could not comment on how much chicken prices might increase due to Malaysia’s decision, he said the company will continue to monitor the market and adjust prices accordingly. The company, which works mainly with farms in Malaysia, has already had to increase prices a few times.  He said: “We do keep our consumers in mind when considering any price increase. We also encourage consumers not to panic buy as there will be enough stock for all.” He added that besides fresh chicken, consumers can also opt for chilled or frozen poultry products.  Consumers who regularly eat chicken said that they are willing to eat other meats such as fish or mutton and will likely still continue to buy chicken if prices are not too steep. Madam Olivia Ong, 73, a retired power supply clerk, said that although she buys chicken every week, she is willing to replace it with other types of meat if fresh chicken is not available. She said: ""I will just eat less chicken. I am not alarmed by the news and I won't start panic buying because of it."" Financial adviser and father-of-two Lee Wei Ming, 39, said that although his family eats chicken every week, they are also open to alternatives. He said: ""Whether or not we'll buy less chicken depends on how much prices increase. Chicken is the most common meat, but as consumers, we always have a choice to eat other meats."" Business owner and beauty therapist Cecilia Westberry, 59, who regularly shops at Ghim Moh market, said she has noticed prices creeping up for many food items in the past months. ""I think we should be careful not to waste food. Even if the chicken farms don't increase prices much, the retailers will, due to the rising costs of logistics and other operations."" She said she is not worried about a possible price hike for chicken. ""I will keep buying chicken, as my family likes to eat it."""

It is part of efforts by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) to bring visitors back to the Republic, as well as promote its tourism, food and cultural offerings to a younger audience. The animated music video called Sing, Sing, Singapore released on Monday (May 23) is the result of a tie-up between STB and Seoul-based entertainment firm The Pinkfong Company, which is behind YouTube phenomenon Baby Shark. In the 21/2-minute video, STB's Merlion mascot Merli guides characters Pinkfong and Baby Shark around Singapore landmarks. The new song also borrows from the viral hit song Baby Shark, changing the lyrics to mention landmarks such as Sentosa and the Night Safari. After two years of pandemic restrictions crippling tourism and visitor numbers, Sing, Sing, Singapore is part of STB's ongoing SingapoReimagine campaign to revitalise the tourism industry. The Pinkfong Company also announced that it will be expanding its partnership with STB, rolling out a series of marketing activities that will help attract families with young children to Singapore. Said Mr Ryan Seungkyu Lee, executive vice-president of The Pinkfong Company: ""Travel offers incomparable education for children, helping them truly interact with different cultures and others' lives. We will continue to seek opportunities where we can connect people around the world through our joyful content."" Ms Angeline Tang, area director for Korea at STB, said: ""Singapore is ready to welcome visitors from Korea, both young and old."" Pinkfong's line-up of characters last featured in a local collaboration in a music video made with national water agency PUB. Released in January last year, Turn Off The Tap was about teaching children the importance of saving water, and featured PUB mascots Water Wally and Sally alongside the Baby Shark family."

Food prices around the world have risen following the Covid-19 pandemic, which started in 2020, supply chain disruptions, and increasing energy prices."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/energy-market-authority-seeks-to-issue-two-additional-lng-import-licences,Energy Market Authority seeks to issue two additional LNG import licences,"SINGAPORE - Singapore is seeking to appoint two additional liquefied natural gas (LNG) importers to add to the four already supplying the city-state, in a bid to boost energy security amid surging global energy prices. The Energy Market Authority (EMA), which issues licences for importers, said on Thursday (May 19) that it has started the process to invite companies to submit their proposals to supply Singapore with the fuel. These submissions will be evaluated based on the ability of potential suppliers to provide reliable, secure and competitive supply of LNG to Singapore. Proposals must be submitted by July 8. The EMA said that the move will enhance competition and provide more options for gas buyers. The new entrants will join Pavilion Energy Singapore, Shell Eastern Trading, ExxonMobil LNG Asia-Pacific and Sembcorp Fuels (Singapore) as importers. The country's plans to import more LNG come as no surprise as contracts for piped natural gas from Indonesia are due to expire before the end of the decade. “The additional import licences will look to ensure energy security and competitive consumer pricing. It will also help to develop Singapore as a trading hub and support the growth of other LNG-related services like bunkering,” said Singapore-based Hengky, a senior LNG analyst at Refinitiv, a unit of the London Stock Exchange Group. He is Indonesian and has a one-word name. Singapore aims to position itself as an LNG trading hub for Asia as it seeks to capitalise on an expected rise in imports in the region, driven by depleting gas production and growing electricity demand. In a recent interview with The Straits Times, Mr Bas Verkooijen, chief executive of German storage operator Oiltanking’s new subsidiary Advario, said the company is mulling over plans to develop an LNG terminal in Singapore. Natural gas is used to produce around 95 per cent of the Republic’s electricity, and will continue to be a dominant fuel for the country’s electricity generation, EMA said.  Analysts say the decision to try and lock in long-term supply will help provide some level of price certainty in a whipsawing market. “What’s worse than high energy prices is uncertain energy prices. And in this situation, it’s fairly reasonable to assume that prices won’t come down quickly,” said Mr David Broadstock, senior research fellow and head of the energy economics division at the National University of Singapore’s Energy Studies Institute. “Everyone’s trying to rush to get the natural gas, and Singapore’s move at this point is understandable. Strategically, it’s a clever move.” The invasion of Ukraine by Russia, Europe’s top gas supplier, has prompted the European Union to rethink its energy policies amid sharpened concerns of supply shocks.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/from-expansion-to-green-set-ups-food-services-industry-roadmap-helps-spore-firms-chart-growth,"From expansion to green set-ups, food services industry road map helps S'pore firms chart growth","SINGAPORE - From automation to going green to job redesign and expanding overseas, several Singapore-based companies have kick-started plans to transform their businesses in alignment with the Food Services Industry Transformation Map 2025 announced by Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong on Thursday (May 19). These firms have also embraced strategies, which include digitalisation and automation, set out in the 2016 version of the road map when it was launched. Mr Bean, which sells soya-based products, will be setting up a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility by 2025 to support its expansion plans. The Senoko set-up will be a green facility geared towards sustainability efforts, such as soya-waste treatment and wastewater recycling. Enterprise Singapore is working closely with Mr Bean to see how the facility can be supported. The company is also looking to launch a new app in the fourth quarter of this year that includes functions for customers to pre-order and pick up their products. The app will incorporate a loyalty programme, where customers can accumulate points and redeem them. Going digital will also allow the firm to gain insights into customer profiles and better target its marketing. Investment firm Commonwealth Capital, whose food and beverage (F&B) portfolio includes brands such as Pastamania, Swissbake and The Soup Spoon, operates an integrated food manufacturing and logistics set-up that includes a central bakery, meat processing facility and central kitchen. Through its subsidiary, Zac Meat, the company has automated the processing and marination of meat, which is then supplied to brands under its portfolio, as well as to local and international F&B chains. Zac Meat is also working closely with the Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre led by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research, to adopt robotic solutions in order to save on manpower costs. Major food service operator Select Group, which has more than 100 F&B outlets in Singapore and overseas, including brands such as Chinese restaurant Peach Garden and themed foodcourt Singapore Food Street, worked to develop a line of ready-to-eat products under its Taste Asia line. The meals, developed through its subsidiary RM Food Manufacturing, have a shelf life of up to a year. Since 2019, Select's revenue for its Taste Asia line has seen a year-on-year growth of about 20 per cent over the last two years. RM Food plans to export the meals to new overseas markets in the Asia-Pacific region, Australia, Europe and the Middle East. Katrina Group, which owns and operates 35 restaurants in Singapore under eight different F&B brands such as Bali Thai and So Pho, tapped the Career Conversion Programme for Food Services Assistants to redesign jobs. The company is upskilling 18 servers in areas such as digitalisation, customer service and food preparation, following the implementation of a digital ordering system in November 2021 that reduced the need for servers to manually take orders. Healthy food chain SaladStop opened its first cloud kitchen in Katong in 2020 to fulfil delivery orders and has expanded regionally to Indonesia. Cloud kitchens are typically set up for the purpose of preparing food for only delivery or takeout.  It has 25 physical outlets and seven cloud kitchens in Indonesia, and intends to open 10 more cloud kitchens there in the next two years. Traditional mixed rice stall operator Chang Cheng Group invested in an automated central kitchen in 2017. The kitchen is now responsible for supplying close to 160 food stalls in about 25 coffee shops. It has also allowed the group to save an estimated 1,100 man hours a day, leading to a 13 per cent savings in business costs and a 60 per cent improvement in productivity. French Food Factory, which started in 2007 as a cafe operator of the brand name Saybons, embarked on a project to expand its ready-to-eat product range and extend the shelf life of its products to more than 14 days. Its ready-to-eat product sales increased by close to five times last year. The company also plans to expand its business beyond Singapore."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/refreshed-road-map-to-help-battered-food-services-industry-recover-from-pandemic,Refreshed road map to help food services industry recover from pandemic,"SINGAPORE - Getting food businesses to find new revenue streams and grooming home-grown brands that can go regional will be among the targets that a refreshed road map for the food services scene aims to achieve in the coming years. The Food Services Industry Transformation Map 2025 was announced by Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong on Thursday morning (May 19) at Restaurant Asia 2022, a three-day food and beverage symposium and trade show at Sands Expo and Convention Centre. ""As we emerge from the pandemic, it is critical for the food services sector to reposition itself to seize new opportunities, and adopt solutions to future-proof operations,"" said Mr Gan on Thursday, the first day of the event. Put together in partnership with the industry, unions and other government agencies, the Industry Transformation Map (ITM), launched in 2016, had focused largely on digitalisation and the adoption of manpower-lean business formats and technology to improve productivity and reduce reliance on manpower. The 2025 refreshed road map focuses on helping businesses in the sector innovate, expand and reposition themselves to tap emerging consumer trends, as well as build a local talent pool for new job roles in the sector. Over the past two years, the food services sector has battled waves of disruptions due to Covid-19, and despite that, many have continued to press on, and transform their operations, noted Mr Gan. Many have also joined food delivery platforms, adopted digital and automation solutions, and diversified into new revenue streams. The food services industry contributed $4 billion to Singapore's economy and employed about 220,300 workers in 2021, according to data from Enterprise Singapore (Enterprise SG). Now, the refreshed industry transformation map has plans to foster an innovative and resilient food services sector with a bedrock of home-grown regional brands. Mr Gan said: ""The Food Services ITM 2025 will focus on catalysing innovation among enterprises to create new revenue streams, and empower ready and able food services companies to internationalise and capture new growth."" He added: ""We will also press on with efforts on the productivity, jobs and skills front."" The minister outlined four major strategies the road map will adopt. The first thrust involves helping companies adopt bite-size and cost-effective digital and automation solutions to drive growth. ""With increasing competitive pressures and shifting consumer preferences, food services companies must continually transform and explore new operating models,"" Mr Gan said. As companies grow in scale, they will be encouraged to leverage data to improve operations and customer engagement, said Enterprise SG. The refreshed road map has an updated Food Services Industry Digital Plan, which will be launched later this year, to guide companies in using advanced technologies. It will also help small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry to use tools such as those for data protection and cyber security to safeguard their businesses. The second thrust involves catalysing innovation to drive new revenue streams and to tap consumer trends which are moving towards convenience, health and wellness, and sustainability. Mr Gan cited companies that produced and commercialised ready-to-eat meals. These efforts paid off and helped them remain resilient to demand shocks, especially during the circuit breaker when dining in eateries was restricted, he said. With sustainability emerging as a rising global trend, he added that it is pertinent for businesses to incorporate sustainability practices into their operating models. Companies can hence tap Enterprise SG's Enterprise Sustainability Programme to develop capabilities in this area. Enterprise SG said the ITM will guide food services companies to improve their green branding to address the environmentally conscious consumer. It will support them in adopting sustainable solutions or incorporating sustainability practices in their operations, such as in food waste management. The third thrust involves helping home-grown firms seize opportunities to expand globally as borders gradually reopen. A curated market accelerator programme will be rolled out in the third quarter of this year to support companies in the sector making forays into new markets. The programme will create a network for the sharing of knowledge and connect companies to potential partners, said Enterprise SG. ""For companies with existing overseas footprints, we will help them to strengthen their in-market networks and insights,"" said Mr Gan. Support will also be given to companies that are looking into complementary operating models, such as cloud kitchens, so businesses can leverage the shift in consumer acceptance of food delivery during the pandemic. Cloud kitchens are typically set up for the purpose of preparing food for only delivery or takeout. Enterprise SG will help companies with retail food products increase exports through partnerships with regional e-commerce platforms. These can serve as a market test bed before physical outlets are set up. The fourth thrust under the ITM will map out strategies to lift wages, particularly among lower wage roles; reduce reliance on foreign workers; and create more quality jobs for locals. Mr Gan acknowledged the increasing competition for manpower across all sectors. He said: ""It is therefore important for companies, as part of business transformation, to also invest in human capital and create quality jobs for locals. This will ensure that there is a pipeline of talent to support the sector's growth."" With new operating models and new ways of doing business in the sector, he said there will be exciting job opportunities, such as new roles, including digital marketing specialists and data analysts. ""To support the growing demand for these emerging job roles and skills, the Government will work with food services companies to develop and implement talent development programmes to groom locals to take on these jobs,"" he said. Enterprise SG added that it will boost the local training ecosystem by nurturing partnerships between firms and training institutions, as well as via new career conversion programmes to support the training and placement of local workers. ""It is timely to refresh the Food Services ITM, since its launch in 2016, to better align with the needs of the industry amid these changes, so that Singapore can continue to develop a lively and innovative food services industry and provide good careers for locals,"" said Mr Andrew Kwan, president of the Restaurant Association of Singapore, which organised Restaurant Asia with Conference and Exhibition Management Services. He noted that the pandemic provided a jump start to the industry’s adoption of the strategies in the ITM. For instance, F&B operators turned to contactless ordering and other digital solutions during the pandemic.  There were more than 7,000 applications for the Productivity Solutions Grants for IT solutions and equipment over the past 24 months. The figure is more than five times the number of applications in 2018 and 2019. Assistant chief executive of Enterprise SG  for lifestyle and consumer, food and agritech, Ms Dilys Boey, said: ""We want to help food services companies capture the strong consumer demand locally and in the region, brought on by changing consumption patterns and trends in areas such as wellness and sustainability. ""To succeed in this highly competitive industry, we encourage companies to be bold and innovative in exploring new concepts and business formats."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/travel-agencies-in-spore-see-surge-in-enquiries-after-the-announcement-of-japan-tourism-trial,Travel agencies in S'pore see surge in inquiries after announcement of Japan tourism trial,"SINGAPORE - Travel agencies are seeing a surge in inquiries even as some await more details, such as the number of people allowed in each tour group, after the Japan Tourism Agency announced Singapore is one of four countries from which travellers can enter the country on package tours on a trial basis. Since the announcement on Tuesday (May 17), CTC Travel has received over 20 inquiries about travel to Japan. Most were about year-end travel. Japan has always ranked among the top three travel destinations for Singaporeans, said Ms Kelly Toh, marketing manager of CTC Travel. She said: ""We have been telling our customers to wait a while and we will update them once we have more details."" Under the trial, predetermined itineraries for package tours must be approved by the government, with visitors accompanied by a tour guide at all times. Mr Jeremiah Wong, senior marketing communications manager of Chan Brothers Travel, said that inquiries and interest on Japan tours have been streaming in exponentially with the announcement. The travel agency will be launching a small group tour series with fixed itineraries by this week. The group size will be capped at nine travellers and is expected to depart from end June or early July. Mr Hor Xinrong, a 38-year-old private tutor, said it was prudent of the Japanese government to open up to tourism in a measured manner. Mr Lee Kwok Onn, 36, however, is not rushing to book a trip as he feels that the Japanese government is not ready to fully reopen its borders. The designer, who would rather not go on a package tour, said: ""I enjoy having that freedom of movement, without having to follow a strictly planned travel itinerary."" In response to media queries, a spokesman for Japan Airlines said it welcomed this initiative as leading to the revitalisation of the local economy."
