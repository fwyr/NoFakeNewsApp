As always, the PTC - a fare review body appointed by the Transport Ministry - says it will strike a balance between fare affordability and the financial sustainability of transport operators."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/tel-stage-3-on-track-to-open-by-end-of-year-smrt-to-carry-out-testing,11 new Thomson-East Coast Line MRT stations on track to open by end of year,"SINGAPORE - All civil and structural works as well as systems integration and testing activities for the third stage of the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) have been completed, with 11 new stations set to open by the end of this year. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) said it handed over the 11 stations to SMRT on Wednesday (Aug 17) for the rail operator to carry out further operational testing, including on the signalling system, over the next few months in preparation for the opening. In March, Transport Minister S. Iswaran said that the 11 new TEL stations, running from Stevens through Orchard and Outram Park to Gardens by the Bay, would begin operating in the second half of 2022. In response to media queries, LTA said the systems used for TEL stage 3 are rigorously tested to ensure they do not affect the safety and operations of existing MRT systems. Initial testing of the signalling system was done on separate test servers that were segregated from the operational servers used for TEL stages 1 and 2, LTA added. Integration testing was then carried out during engineering hours before the signalling software supplied by French train manufacturer Alstom was integrated into the operational servers for TEL stages 1 to 3. Between Feb 26 and May 29, train services on the TEL started later on weekends to carve out additional engineering hours for these tests. Singapore’s sixth and newest rail line, which currently spans nine stations, has been beset by faults in recent months. LTA on Wednesday shed more light on these disruptions. On April 27, 50 commuters were stuck in a stalled train between Woodlands and Woodlands South stations for more than 1½ hours due to a train fault that morning. This was caused by a cable with damaged insulation on the train, LTA said, adding that checks on the TEL train fleet found that this was an isolated incident. On May 19, a signal fault caused trains to move more slowly in both directions across the entire TEL resulting in an additional 10 minutes of waiting time. This was caused by network issues that occurred after server hard disks in the TEL’s operation control centre were reinstalled following signalling tests. The issues have since been rectified, LTA said. Finally, on July 6, a signal fault led to a 3½-hour disruption in train services along the entire line, leaving commuters stuck on six stalled trains for at least 40 minutes. The Straits Times understands this was due to testing for TEL stage 3. The first stage of the TEL between Woodlands North and Woodlands South stations opened in January 2020, with the second stage - comprising six stations between Springleaf and Caldecott - opening in August last year. TEL stage 3 has 13 stations, but Mount Pleasant and Marina South stations will remain closed until housing developments around them are ready. The last two stages of the TEL, stage 4 and stage 5, comprise a total of 10 stations from Founder’s Memorial to Sungei Bedok. They are expected to open around 2024 and 2025, aside from Founder’s Memorial station which will open in tandem with the actual memorial in 2027. When the TEL is fully completed, more than 240,000 households will be within a 10-minute walk from a TEL station. It will also help to relieve crowding on the East-West and North-South Lines. For Mr Mohammed Sabir Ansari, 27, who lives in Shenton Way, the opening of TEL stage 3 will give him a public transport option that is less than a minute’s walk from his home. “I’m unbelievably excited,” said the business development director, adding he will likely use the TEL three to four times a week to go to Great World City and Orchard Road in future."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/coe-premiums-rise-in-all-categories-except-open,COE premiums rise in all categories except Open; new record in Cat B ,"SINGAPORE - Certificate of entitlement (COE) premiums for larger and more powerful cars reached a new record as prices for most categories rose on Wednesday (Aug 17). Only the Open category saw a dip. The premium for cars with engines larger than 1,600cc or 130bhp, as well as electric vehicles (EVs) with more power than 110 kilowatts went up by 4.7 per cent from $107,001 to $112,001, breaking the record of $110,003 set on July 20.  The price of COEs for smaller and less powerful cars and EVs ended 9.9 per cent higher at $87,889, up from $80,000. Commercial vehicle COE premiums rose by 5.4 per cent from $56,089 to $59,090. The price of motorcycle COEs increased by 0.9 per cent, from $11,000 to $11,101. Open category COEs, which can be used to register any type of vehicles other than motorcycles, ended slightly cheaper at $112,001, representing a dip of 0.9 per cent from $113,000. The premium is still hovering near the all-time high of $114,001. Motor traders said the results were largely expected, as there has been talk of strong sales over the last weekend, both from brands that participated in the Cars@Expo event, as well as other dealers that benefited from the buzz surrounding the trade show. There were more bids at this tender compared with the previous one, reflecting the stronger sales performance. For instance, Category A had 835 bids, up from 689. The price rally for smaller car COEs also started earlier than usual. The premium was already at $80,001 with more than 30 minutes to go before the exercise closed, which gave more time for prices to climb further. In contrast, the premium for Open category COE, which rose very quickly at the last exercise, trailed behind the COE price for larger cars.  Mr Raymond Tang, honorary secretary of the Singapore Vehicle Traders Association said these are “signs of a healthier market situation” as it means that dealers have actual orders to fulfil, as opposed to chasing after Open category COEs in anticipation of future orders. He reckons that consumers who really need a car may be coming to terms with the higher COE premiums, and thus are starting to come into the market for both new and used cars.  Mr Ng Choon Wee, group commercial director at Komoco Motors, said the large number of unsuccessful bids would roll over into subsequent tenders, meaning that premiums would not come down as dealers have to deliver the cars.  The next tender exercise in September is three weeks away, one more than the usual two-week interval. The longer gap has typically led to higher premiums, as dealers have more time to collect orders. Mr Nicholas Wong, Kah Motor’s general manager, said that under the current situation where the supply of COE is so low, motor dealers are faced with either “bleeding to secure the COE or facing cars being stuck in storage""."

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/bus-and-train-fare-formula-to-be-reviewed-any-changes-will-be-applied-next-year,"Bus, train fare formula to be reviewed; any changes will be applied from 2023","SINGAPORE - The way that bus and train fares are calculated will be reviewed to account for changes in commuting patterns, and to balance fare affordability and the financial sustainability of the public transport sector. The Public Transport Council (PTC) said this on Monday (Aug 15) as it announced the start of its review process, aiming to complete it by the first half of next year. Any changes made to the public transport fare adjustment formula and mechanism will be applied from the fare review exercise in 2023 onwards, the PTC added. It will be consulting commuters, public transport operators, the labour movement and transport experts for the review. The current formula will remain for the upcoming fare review later this year. The formula puts a cap on how much public transport fares here can be adjusted each year. It comprises five component indicators that take into account core inflation, energy prices, wage increases, productivity and the network capacity of the public transport system. The formula is typically reviewed once every five years, said the PTC, which is led by Nominated MP Janet Ang, and comprises 16 other members from academic institutions, business, grassroots organisations, labour unions and professional services who are appointed by the Ministry of Transport (MOT). The last time there was a formula review, the network capacity factor (NCF) was introduced in 2018 to better reflect operating costs borne by public transport operators due to capacity adjustments - such as running more trains and buses over longer distances for less crowded and more convenient rides, for instance. The PTC on Monday laid out the terms of reference for its latest review. It will first look at the effectiveness of the current formula, in consideration of the changes in the public transport industry and commuting patterns. Last year, former PTC chairman Richard Magnus highlighted the growing phenomenon of people working from home, but said then that the long-term trend is still not clear. Due to Covid-19, public transport ridership in Singapore fell to as low as 25 per cent of pre-pandemic levels during the circuit breaker in April and May 2020. While numbers have since bounced back after pandemic restrictions were largely eased, they are still below pre-Covid-19 levels. The PTC said it will also propose ways to better balance keeping fares affordable with ensuring the financial sustainability of the public transport system. This issue came up in Parliament earlier this year during the debate on MOT's budget, when Transport Minister S. Iswaran and Workers' Party MP Jamus Lim engaged in a lengthy exchange over whether public transport could be made free for all seniors and people with disabilities. Mr Iswaran pointed out that the Government currently spends more than $2 billion annually in subsidies for public transport commuters - about $1 billion for bus operations and $1 billion for train ones. He also noted that shifting work and travel patterns, an ageing population and volatile energy prices will impact public transport over the next decade. In December last year, bus and train fares were raised by 2.2 per cent - or three to four cents for adults and one cent for seniors, students, people with disabilities and low-wage workers. This was because of a 4.4 per cent fare hike that was carried over from 2020. The maximum allowable adjustment last year was actually -2.2 per cent based on the current formula. The fare increase could have been much higher at 51.5 per cent had the PTC not excluded the NCF in the formula for 11 out of the 12 months in 2020 to account for the exceptionally sharp drop in ridership due to Covid-19. The PTC has said that it will continue to exclude this drop in ridership when calculating the NCF for this year's fare review. Singapore University of Social Sciences transport economist Walter Theseira said the PTC could consider during its review whether the NCF needs to be reworked and whether the fare formula could take into account more current indicators rather than those from previous year, especially in a time of rapid, transitory inflation. While the PTC is also looking at how to better balance the books, Associate Professor Theseira added that the question of whether there ought to be a deficit incurred for public transport, and how this deficit is shared between commuters and taxpayers, should be dealt with by the Government instead. “These are questions with no easy answers and the PTC is not equipped, nor has the mandate, to make these types of decisions,” he said."

Revenue rose by 6.7 per cent to $1.86 billion as world economies emerged from the Covid-19 pandemic. Operating expenses rose by 4.8 per cent to $1.68 billion. The Singapore-based global group said that with the exception of China, economic activity in all the countries it operates in picked up during the last six months. The sale of Alperton garage in Britain and government relief helped to bolster earnings. Earnings per share stood at 5.48 cents, up from 4.2 cents during the same time last year. Net asset backing per share stood at 125.26 cents, from 124.9 cents previously. Directors are recommending an interim dividend of 2.85 cents and a special dividend of 1.41 cents. ComfortDelGro chairman Lim Jit Poh said: ""The group is in a fortunate position to have a strong cash flow and be in a net cash position. As such, we do not have any problem funding our dividend payouts internally. ""With the exceptional gain from the sale of the Alperton property in London, we have decided to pass on the net gain from that sale to our shareholders. This is something we will continue to do going forward when we make extraordinary gains and have no urgent need of the proceeds."" The group’s public transport services division fared significantly better, with operating profit increasing by 48.8 per cent to $122.8 million. Its taxi business’ operating profit grew by 18.4 per cent to $21.2 million.  Its automotive engineering division, which includes fuel sales to cabbies, saw a 16.1 per cent decline in operating profit to $4.7 million. Its vehicle inspection business posted an 8.6 per cent rise in profit to $16.5 million, while its driving centre business had a 10.9 per cent dip in earnings to $9 million.  The group’s car rental division posted a profit of $1.7 million, unchanged from previously. But its bus station business incurred a loss of $300,000, from a profit of $1.6 million.  As at June 30, cash and equivalents stood at $970.5 million, from $892.8 million previously. The group said no provision for impairment was made for taxi vehicles, taxi licences, goodwill and investment in subsidiaries for the period. In its outlook, ComfortDelGro said there is “uncertainty over the effectiveness” of public transport fare formulas “in the long term should high energy prices persist”. In Singapore, it said its public transport business will be affected by an amendment to a reduction in the service fee payable by the Land Transport Authority on five bus contracts from Sept 1, 2022, as part of an agreement to move the Downtown MRT Line to a new financing framework. Rail ridership in Singapore, bus charter in Australia and coach services in Britain are continuing to recover, but taxi revenue in China will continue to be heavily impacted by the country’s zero-Covid-19 policy, it pointed out."

Earnings per share of the ComfortDelGro subsidiary rose by 9.5 per cent to 3.7 cents. Vicom chief executive Sim Wing Yew said: ""As Singapore emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic, demand for Vicom's services, especially in the non-vehicle testing segment, is improving. ""But growing inflationary pressures and the threat of recession loom near, and we are not out of the woods yet. We will thus continue to keep a tight lid on costs and adopt a cautionary stance in the immediate future.""

By Thursday morning (Aug 11), Shell, Sinopec and SPC had each reduced diesel prices by 11 cents a litre and petrol prices by nine cents a litre - mirroring Esso's move on Wednesday. Caltex was the last to match these price reductions, doing so at around 12.30pm. Separately, the so-called premium 98-octane is now 13 cents higher at Shell than it was two weeks ago when the company retailed this grade at the same price as its regular 98-octane fuel. According to Fuel Kaki, a petrol and diesel price tracker set up by the Consumers Association of Singapore, diesel now ranges between $2.80 (Sinopec, SPC) and $2.82 (Caltex, Shell). The 92-octane grade of petrol, which the majority of vehicles can use, is now $2.80 a litre across all brands, while the popular 95-octane is $2.84 at SPC and $2.85 elsewhere. The 98-octane grade is $3.34 at Shell, and $3.32 at Esso, Sinopec and SPC, while the premium 98-octane grade is between $3.45 (Sinopec) and $3.56 (Shell). After discount, the cheapest 92-octane fuels are from Caltex (OCBC 365 card) and Esso (DBS Esso card), at $2.30 a litre. The costliest 92-octane grade is from Esso (Citibank Cash Back card, other OCBC cards), at $2.41 a litre. Sinopec, which has only three stations here, offers the lowest price of $2.23 for 95-octane petrol (with OCBC cards). Among operators with sizeable networks, Caltex (OCBC 365 card) and Esso (DBS Esso card) offer the lowest rate of $2.34. For 98-octane petrol, Sinopec again has the lowest rate of $2.61 (OCBC cards), followed by $2.72 at Esso (DBS Esso card). The price cuts follow a continuing downward movement in the prices of crude oil and refined products. Rising inflation is putting a dent in demand on both automotive and non-automotive fronts around the world. Brent crude last closed on Nasdaq at US$96.31 a barrel, its lowest since February. RBOB Gasoline, a proxy for refined petrol, is hovering just above US$3 a gallon, its lowest since April."

These, however, are still below pre-pandemic levels. SBS Transit chief executive Cheng Siak Kian said: ""We are seeing a steady increase in rail ridership as more workers return to the workplace with the gradual easing of Covid-19 measures. ""However, it's still early days to say if ridership will recover to pre-Covid-19 levels due to hybrid work arrangements, and we are closely monitoring the situation.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/over-300000-travellers-crossed-msia-spore-land-border-daily-last-weekend,"More than 300,000 crossed Malaysia-S'pore land border daily last weekend","SINGAPORE - More than 300,000 travellers crossed the land border at Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints daily from last Friday (Aug 5) to Sunday, the highest recorded weekend travel volume since the land border reopened on April 1. Over the weekend, long queues formed on both sides of the Singapore and Malaysia border, with some travellers standing in line for more than three hours. In a photo posted on Facebook by radio DJs Justin Ang and Vernon A on Saturday afternoon, large crowds could be seen at the Bangunan Sultan Iskandar Customs, Immigration and Quarantine Complex in Johor Bahru. The pair, who co-host the Muttons In The Morning programme on Class95FM, said in an Instagram story that clearing Malaysian immigration and customs took them 3½ hours. When The Straits Times visited Woodlands Checkpoint on Sunday, most of the queues had subsided after travellers chose to take the train or cross the border at off-peak hours. Ms Michelle Lee, 40, was relieved to see shorter queues on her return to Singapore after she was stuck in a snaking queue at Woodlands Checkpoint on Friday at 6.25am. The Malaysian flight attendant said: ""Normally, there is no one there at this time. But there was a queue all the way until the bus stop outside. ""I only realised later when a friend told me it was because Singapore's National Day is on Tuesday so maybe people took the chance to go across for a short holiday before coming back to celebrate."" To avoid crowds on her return trip, Ms Lee made sure her bus commute would reach Woodlands Checkpoint by 5pm, an hour before the start of evening peak traffic. Mr Paul Lim, 27, a finance executive, also experienced a smooth clearance at Woodlands Checkpoint on Sunday evening. The Singaporean, who spent the weekend visiting KSL City Mall and nearby food places with some secondary school friends, said he had planned his itinerary based on his past experiences with traffic jams along the Causeway. Mr Lim said: ""We decided to go on Friday afternoon and took the train because usually those who finish work would drive in on Friday evening."" Meanwhile, the air checkpoints saw an average traveller volume of more than 78,000 a day between Friday and Sunday, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) said. ICA reminded all travellers, including fully vaccinated Singaporeans, arriving in Singapore via air or sea to submit the SG Arrival Card, which contains health declaration information, within three days before arrival. Only fully vaccinated Singaporeans, permanent residents and long-term pass holders entering Singapore via the land checkpoints in Woodlands and Tuas do not need to fill in the card. ICA said: ""This exemption from the SG Arrival Card was in view of the high volume of traffic and daily commuters at the land checkpoints, and the Covid-19 situation between Singapore and Malaysia was largely similar."" ""(The health declaration) remains an important way for us to detect upstream infectious diseases of concern that might be imported by travellers from a wide range of countries,"" the spokesman added, citing diseases such as Covid-19, yellow fever and Ebola. Mr Aaron Wong, 34, who runs travel website The MileLion, said that with travel restrictions to Singapore almost entirely lifted for fully vaccinated individuals, those travelling now may have subconsciously switched back to a pre-Covid-19 mindset, when entering Singapore was as simple as scanning their passport at the electronic gate. Mr Wong said: ""Prior to Covid-19, the arrival card was exclusively for foreign visitors, which might explain the unfamiliarity among Singaporeans. ""But filling up the health declaration is important because information such as the travellers' place of departure and their exposure to Covid-19 can help the authorities screen for new and potentially high-risk Covid-19 variants."" Those who do not submit the SG Arrival Card prior to arrival will be redirected to the side of the arrival immigration hall to do so, said ICA. Thereafter, they will have to rejoin the queues for immigration clearance which may result in delays."

Iswaran on Sunday (Aug 7). ""This means we are able to attract people to join the aviation sector after a period of considerable challenges,"" said Mr Iswaran, who was speaking to the media on the sidelines of the Nanyang 57th National Day Carnival in Jurong West. In an update on Singapore's recovery status as an air hub, he said the new ranks of workers have helped the aviation community and Changi Airport cope with the surge in volumes, which, in the first week of July, hit about 56 per cent of pre-Covid-19 levels. ""We now need to sustain that and increase the manning levels going into the year end, because we anticipate another significant increase in the year-end period."" He added: ""We need to plan for that and make manning and operational adjustments - that is what everybody is working on right now."" He noted that one of the challenges with recovery has been manpower, because pre-Covid-19, the aviation sector employed about 35,000 people. ""At the end of last year, we were down to about 25,000...There was about a one-third attrition, which is a significant loss of capability when we are trying to ramp up fast,"" he said. ""Many airports have ramped up quickly, but then subsequently had to make adjustments and even scale back, because of the challenge of manning levels."" Besides recruiting people, he said aviation partners - including Changi Airport, airport services firm Sats and Singapore Airlines - are investing in training, as many recruits may be new to the sector. He said: ""They need to enhance their knowledge of the sector and operations and level up the skills needed to come up to speed, because it is critical for both operational efficiency, and also for safety... (partners) are investing heavily in the effort to train and bring them up to speed so that they can seamlessly fit into the operations."" He added that the sector is recovering well, and urged Singaporeans to consider careers in the sector, as many key players are recruiting and looking for good people. Mr Iswaran also reiterated that the target is to get Changi Airport's handling capacity to its pre-pandemic level of 70 million passengers a year. Both ramping up manpower and a series of scheduled openings of terminals are in the works in pursuit of this target. Changi Airport Terminal 4 will reopen on Sept 13, and the southern wing of Terminal 2 will be opened for departure operations in October. With these openings, the capacity of the airport will be at about 80 per cent of pre-Covid-19 levels, said Mr Iswaran. ""We are looking at making sure that the airport is able to get back to processing and serving passenger flows at that level,"" he said, adding that there are no explicit targets for the year end. ""But whether that actually comes about depends on many other factors that are beyond our control, because there are external factors, in particular, what is happening in some of our key markets in North-east Asia like China, Japan and (South) Korea."" He said the airport's capability and capacity for operations is not just dependent on infrastructure and equipment, but skilled manpower and especially Singaporean manpower ""to ensure the continuity and recovery of our operations in Changi"". ""But our preparation continues, because we need to make sure that we are ready for further improvement in the aviation sector,"" he added."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/leadership-reshuffle-at-mpa-as-current-chief-executive-quah-ley-hoon-steps-down,Leadership reshuffle at MPA as current chief executive Quah Ley Hoon steps down,"SINGAPORE - A change of leadership is afoot at the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), with current chief executive Quah Ley Hoon set to leave after nearly four years at the helm. Ms Quah, 45, will step down on Sept 5, and will be replaced by Mr Teo Eng Dih, 44, who is currently deputy secretary for policy at the Ministry of Defence (Mindef). The Ministry of Transport (MOT) said in a statement on Friday (Aug 5) that Mr Teo will be appointed as chief executive (designate) of MPA from next Monday (Aug 8), concurrent with his current position at Mindef, before formally taking over as chief executive from Sept 5. ""The Ministry of Transport would like to put on record its appreciation to Ms Quah Ley Hoon for her significant contributions as the chief executive of MPA and wish her all the best in her future endeavours,"" the statement said. Ms Quah, who was formerly chief editor of CNA, joined MPA as chief executive (designate) in November 2018, before taking over as chief executive in January 2019. MOT said she played a pivotal role in driving Singapore's global maritime aspirations, and had helped to oversee the completion of land reclamation works for Phase 1 of the Tuas mega port project. Ms Quah was also instrumental in leading MPA through the Covid-19 pandemic, overseeing vaccination drives for local maritime personnel and crew members onboard ships calling at Singapore, MOT said. “Under Ms Quah’s leadership, MPA responded decisively to the challenges posed by the pandemic, made big strides to transform and decarbonise the maritime sector,” said Transport Minister S. Iswaran in a Facebook post on Friday, adding that significant steps were also taken to digitalise the industry. When asked, MOT and MPA did not say where Ms Quah will be going to next. Her successor, Mr Teo, was special assistant to then Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean from 2016 to 2018 before he joined Mindef. He is currently responsible for defence policy and diplomacy, strategic and public communications, and total defence.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/heavy-traffic-delays-expected-at-woodlands-tuas-checkpoints-during-national-day-holiday,"Heavy traffic, delays expected at Woodlands, Tuas checkpoints during National Day holiday","SINGAPORE - Motorists crossing the Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints can expect heavy traffic and delays this National Day weekend and holiday period (Aug 5 to Aug 10) following a peak of more than 290,000 commuters a day over the past weekend. The number of daily crossings from July 29 to 31 surpassed the weekend travel volumes recorded during this year's June school holidays, Vesak Day and Good Friday weekends, said the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) on Thursday (Aug 4). Weekends during the June school holiday saw about 278,000 travellers each day. As traffic flow has been increasing along the Causeway and at the checkpoints, commuters are advised to adjust their travel plans, if possible, to avoid being caught in a jam. Pre-pandemic, during peak traffic at the National Day long weekend in 2019, travellers at the land checkpoints had to wait for up to four hours before they cleared immigration, added the ICA. Therefore, travellers are advised to factor in additional time for immigration clearance and avoid the following peak hours: - From 3pm to 11.59pm, travellers leaving Singapore on Friday (Aug 5) - From 6am to 10am and 4pm to 9pm, travellers leaving Singapore on Saturday (Aug 6) - From 6pm to 11.59pm, those arriving in Singapore between Sunday (Aug 7) and Wednesday (Aug 10). Those departing from the Woodlands checkpoint should also note that Malaysia's immigration department, Jabatan Imigresen Malaysia, has been conducting upgrading works on their arrival immigration car booths since June. During this period, booths undergoing upgrading at the Bangunan Sultan IskandarCustoms, Immigration and Quarantine Complex will not be operational. Before leaving Singapore, motorists are also advised to check the traffic situation at the land checkpoints through the Land Transport Authority's One Motoring website or via the Expressway Monitoring Advisory System installed along the Bukit Timah Expressway and Ayer Rajah Expressway. Traffic updates will also be posted on the ICA's social media pages. Travellers should ensure their passports have a remaining validity of six months or more. Permanent residents who have renewed their passports will have to transfer their re-entry permit to the new passport, said the ICA. All short-term visitors, including in-principle approval holders, need to submit their Singapore arrival card with health declaration within three days before arriving at Singapore. Arriving travellers who are not fully vaccinated against Covid-19 will receive a seven-day stay-home notice through the e-mail address provided in their arrival card declaration, added the ICA."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/mpa-to-suspend-glencores-bunkering-licence-for-two-months,MPA suspends Glencore’s bunkering licence in S'pore over contaminated fuel,"SINGAPORE - The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) will suspend Glencore’s bunkering licence for two months after the global commodity trading giant knowingly supplied contaminated fuel to ships at the Singapore port. The suspension, which takes effect from Aug 18, comes after Glencore’s subsidiary in Singapore supplied tainted fuel to 24 ships in late March and early April. At least three of these vessels have reported issues with their fuel pumps and engines, said MPA on Wednesday (Aug 3).  Investigations by the port authority showed that Glencore Singapore had sold the tainted oil even after the fuel testing laboratory that was contracted by it reported that the samples contained high levels of chlorinated organic compounds (COC), a component not commonly found in marine fuels.  Bunker fuel contaminations have the potential to damage a ship’s engine and lead to costly repairs. Ships losing power at sea can be extremely dangerous, increasing the risk of collision or running aground. The testing of the fuel samples was done between March 21 and March 23, said MPA. Despite this, Glencore continued to supply bunkers blended with the contaminated fuel in the Port of Singapore from March 22 to April 1, noted MPA It added: “Glencore contravened the terms and conditions of its bunkering licence in failing to ensure that no bunkers supplied by it were contaminated. Glencore was given the opportunity to comment on these findings before MPA finalised its conclusions.” MPA said it has asked Glencore to improve its internal procedures “to ensure that prompt action is taken in future when it becomes aware of, or reasonably suspects, any irregularity in fuel quality”. Glencore declined to comment when contacted by The Straits Times.  Meanwhile, MPA will not be suspending the bunkering licence of PetroChina as it had stopped supplying the contaminated oil by March 19, as soon as it received the laboratory results showing extremely high levels of organic chlorides. The issue first surfaced when about 200 ships that called at Singapore earlier this year were found to have received contaminated fuel supplied by Glencore and PetroChina International Singapore. About 80 of these ships reported issues with their fuel pumps and engines, MPA said in April. Further investigations showed that the contaminated fuel originated from a tanker that loaded the oil from Khor Fakkan, a port in the United Arab Emirates, some time in January and February. Hong Kong-listed Glencore had bought the oil from Straits Pinnacle, a unit of the Straits Financial Group, which is owned by Hong Kong logistics group CWT International. Straits Pinnacle had, in turn, obtained the oil from Singapore firm Unicious Energy. MPA also noted that it found no evidence that Glencore or PetroChina had intentionally contaminated the high sulphur fuel oil. Mr Simon Neo, executive director of Singapore-based marine fuel consultancy SDE International, said the suspension did not come as a surprise, especially considering the contamination issue had affected Singapore’s reputation as a major ship refuelling hub. “To be a top bunker port or bunkering hub, Singapore must maintain trust in the industry and this covers quantity and quality delivery to vessels,” he said. “Glencore contravened the port authority’s licensing agreement that helps to ensure this trust is maintained by supplying quality fuel to ships coming to Singapore to refuel, and this was a consideration for the MPA in deciding on the suspension of the licence.”"
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/coe-premiums-for-large-cars-and-open-category-dipped-slightly,COE premiums for large cars and Open category dip ,"SINGAPORE - Certificate of entitlement (COE) premiums for large cars and the Open category ended lower at the latest tender exercise that closed on Wednesday (Aug 3). For cars with engines above 1,600cc or 130bhp, and fully electric vehicles (EVs) with more than 110 kilowatts of power, the COE price is $107,001, down 2.7 per cent from $110,003. Open category COEs, which can be used to register any type of vehicles other than motorcycles, ended at $113,000, a dip of 0.9 per cent from the record high of $114,001. Premiums for the remaining three types of COEs rose. The premium for cars with engines up to 1,600cc and 130bhp, and EVs with up to 110kW of power, went from $78,899 to $80,000, an increase of 1.4 per cent. For commercial vehicles, the COE premium went up by 2.2 per cent from $54,889 to $56,089. The motorcycle COE premium rose by $90, from $10,910 to $11,000. This is the first tender exercise under a revised counting method for COEs aimed at reducing fluctuations in supply from quarter to quarter. The new method is based on 50 per cent of the number of vehicles taken off the road in the previous six months instead of the full three-month figure. The supply of COEs for the current three-month period, which applies from August to October, is 11.5 per cent lower than the preceding three-month period under the new  method. The reduction would have been more severe, at 21.4 per cent, under the old method, according to the Land Transport Authority. One motor dealer from a mass-market car brand said showrooms have been empty, with few customers walking in. He attributed the high premiums and demand for COEs to commercial buyers like leasing companies that are expanding their fleet.  There were fewer bids received in the car categories than in the two earlier tenders in July, with 1,301 this round compared with 1,536 and 1,595 last month, backing the dealer’s point about lacklustre sales. Another motor dealer said that even though the market for cars has been weak, some traders may be stocking up on Open category COEs – which are transferable – in preparation for large-scale sale events like the upcoming Cars@Expo on Aug 13 and 14. Bidding for motorcycle COEs was relatively quiet on Wednesday. It was priced at $1 right up to the final two minutes of the exercise, before the premium surged to close at $11,000. Mr Rex Tan, president of the Singapore Motor Cycle Trade Association, said such bidding behaviour was not unusual, as the majority of bids would have come from motorcycle retailers who put in bids in bulk.  He added that the high premiums in this category is more likely an accurate reflection of the demand for motorcycles given the tight COE supply."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/red-amber-green-turning-arrows-cut-accidents-by-40-per-cent,Red-amber-green turning arrows cut accidents by 40%: Iswaran ,"SINGAPORE - The number of traffic accidents involving right turns has decreased by 40 per cent at junctions where red-amber-green (RAG) turning signals have been installed. This is based on a sample of traffic junctions with RAG arrows by the Land Transport Authority (LTA), said Transport Minister S. Iswaran on Tuesday (Aug 2) in a written parliamentary reply. Responding to Mr Shawn Huang (Jurong GRC), Mr Iswaran said RAG arrows have been installed at 798 traffic junctions in place of discretionary right turns. By the first quarter of 2024, such signals will be rolled out at 1,200 out of the 1,600 junctions here. At junctions where discretionary right turns are allowed, motorists can make the turn while the green light is on if they deem it safe to do so. With the RAG scheme, they have to wait for the turning arrow to become green before turning right, which reduces the likelihood of collision with oncoming traffic. The authorities started installing RAG turning arrows in 2018, after two fatal accidents that year involving discretionary right turns that sparked public concern about safety. In assessing whether to install RAG arrows at a junction, the LTA considers factors such as accident history, vehicle speeds at the intersection and site constraints. Traffic simulations are run to determine the potential impact of implementing RAG turning arrows on traffic. For major junctions, the assessment may take up to six months. The LTA has said it takes between two and six months to install RAG turning signals, depending on the complexity of traffic conditions, the presence of underground utilities and the sequence of work. Mr Kevin Teo, 46, whose job involves accompanying customers taking out cars on test drives, believes that RAG turning signals should be the norm. He said he feels a lot safer as a passenger knowing that his customer will not be taking unnecessary risks at junctions with such signals. In his reply, Mr Iswaran also said the LTA has completed 24 Silver Zones, with an additional 26 to be in place by 2025. These zones are located in areas with higher concentration of seniors. Roads in Silver Zones have reduced speed limits and traffic calming measures such as narrower and meandering lanes, raised crossings and speed humps. Mr Iswaran said these zones have reduced accident rate among senior pedestrians by about 80 per cent."

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/how-the-singapore-passport-is-produced,How the Singapore passport is produced,"SINGAPORE - While the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) is now producing 6,500 passports daily, up from 2,000 in 2019, its officers perform thorough checks on the applications and production of the document to ensure its quality, said Senior Assistant Commissioner Dominic Chua, director of the ICA's citizen services centre. Checks are also in place to ensure the passports meet international requirements and holders are not refused entry while clearing immigration overseas. The biometric passport, which gives Singaporeans visa-free access to 192 destinations, includes multiple security features such as laser images and designs that make it difficult for forgers to duplicate. These are the steps involved in producing a passport: 1. People apply for a passport online using Singpass or submit a paper application to the passport unit at the ICA Building in Kallang Road. 2. Officers check whether the applicant is eligible for a passport and determine the validity of the passport to be issued. Since last year, the default validity for passports is 10 years. However, for children below 16, the validity is capped at five years as their facial features will change as they grow. 3. Details such as the applicant's name and date of birth will be laser engraved into the passport's polycarbonate biodata page, a process that makes it extremely difficult for others to tamper with. 4. Officers check each of the 6,500 passports currently produced daily to ensure there are no physical defects such as misaligned text. The passports are then run through machines which ensure that the biometric chip - encoded with the applicant's data including facial features and fingerprint - can be read. 5. The passports are sorted based on collection timing and location before they are issued. 6. For Singaporeans who have yet to enrol their facial and fingerprint biometrics, they will do so upon collection and ICA's machines will ensure this data can be read."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/one-weeks-wait-for-new-passports-as-early-as-december-ica,"One-week wait for new passports by year end, says ICA","SINGAPORE - Singaporeans who apply for a new passport can expect a processing time of one week by the year end, similar to before the Covid-19 pandemic, said the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA). This target is based on the number of passport applications the authority receives each day and how many it can process since it introduced stepped-up measures to deal with the surge in applications, said Senior Assistant Commissioner(SAC) Dominic Chua, director of ICA's citizen services centre. Currently, the waiting time is at least six weeks for new passports. Passport applications surged to more than 7,000 a day in May, compared with 2,000 before the pandemic, after Covid-19 border restrictions were significantly eased on April 1. This month, ICA received about 4,500 applications daily. SAC Chua told The Sunday Times that nearly 300 officers from other work units across ICA have been gradually deployed since May to help about 100 officers from the passport unit process and produce passports. These officers work 24/7, and many have put their travel plans on hold. ICA officers have been working in eight-hour shifts to check on the applicants' eligibility and ensure that all passports printed meet quality and security standards. The officers also pack the passports, arrange for them to be collected at the 29 SingPost branches islandwide, and man the collection counters at the ICA Building in Kallang Road. With the additional manpower, ICA is now able to produce 6,500 new passports daily, up from 2,000 in 2019, SAC Chua said. He added: ""Never in the history of ICA have we issued such a huge number of passports at one go."" Also, more Singaporeans are now collecting their passports at post offices, with SingPost increasing the number of counters and outlets for collection as a result. It has raised the number of collection counters to 46, from 39 in October last year, and added the Novena and Killiney Road branches to the list of outlets for passport collection, bringing the total to 29. Some 85,000 passports were collected at post offices last month, almost double the 43,500 in May, according to ICA. The authority had on June 13 accepted walk-ins at the ICA Building only for passport applicants with appointments or passports to be collected. Eligible applicants were encouraged to collect their passports at post offices to avoid the queues that had formed outside the ICA Building in June. ""Compared to October 2021, SingPost today has three times the capacity for passport collection services,"" SingPost chief executive for Singapore Neo Su Yin said in a written reply. A SingPost spokesman added that there could be longer wait times at these outlets - Ang Mo Kio Post Office, General Post Office (SingPost Centre), Hougang Central Post Office, Marine Parade Post Office, Tampines Post Office, Toa Payoh Post Office - and advised people to avoid making appointments at these places. The spokesman said: ""We seek the understanding of customers that wait times may be longer than usual, up to 60 minutes at certain times of the day. We are working with ICA to reduce wait times for customers."" SingPost advised those collecting their passports to arrive punctually for their appointments, so that all customers can be served in a timely manner."

Through the partnership, the flag carrier will work with Destination NSW, the NSW government's tourism and major events agency, on initiatives such as advertising and marketing campaigns to drive visits to the Australian state. The MOU was signed at The Fullerton Hotel Singapore. ""Singapore Airlines, with the support of the NSW government, is currently operating four daily flights to Sydney, which is estimated to deliver over $231 million in visitor expenditure to NSW up until July 2023 and support more than 1,200 jobs,"" said New South Wales Minister for Sport and Tourism Stuart Ayres. Some 126,000 Singaporeans spent more than one million nights in NSW in 2019, adding A$232 million (S$223.5 million) to its economy, added Mr Ayres, who is also Minister for Enterprise, Investment and Trade, and Minister for Western Sydney. The agreement, which is part of NSW's A$60 million Aviation Attraction Fund, will facilitate marketing activities across Singapore, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Britain, Germany and France, to increase demand and tourism to NSW. The fund is part of a Covid-19 economic recovery plan and aims to build aviation capacity across NSW by supporting airlines to return to the state's airports. Tourism is one of Australia's biggest industries, worth more than A$60 billion and employing about 5 per cent of the country's workforce. But the sector was crippled after the country shut its borders in March 2020. Australia fully reopened its international borders in February to vaccinated travellers. SIA's senior vice-president of marketing planning JoAnn Tan said the airline is looking forward to working with Destination NSW to showcase the Australian state's attractions and to promote the state as a destination for its customers. With the agreement, Mr Ayres said there is a good opportunity to increase the number of flights to Sydney eventually. ""This is a great start and a really strong indication of confidence of flying between Singapore and Sydney... we do hope that this will lead to more aircraft coming into Sydney and that's great for Singapore and great for New South Wales,"" he said."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/call-for-suggestions-on-ways-to-improve-cycling-experience-in-sengkang,Call for suggestions on ways to improve cycling experience in Sengkang,"SINGAPORE - Residents of Sengkang have been asked to provide suggestions on how to improve the cycling experience in their town in an open call that was put up online on Sunday (July 24). This comes amid requests by some for more infrastructure there, as the roads and sidewalks have become busy with cyclists in recent years. Widening pavements in high-traffic areas and carving out designated bicycle lanes from roads with lower traffic were among the ideas mooted by Sengkang GRC MPs He Ting Ru, Jamus Lim and Louis Chua, who put out the call for feedback. The latter proposal was previously raised by Associate Professor Lim during the debate on the Ministry of Transport's budget earlier this year. In a Facebook post, the MPs said most of Sengkang town is located within 2km of the MRT system, but the existing cycling paths there do not link well to transport nodes and park connectors in the area. ""This presents a great opportunity for our town to get off cars and get onto bicycles, be it for commuting to the MRT or for leisure,"" they added. The aim is to work with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to implement some of the proposals from residents, as the Government looks to expand the islandwide cycling path network from 500km now to about 1,300km by 2030. In February last year, The Straits Times reported that Sengkang's cycling path network could span 28.3km by 2030, with feasibility studies under way. According to a cycling route map on LTA's website, there are currently less than 2km of dedicated cycling paths in the area. Ms He, Prof Lim and Mr Chua told ST the key issue is that Sengkang does not have a high enough density of cycling paths, despite the significant number of cyclists there. They suggested that there is potential for Sengkang to be a walking and cycling town, alongside Tampines and Ang Mo Kio. Ang Mo Kio was earmarked as a model walking and cycling town in 2014 and is slated to have 27km of cycling paths by 2026. Tampines became the second such town in 2017, with 17km of cycling paths now. This will grow to 30km by 2026. The MPs said Sengkang is both relatively compact and flat, which makes it more conducive for cycling than other towns. Residents have also flagged that the footpaths in the town can be narrow and congested. ""We have observed that particularly around Sengkang Central and along the main thoroughfares, there are a higher number of delivery riders, especially during the rush hour,"" said the MPs, noting that this adds to congestion on footpaths there. Polytechnic student Farhan Sam, 21, who lives in Sengkang and also delivers food in the area, prefers to cycle on the road as it is faster than riding on the pavement. He said dedicated bicycle lanes on the road will be helpful for delivery workers as it will make it safer. Fellow resident Michael Jude, 72, cycles only on pavements as the roads are too dangerous for him. While some of the footpaths are narrow, he said the current infrastructure can generally accommodate both cyclists and pedestrians for now. Instead, the part-time food safety trainer would like more bicycle parking spaces to be provided as the existing ones are already filled to the brim. Another resident, Mr Lum Choon Hoe, 57, said he hopes that more cycling paths can be built as the sidewalks are often packed with pedestrians when he cycles to and from work during peak periods. ""People don't give way to each other so it is difficult,"" added the hospital worker. Suggestions can be submitted from now till Aug 14 via an online form that can be found on the Sengkang GRC Facebook page."

According to Fuel Kaki, a pump price tracker set up by Consumers Association of Singapore, the posted price for diesel now ranges from $2.91 (Sinopec, SPC) to $2.93 (Caltex, Shell). As recently as two weeks ago, they were all above $3 a litre. As for petrol, the 92-octane grade is a uniform $2.89 a litre. Two weeks ago, it was $3.30. The popular 95-octane is $2.94 a litre except at SPC, where it costs one cent lower. The 98-octane grade, necessary only for a few cars, is $3.14 except at Shell, where it is $3.43. The so-called premium 98-octane grade is between $3.43 (Shell) and $3.58 (Caltex). The reduction came on the back of further easing in wholesale fuel prices. RBOB gasoline, a proxy for refined petrol, last closed at US$2.99 a gallon - its lowest since March. Industry watchers said rising inflation and fears of an approaching recession have caused people to cut back on driving and commuting. After discount, Caltex's 92-octane is between $2.37 and $2.43 a litre, while Esso's is between $2.37 and $2.49. At SPC, the only other operator which offers 92-octane, the fuel is a uniform $2.46. The 95-octane fuel is cheapest at Sinopec, at $2.30 a litre. Among operators with sizeable station networks, Caltex's 95-octane is $2.41 for OCBC 365 card, and $2.47 for a range of other cards, while Esso's prices range from $2.41 to $2.53. The 98-octane fuel is $2.68 at Sinopec, but only with OCBC cards. Elsewhere, the petrol is $2.90 at SPC (a range of cards), and between $2.80 and $2.93 at Esso.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/coe-supply-for-aug-to-oct-to-drop-by-115-under-new-counting-method-aimed-at-reducing-fluctuations,COE supply for Aug to Oct to drop by 11.5% under new counting method,"SINGAPORE - The supply of certificates of entitlement (COE) will drop by 11.5 per cent for the three months from August to October under a revised counting method aimed at reducing fluctuations. In all, there will be 3,526 COEs each month spread across five categories, said the Land Transport Authority (LTA). This is down from 3,982 COEs available each month from May to July. The COE quota under the previous computation method for the August to October period would have been 9,394 instead of 10,581 – a 21.4 per cent cut instead of the announced 11.5 per cent reduction from the previous three-month period. In the category for internal combustion engine cars with up to 1,600cc and below 130bhp, as well as fully electric vehicles with up to 110 kilowatt of power, there will be a monthly supply of 1,086 COEs, a reduction of 11.3 per cent from the current quota period. For cars with larger engines or more power, there will be 939 COEs, 10.8 per cent down from the current period. The supply of commercial vehicle COEs is reduced by 19 per cent to 166 COEs monthly for the August to October period. This category has received the most severe reduction among all the types of COEs. There will be 1,008 COEs for motorcycles, a cut of 10.1 per cent from the 1,121 COEs available monthly in the May to July period. In the Open category, which can be used for all types of vehicles except for motorcycles, the quota is reduced by 13.7 per cent from 379 COEs each month to 327 COEs. The figures are based on an updated calculation method which LTA announced along with the new quota.  The main determinant of the COE supply is the deregistration rate. The revised method of calculation for the coming three months is based on 50 per cent of the number of deregistrations in the previous six months instead of taking the deregistrations from the previous three months alone.  LTA said that the new method for computing the COE quota available for bidding reduces the quarter-to-quarter volatility of the COE supply while being more responsive in returning the COEs of deregistered vehicles to the bidding pool. As reported earlier, motor traders have expected the quota to be reduced. In anticipation of a further rise in premiums, motor dealers have been rushing to secure as many COEs as possible in the recent tender exercises to register customer orders as well as to secure Open category COEs, which are valid for three months.  COE premiums have been going up - in the latest tender exercise on Wednesday, the premium for the Open category COE hit a record high of $114,001.   A motor dealer said that while the reduction in COE quota may not be as severe as anticipated, premiums will still be going up.  Since February 2018, the vehicle growth rate has been set at zero per cent for all categories of COEs except for commercial vehicles, with their numbers allowed to grow at the rate of 0.25 per cent per year. This policy runs until January 2025."

These suggestions are not entirely new, and have been made over the course of the 32-year-old auction system. In the three decades, tweaks have been made, too."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/taxi-companies-extend-temporary-fare-hike-until-dec-31-as-fuel-costs-remain-high,Taxi companies extend temporary fare hike until Dec 31,"SINGAPORE - Taxi companies here have extended until Dec 31 a temporary one-cent increase in distance and waiting-time fares for standard taxi rides that is meant to help cabbies cope with the high cost of fuel. SMRT-owned Strides Taxi announced the extension in a Facebook post on Thursday (July 21), while Premier Taxis made the announcement on its website last week. The remaining three taxi operators here - ComfortDelGro, Trans-Cab and Prime Taxi - also told The Straits Times on Thursday about their move to extend the temporary fuel-related fare hike until the end of the year. The fare increase, introduced in April on the back of soaring pump prices, was originally meant to end in May or when fuel prices eased. But it was extended until the end of this month as pump prices remained high, and will now be extended again as prices for 92-octane petrol hover around the $3 mark. With the temporary hike, passengers taking regular taxis are now being charged 25 cents for every 400m travelled up to 10km, every 350m travelled after 10km, and every 45 seconds or less of waiting time. This is up from 24 cents previously. ComfortDelGro, Singapore's largest taxi operator with a fleet of about 9,000 cabs, had previously said the temporary hike amounts to a fare increase of about 32 cents for a standard 10km taxi ride. For limousine and premium cabs, passengers now pay between 34 and 36 cents for every 400m travelled up to 10km, every 350m travelled after 10km, and every 45 seconds or less of waiting time, depending on the taxi operator. The temporary hike also impacts non-metered taxi fares, which applies to rides booked via ComfortDelGro's ComfortRide ride-hailing service. According to the Consumers Association of Singapore's pump price tracker, Fuel Kaki, a litre of 92-octane petrol currently costs between $2.94 and $2.96, while diesel costs between $2.93 and $2.98 per litre before discounts. This is down from earlier highs of between $3.34 and $3.37 per litre of 92-octane petrol and between $3.16 and $3.19 per litre of diesel, but still higher than pump prices at the start of the year. The authorities had earlier said pump prices are likely to remain elevated after rising by between 30 per cent and 40 per cent in the past six months. Support measures have been doled out as part of a $1.5 billion support package to help Singaporeans cope with inflation, including a one-off $150 relief from the Government for taxi hirers that will be paid out in August. The Land Transport Authority will work with transport operators here to disburse the relief to those eligible. For ComfortDelGro cabby Ethan Ong, the temporary increase in distance and waiting-time fares has amounted to additional earnings of only a few dollars a day. So while the extension of the fare hike is welcome, he does not expect it to make a big difference to his earnings, given the large increase in fuel costs. “There is nothing much we can do. These are all market forces,” said the 38-year-old. “But obviously every little bit helps and we appreciate the fact that help is given.” Risk manager Jeffrey Lim, 39, who does not own a car and takes a taxi six to eight times a month, said he has not noticed the increase in distance and waiting-time fares, but added that cab fares are generally more expensive now. On the extension of the temporary fare hike, Mr Lim added: “It is understandable, given that inflationary pressures are starting to affect all areas of life. However, it is death by a thousand cuts when salaries aren’t keeping pace with these increases.”"
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/coe-prices-rise-across-the-board-with-open-category-setting-record-twice-in-a-row-at-114k,"COE prices rise across the board, with Open category reaching new high of $114k","SINGAPORE - Certificate of entitlement (COE) premiums ended higher in all categories at the latest tender exercise on Wednesday (July 20), with the Open category setting a new high for the second time in a row. The premium for the Open category COE, which tends to be used for larger cars, ended at $114,001, a 3.1 per cent increase from last round's $110,524. Premiums for cars with engines above 1,600cc or 130bhp, as well as electric vehicles (EVs) with power output above 110 kilowatts rose by 2 per cent from $107,800 to $110,003. For smaller and less powerful cars and EVs, COE premiums went up by 1.2 per cent from $78,001 to $78,899. The commercial vehicle COE premium went up from $54,001 to $54,889, a hike of 1.6 per cent. The price of motorcycle COEs rose by $21 from $10,889 to $10,910. The latest tender exercise is the last one under the current three-month quota period.  Even higher COE premiums may be on the horizon, say motor dealers, who anticipate a significant reduction in the supply of COEs for August to October. Industry watchers attribute this expectation as the main driver behind Open COE premiums breaking the record again in the tender exercise. At the previous tender exercise that closed on July 6, the premium in this category was $110,524, surpassing the record set in 1994. Unlike the two COE types for cars that must be tagged to owners, Open COEs are transferrable. As they can be held for three months before they have to be used, such COEs would become even more valuable if there is a drop in supply of COEs for the August to October period. An executive from a premium German brand dealership said motor traders would be determined to secure whatever COEs they need in this round in order not to pay even more for them in the coming months. When the exercise closed on Wednesday afternoon, a total of 834 bids were received in the category of COEs for smaller and less powerful cars, down from 900 submissions recorded previously. This suggests that the dealers may not have many orders to fulfil. The bidding in this category of COEs also progressed relatively slowly in the last hour of the tender exercise. It was only in the final two minutes or so that the price jumped by more than $2,000. Mr Ng Choon Wee, commercial director for Komoco Motors, suggested it was likely that the final push came from fleet operators and not car dealers looking to register customer cars. Motor traders who need COEs would not risk putting in a large volume of bids so near to the end of the tender exercise. If they are late and fail to secure the COEs, they would not be able to deliver cars to their customers. Fleet operators, on the other hand, may act at the last minute because they spot an opportunity to nab a potentially cheaper COE."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/all-pump-prices-fall-92-octane-petrol-prices-drop-below-3-a-litre,All pump prices fall; 92-octane petrol prices drop below $3 a litre,"SINGAPORE - All fuel pump prices have fallen since Esso initiated a sharp 14-cent cut in rates last week. According to Fuel Kaki, a pump price tracker set up by the Consumers Association of Singapore, the other four brands - Caltex, Shell, Sinopec and SPC - adjusted their posted prices downwards over the weekend. All matched Esso's reduction of 14 cents for petrol and four cents for diesel, except for SPC, which cut diesel price by seven cents and petrol prices by 16 cents a litre. With the change, diesel now ranges from $2.93 (SPC) to $2.98 (Caltex, Shell), and 92-octane petrol ranges from $2.94 (SPC) to $2.96 (Caltex, Esso) - the first time that all brands of 92-octane fuel are below $3 since April. This also means 92-octane fuels from Caltex and Esso are priced below their diesel rates - an uncommon occurrence since diesel, which attracts a far lower duty, has traditionally been noticeably less costly than the least expensive petrol here. Shell and Sinopec do not offer 92-octane fuel. The popular 95-octane grade is $3.01 across all brands except SPC, which is pricing it at $2.98. The 98-octane grade, necessary only for a minority of cars here, is now between $3.46 (SPC) and $3.50 (Shell). The so-called premium grade of 98-octane petrol is now between $3.50 (Shell) and $3.65 (Caltex). After discount, the lowest price for 92-octane petrol is $2.43 a litre from Caltex (OCBC 365 card) and Esso (DBS Esso card). The highest is $2.55 from Esso (Citibank Cashback card and other OCBC cards). For 95-octane, Sinopec's $2.36 (OCBC cards) is the lowest, but it has only three stations. Among operators with a sizeable network, Caltex (OCBC 365 card) and Esso (DBS Esso card) offer the lowest rate of $2.47 a litre. The highest 95-octane rate is $2.59 (Shell, with cards other than UOB One card) and Esso (Citibank Cashback card and OCBC cards except for OCBC 365 card). For 98-octane, Sinopec again has the lowest rate of $2.74 (OCBC cards), followed by Esso's $2.85 (DBS Esso card). The highest rate is $3.01, posted by Shell (various Citibank and HSBC cards). The pump price adjustment came on the back of Brent crude oil futures tumbling below US$100 a barrel for the first time since April. RBOB gasoline, a proxy for refined petrol, is hovering at around US$3.20 a gallon, the lowest in more than three months. Growing inflation and rising interest rates are fuelling fears of a global recession, which dampens demand for oil. Motorists have also been cutting back on mileage clocked in response to steep pump prices, while a gradual shift to electric vehicles is also crimping fuel demand."

According to Fuel Kaki, a pump price tracker set up by the Consumers Association of Singapore, Esso made the cut at around 4pm on Friday (July 15). Its posted price for 92-octane petrol is now $2.96, or 14 cents lower than last week's price, while its diesel rate is a cent higher at $2.97 (four cents down). The posted price for its 95-octane petrol is $3.01 and that for 98-octane is $3.48. Both are also 14 cents lower than last week's prices. The reduction came on the back of Brent crude oil sliding below US$100 a barrel for the first time since April. RBOB gasoline, a proxy for refined petroleum prices, last traded at US$3.19, the lowest in more than three months. Esso's move is expected to trigger a reduction across other brands in the coming days.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/comfortdelgro-doubles-fleet-to-become-no-3-coach-operator-in-ireland,ComfortDelGro doubles fleet to become No. 3 coach operator in Ireland,"SINGAPORE - Transport giant ComfortDelGro has doubled its coach fleet in Ireland with a new acquisition. Through wholly-owned subsidiary ComfortDelGro Irish Citylink, the Singapore-based group bought Irish coach operator GoBus - which operates 31 buses - for €12 million (S$17 million). This has made ComfortDelGro the third-largest inter-city coach operator in Ireland, with a fleet of 64 buses. ComfortDelGro Irish Citylink, which has been operating since 1991, runs a range of services in Galway, Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Clifden, Loughrea, Athlone and Ballinasloe. ComfortDelGro said on Wednesday (July 13) that all three routes plied by GoBus ""have been experiencing strong commuter demand in recent months"", with the Cork-Dublin one already operating at pre-Covid-19 levels. ComfortDelGro group deputy chief executive Cheng Siak Kian said: ""As the world emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic, we have seen transport ridership levels improve. In Ireland, demand for inter-city coach services has picked up significantly, especially now that fuel prices are treading at close to record high levels. ""The addition of the GoBus network therefore comes at an opportune time."" Established in Galway in 2009, GoBus was named ""Coach Operator of the Year 2020 - Intercity"" at the biennial Fleet Bus & Coach Awards, which is organised by Fleet Publications, the largest publisher of transport-oriented magazines in Ireland. ComfortDelGro Irish Citylink currently ferries more than 28,000 people a week and expects to reach a ridership of ""well over 35,000 by year-end"", barring unforeseen circumstances. ComfortDelGro is also one of the largest bus and coach operators in Britain, with scheduled bus operations in London and across South Wales, as well as inter-city coach services in Scotland. In London, the group's wholly-owned subsidiary, Metroline, operates about 17 per cent of the city's scheduled bus mileage. In addition to bus and coach services, the group also operates private-hire businesses in Liverpool and Aberdeen. ComfortDelGro's two other major overseas markets are Australia and China. For the year ended Dec 31, 2021, the group's net earnings more than doubled to $130.1 million on the back of a 9.1 per cent rise in revenue to $3.5 billion. Overseas businesses accounted for 46.2 per cent of revenue and 42 per cent of operating profit."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/marine-fuel-sales-in-singapore-dips-as-high-prices-curbs-ship-refuelling-at-the-portmpa,Marine fuel sales in Singapore dip as high prices curb ship refuelling at the port,"SINGAPORE - Sales of marine fuel in Singapore plunged in June in the wake of soaring oil prices that reduced the number of ships calling at the port to refuel. Sales fell to 3.75 million tonnes, almost 9 per cent down on May, industry sources and government data showed. Vessels calling specifically for refuelling in Singapore, the world's largest bunkering hub, fell to 2,940 - 7.2 per cent lower than in May and down from 3,242 in June last year, said the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) on Wednesday (July 13). A marine fuels procurement manager with a Chinese-owned container liner said the company's vessels were literally ""running on fumes"" in June due to the high prices. Low-sulphur marine fuels cost around US$1,100 to $1,200 a tonne in June, compared with about US$800 in May. ""It was a really tough month for my department, because every day, I was being asked to watch my costs. It was a lot of pressure, I had no choice but to cap my purchases,"" said the manager. ""It's just been a roller-coaster... As crude prices rose, the bunker price followed. We've had to be very conservative with our refuelling programme."" Mr Roslan Khasawneh, a senior fuel oil analyst at data analytics firm Vortexa, said besides costlier crude, marine fuel prices, particularly for low-sulphur grades, surged because the market has been struggling with supply. He added: ""Many ships resorted to bunkering in other regional ports like Zhoushan in China, where bunker prices for low-sulphur marine fuels were being offered at a discount to Singapore for most of the month."" Mr Yaw Yan Chong, a director at Refinitiv Oil Research, said the loss of gasoil exports from Russia, a key supplier to Europe, forced buyers there to seek alternative sources, sparking a demand surge that drove refining margins for the product to record highs. This, in turn, led to a shortfall in the production of components used to make low-sulphur fuel oil, creating another shortage in the marine fuels market. Mr Yaw said: ""It's really just a rippling effect of the sanctions now placed on Russia, which is a major exporter of many different forms of energy, not just gas. The impact is deep and looks structural to us."" MPA data shows that sales in June of the most commonly traded low-sulphur grade dipped around 5.7 per cent to 1.9 million tonnes from May's levels. Wide-ranging sanctions targeting Moscow's energy exports - including crude oil, diesel and piped gas - since the Feb 24 invasion of Ukraine have forced European buyers to scour the world for alternatives. While sales of low-sulphur marine fuels fell at Singapore's port, ship refuelling for high-sulphur grades increased due to the relatively steeper discounts that were being offered by sellers. MPA data shows that sales in June of the most common high-sulphur grade came in at 1.05 million tonnes, the highest for the year. Mr Yaw said the high-sulphur market was not only well supplied but also awash with steeply discounted sanctioned barrels in not just Asia, but also in the Middle East and the Mediterranean."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/first-air-taxi-flights-in-spore-to-take-scenic-route-around-marina-bay-if-approved,First air taxi flights in S'pore to take scenic route around Marina Bay if approved,"SINGAPORE - Tourists looking for a new way to take in the sights in the Marina Bay area may be able to do so from the sky if a proposed route for the first commercial air taxi flights here gets the nod from the authorities. The proposed flight over a 12km route, operated by air taxi pioneer Volocopter, is expected to be ready for launch around early- to mid-2024, with the hiring of key staff such as pilots, engineers and service crew expected to start by end-2023 at the latest, said Volocopter's chief commercial officer, Mr Christian Bauer, on Tuesday (July 12). Mr Bauer spoke to reporters during a tour of a newly launched public exhibition at ITE College Central in Ang Mo Kio, which will showcase a scale model of Volocopter's fully electric urban air taxi VoloCity. The two-seater aircraft has a range of 35km and a speed of 90kmh, and is part of the German company's longer-term vision for urban air mobility in Singapore. If all goes to plan, Volocopter's maiden commercial flight here will take passengers from a take-off and landing area in Marina South to the Marina Reservoir and back, going over the Marina Barrage and the Benjamin Sheares Bridge at an altitude of 100m to 150m. The journey, which will also take in parts of Kallang Basin near Tanjong Rhu, will last about 15 minutes. Mr Bauer said the proposed route is in ""the final approval stage"" and studies on the route have already been conducted. ""Why a tourist flight? Because to be quite transparent, Singapore does not have a congestion problem on the ground, but you have around 20 million visitors per year who want to have excitement, an experience. We believe such a breathtaking sightseeing excursion would be a brilliant way to start off,"" he added. Another air taxi route around Sentosa island - also aimed at tourists - is next in the pipeline for Volocopter. In 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic struck, 19.1 million travellers visited Singapore, spending close to $28 billion. Mr Bauer said Volocopter is also in discussion with the authorities on the location of its first VoloPort, which is where the air taxi will take off from and land at. ""We need them to break ground at the end of the year or the beginning of next year to really build up that infrastructure to be ready,"" he added. Volocopter's air taxis look like small helicopters with multiple mini rotor blades. But unlike regular choppers, these electric aircraft have been touted as a safer, quieter, more convenient and more environmentally friendly way to travel. They will take off from and land on vertiports - named for the way the aircraft take off and land vertically. Volocopter said its vertiports take only three to four months to build if they are constructed on cleared land. It aims to have between four and six of them in Singapore and South-east Asia by 2030. Earlier this year, the company had laid out longer-term plans to operate cross-border air taxi trips from Singapore to Indonesia and Malaysia. In the meantime, the firm wants Singapore and Paris to be the first cities its commercial air taxis are flown in, and is in the process of obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and the European authorities. A slew of tests, flight trials and evaluations are being conducted to ensure the air taxis are as safe as commercial aircraft. Volocopter's chief risk and certification officer, Mr Oliver Reinhardt, said there is a working arrangement between CAAS and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to concurrently validate the VoloCity aircraft. Certification is expected in early 2024. Asked about Volocopter's proposed flight routes and certification, Mr Tan Kah Han, CAAS' chief technology officer and senior director at CAAS' Unmanned Systems Group, said only that the authority is working with partners like Volocopter to evaluate possible routes and develop an operating framework here. He said CAAS is also working with EASA to develop a range of regulations, including on airworthiness, to address and ensure public and aviation safety. Asked how much each air taxi flight will cost here, Mr Bauer declined to give specific figures. But he said Volocopter's first flights in Singapore will be about 70 per cent to 75 per cent cheaper than the price of a helicopter ride. According to one local helicopter operator, it costs about $2,500 to charter a helicopter for sightseeing in Singapore, and this is only for the flight itself. Mr Bauer said the aim in the next five to seven years is to make air taxis as affordable as a premium taxi ride. By 2030, Volocopter also plans to hire up to 500 direct employees here and induce the creation of another 800 jobs in related sectors. ITE College Central principal Suresh Natarajan said Volocopter's engineers have already conducted training for ITE lecturers to get familiar with the VoloCity aircraft as part of a feasibility study for maintenance training. ""We are very hopeful that, through this collaboration, we are able to provide new career and development opportunities for the Singapore aviation workforce by embracing new technologies and staying ahead with the... curve."""

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/more-roadside-carpark-spaces-in-the-cbd-to-be-converted-into-bicycle-parking-facilities,More roadside carpark spaces in the CBD to be converted into bicycle parking facilities,"SINGAPORE - Cyclists heading to the city centre will soon be able to park their bicycles in more dedicated areas, with roadside car parking spaces in Outram and Telok Ayer set to be reclaimed for this purpose. Two car parking spaces in Club Street have already been converted into a bicycle parking space as at the end of June, and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) aims to create a total of 100 new bicycle parking spots in the Central Business District (CBD) by this quarter. This will be done by repurposing two car parking spaces each in Telok Ayer Street, Boon Tat Street, Tras Street and Bukit Pasoh Road, LTA said in response to queries. Each car parking space yields about 10 bicycle parking spaces. The cycling path network in the CBD will also be expanded by another 3.8km, with new paths to be built along Marina Boulevard, Shenton Way, Cecil Street, Cross Street, Pickering Street, and parts of South Bridge Road and North Canal Road. Most of these new paths are expected to be completed by the end of the year. Currently, there are about 15km of cycling paths in the CBD, mostly around Bayfront, Marina South and Gardens by the Bay. The provision of more bicycle parking facilities in the CBD is meant to encourage more people to take up active mobility in the city centre, LTA said. But there is a lack of space to build new infrastructure, hence the need to repurpose roadside car parking spaces there. In late 2019, LTA converted two roadside car parking spaces in Jiak Chuan Road in Chinatown into bicycle parking spaces as part of a trial - which it said was a success. In a letter to owners and tenants of shophouses there at the time, LTA had said that the move would help to curb indiscriminate bicycle parking in the area. A waiter at Kafe Utu in Jiak Chuan Road said there were quite a lot of customers who cycled to the African-inspired eatery for brunch on weekends after the new bicycle parking spots were put up, though there are not as many now. Ms Pang Su Yi, founder of Bao Makers, also in Jiak Chuan Road, said the new bicycle parking spaces have not brought too many cyclists to her eatery, but it has helped with the issue of improperly parked bicycles. She said some cyclists used to park their bicycles along the walkway outside her eatery and nearby shophouses, obstructing it. ""People park properly now so it is less of a hazard,"" she added. Cycling enthusiasts said more parking facilities for two-wheelers can only be a good thing, but there are questions over the utility of the new lots, since there is a lack of proper cycling infrastructure around the Outram and Telok Ayer area. Musician Afiq Syazani, 34, who used to cycle often through Duxton Plain Park near Bukit Pasoh and Jiak Chuan Road, said the Outram and Telok Ayer area is quite hilly and generally car-centric, which discourages active mobility. Mr Francis Chu, co-founder of cycling group Love Cycling SG, said: ""People may feel unsafe to cycle on the street."" He suggested that the speed limit at these locations be lowered to 20kmh and traffic-calming measures, such as more road humps, be put in place. Mr Woon Taiwoon, who is also a co-founder of Love Cycling SG, suggested that the authorities work with local businesses to give perks to cyclists or create social media campaigns around cycling in the CBD. ""There is only so much you can do with repurposing a car parking space,"" he said. Mr Afiq said LTA should put up signs around the new bicycle parking facilities and the roads leading to them, so that the public know to use them. ""Even if you're just walking past, the signage will increase awareness of the area's cycling potential,"" he added. LTA said it will continue to study other suitable areas to implement more bicycle parking to enhance the cycling experience in Singapore, as the islandwide cycling network here is being expanded from about 500km now to 1,300km by 2030. The Government had also previously said it would add 3,000 more bicycle parking spaces at MRT stations here by 2025, on top of the 27,000 parking spaces at public transport nodes now. ""These are small wins,"" said Love Cycling SG's Mr Woon. ""With more bicycle parking spots, I hope it can encourage more people to try cycling around the CBD instead of driving."""

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/additional-15-minutes-for-travel-between-jurong-east-and-kranji-mrt-stations,Train fault delays travel between Kranji and Jurong East stations,"SINGAPORE - A train fault caused delays of up to 25 minutes between Kranji and Jurong East MRT stations on the North-South Line yesterday.  In a tweet at 5.56pm, rail operator SMRT had also offered free regular bus services between Woodlands and Jurong East. But some commuters had difficulty finding the buses.  When The Straits Times arrived at Jurong East MRT station at 7pm, crowds had formed in the taxi areas outside the station, where commuters were waiting for private vehicles.  Mrs Geetha Ganesh, a pre-school teacher who works in Jurong East, was heading home to Choa Chu Kang when she was caught in the train delay and heard the announcement that bus services to Woodlands were available for commuters.  “But when I went down, there was no one to direct the crowd and no one knew where the buses were.  “So I called my husband to pick me up,” said the 36-year-old, adding that she had to cancel her wax treatment appointment because of the train fault.  Mr Kynan Yau, a polytechnic student who was on his way home to Woodlands from his internship in Dover, said he walked around the bus pickup location for about 30 minutes because he could not find the buses.  He said he had to cancel dinner plans with his parents because of the train fault. “I’ll just wait it out, see how else I can reach home,” said Mr Yau, 19. The bus services were halted after the fault was cleared, SMRT’s tweet at 7.04pm said. In a Facebook post, SMRT explained that three cars in the faulty train had no lights.  After commuters disembarked at Choa Chu Kang station, the train then went to the depot, where investigations into the fault were conducted."

According to Fuel Kaki, a pump price tracker initiated by the Consumers Association of Singapore, Caltex, Esso, Shell, Sinopec and SPC have adjusted prices since Wednesday. Sinopec, which has the smallest network of stations in Singapore, slashed the price of its premium 98-octane petrol by 29 cents a litre. Its 98-octane fuel, which is the next highest grade, is down 16 cents a litre. Both grades are now priced at $3.62 a litre. Shell was the next biggest mover, lowering prices by 20 cents a litre across its range of petrol. With the latest round of revisions, it costs $3.15 a litre for Shell's 95-octane petrol and $3.64 a litre for both its 98- and premium 98-octane fuels. SPC reduced prices by 16 cents a litre across all three grades of petrol it offers. Its posted petrol prices are now $3.10, $3.14 and $3.62 a litre for the 92-, 95- and 98-octane fuels. Esso's posted prices match SPC's for the 92- and 98-octane petrol. But at $3.15 a litre, its 95-octane petrol is a pricier. Caltex priced its petrol at $3.11, $3.19 and $3.83 per litre for the 92-, 95- and premium 98-octane fuels. Diesel prices are more closely aligned with just 2 cents a litre separating the most expensive (Caltex and Shell at $3.02 a litre) and the cheapest (Sinopec and SPC at $3 a litre). MPs had raised the issue of surging crude oil prices and the impact on drivers several times in recent Parliament sittings. On Tuesday, Minister of State for Trade and Industry Low Yen Ling said the Government will not regulate or cap pump prices as doing so distorts the market. But she added: ""The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore monitors the fuel market closely and will not hesitate to investigate the practices of the retail operators. ""We will take firm enforcement actions against any anti-competitive behaviour."" While he is glad pump prices are down, Mr Gordon Tiang, 47, from the telecommunications industry, said they are still high. ""It is good that prices are coming down. But the drop does not feel very significant. ""It still costs too much to fill up my car,"" said Mr Tiang, who pays more than $100 each time he fills up his 1.6-litre family sedan with 95-octane petrol."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/first-haul-of-greener-aviation-fuel-loaded-for-sia-and-scoot-flights-from-changi,First haul of greener aviation fuel loaded for SIA and Scoot flights from Changi,"SINGAPORE - The first batch of blended sustainable aviation fuel to be used on all Singapore Airlines (SIA) and Scoot flights departing from Changi Airport was loaded into the airport's fuel system on Thursday (July 7). This is part of a one-year pilot announced by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), SIA and GenZero, a Temasek-owned investment platform, last year. The joint statement by the three parties said besides the process of blending, certification and delivery of sustainable aviation fuel to Changi Airport, the trial will also provide insights into the end-to-end cost components, potential pricing structures to recover cost, as well as support future policy consideration for the deployment of such fuels. Under the pilot, 1,000 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel will be supplied by Neste, an oil refining company that has manufacturing set-ups in Finland, the Netherlands and Singapore. The product by Neste is made from used cooking oil and waste animal fats. This is blended with refined jet fuel at ExxonMobil's Singapore facility before being transported to Changi Airport. The use of the blended fuel over the one-year trial is expected to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 2,500 tonnes. Senior vice-president for corporate planning at SIA, Ms Lee Wen Fen, said the inaugural delivery of the sustainable fuel is an important milestone in its decarbonisation journey. According to the International Air Transport Association, commercial aviation is responsible for 2 per cent to 3 per cent of global carbon emissions. In 2021, SIA Group committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The company announced then that its airlines will achieve this target with several measures including investing in new-generation planes, adopting sustainable fuels and sourcing for high-quality carbon offsets. Sustainable aviation fuels are said to cost significantly more than conventional jet fuels. As part of the pilot, CAAS, Temasek and SIA have also started selling 1,000 units of sustainable aviation fuel credits as a way to bring down the higher cost. Each credit represents 2.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, bringing the total to 2,500 tonnes. Customers, including corporate and individual travellers, as well as freight forwarders, will be able to purchase these credits to offset their own carbon footprint while contributing to the development of the sustainable aviation fuel industry. From the last quarter of 2022, SIA customers will be able to buy a mix of such fuel credits and carbon credits as part of the airline's voluntary carbon offset programme. On its part, ExxonMobil has a global plan to provide 200,000 barrels of lower-emission fuels - which include sustainable aviation type - daily by 2030."

Instead of driving there like he used to, he took a ferry. He was among the 140 passengers who boarded the first Desaru-bound vessel as a new ferry service between Singapore and Desaru began operations on Thursday. Mr Chong said: ""We plan to visit the fruit farm, sightsee and relax at the clubhouse. As my granddaughter has never taken the ferry, I decided to take my family on this trip to have fun."" Another passenger, marketing manager Kim Low, was at the ferry terminal in Tanah Merah with his wife and two children, aged two and five, as well as his mother-in-law who had come from Japan. ""It's my first time going to Desaru. We wanted a short getaway with my mother-in-law while she is in Singapore and we booked it spontaneously last week since the ferry service is back,"" he said. ""We are planning to just relax there, perhaps visit the firefly park today and water park tomorrow. We will be staying for one night and returning to Singapore tomorrow."" A return ticket on the ferry costs $118, while a one-way ticket is $70. From July 7 to Oct 6, ferry operator Batam Fast is charging $98 for a return ticket for bookings via its website and social media pages. The ferry, which can take 250 passengers, operates from Thursdays to Sundays. It leaves Singapore at 8.30am and departs from Desaru at 5.30pm, with each trip taking around 90 minutes. Before the pandemic, travellers could take a 30-minute ferry ride from Changi Ferry Terminal to the Tanjung Belungkor Ferry Terminal in Kota Tinggi in Johor, followed by a 30- to 45-minute drive to Desaru. The ferry service was suspended from March 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Travellers can also reach Desaru by bus, with the ride taking about 2½ hours, depending on traffic conditions and Customs clearance. A spokesman for Batam Fast said it has seen good response for the ferry service. ""So far for this weekend, the departing trip on Saturday and return trip on Monday are fully booked. Even though we only offer trips from Thursdays to Sundays, we decided to open up for next Monday, a public holiday, for bookings due to the long (Hari Raya Haji) weekend,"" he added. Passengers should take along valid travel documents such as passports, entry visas, permits and vaccine certificates."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/coe-premiums-hit-all-time-high-of-110524-in-open-category,"COE premium hits all-time high of $110,524 in Open category","SINGAPORE - Certificate of entitlement (COE) premiums hit an all-time high of $110,524 in the Open category on Wednesday (July 6), reflecting market expectations that prices could rise further amid a projected decrease in supply.  The premium for Open category COE, which tends to be used to register larger cars, rose by 5.9 per cent from $104,400 at the last tender.  The previous record was $110,500, set in 1994 under a different classification, for cars above 2,000cc. Premiums also rose across all other categories. The COE premium for cars with engines smaller than 1,600cc and 130bhp, and fully electric vehicles (EVs) with up to 110 kilowatts of power, went up from $74,989 to $78,001 - a 4 per cent increase. For cars with larger engines, as well as more powerful EVs, the premium was $107,800, up 1.7 per cent from $106,001. The motorcycle COE premium rose from $10,302 to $10,889, an increase of 5.7 per cent. The commercial vehicle COE premium went up by 1.9 per cent from $53,011 to $54,001. The Straits Times had earlier reported that industry watchers expected to see record-breaking premiums due to projections that the three-month supply of COEs from August to October will be less than that of the current period.  Their projection was based on the low number of vehicles being taken off the road in the previous months. Deregistration figures recorded from April to June are the main determinant of the supply of COEs for the August to October period. In Wednesday’s tender exercise, the Open category was the biggest mover among the types of COE.  Open COEs, which can be used to register any kind of vehicles other than motorcycles, have to be used within three months after they are secured. Otherwise, the bidder will lose the $10,000 bid deposit. They are also transferable, so motor dealers can hold on to such COEs to use in the future. Mr Nicholas Wong, general manager of Kah Motor which distributes Honda cars, attributed the spike in the Open category COE premium partly to speculators. Currently, the oldest stock of Open COEs that can still be used will be from April, and had cost nearly $100,000 a piece. Traders hoping to profit from reselling the valid Open COEs at a future date would want premiums to keep rising, Mr Wong said. Bidding for COEs in the large-car category was more muted than earlier, with 695 bids submitted, compared with 822 bids seen at the previous tender. This suggests that car companies have fewer orders this time than before. There is still one more tender exercise in July before the new quota – expected to be announced next week – kicks in.  This gives dealers more urgency to secure their needed COEs at the latest tender, in anticipation of a bigger rush for COEs during tenders under the expected reduced quota. One motor dealer said: “If there were dealers who needed a COE and was waiting for a cheaper COE at the next round, well, good luck to them.” The record set in the Open category is the second type of COE premium to make history this year after the motorcycle COE premium hit $11,400 in March.  The previous record premium of $110,500 was set in December 1994 under different conditions. Besides having more categories – seven instead of the current five – tenders were held once a month, not twice. It was also a closed tender system so bidders could not enter or revise their bids as the exercise proceeded. COE prices fell in the months following the 1994 record as new government measures were introduced to curb speculation. Dr Zafar Momin, a former adjunct professor at Nanyang Business School, said that in the current high COE premium environment, dealers will try to shift demand forward and push consumers to buy now, on the fear of prices rising later on. What he expects is for rational car buyers to hold back on their purchase. While the restrictive COE supply means that premiums will not fall dramatically, Dr Momin said that it may be possible to see premiums ease slightly and gradually. This is not accounting for external factors – such as fleet operators needing to register more cars, which will drive up demand and hence COE prices – or the Government stepping in to curb premium increases, like it did in 1994. "
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/chinese-petrol-firms-lower-pump-prices-to-match-essos-rates,Chinese petrol firms lower pump prices to match Esso's rates,"SINGAPORE - China-owned fuel station operators have lowered petrol prices by another four cents a litre across the board - the third reduction since last Friday (July 1). According to Fuel Kaki, a pump price tracker initiated by the Consumers Association of Singapore, Sinopec cut rates on Tuesday (July 5), followed by fellow Chinese company SPC on Wednesday. Sinopec's posted petrol prices are now $3.31, $3.78 and $3.91 a litre for 95-, 98- and premium 98-octane fuels respectively. It also reduced diesel price by one cent, to $3.12 a litre, to match SPC's rate. SPC's prices are $3.26, $3.30 and $3.78 for 92-, 95- and 98-octane fuels respectively. Posted prices of these two Chinese operators are now in line with Esso's. Rates at the other two operators - Caltex and Shell - are around four cents higher. Esso still has the cheapest petrol after discount among brands with sizeable networks. Its 92-, 95- and 98-octane fuels are as low as $2.67, $2.75 and $3.10 a litre respectively (with DBS Esso card). Sinopec, which has only three stations, is retailing its 95- and 98-octane fuels at $2.59 and $2.97 a litre respectively (with OCBC cards). Like Shell, it does not offer 92-octane petrol."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/train-service-along-entire-thomson-east-coast-line-disrupted-by-signal-fault,Train service resumes on Thomson-East Coast Line after 3½ hour disruption,"SINGAPORE - A signal fault disrupted commutes along the entire Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) in both directions for about 3½ hours on Wednesday morning (July 6), and left some commuters stuck on six stalled trains. SMRT said in a statement on Facebook that the fault started at 8.05am, affecting 19 trains in total between the nine-station stretch from Woodlands North to Caldecott. The operator had first reported the signal fault on Twitter at around 8.25am, and said trains on the line were moving more slowly. At 8.40am, it said there was no service along the entire TEL – Singapore’s newest rail line – in both directions. Train service progressively resumed from 11.20am, said SMRT, and free bus services and bus bridging services ended at 11.45am. Commuters on 13 trains disembarked at the station platform within 10 minutes, SMRT said. The remaining commuters on the six trains that stalled between stations disembarked by 8.50am at the nearest stations, SMRT said, without specifying how many commuters were affected. There was full lighting and ventilation in the stalled trains while the commuters were on board, the transport operator said, adding that no one needed medical aid. Engineers from SMRT, the Land Transport Authority and Alstom, which supplied the TEL signalling system, were activated within five minutes, the operator said.  Staff were also deployed to help affected passengers at all stations, and announcements were made in trains and at stations to advise commuters to take alternative modes of transport, it added. “We are sorry for affecting your morning commute,” SMRT said. A long line of commuters were seen waiting for the bridging bus service outside Caldecott MRT station when The Straits Times arrived at about 9am. Those interviewed said they had been waiting for about 20 minutes for the bus, and that it took an hour in total before the first double-decker bridging bus arrived at the MRT station at 9.45am. Logistics operations manager Ryan Lee was an hour late to work because of the disruption. He said he reached Caldecott station at about 8.20am after transferring from the Circle Line, and was told to queue for the bridging bus service. “The SMRT staff were unsure of the bus arrival timing. At 9am, one said it was arriving in five minutes or so, but it never happened,” Mr Lee added. The 35-year-old ended up taking a private-hire car to his workplace in Upper Thomson. “If they had told me it would take so long, I could have found alternative transport earlier. There are not a lot of bus options at Caldecott,” he said. A commuter who wanted to be known only as Philip said the crowd at Mayflower station was about two to three times the usual size. ""There was a broadcast message at the station. It first said there was a delay, before announcing that there was no service,"" the 49-year-old civil servant added. He had arrived at Mayflower station at around 8am and waited for 20 minutes before taking a taxi to his office in Ghim Moh. Another commuter, who wanted to be known only as Ms Shen, 40, said she and her older sister were trapped for 40 minutes on a train between Mayflower and Springleaf stations after boarding it at about 8am. The property agent said the disruption cost her a meeting in Woodlands with a new tenant she was supposed to sign a contract with, while her older sister, who had just started a new job this week, was given a black mark by her boss as she ended up being 1½ hours late to work. “There was no driver on the train and no one we could turn to. Someone had even suggested pressing the emergency button to get attention,” she said. The train eventually started moving again, and Ms Shen was able to alight at Springleaf. But the promised bridging bus did not arrive and the only regular bus to Woodlands would have cost her another hour. “There was a lot of panic that went on as every minute passed, especially in an enclosed environment without any updates at all,” she added. This is the third fault on the TEL in recent months. On April 27, 50 commuters were stuck in a stalled train between Woodlands and Woodlands South stations for more than 1½ hours due to a train fault that morning. On May 19, SMRT said a signal fault caused trains to move more slowly in both directions across the entire TEL, resulting in an additional 10 minutes of waiting time for commuters. The TEL was opened in stages, with the first stage between Woodlands North and Woodlands South stations opening in January 2020, and the second stage - comprising six stations between Springleaf and Caldecott - opening for passenger service in August last year. TEL Stage 3, which will comprise 11 stations between Stevens and Gardens by the Bay, is set to open later this year. In preparation for this, SMRT and the Land Transport Authority have been testing the integrated systems and trains for TEL Stages 1 to 3 since early this year.  Between Feb 26 and May 29, train services on the TEL started later on weekends to carve out additional engineering hours for testing."

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/direct-flights-start-between-spore-and-pacific-island-territory-new-caledonia,Direct flights start between S'pore and Pacific island territory New Caledonia,"SINGAPORE - Holidaymakers can now catch direct flights between Singapore and New Caledonia, an idyllic group of islands in the Pacific Ocean known for their pristine blue waters. Flights to the French territory, which is about eight and a half hours long, are on sale by its carrier Aircalin, starting at 1,143 euros or S$1,660 for a round trip. This is the first time in more than 25 years that it is possible to fly direct from Singapore to New Caledonia, roughly two and a half hours by plane from Australia, said executive vice president of Changi Airport Group Tan Lye Teck on Saturday (July 2). In the 1960s, the French airline Union de Transports Aeriens (UTA) operated a service between Singapore and the territory's capital Noumea, he added in an address to Singaporean and New Caledonian media at Jewel in Changi Airport. This service - which was part of a multiple-part service to Paris - was taken over by Air France in 1992, which stopped the route in 1995. Mr Tan's address came a day after the first Aircalin plane touched down at Changi on Friday (July 1). The territory is an archipelago made up of several groups of islands. The main island is known as Grand Terre and is where its capital Noumea is located. The French overseas territory has a population of about 270,000, made up of various ethnic groups including the indigenous Kanak, French, as well as various others such as Javanese and Japanese. The islands are sparsely populated with 14 residents per sq km, and not heavily visited by tourists, said the general manager of New Caledonia Tourism Julie Laronde. The archipelago saw about 130,000 tourists a year before the Covid-19 pandemic, she added. Her agency has divided the main island into four distinct areas based on their draws for tourists. The east coast is known for its ""Kanak spirit"", the culture of the indigenous Kanak peoples who make up slightly less than half of the population; the west coast is known for its ""cowboy"" culture; and the capital Noumea is said to have a similar culture to the French Riviera region. The ""great south"", or the tip of the main island, is good for adventure-style holidays, and many of the smaller islands of the territory have lagoons rich in biodiversity, she said. Due to its proximity to Australia and New Zealand, English is widely spoken in New Caledonia - meaning Singaporeans should have little problem communicating, she added. The flights will be on the Airbus A330neo, which has a capacity of 291 seats.  The French Ambassador to Singapore Marc Abensour, who also spoke on Saturday, said the direct air link will serve both Singaporeans and French citizens in Singapore and the region, as France seeks to strengthen its connectivity to the Indo-Pacific region."

According to Fuel Kaki, a pump price tracker set up by the Consumers Association of Singapore, pump operators have cut posted prices by three to four cents more since Friday. Caltex started the ball rolling last Saturday morning, followed by Shell and then SPC on the same day.  Sinopec responded on Monday afternoon, followed by Esso later. As at 5.30pm on Monday, diesel is between $3.12 (SPC) and $3.14 (Caltex, Shell), while 92-octane petrol - dispensed only at Caltex, Esso and SPC - is $3.26 at Esso and $3.30 at Caltex and SPC. The popular 95-octane fuel is between $3.31 (Esso) and $3.35 (Caltex, Shell, Sinopec), while 98-octane petrol - necessary only for a minority of vehicles here - is between $3.78 (Esso) and $3.84 (Shell). The so-called premium 98-octane petrol is between $3.84 (Shell) and $3.99 (Caltex). After discounts, the lowest 92-octane price of $2.67 is at Esso (DBS Esso card). The cheapest 95-octane price is $2.63 at three-station operator Sinopec (OCBC cards). Among operators with sizeable networks, the lowest is $2.71 at Esso (DBS Esso card). Sinopec also has the lowest 98-octane price of $3 (with OCBC cards), followed by Esso’s $3.10 (DBS Esso card). After surging in the first half of this year on the back of supply chain woes and the Russia-Ukraine war, oil prices are now softening amid growing signs of an imminent global recession."

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/no-need-to-press-button-to-activate-green-man-just-wave-hand-lta-trial,Wave hand to activate green man: Contactless buttons on trial at four pedestrian crossings ,"SINGAPORE - They may look similar to the button one presses to activate the green man at a traffic junction, but at two new pedestrian crossings here, a wave of the hand is all that is needed to signal an intention to cross the road. As part of a six-month trial by the Land Transport Authority (LTA), contactless push buttons were on Thursday (June 30) installed in Jalan Besar, near Syed Alwi Road, and Tampines Street 86, close to Block 879A. By the end of this month, the buttons will also be on traffic light poles at new crossings in Bukit Batok Street 32, near St Anthony's Primary School, and Yishun Street 21, near Block 219. Signs with pictures showing how the contactless devices work will be on the traffic light poles at the four trial locations. Mr Jerry Heng, LTA's deputy director for traffic, street and commuter facilities lighting, said the current push buttons can become defective due to improper use. Worn out buttons may not send a signal for the green man when pushed, or they may get stuck and keep sending the same green man signal to the system. As they age, the buttons require more maintenance and, with more than 11,000 installed at about 2,400 traffic junctions, the work can add up. Over the years, some buttons have also been vandalised and abused through ""repeated triggering"", Mr Heng said. Due to misconceptions among pedestrians that each press will make the traffic light turn in their favour quicker, this has led to wear and tear being accelerated, reducing the button's expected 15- to 20-year lifespan, he added. The hope is that without the mechanical button and physical contact, the new contactless devices will be more reliable and easier to upkeep - saving costs and manpower in the long run. The contactless buttons also minimise the transmission of Covid-19 and other diseases, with similar trials conducted over the past couple of years in Australia and Canada for this reason. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported in November last year that touchless pedestrian button trials in Melbourne received positive feedback, and drew interest from New Zealand, Ireland and Singapore. According to the ABC report, the buttons used in the trials cost A$320 (S$305) - about A$100 more than the current ones. Mr Heng said that to keep the costs of the trial in Singapore low, the contactless buttons being tested here are modifications of the regular ones. But LTA may come up with a new form if the trial run succeeds. For now, there is still a button in the middle of the new device, but it cannot be used. On the right is an infrared sensor that will detect when a pedestrian waves his hand in front of it. A red light on the left will indicate if the wave has been registered, and a signal is sent for the green man to light up. It will take a few seconds or more for the green man to appear, depending on the traffic light cycle. Mr Heng said LTA will be evaluating whether the sensors in the contactless buttons are sensitive enough, and if they can withstand the weather here. The trial will also look at whether the devices can cope in busy areas, which is why the four trial locations are near amenities and schools with heavy pedestrian flows. Asked if he thinks pedestrians here will find it hard to change their habits, Mr Heng added that he is optimistic. ""In many other locations where it has been implemented, people are slowly adapting to this kind of technology-driven push-button system."" Pedestrians who have tried the contactless buttons welcomed the move. “It is a good idea, especially during this pandemic,” said Mr Martin Ng, who works in sales.  “Many people touch the buttons, so the virus could be on there.” However, the 44-year-old said the signs put up by the authorities for the trial are easy to miss. “They need bigger signs telling people to just wave,” he added. The new buttons may also pose challenges for the visually handicapped, said Mr Chong Kwek Bin, 41, who is visually impaired. “It is probably less reassuring for us, as we have no idea if the green man has been successfully activated. I would probably be feeling for the position of the sensor before waving my hand, which defeats the purpose,” Mr Chong added. “With the current buttons, we at least know when we have pressed it.”"
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/aviation-sector-must-focus-on-capacity-climate-and-collaboration-s-iswaran,"Aviation sector must focus on capacity, climate and collaboration: S. Iswaran","The global aviation industry needs to focus on three Cs - capacity building, climate action and collaboration - to deal with existing and future challenges. Speaking at the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) Global Support Symposium in Istanbul on June 28, Transport Minister S. Iswaran said this would ensure safe, smooth and sustainable recovery. ""We are coming out of a pandemic. The aviation industry was decimated, but is now showing promising signs of recovery. Recovery is uneven across the world. In terms of priorities, what we need is a recovery that is safe, smooth and sustainable"", he noted. On collaboration, Minister Iswaran said: ""The road to recovery is not just about one country or one airport or one airline. This is really about the international aviation community coming together."" This is where ICAO can play an important role, he added; by bringing the different players together and sharing best practices from diverse contexts. It is also important to look at not just what the industry is dealing with today, but what needs to be done to be ready for tomorrow's challenges. He said: ""In other words, you do not want to be in a situation where we are still fighting the last pandemic, when a new variant comes about that poses a different type of challenge."" The general consensus is that this is not the last pandemic that the world will have to face. So there is a need for some scenario planning, to think about the different kinds of challenges that may surface in future, and the protocols that may be need to respond to them, he said. ICAO can play an important role in working with member states and other international organisations, like the WHO, to think through the different challenges that might come up, and how the aviation industry could respond to them, Minister Iswaran added. Partnerships are also important, he stressed. And based on Singapore's experience, these are strongest and resources are most effectively mobilised - when they are focused on specific needs and purposes. Singapore is happy to work with ICAO on various initiatives, an example being the Singapore-ICAO Developing Countries Training Programme (DCTP). Mr Iswaran said: ""We can relate to it because we have benefited from such assistance in the past. So, we want to share our expertise and partner ICAO in its global implementation support efforts today. We recognise that there is a need for young aviation professionals."" Singapore is also partnering ICAO to develop the ICAO-Singapore DGCAs Programme on Aviation Resilience - to equip civil aviation leaders with new skills and competencies to seize new opportunities as they rebuild their respective aviation sectors. The symposium in Turkey brought together ICAO Member States to exchange information and views on the latest trends, innovations, training, digitalisation and best practices to support a safe, smooth and sustainable future for global aviation."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/pump-prices-fall-for-first-time-in-months,Pump prices in S'pore fall for first time since April,"SINGAPORE - Fuel pump prices have dipped across several brands - the first time since April. According to Fuel Kaki, a pump price tracker initiated by Consumers Association of Singapore, Caltex, Esso and Shell dropped posted prices mostly by two to four cents a litre on Friday (July 1). Shell however, slashed its so-called premium petrol by 25 cents, in an apparent bid to shore up falling sales. The two Chinese companies - Sinopec and SPC - have yet to adjust prices, but are expected to do so soon. With the change, 92-octane petrol is now between $3.30 (Esso) and $3.34 (Caltex, SPC), while the popular 95-octane is between $3.35 (Esso) and $3.39 (Caltex, Shell, Sinopec). The 98-octane grade, which is necessary for a minority of cars here, is between $3.82 (Esso) and $3.88 (Shell), while its premium variant ranges from $3.88 (Shell) to $4.05 (Caltex). Diesel is now between $3.14 (Esso) and $3.17 (Caltex, Shell). The latest adjustment makes Esso the brand with the least expensive fuels, and Caltex the costliest. After discount, the least costly petrol among operators with a sizeable station network is Esso's 92-octane at $2.71 a litre (with DBS Esso card), followed closely by its 95-octane at $2.75 (DBS Esso card). Sinopec's 95-octane is lower at $2.66 (OCBC cards), but it has only three stations. For 98-octane petrol, the cheapest is Sinopec at $3.03 a litre (OCBC cards), followed by Esso's $3.13 (DBS Esso card). Brent crude closed on the Nasdaq on Thursday at below US$115 a barrel, from above US$123 earlier in the month. The benchmark oil however was trading as low as US$110 before recovering late last week. RBOB Gasoline, a proxy for refined petrol, traded at US$3.54 a gallon in early trade on Friday, from US$4.28 earlier in the month. Prices of oil and refined products have been on the uptrend since world economies started reopening early this year after more than 24 months of Covid-19 restrictions. Producers that had scaled down operations during the pandemic had difficulty scaling them up to meet the surge in demand.  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February worsened the situation as the two are also oil producers, and Western trade sanctions on Moscow added fuel to the fire.  But now, energy demand may start to wane with a global recession looming, sparking a softening of prices. Even so, oil companies have been reporting a surge in profits. According to reports compiled by news outfit USAToday in May, Shell trebled its first-quarter earnings to US$9.1 billion (S$12.7 billion), while BP posted a first-quarter profit of US$6.2 billion - its highest in over a decade. Exxon (marketing the Esso brand of fuels) more than doubled its earnings in the first three months of the year to US$5.48 billion, and Chevron (marketing the Caltex brand of fuels) posted first-quarter earnings of US$6.26 billion - more than four times what it made at the same time last year."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/chinese-bicycle-sharing-firm-enters-singapore,"Chinese bike-sharing firm, HelloRide, enters S'pore","SINGAPORE - The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has allowed a Chinese bicycle-sharing operator to set up shop here - the first time since China-based players exited the market, leaving a mess of uncollected bikes and unpaid user refunds. In a statement on Friday (July 1) morning, the authority said HelloRide, a major player in China, has been awarded a Type 2 sandbox licence to operate a fleet of up to 1,000 shared bicycles. Type 2 licences are valid for up to one year, after which operators need to apply for Type 1 (full) licences that allow them to operate a larger fleet. LTA said it would evaluate factors such as the applicant's track record and its ability to manage indiscriminate parking and ensure healthy fleet utilisation. There are currently two other bicycle-sharing operators in Singapore - Anywheel and SG Bike - and both are local players with Type 1 licenses. With HelloRide, the total number of shared bikes here stands at 36,000. While bicycle-sharing services are supposed to provide commuters with convenient first- and last-mile commutes, past experiences with such services have been less than rosy. A slew of Chinese operators began flooding the market with hundreds of thousands of bicycles about five years ago. These bicycles were often strewn about, blocking walkways and ending up in canals. Occupancy rate was extremely low, and when the players exited Singapore, users were left with unpaid deposits and no recourse. The LTA has since implemented QR code parking, which can track indiscriminate parking and penalise irresponsible users. ""Since the introduction of the QR code parking system and user ban in January 2019, more than 90 per cent of shared bicycle users now end their trips at designated parking areas,"" LTA said. Even so, complaints of strewn bikes are beginning to resurface. In response to queries from The Straits Times, an LTA spokesman said that in the first half of the year, the authority had received about 257 instances of feedback a month on indiscriminate bicycle parking, down from around 1,300 a month before QR parking was introduced in 2019. She added that operators are required to impose an additional fee of $5 on users who do not park at designated public parking areas and scan a tagged QR code to end a trip.  “Those who fail to do so three times or more in a calendar year will be banned from using all bicycle-sharing services for at least a month,” the spokesman said, with recalcitrant users facing a ban of up to a year. As at end-May, more than 2,750 users have been banned, with repeat offenders accounting for around 7 per cent. "

The announcement was made at a signing ceremony for the memorandum of understanding between the two parties on Thursday (June 30). When launched in June next year, the cars can be booked through the SP smartphone app or the Kinto Share app operated by Borneo Motors. This will be the first time that users of SP Group's services can hire a car through its smartphone app. Ms Jasmine Wong, the chief executive of Inchcape Singapore and Greater China, which owns Borneo Motors, said: ""With this initiative, we combine our expertise in electrified vehicles with SP Group's eco-charging solutions to embark on a significant step in steering the nation towards a more responsible and sustainable way of living."" In addition, Borneo Motors and SP Group will set up an innovation and experience centre in the housing estate to help Tengah residents learn about sustainable mobility solutions. Borneo Motors launched Kinto Share last year for its on-demand car-sharing service with Lexus models. On its website, prices for daily rental start from $198. The collaboration with SP Group will see the vehicles being parked at dedicated carparks in the Tengah township. The exact details are still being worked out. This is the first time Kinto Share will serve a housing estate. Currently, users of the car-sharing service pick up the vehicles from the Lexus Boutique in Leng Kee Road. They can also pay for doorstep delivery and retrieval. SP Group and Borneo Motors are also conducting joint research in electrification, focusing on areas such as user behaviour and vehicle energy consumption, to further develop their future electric mobility programmes. The pilot, which runs for five years, will initially have eight Toyota models, seven of which are hybrids that do not require access to an EV charger. The eighth is the bZ4X, the Japanese car brand's first fully-electric vehicle, which will be officially launched in Singapore by then. A plug-in hybrid model is said to be in the pipeline. To encourage take-up, Tengah residents will be offered preferential rates for both the car rental and EV charging. Located in the western part of Singapore, Tengah consists of five districts with 42,000 residential units. Touted as a ""smart-energy town"", it features EV-ready carparks. Solar panels located on the top of residential blocks supply the needed electricity to power selected parking lots with EV chargers."

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/car-emissions-scheme-to-be-tightened-from-2024,"Car emissions scheme extended until end-2023, thresholds to be tightened from 2024","SINGAPORE - Car buyers and sellers here will be nudged further to adopt environmentally cleaner models such as electric vehicles (EVs) when a tightened emissions scheme kicks in from 2024. This is a year later than expected, as the current scheme is due to expire at the end of this year. The Straits Times understands this was because the motor trade had appealed for more time so that manufacturers could make changes to meet stricter standards.  In a joint announcement on Thursday (June 30) morning, the National Environment Agency (NEA) and Land Transport Authority (LTA) said the current Vehicular Emissions Scheme (VES) - which is valid till Dec 31, 2022 - will continue for another year with no change. But from Jan 1, 2024, thresholds for the various pollutant levels in the carrot-and-stick scheme will be lowered. Among the bigger changes are nitrogen oxide and particulate matter levels - two pollutants that have direct and serious health implications. For instance, the nitrogen oxide threshold is lowered by as much as 30 per cent and the particulate matter threshold by as much as 50 per cent.  ""The more stringent thresholds for emissions of carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter clearly distinguish pure internal combustion engine cars, cleaner alternatives such as hybrids, and electric vehicles,"" the announcement read. The two agencies added that there will be no change to the VES rebate till Dec 31, 2023, and no change to the VES surcharge till Dec 31, 2025. Rebates applicable from Jan 1, 2024, will be announced in 2023. Examples of cars which currently meet the tightened A1 band - the highest standards which qualify them for the highest tax rebate - include the Tesla Model 3 and S (including Performance variants), Nissan Leaf, Hyundai Ioniq, MG ZS EV, and Hyundai Kona Electric. Those that will fall into the lowest C2 band - which attracts the heftiest surcharge - include the Mercedes-Benz C180, Toyota Vios, Audi Q3 and Honda Odyssey. Mr Ron Lim, head of sales and marketing at Nissan agent Tan Chong Motor Sales, said: “Considering the current backdrop of escalating certificate of entitlement prices and global supply chain challenges, the decision to delay tightening the current VES limits... is definitely welcome news.  “Hopefully, with the new 18-month lead time, industry players will now have more time to work with their respective manufacturers to get appropriate models which meet the new VES limits.” Ms Sabrina Sng, managing director at Wearnes Automotive in charge of Swedish EV brand Polestar, said: ""I think the measures are in the right direction, to encourage consideration of cleaner emission vehicles. But the incentive amount needs to be higher to get wider and quicker EV adoption. ""In countries such as Norway and the Netherlands, EVs are cheaper than internal combustion engine cars - that makes it much easier to swing consumers."" A BMW Asia spokesman said the announcement was “a strong signal from the Government to encourage drivers to switch to cleaner vehicles” and for manufacturers to “provide viable options to customers”.  She added that BMW Group will be expanding its electrified fleet “in the coming months and years”. The start of the stricter VES in 2024 coincides with the transition to a new benchmark cars imported to Singapore have to meet.  The so-called Worldwide Harmonised Light-duty Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP), which measures vehicle pollutant levels under more realistic conditions and which has been in place in Europe for a number of years now, will kick in here for all new car models from Jan 1, 2024. With WLTP, some models that currently qualify for VES rebates may fall into the neutral B band. Parallel importers reckon one such model will be the Honda Vezel Hybrid, one of their bestsellers. If so, the Vezel will no longer have an advantage over the HR-V - an export version of the Vezel sold by authorised Honda agent Kah Motor.  “Unless Japan can lower the emissions of the Vezel, we will lose a lot of sales,” one said. But authorised agents said one main reason why parallel imports have this edge is because the authorities allow such cars to have an emissions concession. The so-called evolution coefficient applies a 0.92 factor to the tested emission levels of parallel imports, on account that these cars are not run in like manufacturer-sourced models when test values are captured. "

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/surcharge-hike-for-taxi-rides-from-changi-airport-extended-by-six-months-until-end-2022,Extra $3 surcharge for taxi rides from Changi Airport extended until end-2022,"SINGAPORE - Passengers taking a taxi from Changi Airport will continue to pay an additional $3 per trip until the end of the year, as the increase in the location surcharge will be extended by six months. The increased surcharge - which Changi Airport Group (CAG) had earlier said was aimed at ensuring a better supply of cabs to the airport - kicked in on May 19 and was originally supposed to end on June 30. This surcharge hike will now be extended until Dec 31, 11.59pm, said taxi operator Strides Taxi, a subsidiary of public transport company SMRT, in a Facebook post on Thursday (June 23). ComfortDelGro, Prime Taxi and Premier Taxi published notices of the extension  on Friday (June 24). Under current regulations, taxi fares here are determined by the operators. Any changes must be lodged with the Public Transport Council in advance and publicised at least seven days beforehand. With the increase, taxi rides starting from the airport, Changi Air Freight Centre, the Airport Police Station and the Airport Logistics Park of Singapore, will cost an additional $8 every day from 5pm to 11.59pm, and an additional $6 at all other times. Before the fare hike, the airport surcharge was $5 on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from 5pm to 11.59pm, and $3 at all other times. The decision to raise the surcharge had come amid a reluctance from cabbies to go to the airport to pick up passengers despite a revival in international air travel, resulting in a shortage of cabs and long queues at the airport's taxi stands. Increasing the surcharge drew more cabs back to Changi, but taxi drivers had told The Straits Times that it does not make up for petrol costs, which have risen by 30 to 40 per cent in the past six months, and the long wait of up to an hour for a fare. Responding to ST’s queries, a CAG spokesman said the surcharge hike has improved the supply of taxis at Changi Airport, but did not provide more details. When ST visited Changi Airport Terminal 3 on Friday morning, there were about 30 taxis queuing outside of the arrival hall and passengers were able to board a cab almost immediately. Cabbies interviewed were not aware that the airport surcharge hike would be extended, but said they welcomed the move. Mr Toh Cheng Chuan, 68, who has been a taxi driver for 17 years, said he enjoyed picking up fares from the airport because of the increased surcharge.  “I have been going to the airport more frequently. Aside from the surcharge, there are also more passengers because there are more flights,” he said. Another cabby, Mr Lim Whay Yuan, said he is more attracted by CAG’s own incentive scheme, in which cabbies can earn a daily $10 reward if they make a minimum of three trips to the airport during specific time windows. “I made an additional $150 in April thanks the incentive. It really adds up,” Mr Lim said. The incentive scheme will end on June 30. Asked about the surcharge hike, the 70-year-old added: “Maybe they’re trying to get more taxis to come because they’re trying to open up the airport. They say Changi is the best airport in the world, so how can there be no taxis?” However, Mr Jovin Lim, 54, who drives a seven-seater cab and makes 10 to 12 trips to the airport daily, said that the surcharge has attracted a lot of smaller taxis to the airport, resulting in longer queues. “The surcharge makes it difficult for bigger cabs. I waste a lot of time queuing,” he said. During an announcement earlier this month (June 10) that Terminal 4 will reopen in September and operations at Terminal 2 will be increased to half by October, Transport Minister S. Iswaran had said that the response to the increased surcharge ""has been good and generally managing well with demand"". But the minister also said that the situation at Changi is very dynamic. ""When passenger volume goes up, you have to basically see how flexibly we can respond. What we see now is the taxi services have caught up,"" he told reporters. ""But whether we need to do more, whether we need further adjustments, I think this is something that we are constantly monitoring because this is really a period of quite rapid changes,"" he added. Last month, 2.47 million passengers passed through Changi Airport - a 28 per cent increase from 1.93 million in April, and 14 times more than in May last year. With travel restrictions easing globally, Changi Airport's handling capacity is expected to return to pre-Covid-19 levels of 70 million passengers per year by October. Currently, only T1 and T3 are fully open. They have the capacity to handle 46 million passengers a year, two-thirds of 2019 volumes. T2, which had been undergoing upgrading works for the past two years, will reopen in phases over the next two years. The expansion of the terminal is expected to be completed by 2024. Separately, Strides Taxi will also be raising the charter rates for its London taxis starting from July 1. It will cost $75 to charter a London taxi for airport arrival transfers and $65 for airport departure transfers - up from the current rates of $55 and $50 respectively. The point-to-point charter fare for Strides Taxi's London cabs and the hourly charter rate will also go up to $65, from $50 now. Strides Mobility Services senior general manager Yeow How Pheng said the charter rates were raised due to market demand and rising fuel costs. “We will continue to monitor market conditions and review the charter rates accordingly,” he added."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/singapore-to-study-use-of-communications-satellite-to-allow-pilots-to-talk-to-air-traffic-control,S'pore to study use of communications satellite to allow pilots to talk to air traffic control,"SINGAPORE - A study to examine the benefits of a space-based system to allow pilots to talk to air traffic controllers will see Singapore involved in the launch of a communication satellite into space. It is the first such study of its kind and if successful, will help to shape international aviation laws and make air travel safer, said the four organisations involved. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and the Economic Development Board's Office for Space Technology and Industry (OSTIn) will work with two firms to launch a purpose-built satellite carrying communications equipment into space next year. CAAS and OSTIn signed a memorandum of understanding on Tuesday (June 21) with air transport IT firm Sita and satellite platform Startical for the one-year study to improve communications in air traffic control. In a joint statement, the organisations noted that as current Very High Frequency (VHF) stations are ground-based, there is limited or no VHF voice communications coverage over oceanic, mountainous or remote areas beyond the range of ground-based stations. Pilots and air traffic controllers communicate via VHF voice communications in instances such as aircraft landing or change in flight paths. ""Space-based VHF voice communications will have more comprehensive coverage, which helps to enhance the safety and efficiency of air traffic management,"" they added. The study will examine the possibility of using space-based VHF voice communications between pilots and air traffic controllers, and its benefits over existing ground-based VHF voice communications. The four organisations noted that while technical studies on the concept have been conducted previously, the upcoming trial is the first involving a purpose-built satellite. CAAS will present the results and data from the trial to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the International Telecommunication Union for consideration. The information gleaned will help both organisations in setting standards for space-based VHF voice communications, the joint statement said. CAAS director-general Han Kok Juan said: ""Space-based VHF communications technology could be transformative; it could boost safety and efficiency and make aviation more sustainable, while increasing capacity to meet rising air travel demand. ""This proof of concept, if successful, will be a significant step forward towards global endorsement and adoption."" With air travel expected to grow post-pandemic, more planes will be taking to the skies in the coming years. ICAO said no fewer than 200,000 flights are expected to take off and land daily worldwide by mid-2030s - almost double the number before Covid-19. Before the pandemic, Asia-Pacific was the fastest growing region in terms of air traffic. The International Air Transport Association said air traffic through the region is expected to recover to 2019 levels by 2025, a year after the rest of the world."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/coe-prices-end-higher-with-premiums-for-big-cars-crossing-100k-for-second-tender-in-a-row,"COE prices end higher, premiums for big cars cross $100k for second tender in a row","SINGAPORE - Certificate of entitlement (COE) premiums rose across all categories at the latest tender exercise that closed on Wednesday (June 22). This was the first tender exercise since COE premiums broke the $100,000 mark in two categories on June 8. The price for cars with engines bigger than 1,600cc or 130bhp and fully electric vehicles (EVs) with a power output of above 110 kilowatts went up by 5.3 per cent from $100,684 to $106,001. In the Open category, which tends to be used to register larger cars, the premium ended at $104,400 - 3.7 per cent above the $100,697 registered previously. The price for smaller cars and less powerful EVs also went up by 1.6 per cent from $73,801 to $74,989. Commercial vehicle COE premiums edged up by $9 to end at $53,011. The price of COEs for motorcycles went up by 3 per cent, from $10,000 to $10,302. Some car dealers, both authorised dealers and parallel importers, said the number of unsuccessful bids registered in the two most recent tender exercises reflects how severely the supply of COEs is falling behind the demand for cars.  In the category for larger cars, there were 822 bids vying for 531 COEs in the latest tender, which meant 291 bidders failed to secure COEs. There was a similar number of failed bids in the June 8 exercise. And in the four exercises before that, the number of excess bids were between 128 and 186. Bids for such COEs are entered only when there is a buyer waiting to register a car. Those who have failed in the earlier exercises will bid again in subsequent tenders for the dealers to put their cars on the road.  COE tender exercises run for three days. Normally, bids are only entered on the final day, often minutes before the closing.  In the latest tender exercise that closed on Wednesday, an observer noted that there were already 89 bids registered by 6pm on Tuesday in the large car category. While these bids can be from individual car buyers who are looking to secure COEs privately, that is not a common practice. Instead, the observer suggested that it may be from the American EV brand Tesla.  Unlike most car brands that price their cars with COEs, Tesla does not do so. When the vehicle is ready for registration, the buyer authorises Tesla to bid on their behalf, up to an agreed level above the last COE price. This can vary between 5 per cent and 8 per cent, or even more, depending on the situation when the deal was done.  This allows Tesla to put in the maximum price that it is authorised to bid early on in the exercise and not have to repeatedly adjust upwards as the tender exercise develops, as other brands would do. The supply of Teslas to Singapore seems to have taken a hit due to production shortages in recent months. From April to May, only 10 Teslas were registered. This is significantly below the average of 60 units a month seen in the first quarter of 2022. If Tesla is the one putting in the bulk of advance bids, then the brand has likely received a sufficient shipment of cars and is getting ready for registration.  Other car dealers have also been holding more roadshows away from their showrooms to reach customers. The orders taken would drive the need for COEs. Additionally, there are signs that LTA’s announcement to move lesser powered mass market EVs into the small car COE category in May could also be partially responsible for the higher COE premium for smaller cars.  In May, Chinese brand MG registered 100 units of its ZS EV SUV, which is one of the EVs to benefit from the change. The brand had registered just 32 units in total in the first four months of the year. Mr Eddie Loo, president of the Singapore Vehicle Traders Association, said it is clear demand for COEs is outstripping supply.  He added: “At this rate, we may really have to accept the $100,000 COE premium as the new norm.” Meanwhile, motorcycle COE premiums are on the rise again just months after the Land Transport Authority acted to “encourage prudent bidding behaviour” in March, when prices had hit a high of $11,400.  It halved the validity period to use the motorcycle COE after it is secured from six to three months and raised the bidding deposit from $200 to $800. These measures apply to COEs secured from the second exercise in March. Those from earlier exercises would still be valid for six months. Mr Rex Tan, president of the Singapore Motor Cycle Trade Association, does not regard the high motorcycle COE premiums seen on Wednesday as a sign that the measures are losing effectiveness.  Instead, he said dealers may be putting in a last-ditch effort to keep premiums high. This is because the expensive COEs secured at the end of last year, at the cost of $9,601 with a six-month validity, and those from March, which are valued at $10,501 and are valid for three months, would all expire by this round."

What is happening?,"SINGAPORE - Flight disruptions and baggage issues caused by a manpower shortage worldwide have plagued airports in the last few months. The Straits Times takes a look at why these problems are occurring and what travellers can do to reduce the risk of being affected. A: The primary reason for the surge in flight cancellations and baggage issues is the manpower crunch faced by several airports worldwide. The International Air Transport Association said on Monday (June 20) that the global aviation sector is now employing about 44 million people. This is slightly less than half of the 90 million people employed by the sector in 2019. A: Airports, airlines and ground handlers worldwide have laid off tens of thousands of workers since the Covid-19 pandemic started in early 2020. Many other remaining workers have also left the sector in search of better job security, amid the uncertainty about the prospects for air travel. As governments worldwide eased border restrictions in response to reduced public health concerns, air travel has recovered at a faster rate than expected. With travellers returning to airports more quickly than workers, some airports have been overwhelmed. Covid-19 outbreaks among airport staff are an additional drag on manpower. The situation in Europe has also been exacerbated by strikes in recent weeks. A: The problems caused by the manpower crunch have been most apparent in London, Amsterdam and Dublin. At the Heathrow Airport in London, airlines were asked to cancel 10 per cent of their schedules on Monday, affecting an estimated 15,000 passengers on 90 flights. A shortage of workers in baggage handling had led to long delays, leaving thousands of unclaimed bags piling up over the weekend after passengers waiting for hours had left in frustration. Gatwick, Britain's second-busiest airport, said it would limit flights to 825 a day in July and 850 a day in August, from a pre-pandemic peak of around 950 services. Amsterdam Airport Schiphol said that passenger numbers would be capped at about 20 per cent below usual levels at the busiest times in July. At the Dublin Airport in Ireland, a check-in queue was seen stretching way beyond the airport even before daybreak in late May. On May 29, more than 1,000 passengers missed flights due to queues and a lack of airport staff. Disputes over pay have also led to strikes by some workers, thus further disrupting flights. For example, airport workers in Paris and air traffic controllers in Italy have gone on strike in recent weeks. A: In the United States, about 15,000 flights were cancelled between last Friday and Sunday. The flight cancellations were attributed to Covid-19 cases among aviation staff, poor weather and shortage in manpower, including among pilots. Long check-in queues and wait time for luggage or check-ins have also been reported in Australia and India. For now, Europe and the United States are the primary regions afflicted by airport congestion. But industry observers have warned that Asian airports, if not managed properly, could very well be next to face such issues. A: Travellers should consider buying travel insurance. Mr Aaron Wong, founder of travel hacks site The MileLion, said: ""No one should be heading overseas without travel insurance, in particular a policy with solid coverage for travel inconveniences like delayed or lost luggage and missed connections."" Travellers flying from Switzerland, Iceland, Norway or an European Union airport can tap the EC261 flight disruption compensation when their flights are delayed or cancelled. The EC261 is an EU law which protects the rights of air passengers. But travellers will not be entitled to compensation if flights are disrupted owing to ""extraordinary circumstances,"" such as strikes or bad weather. In buying insurance, travellers should try to get coverage for costs related to flight disruptions such as pre-paid fees for hotels, car rentals and tours. A: Travellers can temporarily avoid travelling for leisure to places where the manpower crunch at airports has been well documented. When booking hotels, choose the most flexible cancellation policies. To minimise inconvenience arising from delayed baggage, travellers should pack all essentials in carry-on bags, said Mr Wong. Essential items include chargers, medication and important documents. Mr Wong added: ""While departures from Changi Airport are still manageable, you should budget one to two extra hours on top of your regular buffer time for check-ins when flying back to Singapore. ""With loads so high now, missing your flight may mean not being able to get a seat home for a few days."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/travellers-may-get-new-passports-within-days-if-online-appeal-is-successful-ica,Travellers may get new passports within days if appeal is successful: ICA,"SINGAPORE - Travellers who need to go overseas urgently may be able to receive their new passports within days if their online appeal is successful, according to an update on the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority's (ICA) website. The website, which The Straits Times understands was updated earlier this month, noted that for urgent requests, ICA will reply within a week, or at least two days before the intended date of travel, whichever is earlier. Those who are applying through the online appeal form will have to upload supporting documents such as hotel reservations, flight tickets and a travel itinerary. The form, which takes about 10 minutes to complete, will also require them to indicate their date of intended travel. Those whose appeals are successful will be able to collect their passports at the ICA Building in Lavender or at one of the 27 post offices. Previously, travellers were told to expect a waiting time of at least six weeks for new passports. More than 5,000 passports are issued by ICA every day, almost thrice the number in 2019. Last month, long queues had formed outside the ICA Building as travellers rushed to renew their passports ahead of the holidays which began on May 28. In the website update, ICA said that travellers should ensure that the photograph they submit meets ICA's photo guidelines. Photographs must be taken with even brightness, within the last three months and with a neutral facial expression. The shoulders and hair must be fully visible and the photo background must be white in colour. Applicants who would like to check on their passport application status can do so by logging on to the MyICA website. To submit an urgent appeal, the public can visit this website."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/dhl-adds-80-electric-vans-and-105-chargers-as-part-of-net-zero-emissions-target,DHL adds 80 electric vans and 105 chargers as part of net-zero emissions target,"SINGAPORE - Logistics company DHL Express will have an additional 80 electric vehicles (EVs) on its delivery fleet in Singapore by October this year, bringing the total tally to 90, out of the 390 delivery vehicles it operates here. The announcement was made at the EV fleet expansion event held at DHL Express' facility at Greenwich Drive on Tuesday (June 21) in the presence of Transport Minister S. Iswaran. These vehicles are expected to cover 30 per cent of DHL's daily routes. Mr Christopher Ong, the managing director of DHL Express Singapore, said: ""By transitioning to electric vehicles, DHL Express Singapore is set to eliminate a total of 323 tonnes of CO2 emissions yearly."" DHL's latest additions are Citroen e-Dispatch vans which can carry up to one tonne of load. A fully charged vehicle has a range of up to 339km. For DHL deliveries, the vehicles travel just over 100km daily to cover delivery routes. These 80 vans are on a five-year leasing and maintenance contract with ComfortDelGro Rent-A-Car, a subsidiary of the transport giant. To support the new EVs, 105 EV chargers will be installed in DHL's service centres. This is believed to be largest deployment of EV chargers for a commercial application in Singapore yet. The Siemens 7 kilowatt AC chargers are supplied and installed by private charging firm, EVOne Charging. The charging system is able to manage the electric load on the facility's network, enabling DHL to monitor the EVs' energy usage pattern as well as help with allocating charging slots to the vehicles. By opting for AC chargers instead of the faster but also more energy intensive DC chargers, the installation at DHL's service centres is not expected to require major upgrade to its power supply grid. Three hours of charging will add approximately 85 km of operating range to the vehicle. A full charge for a completely flat battery will take up to nearly 11 hours. In January this year, DHL used 10 EV vans in a pilot programme to test the charging capabilities and gain experience with using these vehicles. They consisted of the Citroen e-Dispatch and the electric version of the Renault Kangoo, which has a smaller payload. A part of Deutsche Post, DHL targets to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Globally, the company has partnered with fuel suppliers Neste and BP to secure more than 800 million litres of sustainable aviation fuel until 2026. DHL also wants to electrify 60 per cent of its global last-mile delivery fleet by 2030. Other major logistics companies have also announced their EV transition plans. German rival, DB Schenker, wants to make its transport activities in European cities emission-free by 2030 while American company FedEx is targeting to have an all-electric global pick-up and delivery fleet by 2040. Singapore has also been pushing to electrify more vehicles. The Land Transport Authority has said that it will electrify half of the country's public bus fleet by 2030. Taxis that run on batteries are allowed to stay in service for 10 years instead of eight. Businesses looking for commercial vehicles are also incentivised to choose EVs over conventional options. The Commercial Vehicles Emissions Scheme encourages buyers to opt for lower emission vans. While most, if not all, diesel vans will fall into the surcharge banding and is liable for a $10,000 surcharge, an EV alternative can qualify for a $30,000 rebate, which is disbursed to the buyer over three years."

They are SMRT bus service numbers 75, 960 and 960E; SBS Transit bus service numbers 56, 70M, 111, 133, 162M, 195 and 502; Tower Transit bus service numbers 77, 97, 106 and 857; and Go-Ahead Singapore bus service numbers 36 and 518. SMRT said in a statement on Tuesday that its bus services would not stop at two bus stops in Raffles Avenue. Both SBS Transit and Tower Transit said on their websites that their respective bus services would skip 11 bus stops in Raffles Avenue, Bayfront Avenue, Central Boulevard and Marina Boulevard. Go-Ahead Singapore said its bus services would skip bus stops in Bayfront Avenue, Raffles Avenue and Temasek Avenue. All four operators said their bus services would be affected from 7.30am to10.30pm on Saturday. This year's National Day Parade will be held at the Marina Bay floating platform and will be open to the public, the first time in two years.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/commuters-welcome-resumption-of-ktm-train-service-between-jb-and-woodlands,Commuters welcome resumption of KTM train service between JB and Woodlands,"SINGAPORE - The Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM) train service between Johor Bahru and Woodlands restarted on Sunday (June 19) after being suspended for more than two years due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Its resumption was welcomed by commuters, who said travelling by train is faster and more convenient than taking a bus or going by car. Ms Elaine Ng, 33, who stayed up past 3am on June 13 to secure tickets to JB the moment they went on sale, said she prefers taking the train because it beats getting stuck in a road traffic jam on the Causeway. ""When I went to JB by car last month on a Saturday morning, it took about three hours for me to get there because of how busy it was,"" said Ms Ng, who is a logistics manager. Another commuter, 44-year-old healthcare worker Stephanie Lee, said a perk of taking the train was not having to wake up early in the morning to beat the crowd at the Woodlands checkpoint. ""With tickets bought in advance, we just have to arrive before boarding time and we are guaranteed a seat,"" she said. Ms Lee added that immigration clearance is also faster as the passport is stamped by both Singapore and Malaysian officers before commuters board the train. ""So it saves time from having to go through immigration twice (which happens when) you take a bus,"" she said. Also known as the Tebrau Shuttle, the train service was suspended on March 24, 2020, to curb the spread of Covid-19. It now runs 31 trips daily - with 18 from JB Sentral to Woodlands and 13 from Woodlands to JB Sentral. Each trip is about five minutes. Trains to JB run from 8.30am to 11.45pm, while those to Woodlands run from 5am to 10.45pm. Around 7,000 passengers are expected to use the service daily, with trip capacity at 320 passengers. The ticket costs $5 for a trip from Woodlands to JB, and RM5 (S$1.60) from JB to Woodlands. They are sold about a month in advance. In comparison, the cross-border bus services run by SMRT and Transtar Travel cost about $2. Tickets for popular time slots around the weekends, like Friday evenings and Saturday mornings, have mostly sold out, according to the KTM website. When The Straits Times arrived at the Woodlands Train Checkpoint around 9am, there was a line of about 50 commuters waiting to board the 9.45am train. Among them was Mr Tay Kai Xian, a 26-year-old financial risk consultant, who was visiting Malaysia for the first time since the pandemic. ""It's more convenient now as we don't have to carry physical tickets with us. We only need to show our passports to board the train,"" he said. Those who had taken the train previously said it has been refurbished and looks cleaner than before. Ms S. H. Wan, 32, an accountant who returned to Singapore after visiting her family in JB, said: ""The train looks new and I felt very comfortable in it."" She added: ""Though almost all the seats were occupied, it's still much less crowded than taking the bus."" Mr S. T. Liang, a 42-year-old project manager in the gaming industry, said his train to Woodlands was delayed for about 25 to 30 minutes. ""Our train was supposed to depart at 10am but we were told that there were some technical issues. It surprised me because today is the first day the train service is resuming, so everything should run smoothly. ""We have kids with us, so it was slightly inconvenient, but other than that, immigration processes were very smooth."" Many commuters said that they will make more frequent trips to Malaysia now that the train service has restarted. Ms Nuraishah Hamza, 37, who used to go to JB once a month before the pandemic, said she might resume doing so. ""It's very convenient - we can skip the snaking queues to cross the Causeway and immigration (clearance) is also faster,"" said Ms Hamza, who is a civil servant. ""A shopping trip or staycation is just a train ride away."""

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/hundreds-of-workers-join-aviation-industry-as-firms-ramp-up-recruitment,Hundreds of workers join aviation industry as firms ramp up recruitment,"SINGAPORE - The bulk of 600 initial job vacancies at ground handler Sats have been filled as the firm and its counterparts at Changi Airport ramp up hiring in preparation for further recovery in air traffic. Sats, the main ground handler at Changi Airport, told The Straits Times that it has been hiring workers who support passenger operations and meal production, among others. Other firms - dnata, Certis and Scoot - are also in the midst of hiring hundreds of workers as they process applications from a recent career fair. The push to hire more workers comes as the airport bids to avoid manpower shortages that have triggered long queues and flight cancellations at other airports in recent months. In Singapore, the number of air travellers and visitors are at their highest since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, although a full recovery remains some distance away. Ms Lilian Tan, chief human capital officer at Sats, said: ""As the aviation industry continues to progress, additional roles will become available, and we will tap the local talent pool to augment our workforce."" She said Sats aims to attract new workers and retain its existing workers with incentives such as competitive pay and performance-based rewards. Sats is still hiring for several roles, including customer service and trainee flight controllers. Perks offered include a joining bonus of $5,000 for some roles. The aviation sector is expected to restore 85 per cent to 90 per cent of its pre-pandemic workforce by the end of the year. It had lost a third of its more than 35,000 workers during the pandemic. Senior Minister of State for Transport Chee Hong Tat had said last month that employers are looking to fill almost 2,000 vacancies immediately during the OneAviation Careers job fair on May 27 and 28. He also said then that the fair, which featured 21 firms, will be the first of many more sector-wide recruitment efforts. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore said on Thursday (June 16) that the event attracted about 11,000 job seekers and aviation enthusiasts. A spokesman said the participating companies are in the process of evaluating applications and shortlisting candidates. dnata, the other ground handler at Changi Airport, said more than 300 candidates expressed interest in working at the firm during the career fair. Mr Musdalifa Abdullah, managing director for dnata Singapore, said the firm is in the process of reviewing applications, interviewing candidates and making job offers. He said dnata plans to recruit and train some 200 new employees across its operations, in roles such as lounge service agents and quality assurance professionals. In some roles, the new staff will be able to join operations after two weeks of training. Mr Andy Tan, head of Certis Aviation Security, said it has shortlisted some 100 candidates for different positions following the aviation career fair last month. It had offered more than 500 vacancies for various roles, such as command centre support officers and auxiliary police officers. Those who are interested in working for Certis can still apply for a job at its recruitment hub in Commonwealth Lane during office hours, Mr Tan added. Airlines have also been hiring flight crew in tandem with the resumption of flights. Singapore Airlines (SIA) had said last month that it will hire 2,000 cabin crew by March next year. More than 800 people have been hired so far. The SIA Group's budget arm, Scoot, said it has recruited more than 250 new cabin crew since late December last year. Ms Theresa Tan, Scoot's vice-president of human resource, said the carrier aims to recruit around 900 cabin crew by the end of its financial year in March 2023. ""All flight and cabin crew who were furloughed or who took secondary employment during the pandemic, are being gradually recalled back to active service,"" said Ms Tan, who declined to give specific figures, citing commercial sensitivity. Scoot is also hiring workers for back-end operations and services, she added. It is recruiting staff for positions such as mobile application developers, web developers and human resource specialists. SIA and Scoot carried a total of 1.7 million passengers last month, up 17.4 per cent from the previous month. Their passenger load factor, which refers to how much of their planes' seats are filled, clocked 78.2 per cent. This was the highest since the onset of the pandemic. There were 418,310 visitors to Singapore last month, according to Singapore Tourism Board. This was less than a third of the 1.5 million visitors registered in May 2019 before the pandemic, but represents a 41.75 per cent increase compared with April this year."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/govt-proposes-laws-for-ev-charging-including-requiring-new-buildings-to-install-chargers,"Govt proposes laws for EV charging, including requiring new buildings to install chargers","SINGAPORE - All new buildings with carparks will have to install electric vehicle (EV) charging points in at least 1 per cent of their total car and motorcycle parking lots in future, under proposed laws to regulate EV charging in Singapore. In addition, the developments have to provide sufficient electrical load to support EV charging with 7.4 kilowatt chargers for 15 per cent of the total parking spaces. Besides new buildings, the requirements would also cover developments that increase their gross floor area by 50 per cent or more, and those that increase their approved electrical load to 280 kilovolt-ampere (kVa) or more. This proposal is in draft legislation to govern EV charging that the Ministry of Transport and Land Transport Authority (LTA) set out on Wednesday (June 15) for public consultation. The proposed Electric Vehicle Charging Bill would vest LTA with powers to regulate EV chargers used in Singapore, impose a licensing regime on EV charging operators, and require EV chargers to be provided in buildings. ""We see a strong impetus to introduce legislation to regulate EV charging across the key stakeholders in the EV charging industry, while the industry and EV adoption in Singapore are still nascent,"" said the authorities. To make it easier for EV charging to be installed in existing strata-titled developments like condominiums, the Government is also looking at amending laws to lower the threshold for such resolutions to be passed. Under the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act, a proposal to install EV chargers currently requires support from up to 90 per cent of residents, depending on factors such as the proposed ownership of the chargers and length of lease. The reduced threshold would apply to contracts that last for up to 10 years and to proposals that do not draw down on condo management funds, said LTA, noting that residents in some condos have not managed to pass resolutions to install EV charging points, even when a majority of residents support the move. Also included in the proposed legislation are laws to appoint LTA as the EV charging regulator, to ensure charging services in Singapore meet safety standards. LTA will regulate the supply, advertisement, installation, registration, use and maintenance of EV chargers. The rules will cover EV chargers that are plugged into the electricity grid, mobile chargers as well as battery charge and swap stations, which charge batteries belonging to an EV. All EV chargers will need to be registered with LTA within a ""reasonable time frame"" after they have been installed, said LTA, without elaborating. Depending on the type of chargers, this may have to be done before they can be used. Owners of existing EV chargers will be required to register them with LTA within 12 months. LTA said registration will enable it to ""properly assign accountability and liability"" on EV charger owners, as well as give it a better overview of the overall EV charging infrastructure. This would allow it to identify areas with insufficient charging points, it added. EV chargers will also have to be inspected periodically by an equipment specialist - every six months for public locations, with a yearly check by a licensed electrical worker. Locations with restricted access like landed homes have to be inspected by an equipment specialist every two years. Meanwhile, charging of detachable EV batteries will not be allowed in homes due to safety risks like battery fires, said the LTA. Companies that wish to operate their own chargers for detachable batteries will be able to work with LTA to get their premises approved for charging. In addition, the proposed laws would allow LTA to enter premises in ""very serious cases of dangerous activities relating to chargers"", such as the use of tampered or illegally modified chargers, those with severe manufacturing defects or those that are not installed properly. LTA said it would issue a ""safety directive"" to an owner to promptly address the risk by uninstalling or rectifying the charger. But if this is not done, the authority would be able to enter the premises to do so. All EV charging operators will be licensed as well under the proposed rules, and have to meet reliability and quality standards. The authorities also plan to put in place safeguards against prolonged, large-scale disruption of charging services. In such an event, LTA will have the powers to take over the affected charging operator's assets and operations, or appoint another operator to step in. EVOne Charging’s managing director, Mr Elson Toh, believes condo dwellers are keener than those in any other housing types to switch to EVs.  His company has been receiving more requests for proposals by condominium residents in the past year, but they rarely get the needed votes at resident committee meetings. He sees the potential for EV adoption to really take off with the proposed change. QuickCharge.sg has installed over 100 EV chargers in commercial sites and landed homes since the middle of last year. Its spokesman said the company welcomed the proposed requirement to register EV chargers as it will give consumers confidence that the chargers comply with safety standards. The public consultation will last till July 14 this year. Responses to the proposed legislation can be sent to EVConsultation@lta.gov.sg with the subject ""Public Consultation for the Electric Vehicle Charging Bill""."

The Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM) train service, also known as the Tebrau Shuttle, takes only five minutes to get from Woodlands to JB. It was suspended from March 24, 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Tickets for popular time slots around the weekends, like Friday evenings, Saturday mornings and Sunday evenings, have sold out on the KTM website. Tickets for trips between 6.45pm and 10.30pm on June 24, the first Friday after the train resumes operations, are also sold out. But with 31 total trips daily, 18 from JB to Singapore and 13 from Singapore to JB at a frequency of 90 minutes, there are still many tickets available at off-peak times. The tickets are priced at $5 for a trip from Woodlands to JB and RM5 (S$1.60) for JB to Woodlands. The cross-border bus services offered by SMRT and Transtar Travel cost approximately $2. Madam Kheoh Phaik Ean, 67, is looking forward to travelling via the train service again. The housewife was a regular on the Tebrau train shuttle service before the pandemic and prefers it over bus services for its speed and convenience. She used to make frequent trips to Singapore to meet her two daughters, aged 22 and 27, when they were students in Singapore. She plans to buy the train tickets soon and does not mind waiting for tickets to be available rather than taking the bus. Madam Yanti Mahad, 48, who travels from Singapore to JB fortnightly for leisure, said the journey is much shorter by train. ""It takes only 15 minutes by train from point to point, but more than 30 minutes by bus if there is traffic. It's a lot faster,"" said the spa therapist. But Madam Siti Astilah, 35, who crosses the border two to three times a week to be with her family in JB, is sticking with the bus for now. The nurse, who works at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, said: ""The Tebrau train shuttle services are indeed fast, but there seem to be more and earlier cross-border bus services now."" For Ms Bernice Heng, 19, a student in JB, nothing beats the train in terms of convenience. She said she used to take the train prior to the pandemic as she did not need to spend time queueing for the bus. The Malaysian, who used to attend school in Singapore, makes the trip across the border twice a month to meet her friends here. ""I might have to fight for the train tickets if they sell out fast but I intend to take the train because it's a lot more convenient,"" she said."

Mr Izham Ismail, group chief executive of Malaysia Airlines, said on Tuesday (June 14) that the shortage of manpower has been apparent in Europe and within Asean, including in Singapore and Malaysia. ""People are not attracted to come back to an airline environment, because first of all, airlines are very volatile,"" said Mr Izham. ""We retrenched people during the pandemic and (when) we try to call them back... they think twice."" He was addressing industry representatives at a panel session during Aviation Festival Asia, held at Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre. Mr Izham said that, among other manpower-related issues, some workers have also moved into the gig economy. Thus, firms in the aviation industry and policymakers will need to work together to address such issues and attract workers to the sector, he said. This includes getting workers to fill jobs at the airports, such as ground handlers. ""Resources are our main issue... airlines cannot (restore) the capacity back as quickly as they want to,"" said Mr Izham. The pace of recovery in air traffic in the region has picked up significantly following the easing of border restrictions related to Covid-19 earlier this year. For example, Singapore is on course to exceed its initial year-end target of restoring air passenger traffic to 50 per cent of pre-pandemic levels by this month. The local aviation sector is on a recruitment drive to restore 85 per cent to 90 per cent of the pre-pandemic workforce by the end of this year. It had lost about a third of its 35,000 workers in the last two years. In countries such as Britain, a manpower crunch has forced airlines to cancel flights at short notice. Mr Izham said beyond the manpower crunch, airlines are now being affected by rising inflation and soaring fuel prices. Fellow panel member Aloke Singh, CEO of Air India Express, said he is cautious about aviation's recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. But he added: ""We have been through oil shocks, wars, terrorism and financial meltdowns. But we have doubled in size every 15 years despite all these. ""There may be challenges in the short term, and they are pretty serious. But when you take the mid-term and the long-term view, we are absolutely bullish."" Mr Roy Toh, director and head of traffic development at Changi Airports International (CAI), said in a subsequent speech that CAI expects passenger traffic to grow at a compound annual growth rate of about 3.4 per cent up till 2040. It also expects passenger traffic to recover to pre-Covid-19 levels in 2024, in line with industry projections. Mr Toh said accelerated recovery in international air traffic is expected in South-east Asia for this year and next year, given that countries in the region are now opening their borders. ""We are expecting seat capacity and hopefully traffic to recover to some 70 per cent of pre-Covid-19 levels by the end of this year, depending on the country,"" he said."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/landing-of-firefly-flight-from-subang-marks-seletar-airports-reopening-to-commercial-flights,Seletar Airport reopens to commercial flights with arrival of Firefly flight,"SINGAPORE - Seletar Airport has reopened to commercial flights for the first time in more than two years, in another step towards normality for the aviation sector. The first flight marking the reopening, Malaysian carrier Firefly's FY3124, landed at the airport at around 8.50am on Monday (June 13). Fifty-nine passengers were on board the 72-seater turboprop plane. Firefly will operate four flights daily for a start - two flights in each direction between Singapore and Subang. It stopped operating flights to Singapore on March 16, 2020, after the Covid-19 pandemic hit. Before the pandemic, it had operated six flights in each direction daily between Seletar Airport and Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport. Firefly chief executive Philip See said at a press conference at Seletar Airport that the airline will look to increase the number of flights plying the route by the end of this year if demand picks up. Prior to the pandemic, about 50 per cent to 60 per cent of the seats were filled on flights on this route. Mr See said the relatively smaller size of both airports, which results in faster immigration clearance and boarding compared with large airports, offers an important air travel alternative to both leisure and business travellers. Noting that travellers could leave their homes in Subang and arrive at their residences in Singapore within three hours by using Firefly flights, he said: ""That is such a key proposition for corporate passengers and our leisure customers who value time so much."" On whether Firefly's operations could be hampered by manpower shortages, which have been observed at several airports, Mr See said: ""At the moment, we don't see that to be a significant problem, simply because at Subang and Seletar, the airport designs are so simple. ""We don't really have the complications you perhaps will see at major transit hubs such as Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) or Changi Airport."" Mr See said the airline will focus on growing the Seletar-Subang route first before looking into expanding its network between Singapore and Malaysia. Among other routes that the airline will assess in the future include one between Changi Airport and Penang, but this is still not on the cards yet, he added. Changi Airport Group (CAG) manages both Changi Airport and Seletar Airport. Mr Tan Lye Teck, executive vice-president of airport management at CAG, said the airport will work with its partners to ensure a smooth and seamless experience for passengers. CAG and Firefly said in a joint statement that they have been conducting several trials and system tests to prepare for the resumption of scheduled commercial flights. Airport staff also participated in refresher training sessions and briefings. In addition, CAG has contacted taxi companies to inform them of Firefly's resumption of flights. Passengers on the first Firefly flight said they welcomed the convenience brought about by the resumption of the Seletar-Subang route. Ms Danielle Lee, 47, an engineer based in Kuala Lumpur, said she could get to Subang Airport from her house in just 15 minutes, which was much shorter than the time needed to reach KLIA. She was in Singapore to attend a seminar, and had travelled regularly to the Republic via Firefly flights for work before the pandemic. Ms Julia Ng, a healthcare worker who is in her early 30s, said she and her parents had taken Firefly flights weekly to travel between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore before the pandemic. Ms Ng said: ""I was very excited when I received the e-mail welcoming us back on board Firefly flights. ""It's the convenience… the fuss-free travel and check-in, the relatively quick check-out and the location as well."""

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/more-sia-krisflyer-miles-needed-to-redeem-flights-or-upgrade-seats-from-july-5,More SIA KrisFlyer miles needed to redeem flights or upgrade seats from July 5,"SINGAPORE - Travellers will need to spend more air miles in order to redeem flights under Singapore Airlines' (SIA) frequent flier programme from July 5. The airline announced on Tuesday (June 7) that it will increase the air miles needed to redeem the rewards after taking into account higher costs. The move is a result of SIA's ongoing review of the KrisFlyer programme. ""We seek your understanding that these changes were made after very careful deliberation, taking into account higher costs, and are necessary to ensure the KrisFlyer programme remains sustainable,"" said SIA. It said in an e-mail to customers that it will increase the cost of redemption for flights by an average of 10 per cent. This will apply to award and upgrade levels on flights operated by SIA, Star Alliance member carriers and SIA's partner airlines. SIA also said that stopovers for eligible redemption bookings ticketed on or after Aug 1 will be limited to a maximum of 30 days. Complimentary stopovers exceeding 30 days, as well as the paid stopover option, will no longer be available for tickets issued on or after Aug 1. The existing policy had allowed travellers to effectively redeem flights using fewer miles. Under SIA's frequent flier programme, air miles - which are named KrisFlyer miles - can be earned through buying flight tickets or credit card spending, among other options. These miles can be used to buy items at SIA's KrisShop or converted to points in partner reward programmes. But they are mostly used by travellers to redeem free flight tickets or to secure upgraded seats on flights. News agency Bloomberg had reported last May that liabilities tied to the five most valuable airline-loyalty programmes in the United States soared almost 12 per cent to US$27.5 billion (S$37.8 billion) in 2020. It cited an expert who said airlines that have gone through financial issues would look at devaluation of miles as a way to make up financial ground. Mr Aaron Wong, founder of Singapore-based travel website MileLion, told The Straits Times on Wednesday that the devaluation in SIA's KrisFlyer miles was not unexpected given that air traffic is recovering at a faster-than-expected rate. ""When load factors are low, it costs the airline very little to offer a seat for miles,"" he said. ""But when load factors are high, every passenger redeeming miles may be taking a seat from a passenger who would have been willing to pay cash."" He noted that the hike is not as drastic as it could have been, with the most popular Saver awards on SIA increasing between 8 per cent and 16 per cent. On how much additional credit card spending a traveller would have to rack up to redeem flights with SIA's revised miles redemption structure, Mr Wong cited the example of the round-trip business class award to South Korea. This costs 94,000 miles now, but will increase to 104,000 miles when the new redemption structure kicks in, he said. The difference of 10,000 miles is equivalent to an additional spending of $2,500 to $9,000, depending on what card a traveller uses, said Mr Wong. ""While there is no need to empty out your entire KrisFlyer miles balance, I would encourage those who have an inkling of where they'd like to head to for their next vacation to try and book before July 5, because they can always change the dates without attracting the new prices. ""It is also important to remember that any award wait lists that have not cleared by July 4 will attract the new pricing,"" he added."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/singapore-malaysia-land-checkpoints-see-highest-crossings-since-border-reopening-on-april-1,"Checkpoints see record crossings at start of holidays, traffic to remain heavy","SINGAPORE - The Singapore-Malaysia land checkpoints have seen the highest daily average crossings since the land borders reopened on April 1, with traffic expected to be heavy until the June school holidays are over. About 262,000 travellers have been making the trip each day between Friday and Sunday, said the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) in a statement on Wednesday (June 8). ICA added that those commuting between Singapore and Malaysia should factor in additional time for immigration clearance. They should also check the traffic situation before making the trip. The school holidays this year started on May 28. School will resume on June 27. At the peak of the June school holidays in 2019, drivers at the land checkpoints had to wait close to 2½ hours before they were cleared through immigration. ICA said departing traffic is expected to be heavy on Fridays between 6pm and 11.59pm, and between 6am and 9am as well as 9pm and 11.59pm on Saturdays. On Sundays, drivers leaving Singapore should expect heavy traffic between 6am and 8am. When entering Singapore, heavy traffic can be expected on weekday evenings between 10pm and 11.59pm. Those returning to Singapore on Saturdays should also avoid the peak hours between 9pm and 11.59pm, and on Sundays between 6pm and 11.59pm. The number of travellers crossing the land checkpoints has been increasing steadily since April. The Good Friday weekend at the end of April saw a daily average of 149,000 travellers using the land checkpoints, said ICA. This subsequently increased to about 224,000 travellers a day during the Vesak Day weekend in mid-May. Before the pandemic, more than 300,000 people travelled between Malaysia and Singapore via the land borders daily. ICA said travellers should be aware that Malaysia's immigration department, Jabatan Imigresen Malaysia, has been upgrading arrival immigration car booths since June 6. During this period, booths that are undergoing upgrading will not be operational. To monitor the traffic situation, travellers can check the One Motoring website or ICA's Facebook page. They can also take cross-border bus services instead of driving into Malaysia, the authority added. ICA is also reminding departing Singapore-registered car owners to make sure their fuel tanks are three-quarters full before reaching the checkpoints, or risk being turned away. Offenders may also be issued with a composition fine of $500 or be prosecuted in court. Travellers arriving in Singapore who are not fully vaccinated are reminded that they will have to serve a seven-day stay-home notice (SHN). It will be issued to them via the e-mail address travellers provide in their SG Arrival Card. ICA said: ""Failure to comply with any SHN-related requirement is an offence under the Infectious Diseases Act. It added that travellers can visit this website for the latest entry requirements into Singapore."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/coe-premiums-for-large-cars-and-open-category-breach-100000,"COE premiums cross $100,000 for large cars and Open category","SINGAPORE - Certificate of entitlement (COE) premiums breached the $100,000 mark in two categories on Wednesday (June 8), the first time since December 1994. Premiums for cars with engines above 1,600cc or 130bhp, as well as electric vehicles (EVs) with power output above 110 kilowatts, rose by 5 per cent from $95,889 to $100,684. The premium for the Open category COE, which tends to be used for larger cars, ended at $100,697, a 5 per cent increase from last round's $95,901. Motor traders said they had expected COE prices to increase due to the three-week interval between tenders, which gives dealers more time to collect orders. They also attributed the rise to various brands holding road shows and online promotions to close deals. Premiums in the other three categories also rose. The price of COEs for cars with engines up to 1,600cc and 130bhp, or EVs with power output of up to 110kW, rose by 8.5 per cent from $68,001 to $73,801. The commercial vehicle COE premium went up from $51,501 to $53,002, marking a rise of 2.9 per cent. The price of motorcycle COEs rose by 5.3 per cent from $9,490 to $10,000. In December 1994, the COE premium was $110,500 for cars above 2,000cc. It beat the record of $105,000 set in the Open category for the previous month. The record COE price was logged during an earlier iteration of the vehicle quota system, where there were eight categories of COEs instead of the current five. In the three months that followed, premiums fell significantly as the Government rolled out measures to stop COE speculation. This included disallowing the reselling of vehicles within three months of purchase and imposing an additional fee for resale in the next three months. Motor dealers generally do not expect COE premiums to come down significantly this time like it did after the records set in 1994. Brands such as Audi and Toyota have held road shows since the last COE bidding exercise in May, while BMW ran promotions on its online channels as well as at the showroom. Such activities tend to boost sales. Other car company representatives said that while showroom traffic has been largely consistent with that in earlier months, the orders picked up during the additional week between tenders meant that they needed to secure more COEs at this latest exercise. Ms Corinne Chua, Wearnes Automotive's managing director for Volvo Cars, pointed to the number of bids received as an indication of how COE premiums will develop in the coming tender exercises. In the category for larger and more powerful cars, there were 851 bids chasing after 528 COEs available - more than in earlier tenders. As companies bid for such COEs only when there are actual orders, it means that the 323 unsuccessful bids will be entering the next tender for the dealers to register the cars. In the last tender, there were 181 unsuccessful bids with a similar quota of COEs available. This means that it is less likely for COE premiums to fall significantly. Car companies will also have to price their cars based on the latest COE prices. Mr Eddie Loo, managing director of CarTimes Automobile, said: ""I don't think we want to be known as having the most expensive cars in the world, but it is looking that way."" Mr Raymond Tang, honorary secretary of the Singapore Vehicle Traders Association, said Wednesday's results were a natural outcome of the low supply of COEs available for bidding. While consumers may baulk at the high premiums, just as they did in March, when it hit $98,889, he believes that ""after one or two months, people will come to accept the $100,000 COE premium"". Ms Sally Chua, 52, who works in the hospitality industry, bought a new car two years ago and is still coming to grips with COE premiums hitting six figures. ""I literally jumped out of my chair when I received the news alert,"" she said. ""With the COE alone costing $100,000, how much do you need to afford a new car today?"""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/anywheel-to-deploy-shared-bicycles-in-ang-mo-kio-pasir-ris-punggol-and-tampines,"Anywheel to deploy shared bicycles in Ang Mo Kio, Pasir Ris, Punggol and Tampines","SINGAPORE - Residents in Ang Mo Kio, Pasir Ris, Punggol and Tampines will get easier access to shared bicycles in the coming months. Mr Htay Aung, chief executive of shared bicycle operator Anywheel, told The Straits Times (ST) on Monday (June 6) that the firm is aiming to deploy its bicycles in these areas by the end of the year. The expansion of areas covered by the firm comes after Anywheel secured approval from the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to double its fleet size to 30,000 shared bicycles. This is the largest number of shared bicycles an operator has been allowed to deploy since a licensing scheme started in 2018. In contrast, the other shared bike operator SG Bike is able to operate only 5,000 bicycles. This is down from the 25,000 bicycles it was allowed to operate in late 2019. A third operator could also join the scene soon. LTA said on Tuesday evening (June 7) that it is reviewing an application from a new operator to start services here. Anywheel's Mr Htay Aung said the decision to expand the firm's fleet came on the back of consistent monthly growth in user numbers over the past two years. He expects demand to further increase with the return of tourists, following eased border restrictions in Singapore since April. The firm currently deploys the bulk of its bicycles in Marina Bay, East Coast, District 9 and the Central Business District. After taking into account stolen and damaged bicycles, there are 14,000 usable bicycles. About 2,000 new bicycles will be deployed on the streets this month. Most of these will be deployed in the existing hot spots of Marina Bay and East Coast, and the remainder in Tampines, said Mr Htay Aung. ""It is important that we continue to double down on deployment in existing areas,"" he said. ""We are seeing a lot of empty searches in which people open our mobile app but are unable to find our bicycles near them."" Mr Htay Aung said about three in five trips on Anywheel's bicycles now are trips between residences and bus stops or MRT stations. On how Anywheel determines new areas in which to deploy its bicycles, such as Tampines, Mr Htay Aung said its app has registered instances of people looking for bicycles in these areas. The firm hopes to achieve profitability by the end of this year, Mr Htay Aung added. He did not provide specific numbers, but said the firm has also been able to generate revenues through selling advertising space in its mobile app and on its bicycles. Meanwhile, an SG Bike spokesman told ST that the reduction in its fleet size to 5,000 bicycles was a temporary move. The firm had become Singapore's largest shared bicycle operator in 2019, when it took over Mobike's licence to operate 25,000 bicycles. It later applied to LTA to operate a smaller fleet of 15,000 bicycles, before the latest round of reduction. Its bicycles are mainly in the north, north-eastern and eastern parts of Singapore. ""Over the past years, we have seen decreased bike count due to rising vandalism and theft cases of between 4,000 and 6,000 bicycles,"" said the spokesman. ""At the same time, our bicycles are starting to get old, and are due for replacement and refurbishment."" SG Bike is in the process of replacing damaged bicycles. It is also looking into how to better prevent bicycles from being damaged or stolen. The spokesman said SG Bike was unable to provide details on whether the business is now profitable. Bicycle sharing had rapidly gained popularity after it was introduced to Singapore around 2017. At its peak, there were more than 100,000 shared bicycles deployed across the island by several operators. But the global fall from grace of prominent operators such as ofo and the introduction of the licensing scheme to curb indiscriminate parking resulted in the use of shared bicycles plummeting. Singapore University of Social Sciences transport economist Walter Theseira said shared bicycle operators worldwide have been facing the issue of financial viability. ""Without restraint on competition and deployment of shared bikes, it is likely that operators will chase the same few operationally profitable markets in Singapore, and end up with overhead costs that can't be recovered from fees as they will be splitting the market,"" said Associate Professor Theseira. ""I am no longer convinced that the private enterprise competition model makes sense for shared bikes, and a better model might be what LTA had originally considered, which was a government-backed local monopoly."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/electric-car-maker-polestar-guns-for-nasdaq-listing-on-june-28,Electric-car maker Polestar guns for Nasdaq listing on June 28,"SINGAPORE - Swedish electric-car maker Polestar is gearing up for a listing on the Nasdaq on June 28, joining a growing line of new electric vehicle (EV) companies that have gone or announced plans to go public in recent months. A source close to the development said the date is confirmed, ""assuming everything goes according to plan"". Polestar will team up with private equity firm Gores Guggenheim to float on the bourse in New York City. The listing is said to have a valuation of US$20 billion (S$28 billion). Its imminent listing follows that of Volvo Cars in October 2021. On May 25, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission declared effective the combination of Polestar and Gores Guggenheim. Polestar will hold a special meeting on June 22 for warrant and stock holders. Polestar's first all-electric model, Polestar 2, was launched in 2020. To-date, the company has 50,000 cars on the road, including some 1,500 Polestar 1 plug-in petrol-electric hybrids. It expects sales to hit 290,000 units - 10 times its 2021 volume - in 2025. It is currently in 23 markets (it arrived in Singapore last November), and expects to expand to another seven by end-2023. As at end-April, there are 62 Polestar 2 cars on the road here. On Tuesday (June 7), the manufacturer unveiled the Polestar 3, a performance sport utility vehicle (SUV) about the size of the Porsche Cayenne. At its global launch in October, the car will have a dual-motor drivetrain, with a targeted range of more than 600km. An SUV coupe around the size of the Porsche Macan - named Polestar 4 - will follow next year. In 2024, the Polestar 5 four-door grand tourer will be rolled out. This is based on the stunning Polestar Precept, although the production car may not have rear-hinged rear doors. Last July, American electric car start-up Lucid Motors listed on the Nasdaq. That same month, Chinese EV company Xpeng started trading in Hong Kong, followed by compatriot Li Auto in August. In November, American EV company Rivian started trading on the Nasdaq. Last month, Chinese premium EV-maker Nio started trading on the Singapore Exchange, following listings in New York and Hong Kong. Last week, Vietnamese EV firm VinFast moved its headquarters to Singapore ahead of an initial public offering in the US. The markets, however, have been unkind to EV stocks since end-2021. Rising interest rates and higher cost of raw materials such as lithium and nickel are hitting the capital-intensive industry. A prolonged lockdown in China (which has just been lifted) halted production, while the war in Ukraine has worsened an ongoing supply chain crisis which erupted when world economies reopened after the Covid-19 pandemic. Market leader Tesla is not spared. Two weeks ago, its stock hit US$628, almost half its 52-week high of US$1,243."

They will be installed at the Surbana Jurong Campus in Cleantech Loop, which is off Jalan Bahar, for public use as part of the larger SP charging network. The first nine will be ready when the building opens in the coming months. The charge point operator currently has 525 charging points in 130 locations. Surbana Jurong Campus is located in JTC Corporation's CleanTech Park, which is one of the five precincts that makes up the Jurong Innovation District. The other precincts are JTC's Bulim, Bahar and Tengah districts, and the Nanyang Technological University. Surbana Jurong's global headquarters spans 68,915 sq m, about the size of 9½ football fields. Construction was supposed to have been completed last year but was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The company's spokesman said it is now expecting completion in the coming months. There will be 10 building blocks within the Surbana Jurong Campus, with the company trialling the use of solar panels to produce renewable energy to support its power needs. However, the power that goes into the EVs during charging will be drawn from the grid. Separately, as part of the pilot tender by the Urban Redevelopment Authority and the Land Transport Authority called earlier, a total of 126 EV chargers will be installed at 34 JTC carparks within the year.

The event, organised by London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, has not been held for the past two years because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Motorists are advised to avoid the roads near the hotel, especially Anderson and Orange Grove roads. They should plan their journey early as there will be slow-moving traffic, police said. Those heading to Stevens Road from Tanglin Road, or Orchard Road from Stevens Road or Balmoral Road should use Scotts Road instead. Those heading to Ardmore Park should use Draycott Park or Draycott Drive, as there is no through road between Ardmore Park lamp post 8 and Anderson Road from 11pm on Thursday to 5pm on Sunday. The entry of commercial vehicles with registration plates starting with G, W, X and Y into Anderson Road will be restricted. As parking within the hotel will be limited, visitors are advised to take public transport or carpool. Vehicles that are parked indiscriminately will be towed away. Members of the public are advised to comply fully with the instructions of the police at designated checkpoints.

According to Fuel Kaki, a pump price tracker set up by the Consumers Association of Singapore, a litre of diesel is now between $3 (Sinopec) and $3.08 (Shell, Caltex) - up from $3-$3.05 two weeks ago. A litre of 92-octane petrol is now between $3.26 (Esso, SPC) and $3.28 (Caltex) - up from $3.13-$3.20. A litre of the popular 95-octane fuel ranges between $3.26 (Sinopec) and $3.33 (Shell, Caltex) - up from $3.16-$3.25. Posted prices of 98-octane petrols are between $3.73 (Sinopec) and $3.82 (Shell) - up from $3.64-$3.74 - while the so-called premium grade of 98-octane fuels is going for between $3.86 (Sinopec) and $4.04 (Shell). This is the first time petrol has breached the $4 mark here. The relentless surge in pump prices started well before Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, which sparked wide-ranging sanctions against Moscow that have deepened the global supply chain crisis. The gradual - and then sudden - reopening of economies as the world emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic has also fuelled demand for fuels. At the same time, producers are struggling to increase production - for instance, restarting refineries which had closed during the pandemic. RBOB Gasoline, a proxy for refined petroleum products, is now around US$4.20 a gallon, its highest in more than two decades. The benchmark Brent crude is now above US$117 a barrel, and heading towards its March high of almost US$130 a barrel.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/jetstar-asia-to-add-11-weekly-regional-flights-from-singapore-in-june,Jetstar Asia to add 11 weekly regional flights from Singapore in June,"SINGAPORE - Local budget carrier Jetstar Asia will be adding 11 flights a week from Singapore to six cities in the region this month. These flights are for the popular nearby destinations of Bali, Da Nang, Manila, Penang, Phuket and Phnom Penh. From June 13, Jetstar will begin operating daily flights between Singapore and Bali. It currently has five flights a week serving Bali. The airline, which currently has one flight to Manila daily, will add three more weekly flights to the city from June 6. This means that the airline will have two flights a day to Manila on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Jetstar will also be doubling its weekly flights to Penang with three new weekly flights from June 6 - two new weekday flights and one new Saturday service. Phnom Penh, Phuket and Da Nang will also each get one additional flight a week. A Jetstar Asia spokesman said: ""With countries increasingly relaxing their travel restrictions, we are pleased to be able to offer more services to key South-east Asian cities as well as incredible leisure destinations."" Much of Asia has been easing border measures in recent months, which has boosted air travel. The Straits Times reported last month that international passenger numbers at Changi Airport rebounded to 42 per cent of 2019 levels in the first quarter of 2022. With the increase in air travel, the aviation sector is also expected to restore 85 per cent to 90 per cent of its pre-Covid-19 pandemic workforce by the end of the year, after losing a third of its 35,000 workers during the pandemic. The Jetstar spokesman said: ""Customers have missed travelling, whether it is for leisure, business, or to reconnect with family and friends. It's great to see consumer confidence improving and international travel back on people's radar."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/lta-awards-3726m-contract-to-erect-09km-viaduct-to-hwa-seng-builder,LTA awards $372.6m contract to erect 0.9km viaduct to Hwa Seng Builder,"SINGAPORE - Part of a new viaduct project in Loyang will be built by home-grown firm Hwa Seng Builder. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) announced on Wednesday (June 1) that the civil contract for the design and construction of a 0.9km section of the Loyang Viaduct along Loyang Avenue between Tampines Expressway (TPE) and Pasir Ris Drive 3 was awarded for $372.6 million. Construction works are expected to start in the third quarter of the year and complete by the end of 2028. The viaduct section is part of the 2.6km Loyang Viaduct – as well as several infrastructure projects designed to complement the new Cross Island MRT Line and serve Changi Airport Terminal 5 – announced in 2019. It is designed to alleviate congestion in the area and support developments in the Changi Northern Corridor. The rest of the viaduct is built together with the Cross Island Line's Loyang MRT station. The entire viaduct will increase road capacity by bringing traffic moving between TPE and Changi Village onto the viaduct, bypassing traffic junctions along Loyang Avenue with Pasir Ris Drive 1 and 3. The viaduct will be situated above Loyang Avenue between Tampines Expressway (TPE) and Loyang Way, with up and down ramps at TPE and near Loyang Lane. The LTA said ""specialised overhead machinery"" will be deployed for construction to minimise impact on traffic. ""As construction works will interface with underground utilities network and given site constraints, traffic diversions will be required,"" the authority added. The Loyang viaduct is connected to another viaduct in Upper Changi Road East. The latter is being rebuilt – by Hwa Seng Builder for $95.6 million – after an earlier version undertaken by local builder Or Kim Peow collapsed in July 2017, killing one worker and injuring 10 others. The rebuilt viaduct, measuring 1.8km, is nearing completion. Hwa Seng Builder was established in 1992. Its past road projects include the KPE/TPE interchange, widening of Woodlands Road, Choa Chu Kang Link, Stagmont Ring, widening of Bukit Batok East Avenue 3 and improvement works for the PIE slip road between Clementi North Flyover and Toh Tuck Flyover."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/lta-launches-exhibition-to-encourage-sustainable-commuting-among-students,LTA launches exhibition to encourage sustainable commuting among students,"SINGAPORE - Singapore Chinese Girls' School (SCGS) student Lai Jia Ying wants to take the train to tuition classes from now on, instead of getting a ride from her parents in the family car. ""Sustainable transport is extremely important as Singapore is striving to be greener by cutting down carbon emissions,"" said the 15-year-old who attended an exhibition rolled out by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) on Tuesday (May 31). The Make the Switch: The Quest For Greener Land Transport exhibition aims to drive students to use greener forms of transport such as walking and taking public buses and trains. The exhibition, which is open to the public, is being held from Tuesday to March 31 next year at the Singapore Mobility Gallery in LTA's headquarters in Hampshire Road. On Tuesday, Transport Minister S. Iswaran launched the exhibition, which was attended by students from River Valley Primary School (RVPS) and SCGS. The exhibition comprises five stations, where visitors can learn of initiatives, such as solar panels at bus depots and electric buses, that seek to make Singapore's transport system energy-efficient. Visitors can also learn how much carbon emissions they can reduce when opting for greener transport options as compared with petrol-guzzling cars. The stations are interactive, with activities such as sticker colouring and a quiz for visitors to measure their understanding of green transport. RVPS pupil Ryan Sng, 11, said: ""I learnt that we should take public transport because it uses less fossil fuel, which are not renewable and sustainable."" Activities at the Singapore Mobility Gallery, such as tours of the LTA compound and booths which focus on the safety and sustainability of green transport, will also be open to the public on specific dates in June. Physical and virtual workshops will be conducted too. Workshops are free but require prior registration. Students on Tuesday were given a preview of the booths - one of which teaches participants how to show care for fellow commuters from different communities. SCGS student Praseeda Chowdary, 14, said the experience ""allowed me to see how Singapore gives priority to and focuses on people who have special needs and disabilities"". Under the 2030 Green Plan, the Republic aims to encourage green commuting, such as walking, cycling and using public transport, with the opening of new train stations and the repurposing of roads for pedestrians and cyclists. RVPS pupil Kaira Lin, 11, is looking forward to do her part. ""Our choice of public transport affects global warming to a great extent. Once the Great World station (on the Thomson-East Coast Line) opens, it will be easier for me to take the MRT to school."" To register for the activities in June, visit this website."
