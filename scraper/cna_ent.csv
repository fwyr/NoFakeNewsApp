The CNA Lifestyle team is busy setting up in a hotel room at the Hilton Orchard on Wednesday (Aug 24) afternoon when a familiar voice floats into the room from the hallway of the suite.  “Wait, is that her? It’s not time for our interview, is it?” asks a member of the crew, a little panicked. After all, from experience, celebrities don’t typically appear until the absolute final moment.  It is her. After routinely listening to her 2019 English single Magnetic Moon before heading out of the house, I can recognise her voice anywhere. But she just wants to say hi before she pops into the room next door for her first interview.  As she makes her way through the melee of busy staff towards us, I am instantly struck by her delicate figure. Her face, tinted in the signature Korean “no makeup” makeup, exudes an elfin charm.  “Hi, I’m Tiffany!” she says, stretching out a hand. Even her voice sparkles.  Most celebrities, the first time you meet them, appear larger than life, sometimes intimidating. But with Young, one of the lead singers of K-pop supergroup Girls' Generation, I feel right at home.  I am filled with that same feeling when we finally sit down for our interview, in chairs parked in front of the hotel bed. We’d earlier requested for the interview to be conducted in the bed, to evoke the feeling of a sleepover. But her managers said no – it didn’t fit Girls’ Generation's wholesome image.  As it turns out, Young is not all that shy.  “Ooh this is the first time I’m doing an interview in front of a bed. How intimate!” she quips.  I take the opportunity to ask her about her bedtime routine – specifically if she ever goes to bed with her makeup on.  “I’m going to be honest – I haven’t slept much in the last five days (because of work),” she tells me. “I napped with my makeup on a few times.” But other than that, she’s “very strict” – she always takes off her makeup before going to bed and is a little horrified when I say that I don’t do that sometimes when I’m exhausted.  “You can’t do that!” she says. “During this promotion, I’m not going to lie, I would sometimes sleep with my makeup on, but I would never. I could never.  “I realise I could never because I had a few drinks the other day and I still erased my makeup and put on my serum. So, I realise my level of strictness through my drunkenness.” ON AGEING GRACEFULLY By this time I’m thinking how funny it is that I didn’t get my request for a “sleepover” but it feels like a sleepover anyway.  Young’s strict cleansing rule isn’t just for the sake of beauty; it’s also a chance to pamper herself.  “I’m learning to be present during my cleansing routine. That’s when you’re really connecting with yourself. That’s when you’re like ‘Wow, you had a long day. You did great, sweetie.’ “This is when your inner voice comes out and starts saying nice things. You know, not every time you’re nice to yourself,” she tells me.  I find it a little hard to believe that the pop star, who's had more than five well-received singles out since going solo in 2017 and who is currently pursuing acting, has time every night for a pep talk and a complete beauty routine. “If I’m really tired, after cleansing, I will put on a face mask because it gets everything done. And then I just leave it on,” she says.  It’s my turn to be horrified: “You can do that?” “It depends on the mask,” she reveals. “There’s the gel type, a satin type and a silk type. Don’t leave the silk type on because it dries everything up. A gel mask, you can leave on.” I can tell she’s generous so I push for another skincare tip. I’m seated less than a metre away from her and I can’t see any signs of under eye ageing. Despite her claim that she has barely slept in days, she has no visible dark eye rings or eyebags.  “My glam team is incredible,” she says seriously. “I also drink a lot of water and electrolytes. I think that is the secret. People just think water but recently I’ve been making sure I drink a lot of electrolytes after a rehearsal.”  The topic of beauty makes Tiffany Young, who is 33, feel nostalgic.  Later that night, she is making an appearance at a Lancome event promoting the brand’s Beauty Tech flagship store, as its ambassador. Young, like me, grew up with Lancome. We share stories of how we used to spray the brand’s inimitable Miracle fragrance as children and our unquenching lust for Juicy Tubes lip gloss.  “Growing up in the ‘90s and early 2000s, beauty trends were explosive. My mum would always be wearing red lips and red nails, and that influenced me a lot. I also love the divas, like Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, who are always so glammed up. “But I love that now, beauty and makeup has become a part of everyone’s routine. It’s a form of empowerment and self-expression – it’s no longer just for a certain type of person or group.” The tagline for the Beauty Tech Flagship Store, an immersive experience outside Mandarin Gallery that will last through Sep 7, is “Strong is the new young”.  I wonder out loud if it was planned, seeing as Young is her last name.  “It wasn’t! It's just meant to be,"" she says. “I love how Lancome brings back their ambassadors from before, like Julia Roberts and Penelope Cruz. I remember seeing their campaigns from a long time ago and now we get to see them again and see how much more beautiful they are over time. “Ageing gracefully to me means awareness and mindfulness – truly being able to be present and taking in the details, whether it’s seeing beauty in yourself or in others or in a situation. I think that's the key to ageing gracefully. I don’t think it’s a certain look or a photo or a product – it really is a mindset."" ON DREAMS Going back to the theme of sleep, I ask Young if she has a favourite lullaby. She is thrilled, as if she’s been waiting for someone to ask her this all her life.  “I’m a big Disney fan!” she exclaims, before proceeding to serenade me with A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes from Cinderella.  “When I was young, I really loved the musical boxes that had a little ballerina in it and that played songs like Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. I love a good classical lullaby.  “But recently, I’ve been obsessed with Elvis Presley and if you listen to the Elvis movie soundtrack, there’s the song Can’t Help Falling In Love by Kacey Musgraves. That is like the sweetest lullaby… I can fall asleep to that.” Last year, Young fulfilled one of her dreams: To play Roxie Hart in Chicago the Musical. She loved playing the sassy villain character so much in the South Korean production of the Broadway hit that she hopes to do it again.  “After that season – I won’t lie – I still practise that monologue. Because I’m like, I’m going to be ready to take that stage again next season.”  The singer-songwriter has indeed been bitten by the acting bug.  She tells me she just finished shooting her first K-drama airing in November, in which she plays financial analyst Rachel alongside Song Joong-ki of Descendants Of The Sun fame.  “It was my first time so I was learning a lot. I loved that I got to represent an Asian-American woman, who’s there to be a boss,” she tells me, adding that she’s also eyeing other Korean musical roles, like Lucy Harris from Jekyll and Hyde, Glinda the Good witch from Wicked, and Satine from Moulin Rouge.  She also wants to play Princess Jasmine from Aladdin, whose Broadway production she has seen a whopping six times. I tell her I played Princess Jasmine in a primary school production and she squeals.  “You’ve had your Disney princess moment! I haven’t. That’s literally my goal in life. “There are so many different, amazing stories that are being written and there will come a time for an Asian-American princess.” At this point, Young looks straight into the camera, flashes a cheeky grin similar to the one she sported in Girls’ Generation’s world-famous music video for Gee, and says: “Hi, Disney.” Now who could say no to that?"

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/anne-heche-hollywood-actress-car-crash-death-2878291,Actress Anne Heche dies from injuries following car crash,"Hollywood actor Anne Heche has been declared legally dead, one week after she crashed her car into a Los Angeles building, a spokeswoman said Friday. Heche, 53, had been comatose in hospital with a severe brain injury since the fiery collision on August 5. Having lost all brain function, she is ""legally dead according to California law"", though her heart is still beating as her family keeps her body on life support while exploring organ donations, spokeswoman Holly Baird told AFP. ""Today we lost a bright light, a kind and most joyful soul, a loving mother, and a loyal friend,"" the family said in a joint statement. ""Anne will be deeply missed but she lives on through her beautiful sons, her iconic body of work, and her passionate advocacy. ""Her bravery for always standing in her truth, spreading her message of love and acceptance, will continue to have a lasting impact."" Heche, best known for 1990s movies Donnie Brasco and Six Days, Seven Nights as well as a high-profile relationship with talk show host Ellen DeGeneres, crashed her car into a two-storey house in the Mar Vista neighbourhood of Los Angeles. The violent collision resulted in ""structural compromise and... heavy fire"" at the scene, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department. The ensuing blaze took 59 firefighters more than an hour to contain and fully extinguish, the department said. Local media reported Thursday that preliminary tests of Heche's blood had come back positive for narcotics, though more were needed to ensure the drugs had not been administered in the course of her treatment. Celebrity gossip outlet TMZ, citing unnamed police sources, said Heche had tested positive for cocaine and fentanyl, with the latter sometimes used for pain relief in clinical settings. Heche rose to fame with her role on the soap opera Another World, for which she won a Daytime Emmy in 1991.  She was nominated for a Tony award for her appearance in Twentieth Century on Broadway in 2004. ""My brother Atlas and I lost our Mum,"" Heche's son Homer Laffoon said in a separate statement. ""Hopefully my mum is free from pain and beginning to explore what I like to imagine as her eternal freedom,"" he wrote."

""There's so much that Daemon gets away with because his brother is the king,"" Considine said in an interview with Reuters. ""It's not until he breaks my heart with his words that I do act,"" Considine added.  The show is based on passages of George R.R.

The crux of the show lies with the relationship between two women, Alicent Hightower and Princess Rhaenyra. The two are close until Rhaenyra's mother dies and Alicent marries King Viserys and becomes the queen, demanding that her children become the heirs to the throne. ""You're going there from the (point of view) of two women for the first time,"" said Emma D'Arcy, who plays the older Princess Rhaenyra in the generation-spanning story. ""It's a show that interrogates patriarchy, misogyny and power."" Some fans complained about the finale of the original Game of Thrones series. House of the Dragon co-creator Ryan Condal said the ending of the new series is already planned.  ""We do have a plan out in front of us, but the main idea is to tell as much story as the book gives us and instead of overstaying your welcome, to get out and leave them wanting a little bit more,"" Condal said. The series debuts on HBO on Aug 21."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/mirror-boy-band-accident-falling-screen-dancers-hong-kong-stage-safety-2844276,Safety in the spotlight in Hong Kong after string of Mirror boy band concert accidents,"SINGAPORE: A spate of stage incidents involving Hong Kong’s hugely popular boy band Mirror has prompted authorities to order an official inquiry, amid debate on whether shoddy concert production quality or insufficient rehearsal time is to blame. Performers in the 12-member Cantopop band had suffered falls, injuries and near-misses since the start of a series of scheduled concerts at the beginning of this week. The most serious incident occurred on Thursday evening (Jul 28) after a massive video screen suspended above the stage fell on two dancers, leaving one in a serious condition. Concert organiser MakerVille, which is owned by Hong Kong tycoon Richard Li’s telecom giant PCCW, told local media early Friday morning that the dancer, who goes by Mo, remains in intensive care. A medical source told South China Morning Post that the impact dislocated the third and fourth section of the dancer's cervical vertebrae, leaving him unable to move his limbs. His head and lungs were also injured. The other dancer sustained scratches and sprained muscles and was discharged after observation, said MakerVille CEO Lo Ting-fai. Three audience members were also taken to hospital with one feeling unwell and the other two in shock, but none required treatment, the Associated Press reported. None of the 12 members of Mirror was hurt. A Hong Kong official told reporters on Friday that ""from initial observation, a wire fractured and led to the fall of the screen and caused the dancers to be injured"". Experts told the South China Morning Post that such accidents were rare at the concert venue – the Hong Kong Coliseum – although one structural engineer questioned if stage equipment had been properly installed, and speculated that a lock to fasten the wiring for such giant video panels could have failed. On social media, fans have questioned whether the production companies were at fault, with some commenters posting unverified claims of the firms being linked with the Chinese government. Others shared the video with a #MadeInChina hashtag, saying the incident was a byproduct of China’s uncompromising rule over Hong Kong. The Art Design & Production firm clarified on Facebook that while it was responsible for props and stage surfaces at the concert, it had no part to play in the engineering or operations that led to the screen falling. In an incident on Tuesday, Mirror member Frankie Chan lost his footing and fell about a metre off the edge of the stage while giving a speech. He later posted on social media, saying: ""Sorry for making everyone worry … Only some bruises. I'm a lucky man.""  The night before, local media reported that band member Anson Kong nearly fell off a rising platform he was dancing on, adding that the structure and other stage features were shaking and wobbling under the weight of performers. Fans also filmed other Mirror members appearing to miss dance steps while on dimly lit and fenceless structures, some suspended in mid-air. An online petition urging concert organisers to better ensure safety was launched on Tuesday night, garnering more than 13,000 signatures since. The Hong Kong government also contacted the organisers that same night to demand improvements, resulting in “dangerous moves” being cancelled and fences installed at the next performance on Wednesday, according to local media. Thursday’s incident – where the audience can be heard screaming in horror in distressing footage being circulated online – was the final straw for the Hong Kong government, which has halted the Mirror concert series until the stage production can be proven safe.  Hong Kong film stalwart Louis Koo, who is president of the city’s performing artistes guild, on Friday morning called for people to stop reposting the accident clips. The key thing is to review the safety issues to avoid repeating the same mistakes, he said on social media. Fellow entertainer Aaron Kwok meanwhile spoke out against reports that Mirror performers had only rehearsed for two days before the start of the concert series on Monday. Kwok said he needed at least three to four days to rehearse at venues, and before that, he would also practise in a different venue with a replica stage, according to Variety magazine. With the Hong Kong Theatre Arts Practitioners Union and several city lawmakers calling for a probe, Hong Kong chief executive John Lee issued a statement early on Friday ordering a thorough investigation and review of safety requirements at similar events. This was to ensure the safety of performers, crew and the public, said Mr Lee, adding: “I express sympathy to those who were injured and hope that they will recover soon.” "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/kate-mckinnon-and-pete-davidson-saturday-night-live-2698891,Kate McKinnon and Pete Davidson leaving Saturday Night Live,"Kate McKinnon and Pete Davidson are among those departing from Saturday Night Live, leaving the sketch institution without arguably its two most famous names after Saturday's 47th season finale. Aidy Bryant and Kyle Mooney will also leave the cast after the episode hosted by Natasha Lyonne. The departures represent one of the biggest cast shake-ups in years on a show that has seen unusual steadiness in recent seasons. McKinnon, 38, won two Emmys and was nominated for nine in her 10 seasons on the show, during which her impressions included Hillary Clinton, and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Her comic chops with characters like alien abductee Miss Rafferty frequently drove castmates and guest hosts to lose it live on air. McKinnon opened the show with an out-of-this-world skit, and said her final goodbyes on “Earth”. “I love ya, thanks for letting me stay awhile. Live from New York, it's Saturday night,” she said to open the show. The 28-year-old Davidson joined the cast in 2014 and has appeared in eight seasons. His own outsize personality often outshone the characters he played. His comic commentaries as himself on Weekend Update were often his most viral bits. And he was as well-known for his life offscreen – dating Ariana Grande and current girlfriend Kim Kardashian – as on. “I never imagined this would be my life,” Davidson said during the show. “I appreciate SNL for always having my back, for allowing me to work on myself and grow. Thank you to Lauren for never giving up on me or judging me even when everyone else was, for believing in me and allowing me to have a place I could call home with the memories that will last a lifetime. Thank you.” Bryant, 35, joined the cast at the same time as McKinnon and has been a constant in sketches ever since, getting four Emmy nominations of her own. Mooney, 37, appeared in nine seasons starting in 2013."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/kourtney-kardashian-travis-barker-portofino-wedding-2698556,"Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker hit Portofino, Italy for a long wedding weekend","The Kravis wedding train has rolled into Italy. After a Las Vegas practice wedding (no marriage license) with an Elvis impersonator officiating, followed by a small ceremony (with license) in Santa Barbara, California, Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker stepped out Friday in the jet set playground of Portofino, a fishing village known for its multicoloured houses and crystalline green water on the Italian Riviera coast. Photographers snapped the couple, along with the rest of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, as they arrived for dinner clad in Dolce & Gabbana. Notably absent was Scott Disick, the father of Kourtney's three children. They took to the streets again Saturday on their way to lunch, Kourtney in a veil and short black dress emblazoned with a likeness of the Virgin Mary. The wedding was to be held at some point over the weekend at the rented Castello Brown, a castle built in the Middle Ages overlooking the Gulf of Portofino, according to TMZ. The reality star, 43, and the Blink-182 drummer, 46, are known for their PDA and didn't disappoint in Portofino, where they were seen Friday on a boat sharing a kiss in the abundant sun – she in a T-shirt of her beau's band and he in his favourite style condition: Shirtless with his multiple tattoos on display. On their way to dinner, “momager” Kris Jenner was in a black dress on the arm of Guilherme Siqueira, a brand ambassador for Dolce & Gabbana. With sis Kim's eldest child, North West, and her own daughter, Penelope Disick, at her side, Kourtney wore a sheer corseted red gown and matching furry stole. Barker? Shirtless under a black suit as he walked with daughter Alabama. The third wedding round was to include family and a small circle of close friends, with a larger reception planned later in Los Angeles, according to reports. Barker and the oldest Kardashian sister went Instagram official with their relationship early last year. He popped the question in October, beachside with a ring of red roses and white candles at a Montecito, California, hotel. Last month, just hours after the Grammys, word of a Las Vegas wedding spread quickly, though no marriage license could be found. Kourtney later clarified they couldn't get one in the wee hours but went ahead with a drunken practice run. In Santa Barbara, they posted photos after making it legal at the courthouse May 15, the bride in a short white dress with veil and the groom in black, his coat buttoned up for a change. Travis’ father, Randy Barker, and Kourtney’s grandmother, Mary Jo “MJ” Campbell, were in attendance. Kourtney didn't marry Disick. Barker has been married twice. His first marriage, to Melissa Kennedy, lasted nine months. His last divorce, from Shanna Moakler, came in 2008. They wed in 2004 and share two teen kids, Alabama and son Landon. Barker is also close with his 23-year-old stepdaughter, Atiana De La Hoya, from Moakler's previous relationship with former boxer Oscar De La Hoya. The Kardashians ended their long-running Keeping Up with the Kardashians on E! last year and decamped to Hulu for a new iteration, The Kardashians, which debuted in April."

Chen, too, revealed that his wife had to juggle filming and nutrition classes throughout this period.  Said her son Chen Xi on Instagram, “I didn’t expect myself to get emotional over this. But I always remember how my mum loved to learn; how she never had the chance to complete her education journey due to financial challenges in those days. “Like many of them in that generation, she gave it up, started working for the family, and became the woman you knew on the screens.”   Her colleagues and friends in the industry, including Huang Biren, Quan Yifeng and Pan Lingling, also congratulated her on her Instagram post.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/netflix-charge-password-sharing-subscriber-loss-stock-streaming-2655941,Commentary: Why Netflix wants to charge you for sharing your password with friends,"SINGAPORE: Netflix is fighting an uphill battle to keep its audience. It lost 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter of 2022 – its first net loss in a decade and well below its target of adding 2.5 million subscribers. This disappointing report prompted a mass sell-off that wiped out 36 percent of its value on Apr 20. CEO Reed Hastings famously proclaimed in 2017 that Netflix’s greatest competitor was sleep. But when discussing the most recent loss of subscribers, the streaming giant pointed fingers at inflation, its exit from Russia following the Ukraine invasion, competition with other platforms – and password sharing. Netflix says more than 100 million households globally are accessing the platform through a shared password, without subscribing to it themselves. It plans to implement a worldwide charge on password sharing, to earn revenue from those piggybackers. This charge is already being trialled in Chile, Costa, and Peru. Users have to pay about S$3 to S$4 for each additional user from different households, up to a maximum of two.  Some investors are skeptical about Netflix’s crusade against free riders. After all, Netflix has turned a blind eye to password sharing up until recently, so password sharing alone cannot explain this quarter’s shocking performances. Just how much will rolling out the charge to other markets move the needle on Netflix’s performance? The digitalisation of services makes password sharing widespread, with people sharing subscriptions for online newspapers, mobile applications, and video games with family and friends. Consumers who choose to use others' accounts tend to be light users. By their calculation, their usage does not justify a full subscription.  Even though service providers lose out on subscription fees with password sharing, many choose not to crack down on the practice. Some service providers even encourage it.  Many digital services connect two sides of the market. For example, news publishers provide a platform that connects readers who pay for the news with advertisers who pay for ad space. They then benefit from a larger network effect – the larger the readership, the more advertisers. Naturally, news publishers prefer a bigger readership to attract more advertisers and charge higher fees to them. So platforms that rely on ad revenue do not see password sharing as a sin, especially those that earn most of their revenue from advertising.  In extreme cases, platforms such as Facebook choose to provide services to individual users for free. Major American news channels, such as NBC and CNN, have free channels on YouTube. For such platforms, the best strategy is to maximise the user pool to earn more advertising revenue.  But Netflix earns its revenue from consumer subscriptions, not advertisers. To it, a free rider is a free rider; they do not bring in any revenue. This could be why Netflix is motivated to curb password sharing to eliminate the drain on potential profits. Two-step verification, a measure Netflix introduced last year to get users to prove they are account owners with a code, makes checking much easier for the company, paving the way for it to rein in on password-sharing. According to estimates by US financial services company Cowen, Netflix stands to earn an additional US$1.6 billion annually by charging for password sharing globally. That’s about 4 per cent of the firm’s 2023 revenue projection of US$38.8 billion. This estimate assumes about half of Netflix password-sharing users will become paying members, who will either pay for a full subscription or join the multiple-user programme. Whether Netflix could reap the predicted US$1.6 billion depends on many factors. Consumers will re-evalutate the costs and benefits of borrowing a password. If it only involves getting the login details from a friend, the cost is meagre. A two-step verification process makes password sharing costlier especially if the viewers don’t live under one roof. It could be annoying if you have to call your friend every time you want to watch your favourite show.  This may push some piggybackers to opt-in for the multiple-user feature. Paying a few dollars per month to get rid of the hassle sounds like a good deal. Even those who are not currently Netflix users might be tempted to sign up if the multiple-user programme is attractive enough with the low monthly price.  Yet, not everyone will sign up. Light users who borrow passwords may decide to leave Netflix completely, since watching a show once in a while will not justify the fee.  What complicates the picture is that some subscribers may renounce their full subscription, switching to the multiple-users programme instead. The “cannibalisation” of existing accounts could be more serious in less wealthy markets and negligible in high-income markets. Like other digital service providers, Netflix faces a high cost of procuring content and setting up infrastructure such as servers. But servicing an additional customer adds little to its cost. While S$3 or S$4 a month sounds puny compared to the full subscription price of about S$20, the multiple-user programme could be lucrative as long as some free riders sign up. Some may even eventually get their separate, heftier subscriptions down the line. Others may be unhappy at Netflix’s change of heart about password sharing, but it remains to be seen how many actually leave the platform because of this. As the market for online streaming services matures, Netflix needs to lock in users before they flock to competitors. Disney+ added 11.8 million new subscribers in the last quarter of 2021 and Apple TV+ might surge in popularity as home to the first film on a streaming service to snag an Oscar best picture award. Consumer behaviour may be on Netflix’s side - they tend to stick to the same digital service provider and rarely consider switching unless necessary. If the effort of curbing password sharing can convert piggybackers to subscribers – though at a lower profit margin – it could benefit Netflix in the long run.  Netflix’s Hastings said the firm is looking at rolling out lower-priced plans that come with ads. This could potentially relieve the reliance on subscriptions and help Netflix earn revenue from a different source. Simply reducing subscription fees may not be a palatable step for Netflix to take – it may bring in more subscribers, but it also creates more consumer resistance to price hikes in the future.  Is the solution to provide more quality content? Before Netflix had as many competitors as it has now, it could bring in a wider variety of shows that cater to many tastes. But the strategy of catering to everyone implies that some niche shows may not attract enough viewers to break even. With more competitors entering the business, Netflix may need to re-evaluate its strategy and look deeper into market segmentation to become more targeted.

The result came out positive.  “I guess there comes a time, when it’s your turn to get sick (COVID-19). I just pray that no one around me has been badly affected,” he wrote. In a one-minute video he posted, Lin updated his followers on his symptoms –a mild sore throat, chills and headaches – and sang a verse from his song Light of Sanctuary, as a form of encouragement to his followers (and himself). “As frustrating and disheartening as it can get, I am reminded that there are so many who have also gone through (or are still going through) similar or worse situations,” he wrote. Lin also gave a shout out to the frontliners who've been “dedicating their lives to protecting and supporting the community”. The star was most recently in the US for what seemed like an impromptu trip organised by electronic dance music DJ Steve Aoki. He returned to Singapore on Thursday (Apr 7) and tested positive for COVID-19 the next day.  We wish Lin a speedy recovery."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/will-smith-banned-attending-oscars-10-years-after-slap-2617176,Will Smith banned from attending Oscars for 10 years after slap,"Hollywood's film academy on Friday (Apr 8) banned Will Smith from attending the Oscars for 10 years after the best actor winner slapped presenter Chris Rock on stage at the Academy Awards ceremony 12 days ago. The board of governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences took the action at a meeting held one week after Smith pre-emptively resigned from the group over his outburst at the live, televised event. ""The 94th Oscars were meant to be a celebration of the many individuals in our community who did incredible work this past year,"" academy President David Rubin and Chief Executive Dawn Hudson said in a statement. ""However, those moments were overshadowed by the unacceptable and harmful behavior we saw Mr Smith exhibit on stage."" In a statement, Smith said, ""I accept and respect the Academy’s decision."" The actor has issued previous statements apologising to Rock, the Oscars producers, nominees and viewers. In addition to the Oscars, the film world's most prestigious awards, the board banned Smith from all other academy events and programs, in person or virtually, for 10 years. The group did not say, however, that he would be ineligible to be nominated for Oscars during that time. Smith's next movie, action thriller Emancipation, about a man who escapes from slavery, had been set for release later this year. No update on the Apple TV+ film has been given since Smith strode up to the stage at the Mar 27 ceremony after comedian Rock made a joke about the appearance of the actor's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, then smacked Rock across the face. Less than an hour later, Smith gave a tearful speech on stage as he accepted the best actor award for his role in King Richard, portraying the father of tennis superstars Serena and Venus Williams. After the ceremony, he was seen dancing at Vanity Fair's annual post-Oscars party. Rock's joke about Pinkett Smith made a reference to the 1997 film GI Jane in which actress Demi Moore shaved her head. It was unclear whether Rock was aware that she has a condition that causes hair loss. Dana Harris-Bridson, editor-in-chief of online entertainment publication IndieWire, called the academy's ban of Smith ""too little, too late,"" saying the group should have removed the actor from the ceremony at the Dolby Theatre. After the fact, the academy had few options, particularly since Smith resigned before his membership in the group could be revoked, she said. ""The moment they had was the moment in the theater,"" she said. In the Friday statement, the academy's leaders said they did not adequately address the situation during the telecast. ""For this, we are sorry,"" they said. ""This was an opportunity for us to set an example for our guests, viewers and our Academy family around the world, and we fell short - unprepared for the unprecedented."" Shortly after the incident, the academy said it had asked Smith to leave, but details of that statement have been disputed and the actor did stay for the rest of the ceremony. The academy's CEO and president also expressed ""deep gratitude to Mr. Rock for maintaining his composure under extraordinary circumstances. ""We also want to thank our hosts, nominees, presenters and winners for their poise and grace during our telecast,"" they said. ""We also hope this can begin a time of healing and restoration for all involved and impacted."""

The single Hey Hey, Rise Up – Pink Floyd's first original new music in almost 30 years – was recorded last week and highlights singing by Andriy Khlyvnyuk from Ukrainian band Boombox, which was taken from a social media post. Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour said he learned that Khlyvnyuk – with whom he had previously performed – left a US tour with Boombox and returned to Ukraine to join the Territorial Defence Forces. ""Then I saw this incredible video on Instagram, where he stands in a square in Kyiv with this beautiful gold-domed church and sings in the silence of a city with no traffic or background noise because of the war,"" Gilmour said on Pink Floyd's website. ""It was a powerful moment that made me want to put it to music."" Gilmour said he spoke with Khlyvnyuk while he was in a hospital in Kyiv recovering from a mortar shrapnel injury. ""I played him a little bit of the song down the phone line and he gave me his blessing. We both hope to do something together in person in the future,"" he said. Gilmour said he had a Ukrainian daughter-in-law and grandchildren and he was feeling ""the fury and the frustration"" of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. Moscow has said it is engaged in a special operation to degrade Ukraine's military capabilities and root out nationalists. The track, which samples Khlyvnyuk singing a World War One protest song, also features Nick Mason, a founding member of Pink Floyd, as well as Gilmour and other musicians."

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/lata-mangeshkar-dies-92-singer-covid-19-india-2482166,"Bollywood playback singer Lata Mangeshkar, 'the Nightingale', dies at 92","Lata Mangeshkar, one of India's biggest cultural icons and a singer who defined music and melody for generations of her countrymen, died on Sunday (Feb 6). She was 92 and is survived by her four siblings. She was hospitalised on Jan 11 after being infected with what a doctor told Reuters was COVID-19. Mangeshkar died on Sunday morning of ""multi-organ failure after more than 28 days of hospitalisation post-COVID-19"", said Dr Pratit Samdani, who was treating her at Mumbai's Breach Candy Hospital, according to Reuters TV partner ANI. Mangeshkar's voice has rung out of television sets, on crackly airwaves and from movie theatres for most of independent India's three quarters of a century, making hers the defining voice of many generations and earning her the title of ""the Nightingale"". ""I am anguished beyond words,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote on Twitter. She will receive a state funeral, and the government will observe state mourning with the flag at half-mast through Monday, the Home Ministry said in a statement. ""The kind and caring Lata Didi has left us,"" the prime minister wrote, using an affectionate term for older sister. ""She leaves a void in our nation that cannot be filled. The coming generations will remember her as a stalwart of Indian culture, whose melodious voice had an unparalleled ability to mesmerise people."" ""VOICE A GIFT FROM GOD"" Born in 1929 in pre-independence India, Mangeshkar began singing in her teens, and in a career spanning 73 years sang more than an estimated 15,000 songs in 36 languages. She enthralled music-mad Indians with her lilting voice and sheer range, singing everything from patriotic songs to romantic numbers, both in films and albums. The world of Bollywood - where movies were unthinkable without at least six songs and where everything from romance to grief was narrated with the help of a ballad - was where Mangeshkar cut her teeth and later made her name. Other Bollywood personalities and politicians offered condolences. ""Love, respect and prayers,"" tweeted Oscar- and Grammy-winning Indian musician A R Rahman. Mangeshkar sang a number of his award-winning songs. Classically trained, Mangeshkar moulded her voice to the demands of singing for Bollywood movies, even voicing songs in her 60s for an actress who was in her 20s. Her songs motivated millions of Indians during wars with China and Pakistan to pay homage to the defence forces. Some of her songs are used as prayers in temples, shrines and schools. ""My voice is a gift from God,"" she once told an interviewer. ""I learned to emote through my voice. When I sang a lullaby, I became a mother, when it was a romantic song, I was a lover."" The only songs she refused to sing were cabaret numbers and songs that had bawdy or racy lyrics, saying in later interviews those did not fit with her personal values. Mangeshkar nevertheless dominated the Hindi film industry for almost five decades until the 2000s, along with her younger sister Asha Bhosle. Mangeshkar's detractors accused her of using her Bollywood clout to limit the entry of newcomers. Her influence was such that Mumbai authorities in 2006 scrapped a planned highway flyover after she objected that it would disturb her privacy. Known for soft-spokenness and wearing a saree, her hair in two schoolgirl-like braids, Mangeshkar received India’s highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, in 2001. She was awarded France's highest civilian honour, the Legion of Honour, in 2009. “Music is incomplete without your voice,"" actor Amitabh Bachchan said of Mangeshkar in 2019, commemorating her 90th birthday. ""It has done the work of saints."""
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/jeremy-monteiro-simply-jazz-club-covid-19-pandemic-music-2476971,Live music is still not allowed so why has Jeremy Monteiro opened a new jazz club in Singapore?,"If you don’t know who Jeremy Monteiro is, please stop reading and Google him. You’ll quickly discover that Jeremy is Singapore’s king of jazz and its greatest local ambassador. He’s also a producer, musician, non-profit organisation head, and all around the single most important living person for the Singapore jazz scene. He’s worked his butt off over the last five decades, playing more than 3,000 gigs and nurturing generations of local musicians. He earned the Cultural Medallion­ – the highest national honour an artist can receive – back in 2002 at the age of 42. And he is one of the nicest and most passionate people you’ll ever meet. Oh and he's now a club owner. Late last year, in partnership with Tinbox, Jeremy opened a new jazz club and restaurant simply called Simply Jazz. And while we still can’t enjoy live music, Jeremy tells us the food is worth the visit. HI JEREMY, EVERYONE KNOWS YOU AS A MUSICIAN. BUT NOT EVERYONE MIGHT REALISE YOU ARE A RESTAURATEUR AND CLUB OWNER. TELL ME WHY YOU OPENED SIMPLY JAZZ. Actually, this is not my first rodeo as a club owner. I had opened Jeremy’s Jazz & Blues Cafe in 1995 at Liang Court. It was a Japanese cafe in the day and jazz club at night. We closed down just over a year later. The scene was not yet ready for it. We didn’t have the critical mass of jazz fans that we do nowadays. My partners and I lost a fair bit of money. But we had a lot of fun. We have no regrets. I then reopened a second Jeremy’s Jazz & Blues Cafe with the folks from the Europa Group at International House, which also lasted over a year. We didn’t lose money on that attempt, but my majority partners felt that we were “not making enough money”, so we shut it down and they then turned it into a pop music club. But they left the jazz photos up for a year before they renovated! For Simply Jazz, Tinbox Group Chairman Adrian Leong, who already has four other outlets, approached me to do a jazz club together and after much thought, I agreed to partner with him to open Simply Jazz by Tinbox. It took me awhile to decide given the two previous attempts that were not successful. But I hope that I am third-time lucky!
So far, since our soft opening in November, we've been doing well even without live music so the future looks bright! WAS IT DIFFICULT FINDING THE RIGHT LOCATION? Tinbox already had Simply Live next door at CHIJMES so when Simply Live moved to NTUC Income building in Bras Basah, Adrian moved Simply Retro into that space and we set up Simply Jazz at the former Simply Retro location. A bit of “musical chairs”. WHEN I THINK OF GREAT JAZZ CLUBS I THINK OF THE ONES OVERSEAS LIKE BLUE NOTE, BIRDLAND AND RONNIE SCOTT’S. WHY DO YOU THINK SINGAPORE HASN'T HAD A GOOD JAZZ CLUB? The Somerset's Bar at the former Westin Hotel was actually highly successful and profitable. But there is an American saying: “If it ain’t broke don’t fix it”. Well ... after great success from 1986 to 1999, they fixed it and everything collapsed. They fixed it by changing it from a true straight-ahead jazz lounge into a Buddha-Bar atmosphere and people just stopped coming. Singapore actually also had the makings of a successful jazz club pre-COVID-19 in Maduro, over on Harding Road. I hope they can return to the scene once the pandemic winds down and we can have live music in clubs again. Right now live music is still not allowed in F&B establishments, only concert-type venues. HAVING PLAYED IN GREAT JAZZ CLUBS AROUND THE WORLD, WHAT IS THE MAGIC FORMULA THAT EVERY GREAT JAZZ CLUB NEEDS TO GET RIGHT? You have to look at the local clientele. If we went totally bebop, it would be empty. If you try to pander, like a famous jazz club in Taipei I played at, and start allowing Whitney Houston to be considered jazz, you will lose the aficionados. So I will balance the repertoire of jazz in all its forms – straightahead and bebop, Latin and Brazilian jazz, fusion and contemporary jazz, and other forms of jazz – and will be careful to draw the line in the sand. So Al Jarreau, yes; Whitney Houston, no. WHAT’S YOUR OWN FAVOURITE CLUB TO PLAY IN OVERSEAS? Too many to list. I love PizzaExpress Jazz Club in London, maybe a little more than Ronnie Scott’s where I’ve also played. PizzaExpress has a lovely Steinway and with 110 seats, it’s intimate enough to connect with the audience. WHAT WAS THE CRAZIEST THING THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED TO YOU IN A JAZZ CLUB? Musically, someone coming up to me to ask me to play One Way Ticket by Boney M. And then, lo and behold, 10 years later, I got another request, on the stage of Harry’s, for the same song! On that occasion, I didn’t meet the person who requested it. If I did, I would have told him, “This is a jazz band and this is not a jazz song.” WAS THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO OPEN SIMPLY JAZZ DURING A PANDEMIC TOUGH?  Well Adrian and the Tinbox Group were ready to enter in this climate so that they would be ready and waiting for when things get better. They have good resources and are prepared to weather it out with me. Having said that, Chef Jack Leong is amazing and people come and pack the place for our food which is basically designed for a Singaporean palate. So one moment a pizza, another beef medallions, and then seafood San Lou Bee Hoon. The busy Friday, Saturday and occasional busy weekday also helps us to cruise through and stay sustainable. I KNOW YOU’RE A FOODIE. HOW INVOLVED HAVE YOU BEEN WITH THE MENU AT SIMPLY JAZZ? I was involved with the food tasting sessions. Our chef is amazing. Occasionally I feed back to him or our outlet manager Charlene Chua about how we can improve the food or cocktails, but generally speaking, the team has gotten it right from the beginning so I really didn’t have to kaypoh too much with the food & beverage. WHAT’S THE BEST THING ON THE MENU? That’s a hard question. I like so many items. I think the scallop and avocado ceviche served in kueh pie-ti cups is great. The rack of lamb has converted quite a few non-lamb eaters into lamb lovers and I love the capellini pasta with scallop and tobiko. Another must-have are the beef medallions, which are tasty and succulent when served medium-rare. SOUNDS AWESOME. GETTING BACK TO THE MUSIC, DO YOU THINK JAZZ IS FINDING NEW AUDIENCES? WHAT CAN BE DONE TO GET YOUNGER GENERATIONS INTO THE GENRE?  Actually, a lot has been happening and the jazz audience has been steadily growing over the years. And Singaporean audiences are also becoming much more discerning. Jazz is now an O-Level elective subject in Singapore so many young people have started to seriously get into listening and also playing jazz. It’s definitely on the up and up. Half of my audience are below 40 these days. So I see young people and older people in the audience. This is completely different from maybe 20 years ago when 80 per cent of my audience used to be people 40 and above. WILL YOU BE PLAYING AT SIMPLY JAZZ?  I will play there two nights a week. I will also sometimes be there when my other activities are not so intense. And I will be hiring a good number of Singaporean jazz musicians, both young and old, to play there as well. IS THERE AN AMATEUR NIGHT? CAN YOUNG PERFORMERS REACH OUT TO YOU TO GET GIGS THERE? No. We won’t have an amateur night, but we will hold a jam session night where young players will show off their stuff. For those who haven’t being paying attention, some of the young jazz players in Singapore already rival some of the best in the region of any age. HOW TOUGH HAS THE PANDEMIC BEEN ON THE JAZZ SCENE HERE? WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO PERFORM LIVE, HOW HAVE THE ARTISTS BEEN COPING? It has been disastrous for musicians. Those of us who have been able to pivot to do things online or play concerts – since concerts are allowed – have been soldiering on. But more than 80 per cent of the musicians who used to play the clubs have had to take on other non-musician jobs. Some of the lucky ones have taken up teaching. It’s really been hard for them. There has been some government help and the Jazz Association (Singapore) where I serve as executive director also has given some jazz musicians help with the JASS Crisis Fund, but honestly, it’s heart-breaking for me to see the majority of club musicians struggle. My partner Adrian who chairs the Tinbox Group had signed on a bunch of musicians to play at his Simply Live outlet and has kept them on full payroll all this time during (the pandemic). They do livestream shows for the group and sometimes they also back the artists at Capitol Theatre at their shows. Capitol Theatre is now managed by IMC Live Global where Adrian Leong is also executive vice-chairman. ARE YOU PLANNING ANY SPECIAL GIGS THIS YEAR THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING OUT FOR? Well, one of my peak experience gigs was just done on Jan 22 with re:Sound Collective. I was playing my orchestral symphonic jazz music. I have quite a lot of shows lined up these year but the Jazz Association (Singapore) charity gala on Apr 30 and my 45th Anniversary shows at Esplanade Concert Hall on Jul 1 and Jul 2 will be really special things to watch out for. I also hope to do a performing tour in Europe in July if the COVID-19 situation allows."

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/dong-dong-qiang-lagu-tahun-baru-cina-bahasa-melayu-2458546,Nyanyikan dalam Bahasa Melayu: Lagu Tahun Baru Cina yang paparkan perpaduan budaya mencuit hati ramai,"KUALA LUMPUR: Ia bukan sebarang lagu Tahun Baru Cina.  Semua ciri menarik yang perlu ada pada sesebuah lagu, ada padanya. Dari iramanya yang riang ria, lirik yang positif, hinggalah kepada pakaian para artisnya yang berwarna-warni mencerminkan perayaan bertuah.  Namun populariti Dong Dong Qiang yang mula dimainkan pada 7 Januari lalu, terletak pada barisan penyanyinya – mereka berbangsa Melayu dan mendendangkannya dalam Bahasa Melayu.  Ini merupakan kali pertama sebuah lagu asal Tahun Baru Cina dinyanyikan dalam bahasa kebangsaan Malaysia, kata penerbit dan komposernya Nevin Hiong. Rakyat Malaysia rata-rata satu hati memuji usaha unik ini. Dengan lirik yang lazim didengari iaitu “gong xi gong xi” dan “dong dong qiang” disisipi lirik Melayu, lagu ini menampilkan Ayie Floor 88, Harry Khalifah, Sarah Suhairi, Beby Acha, Lia Aziz dan Aidilia Hilda.  “Ketika pemilik label rekod MVM Production menghubungi saya untuk menerbitkan sebuah lagu Tahun Baru Cina untuk artis Melayu mereka, tidak pula beliau menyebut ia perlu digubah dalam Bahasa Melayu.  “Beliau hanya menetapkan tiga syarat iaitu lagu tersebut perlu mengandungi ‘gong xi ni’, ‘dong dong qiang’ dan ‘huat ah’. Ini semua ungkapan yang biasa didengar oleh rakan-rakan Melayu kita,” kata Hiong kepada CNA. Ungkapan-ungkapan ini bermaksud ucapan selamat Tahun Baru Cina, merupakan mimikan bunyi irama gendang dan simbal, dan ungkapan Hokkien yang bermaksud kemakmuran.  “Saya terfikir, ketiga-tiga ungkapan ini adalah dalam Bahasa Cina dan lagu pula akan didendangkan oleh artis Melayu, jadi mengapa tidak kita gabungkan irama gaya Melayu dan instrumen Cina, dan hasilkan sesuatu yang istimewa?” tambah Hiong. Lagu yang menarik ini kemudian digandingkan dengan lirik ciptaan pengurus penerbitan Hiong yang dikenali sebagai Uncle Chain. Setelah dimuat naik ke YouTube, lagu ini pantas menambat hati para pendengar di Malaysia. Ramai memujinya kerana menggambarkan hubungan erat antara kaum di negara ini.  “Niat kami asalnya untuk menerbitkan lagu Tahun Baru Cina, namun bertukar menjadi lagu patriotik pula,” kata Hiong, mengulas sambutan luar dugaan yang diterima.  Dalam video muzik ini, tanglung merah dan bunga ume (plum blossom) menghiasi set sementara para artis kelihatan mencuba seni kaligrafi Cina dan bermain gendang tarian singa.   Sambil memakai pakaian tradisional Cina dan Melayu, mereka menyanyikan: “Luar kita berbeza, hati tetap kan sama. Kita bagaikan pokok, kuat pada akarnya.” Dalam satu babak, irama alat muzik Cina diganti dengan gendang Melayu dan Ayie menunjukkan kebolehannya menari zapin, satu tarian tradisional Melayu.  Malah, beberapa ahli kumpulan tarian singa di dalam lagu tersebut juga berbangsa Melayu, dedah Hiong. Setiap babak menggambarkan keharmonian antara budaya. Namun, terang Hiong, beliau dan ahli kumpulan pada asalnya tiada niat pun untuk mempromosi keharmonian kaum.   Sebaliknya, “ia lebih kepada ingin mencuba pelbagai idea.” Ini merupakan hasil kreativiti sekumpulan penggiat seni Cina dan Melayu yang pernah berkolaborasi sebelumnya.  “Orang Melayu pandai bergurai senda. Mereka hidup secara sederhana dan tidak banyak kerenah. Mereka suka bersenang-senang dan gemar berseronok di tempat kerja, jadi bekerja dengan mereka sesuatu yang menyenangkan,” kata Hiong, seorang pengarah filem yang pernah memenangi anugerah.  “Mereka juga cukup berbakat. Jika sesuatu babak itu memerlukan mereka menangis, mereka mudah mengalirkan air mata,” tambah beliau. Bagi Sarah yang merupakan salah seorang selebriti dalam Dong Dong Qiang, kemahiran rakan sekerja berbangsa Cina menguruskan masa merupakan sesuatu yang beliau hargai.  “Mereka mahukan setiap perkara sempurna namun pada masa yang sama tidak terlalu tegas. Kami boleh bersuka ria semasa menyiapkan projek,” ujarnya kepada CNA. Mendalami budaya kaum Cina dan mempelajari serba sedikit mengenai rakan senegara semasa pembikinan lagu ini ternyata menjadi pengalaman berguna kepada para artis ini.  Ujar Sarah: “Saya belum pernah cuba menyanyi dalam bahasa lain, apatah lagi lagu perayaan kaum lain.”  Walaupun “gong xi” merupakan ucapan selamat yang biasa umpamanya pada sepanduk dan papan iklan menjelang sambutan Tahun Baru Cina, menyebutnya dengan betul merupakan satu cabaran buat beliau.  “Sebutannya bukan ‘gong’ atau ‘kong’ tetapi ‘gung’.  “Amat sukar bagi kami untuk mendapatkan bunyi dan sebutan yang tepat sedari awal. Banyak cabaran kami hadapi namun begitu kami cukup gemar lagu ini,” kata beliau. Sambil menunjukkan hasil kaligrafi Cina yang ditulisnya semasa di set, Sarah menceritakan bagaimana mereka diajar cara betul memegang berus dan mencelupnya ke dalam dakwat.  Ungkapan yang diberi kepadanya untuk ditulis adalah “shen ti jian kang (kesihatan yang baik)”. Hasil kerja ini dibawanya pulang untuk kenang-kenangan.  Setakat ini Dong Dong Qiang telah memperoleh 500,000 lebih tontonan di Youtube. Hiong memberitahu beliau turut menerima permintaan daripada stesen-stesen radio Cina tempatan untuk memainkan lagu tersebut.  Label rekod mereka juga telah dihubungi untuk acara persembahan, tambah Sarah.   Sempena Tahun Harimau, beliau berharap rakyat Malaysia akan menghargai kepelbagaian budaya di negara ini.  “Saya berharap setiap kita saling memahami budaya masing-masing dan tidak hanya mencari kesalahan orang lain. Semoga tahun ini menjadi tahun di mana kita saling mempelajari antara satu sama lain,” ujar beliau.  Baca artikel ini dalam Bahasa Inggeris.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/dong-dong-qiang-chinese-new-year-song-malay-bahasa-melayu-2457666,Sing it in Bahasa Melayu: Chinese New Year song celebrating cross-cultural unity warms Malaysians’ hearts,"KUALA LUMPUR: This is not your typical Chinese New Year song.  It ticks all the necessary boxes - upbeat tunes, positive lyrics and costumes in auspicious colours - but Dong Dong Qiang, released on Jan 7, stands out with its all-Malay ensemble singing in Bahasa Melayu.  This is likely the very first original Chinese New Year song in the national language of Malaysia, according to its music producer and composer Nevin Hiong, and one that has united Malaysians in applauding the unique efforts. With customary “gong xi gong xi” and “dong dong qiang” interwoven with Malay lyrics, the song features Ayie Floor 88, Harry Khalifah, Sarah Suhairi, Beby Acha, Lia Aziz and Aidilia Hilda.  “When the owner of record label MVM Production reached out to me to produce a Chinese New Year song for his Malay artistes, he didn’t specify that it should be in Bahasa Melayu.  “He only set three requirements - the song should contain ‘gong xi ni’, ‘dong dong qiang’ and ‘huat ah’, phrases that Malay friends are familiar with,” Hiong told CNA.  The phrases, respectively, are a common Chinese New Year greeting, an onomatopoeia for drum beat and cymbal clash, and Hokkien for prosperity.  “I was thinking, these three phrases are Chinese and the song will be performed by Malay artistes, why not incorporate Malay-style melody and Chinese instruments for something special?” Hiong added.  The catchy tunes were then paired with lyrics penned by Hiong’s production manager, who is known as Uncle Chain. The song quickly captured the hearts of Malaysians after it was uploaded on Youtube, with many praising it for portraying the harmonious interracial ties in the country.  “Our original intention was to produce a Chinese New Year song, but now it has evolved into a patriotic song,” Hiong said of the unexpected responses.  In the music video, red lanterns and plum blossoms adorn the sets as the artistes try their hand at Chinese calligraphy and playing a lion dance troupe’s drum.   Donned in Chinese and Malay traditional attire, they belt out: “We appear different on the outside, but our hearts are the same. We are like a tree with strong roots.” At one point, the Chinese instruments give way to Malay drums and Ayie shows off his zapin (traditional Malay dance) moves.  Even some members of the lion dance troupe featured in the song are Malays, Hiong revealed. Every scene painted a picture of cross-cultural experience, but Hiong said there was no deliberate intention on their part to promote racial harmony.   Rather, “it was mostly about having fun with ideas”, a natural product of a team of Chinese and Malay creatives who are used to working with each other.  “Malays have a great sense of humour. They live modestly and are easily satisfied. They are happy-go-lucky. And they tend to have fun while at work, so it’s enjoyable working with them,” Hiong, an award-winning filmmaker and director, said.  “They are also highly talented artistically. If the scenes require them to cry, their tears will immediately fall,” he added. For Sarah, one of the celebrities in Dong Dong Qiang, her Chinese colleagues’ time management skills is among the things she appreciates.  “They want everything to be perfect but at the same time, they are not very strict. They allow us to enjoy ourselves while doing the project,” she told CNA.  Dwelling deeper into Chinese culture and learning a little bit more about fellow Malaysians during the song production proved to be a fruitful experience for the artistes too.  Sarah said: “I have never tried singing in another language, let alone singing a festive song about another culture.”  While “gong xi” is an ubiquitous new year greeting seen on banners and billboards as Chinese New Year nears, getting the pronunciation right was a challenge for her.  “It’s not ‘gong’ or ‘kong’ but ‘gung’. “It’s very hard for us to get the exact sound and pronounce it right from the start. We had a lot of struggles but we really enjoyed the song,” she said. Showing the piece of Chinese calligraphy she wrote on the set, Sarah recalled how they were taught the right way of holding the brush and dipping it into the ink.  The phrase assigned to her was “shen ti jian kang (good health)” and she made sure she brought her work home as a keepsake.  Dong Dong Qiang has so far raked in more than 500,000 views on YouTube, and Hiong said he has received requests from local Chinese radio stations to play the song on air.  The record label has also been approached for performance engagements, Sarah added.   For the Year of the Tiger, she hoped Malaysians would appreciate the different cultures in the country.  “I hope everyone can be understanding about each other’s culture and not just find fault with other people. I am hoping that this year will be the year we learn something from others,” she said.  Read this story in Bahasa Melayu here. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/shaun-chen-mediacorp-actor-leave-no-soul-behind-drama-2422236,Shaun Chen says his family laughed at him when he was honing his dance moves for new drama,"Shaun Chen has won several accolades for his acting but have you heard about his dancing? The 43-year-old surprised viewers by flaunting his dance moves on the new Mediacorp Channel 8 drama Leave No Soul Behind.  In it, he plays a has-been idol who dies and comes back to haunt Felicia Chin’s character. Starring with Rayson Tan, Chen has plenty of opportunities to show off his interesting (to say the least) dance moves on the show. Chen told 8days.sg that for one of the scenes where he sang and danced at the same time, he had someone teach him the dance moves, which he recorded. He then spent two months practising at home.  “I didn’t dance as well as I hoped to,” he said. Chen also had to create his own dance steps for certain scenes, and these had to be “more old-fashioned” in style to suit his character.  Does he think he’s a good dancer? “I don't dance very well. I really have to learn and practice more 'cos there wasn't much time to rehearse (for the show),” Chen said. Nevertheless, the need to groove must be catching because Chen surprised fans by flaunting his dance moves on social media. In the interview with 8days.sg, he poked fun at himself for getting on the TikTok bandwagon, which netizens gushed over, some teasing him about his dated dance routine. “(My TikTok videos are) a small teaser for everyone to see how bad my dancing skills are,” he added. He took the comments in good stride though, revealing that to stay relevant in the entertainment industry, he had to upgrade himself regularly.  “Posting occasionally, and playing around, letting people see and making some noise. I think it's quite gratifying.” When asked if he received any feedback from his family, he chuckled: “They just laugh at me”. Chen added that his two daughters, Nellie and Neia, are better dancers than he is, as they learn dance in school. Leave No Soul Behind is available on demand for free on meWATCH. It airs weekdays, 9pm on Channel 8.   "

Suga, 28, whose real name is Min Yoon-gi, was confirmed to have contracted the virus on Friday during his self-quarantine upon his return home on Thursday, according to Bit Hit Music. He had received his second COVID-19 vaccination in August, had not come in contact with any other members recently and was not showing any symptoms, the company said. ""He is currently administering self-care at home,"" it said in a statement. ""We see the artists' health as our top priority, and will do everything we can to aid Suga in his speedy recovery."" The band has had ""a number of personal engagements in the United States"" after holding their first in-person concerts in Los Angeles since the start of the pandemic. Big Hit has said BTS would take a break over year-end holidays and prepare for a new concert and album. Since their 2013 debut, BTS has spearheaded a global K-pop craze with catchy, upbeat music and dances, as well as lyrics and social campaigns aimed at empowering young people. The group won the top prize of artist of the year at the American Music Awards for the first time in November, and best pop song for their summer hit Butter, among other awards. As the pandemic swept the world, BTS postponed and then called off what would have been their biggest global tour involving nearly 40 concerts last year, resorting to online shows."

The set is now back in stock on KrisShop, albeit with a brand-new design. This time, while the set retains its batik print theme, it now has a new colour scheme: Emerald green. The previous set was decked in blue.  The tiles also sport a fresh new set of flight-related icons, including runway lights, an aircraft, luggage and international time zones. These replace the classic symbols usually featured on mahjong tiles.  The set is priced at S$388, excluding GST, and is now available for purchase to KrisFlyer members. Krisflyer members can also use miles to redeem a set, or earn more miles with the purchase of every set. Non-members can purchase the set from January 16, 2022.  Shoppers can only purchase one set per customer, and it looks as though there’s already growing interest in the product. According to data on KrisShop’s website, more than 18,000 shoppers have viewed the set in the past 24 hours.  In an October interview with CNA Luxury, Chris Pok, CEO of Krishop, described his initial surprise at the popularity of the mahjong set when it was first launched. “The mahjong set really took us by surprise. That gave us a lot of encouragement and a lot of opportunities to work with brands [to co-design products],” he said.  “We have a lot more lined up, which will be launched towards the end of the year,” he had teased."

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/hasnor-sidik-mr-has-rawjak-zouk-dj-2330066,Singapore DJ Mr Has dreams of throwing a COVID-19 'closing party' in the jungle,"For music fans and club kids of all ages, Hasnor Sidik needs no introduction, except that most would know him by his professional moniker, Mr Has. Hasnor is one of Singapore’s most influential DJs and a key influencer in the music and lifestyle scene. He’s played gigs from Bali to Berlin and spent time working as the in-house music director at the W Hotel and also at the Lo & Behold Group. He is a co-founder and music director of the Telok Ayers Art Club, a Mr Porter Style Council member (one of only three from Singapore), and founder of his own music label Rawjak. Mr Has is yearning for a time in which live entertainment can come back and has an awesome idea for what he calls the Covid Closing Party. HI HAS, WERE YOU ALWAYS INTO MUSIC, EVEN WHEN REALLY YOUNG? I have always enjoyed music since a very young age. Back in the late '80s when breakdancing came onto our shores, I remember dancing to Kraftwerks’ Tour De France in the HDB common corridor with some other kids with our track suits on. WHEN DID YOU FIRST TRY YOUR HAND AT DJING? The real reason why I wanted to DJ came about in the late 90s; it was because of drum and bass music that came from the UK at that time. I thought it would be really cool to play that sound in a club, so I bought myself a pair of turntables and a mixer with the money that I saved from working after my O Levels and just started practising at home. IF YOU WERE TO LOOK BACK, HOW WOULD THE MR HAS OF TODAY CRITIQUE THE YOUNG DJ YOU WERE WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED OUT? I would encourage more record digging and collecting, and not to hurry to get a gig. It is a beautiful part of the process which takes a lot of time and practice, so I would tell my younger self to slow down. WHEN DID YOU DECIDE MUSIC COULD BE A REAL CAREER FOR YOU? When the gigs started coming in! That obviously was a big factor. At that time, I told myself if I wanted to have a DJ career, I must deejay at Zouk at some point. So things started falling into place and pretty soon, I had a part-time residency there and more gigs kept coming. WAS IT HARD TO GET RECOGNISED AND TO GET GIGS? Yes, I had to do a lot of networking apart from just practising at home. Getting to know the scene more and sharing my mixtapes with other fellow DJs and friends helped in getting my music out there. WHAT ADVICE DO YOU GIVE YOUR DJS WHO ASK YOU HOW THEY CAN STAND OUT AND BUILD THEIR OWN CAREERS? I suggest going analog to start with, work on the turntables and record digging first before going with the current software and hardware solutions. You need to understand the fundamentals of DJing. Also, gain some experience producing your own music – it’s a key part in building a music career. WHAT IS THE MOST MEMORABLE PERFORMANCE TO DATE? I have done many amazing gigs but the one gig where I truly enjoyed myself was the courtyard party that I did with W Hotels and Singapore Art Museum. A gathering of Singapore’s best DJs playing to a thousand-strong crowd under the stars. Quite magical!  AND WHAT WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING? They are all challenging. The most challenging part, as a DJ, is that connection and control on the dance floor. It’s a powerful energy that you have to keep up for a good four to six hours, sometimes more at a party. Not an easy task. WHAT IS BIGGEST MISCONCEPTION YOU GET ABOUT WHAT YOU DO? That it’s all fun and travel. ANY OPINION ON CELEBRITIES WHO ALSO DJ? I’m pretty sure there are some out there that can really deejay. WHAT WOULD YOUR DREAM GIG BE? My dream gig right now would be called The CCP – Covid Closing Party – located in a beautiful green, open jungle space in Singapore with plenty of fresh air and not many mosquitoes. It has 24 hours of music and art programming where everyone can come and have fun from day to night to celebrate the end of this pandemic. DJs, musicians, artists, chefs and F&B operators would get together to celebrate the start of “the new endemic"". Mask, optional. I need to talk to the Singapore Tourism Board about this actually. Maybe they will like the idea enough to help me make this a reality. YOU HAVE WORKED IN-HOUSE AT COMPANIES LIKE LO & BEHOLD AND W HOTEL. HOW DIFFERENT IS WORKING FOR COMPANIES LIKE THESE FROM PLAYING GIGS? It was a totally different scope. Those were both management roles for brands that involved budgets, strategy, planning, producing, curating & executing on a corporate level. Very different from gigs. TELL ME ABOUT TELOK AYER ARTS CLUB? HOW DID THAT COME ABOUT? My partner Sue-Shan told me about the idea when she had a space on McCallum Street and was figuring out what to do with it. After much discussion and realising there weren't many art 'offerings' in the CBD, Telok Ayer Arts Club was born. We were also trying to pay homage to the Telok Ayer Performing Arts Centre, which used to be nearby but was sadly demolished. WHAT PROJECTS AND PROGRAMMES DO YOU DRIVE AT THERE? Our club night is called Kelab Malam. It is a monthly party where we have DJs and friends get together for a fun night of food, music and drinks. Makan Matters is our guest chef nights where we introduce new individuals showcasing their personal recipes. TAAC:LIVE is our local live electronic music showcase. Our arts programming is handled by the arts manager, Anmari, and we have collaborated and worked with artistes like Ashidiq Ghazali, Dawn Ng, Aiwei Foo and more. It’s really great to have this kind of space that drives collaborations with local creatives. WHAT EXCITES YOU RIGHT NOW ABOUT THE LOCAL MUSIC SCENE? The talent that is coming out right now excites me. We are more expressive these days so we will see more musicians and artistes doing their thing. WHAT INSPIRES YOU? Family, friends, ping pong. And of course, music. HOW HAS THE PANDEMIC AFFECTED TELOK AYER ARTS CLUB AND YOUR OTHER GIGS? We had to end our lease and regroup during this difficult time. We just launched #TAACAWAY, an online takeaway platform featuring new Singaporean cuisine. Check it out! Every order comes with a playlist and an NFT. As for the other gigs, they will only come back when the entertainment industry is back on. ANY EXCITING PLANS FOR 2022? Look out for more updates on Telok Ayer Arts Club and the rebranding of my label Rawjak."

According to local news reports, New Zealand-born comedian Sam Hammington is leaving the KBS show after five years of being a regular fixture, taking with him his two adorable sons Bentley and William.  The Return Of Superman follows celebrity dads as they are left to care for their kids alone for 48 hours and has featured the likes of actor Song Il-gook and his fraternal triplets Dae-han, Min-guk and Man-se, MMA fighter Choo Sung-hoon and his daughter Sa-rang, as well as footballer Lee Dong-gook and his five children. The popularity of the show has helped boost the fame of its cast members over the years and has done the same for Hammington, who before this had mainly appeared on the small screen in cameo roles. Hammington made several posts on his Instagram page with some insight on the decision. In one post, he apologised for the ""sudden announcement"" and described the last few days as being a ""rollercoaster of emotion"". He also posted a slideshow of his sons' photos with the text, ""It hurts to leave like this but thanks for the memories!"".  In a photo of himself and his sons in a pool, Hammington wrote: ""With every beginning there comes an end, (and) as unfortunate as it is, the time is right for us to move on.  ""Due to you, the fans, we have been afforded some amazing memories. Thank you. We hope that you will continue to support and love us in the future as well,"" he wrote.  Fans have been quick to offer their support to the trio, leaving comments like ""Fighting, Sam appa"" and ""Thank you for making me happy"".

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/panda-cub-singapore-name-mandai-wildlife-group-2324671,Singapore’s panda cub is turning 100 days old and he's finally getting a name in December,"It is almost 100 days after Singapore welcomed its first giant panda cub, Kai Kai and Jia Jia’s baby. He turns 100 days old on Sunday (Nov 21) – and soon, the public can look forward to his public debut, with a brand new name. The 100-day celebration is customary in China, where the giant pandas hail from, to mark the end of the most vulnerable period for both mother and baby. As the day approaches, Mandai Wildlife Group’s panda care team is now preparing for the cub’s public debut.  Currently weighing just over 6kg and measuring 67cm, the panda cub has grown out his baby teeth and developed crawl-walking skills that let him roam independently.  The cub’s gender was revealed back in September this year, as members of the public were invited to submit name suggestions.  Now, Singaporeans can look forward to the cub’s name-reveal sometime in December.  “We would like to thank the public for their help in the naming process, which received more than 64,000 votes,” said Mandai Wildlife Group’s Group CEO, Mike Barclay.  Having reviewed public submissions, the judging panel shortlisted the names 宏宏 (Hong Hong), 叻叻 (Le Le), 新乐 (Xin Le), 新阳 (Xin Yang) and 新缘 (Xin Yuan). Of the five, Kai Kai and Jia Jia’s baby will take the name with the highest number of public votes. As the panda cub matures, River Wonders guests can expect to catch glimpses of him roaming the Giant Panda Forest in the coming weeks, Barclay added. “As he becomes more comfortable and independent, we expect him to join Jia Jia in her public exhibit from early next year.” In preparation for his public debut, the park’s panda care team is conditioning the cub to be away from Jia Jia for longer periods of time. To help him adapt to different surroundings, the team is also introducing him to new environments while monitoring the development of his motor skills.  Born on Aug 14, Kai Kai and Jia Jia’s baby is set to return to China when he reaches full independence in about two years. Following which, he will join the rest of China’s panda breeding population. "

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/alec-baldwin-set-accident-prop-gun-death-2261826,Commentary: Workplace safety on a film set isn’t different from any other,"MELBOURNE: When shooting a film with guns, there are many choices to make: Each prop needs to be appropriate for the character and for the scene. There is also the choice of whether you will use replica weapons, real weapons or a mix. But most importantly, everyone on set needs to know how to work alongside guns. A gun with no ammunition – that is, a gun with neither a bullet nor blanks – is not dangerous. But even so, on set there is always an armourer, a safety officer and a stunt coordinator: At least three people who always have an eye on the guns on set. We recently finished shooting Darklands, a psychological thriller staring Nadine Garner about a policewoman who fails to stop a shooting and is then pursued by a journalist determined to use the policewoman’s story to resurrect her own flagging writing career. We used real weapons, but we only used blanks in one scene. The night we fired the blanks was a very controlled situation, working with a very experienced crew. The safety of our cast and crew was of utmost importance to us. Here are some of the things we kept in mind. When the worst thing happens and someone dies on set, the impact resonates profoundly throughout the industry and the lives of those affected. Two big stories in the 1980s, in particular, changed how occupational health and safety is approached on sets. In 1982, three actors – two of them children – were killed on the set of Twilight Zone, when special effects explosions caused a helicopter to crash. Their deaths will echo through film sets forever. In 1984, the actor Jon-Erik Hexums put a gun filled with blanks to his head, and, joking about delays to filming, he pulled the trigger. The force of the wadding was enough to fatally injure him. Instead of using a bullet, blanks use wads of paper, plastic, felt or cotton – this wadding ensures you get a certain level of flame out of the gun. But this wadding is the thing which can cause a lot of injury - just because a gun is using blanks doesn’t mean it isn’t dangerous. For all elements of shooting a film, you have to sit and worry about all possible scenarios and have a plan for any risks. The safety officer will work elbow to elbow with the director and first assistant director to ensure the safety of the set. While scouting for locations, the safety officer will consider elements such as trip hazards, road safety, how the set will be lit at night and the supply of electricity. When you are filming on public land, such as parks, the council will ask for a risk assessment: This can detail where people will park, where bathroom facilities will be located, where equipment will be, as well as considering potential problems like what would happen if a limb was to fall from a tree. Even an actor carrying a cup of hot coffee on screen will be considered for safety. Filming this year, we also added an on-set nurse and COVID-19 officer to consider the health of everyone on set. When a scene is set, the safety officer will check everything, down to the safety mats on the ground to the gel padding hidden by costumes. On film sets, guns are supplied by an armourer. They will have access to both real and replica weapons, with real weapons costing more to hire than replicas. Any moment you are using weapons on set, you must treat them with the utmost respect. Safety has to be paramount. In Australia, guns are so rarely handled we found they are highly respected: People are very conscious of the weapon. All of the protocols surrounding gun use are well established. Everything on set around a gun must be treated with an abundance of caution. The weapon with the blank was never fired at anyone. All cast and crew are briefed multiple times about safety. The police are always notified, as are any neighbours adjacent to the filming location. We chose to shoot with real weapons, but we only used blanks in one scene. In every other scene, visual effects (VFX) will be used. The blanks were chosen because of the importance of the weapon to the storytelling in that scene. We needed the reflections on the actor’s face to be real, her physical response to be real - like when Alan Rickman was dropped while shooting Die Hard. Sometimes the moment just calls for that palpable truth. But many gun effects can be done well through VFX and companies even sell VFX gunfire packages. Adding these effects is a very specialised field: They can add different muzzle flares, different smoke patterns and you can even make a gun recoil in someone’s hand. Our sympathies go out to the families of those affected by this incident. We can only imagine what Alec Baldwin would be feeling right now. It is a horrendous situation for everyone involved. This is an issue of workplace safety. When things go fatally wrong in any workplace, it is a tragedy. In Australia, we have always found film to be a really well-regulated environment. On our set, we all understand making a movie is not worth putting someone’s life or health at risk. We can only imagine most filmmakers feel the same.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/netflix-employee-fired-dave-chappelle-closer-2248641,Netflix employee fired in wake of Dave Chappelle special furor,"Netflix said Friday (Oct 15) that it had fired an employee for disclosing confidential financial information about what it paid for Dave Chappelle’s comedy special The Closer, which some condemned as being transphobic. The employee, who wasn't named, shared “confidential, commercially sensitive information outside the company"", a Netflix statement said. “We understand this employee may have been motivated by disappointment and hurt with Netflix, but maintaining a culture of trust and transparency is core to our company,” the statement said. The statement said the information was referenced in a Bloomberg news article, which reported that Netflix spent US$24.1 million on The Closer, which first aired last week. The article also mentioned the lower budgets for a 2019 Chapelle special, a Bo Burnham special and the nine-episode hit Squid Game. Netflix said a review of its internal access logs pinpointed the information to a single person, who “admitted that they downloaded and shared sensitive company information externally"". The Closer, first aired on Oct 1 and had gained at least 10 million views. However, Chapelle's remarks about the transgender community raised protests within Netflix and from LGBTQ activists. The media watchdog group GLAAD said that “anti-LGBTQ content” violates Netflix’s policy to reject programmes that incite hate or violence. However, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos told managers in an internal memo that the show doesn't cross “the line on hate"" and will remain on the streaming service. Several Netflix employees, including a software engineer who identifies as transgender, had criticised the special. Transgender employees and their co-workers are being urged to stage a walkout next Wednesday in protest. “Our leadership has shown us that they do not uphold the values for which we are held,” said a Monday post on a public company Slack channel, the Los Angeles Times reported."

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/indonesia-dangdut-music-performers-livelihoods-covid-19-2225321,Dangdut quandary: Indonesia folk pop industry grapples with uncertainties amid pandemic,"JAKARTA: With full makeup and glitzy outfit, Netha Salsabila used to mesmerise the audience when she performed dangdut, Indonesia’s folk pop music famous for its upbeat melodies. The 32-year-old, who goes by the moniker Ranesa Queen, is a dangdut singer in the Indonesian city of Madiun, East Java. Like many other dangdut performers, she was forced to switch jobs and change her lifestyle because of COVID-19.     When the pandemic broke out last year, her world turned upside down from performing shows at night to cooking food for her customers in the early hours of the morning. “The reason I changed my job is that many events were cancelled due to the difficulty of obtaining a permit for holding celebratory events such as weddings and birthdays,” she told CNA. “So I switched to culinary and now I sell food online such as fried catfish.” Dangdut performances usually involve singing, live music and dancing. In a normal situation, they are not difficult to host. However, putting all the elements together during the pandemic is not an easy task, particularly when live events open to a large audience are not allowed. With the many movement and gathering restrictions imposed in public places, dangdut artistes and musicians have found it difficult to make a living as there are no opportunities for any public performances. Singers and musicians interviewed by CNA admitted they now earn significantly less than before as dangdut artistes. Many said they could not wait to get back on stage again when all the restrictions are lifted so they could continue with their performances.   Often touted as the national music of Indonesia, dangdut as a genre arrived in Southeast Asia (namely Indonesia and Malaya) in the late 1950s, said music experts.   Originally developed by infusing Malay music with Hindi and Arabic influences, dangdut in its contemporary version also includes many Indonesian folk elements. Dangdut’s popularity reached its peak in the 1990s especially in Indonesia when it was both a medium of mass entertainment as well as a platform to promote national messages and popular narratives.   As folk music of sorts, dangdut remains popular to many segments of the Indonesian society today, especially the general public. Its massive popularity helped to entice many young people including Salsabila to become full-time dangdut singers, musicians or dancers. But as the COVID-19 situation worsened, many in the dangdut music industry had to bear the brunt of the pandemic with few or no opportunities to perform. Salsabila became a dangdut singer 17 years ago by accident when a friend asked her to replace a dangdut singer who abruptly cancelled a gig. “Coincidentally, singing has been my hobby since I was little. So I then joined a group called Sentana.  “I learned a lot from the musicians whom I regard as my own siblings,” said Salsabila.  As a dangdut singer, she could earn about 5 million rupiah (US$350) per month from various performances.  If she had offers to perform in other cities such as in Malang or Tuban, she could even earn up to 7.5 million rupiah in a month. Currently, she only earns about half of her previous income.    “I miss performing on stage and eating during festivities. Now I only sit at home and cannot gather with fellow artistes.”   Besides, running her own food business is a difficult task where extra patience and tenacity are required, she said.   ”Early in the morning I have to be ready and take pictures of the food and upload them to my social media accounts,” she noted, adding that most of her customers approach her on social media.   Another former dangdut singer Novi Listiana, 23, has turned to farming to make ends meet since the pandemic. Based in Boyolali, Central Java, Listiana previously performed in several villages in her hometown.  “I was a singer not because my voice is good but because I was the only breadwinner in my small family. “So I had to do it for my family and I had been singing since I was in junior high school in 2013,” she said. When she got married in 2018, she thought about changing her career and appearance too. She was concerned that there are people in Muslim-majority Indonesia who disapprove of the way some dangdut female artistes dress and deem it too revealing and “unIslamic”.   As she decided to leave the dangdut music scene, Listiana also found it hard to find a different job especially when the pandemic situation worsened in Indonesia. “When COVID-19 struck, there were also no requests to perform. I looked for other jobs and couldn’t find any,” she said. Her musician husband, who played a two-headed drum called kendang, also decided to leave behind his music career. He taught Listiana some farming skills and since then both husband and wife have been working as smallholder farmers. “At first I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed. But over time I actually feel happy and now I feel comfortable being a farmer,” she told CNA. Listiana said that income wise, there was no drop in her earning as she still makes about two million rupiah per month, the same amount she earned as dangdut singer. Less fortunate though are dangdut musicians such as Agus Suprapto and Listyo Pramono. Suprapto, who was a dangdut keyboardist for almost two decades, is now an electrical handyman. He also runs a small food stall and a Playstation 3 (PS3) video game rental service.   “In mid-2020, around July or August, I even had to sell my Yamaha keyboard to buy electronic service tools, a second-hand TV for my PS3 rental service and to set up my stall,” said the 46-year-old.  As a keyboardist, Suprapto used to perform every day during festive seasons and earn about 200,000 to 300,000 rupiah for every show. Nowadays, he fixes faulty electronic equipment, a skill he taught himself from watching Youtube clips. He gets such requests twice or thrice a week. “Maybe because of the pandemic, there are fewer requests for repair. At the moment what is important is to survive,” said the father of a preschooler.  He admits that there is both joy and sorrow in being a small-time technician. For instance, he does get upset whenever a client in a village cannot afford to pay him for his service. But then he also gets to feel their joy when he sees his client’s happiness after their faulty equipment has been fixed again. “From one client I can get a maximum of 100,000 rupiah. Well, I live in a village,” said the East Java native who lives in Joho village.  “And then there are some who cannot afford to pay for my service because they don’t have money. That’s okay because I know how it feels (not to have money).”  For former dangdut guitarist Listyo Pramono, being unemployed has been a major blow since he lost his job. The 40-year-old who spent 15 years as a dangdut musician had to work as a labourer in a sugar factory when the pandemic struck. Even then he would find himself unemployed every now and then since work at the factory is on a seasonal basis only.   Music analyst Bens Leo acknowledged that many dangdut artistes and musicians have changed jobs because of the pandemic. But he noted that this was also the case with artistes of other genres as well.  Nonetheless, he believed that dangdut performers as a whole face bigger challenges since there are more of them in Indonesia compared to the rest in the entertainment industry.  With limited opportunities because of the pandemic restrictions, competition for jobs or offers to participate in events was much stiffer among them.   As the COVID-19 situation began to show signs of improvement in Indonesia, many regions have started to open up and small events under strict health protocols were permitted.  Observers like Leo were confident that the dangdut scene would make a strong comeback as many of those involved in the industry felt “dangdut is their DNA” He believed that dangdut artistes would likely return to the scene as soon as more opportunities for them to perform were available. Salsabila, the dangdut singer-turned-cook, readily admitted that if there were opportunities, she would go back to singing again. However, she insisted that her culinary business would come first as her main job, with singing and performing dangdut as a sideline. “In the entertainment industry, there are newcomers every year, so I’ll focus on my culinary business. But I would be happy if I could do both,” said Salsabila. Keyboardist Suprapto and guitarist Pramono were also hopeful that the pandemic would be over soon, so they could return to their dangdut music again.   For some like Listiana who have moved on to other things, going back to the dangdut life is not an option anymore. “I have forgotten the glamorous life because I feel that to be happy, I don’t need to live a sumptuous life.”  Read this story in Bahasa Indonesia here."

Douyin is tech company Bytedance’s Chinese version of TikTok, which caters only to China-based users. The 43-year-old Mandopop star, who launched her first post on Douyin just days before the livestream, had planned to go on a world tour last year, but postponed her plans due to the pandemic. “We finally got our first show together with this band and Stefanie Sun.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/lalisa-blackpink-lisa-first-solo-album-2172086,Blackpink’s Lisa makes solo debut with record 97m views and counting,"Lisa of K-pop girl group Blackpink released her debut solo, Lalisa, on Friday (Sep 10). The star, whose real name is Lalisa Manoban, paid tribute to her home country in the music video. From the choreography to her outfit, the 24-year-old brought attention to her Thai roots, giving credit to the country she grew up in.  The three-and-a-half minute music video not only had Lisa wearing a beautiful custom-made traditional costume, the talented choreographer also added elements of traditional Thai dance.  The costume was designed by Thai brand Asava, and made using Thai brocade silk.  A post shared by asava (@asavagroup) The brand, which specialises in creating modern versions of traditional Thai dresses, said the costume also featured “delicately woven” patterns from the province of Lamphun in upper Northern Thailand.  The brand revealed on Instagram that the delicate piece is hand-embroidered, using Swarovski crystals. “I was talking to producer Teddy Park and wanted to put a Thai vibe in my song, and he came up with an arrangement that had the perfect Thai mood. I loved it,” said Lisa to UK newspaper Metro and other media on Friday.  She is the third member of Blackpink to go solo, following Jennie, who released Solo in Nov 2018, and Rose, who released On The Ground and Gone this year.  Lisa’s Thai fans have labelled her a national icon – for good reason.  A post shared by LISA (@lalalalisa_m) The star was born in the Thai province of Buriram and grew up in the country before scoring a life-changing audition by South Korean record label YG Entertainment in 2010. She was 13 years old then, and has never looked back.  “She's iconic, a queen and a legend,” said a comment on the official music video of Lalisa on YouTube. A post shared by JISOO🤍 (@sooyaaa__) The other members of Blackpink also celebrated Lisa’s debut, with a beautiful floral bouquet from Rose and a dedicated post from Jisoo, saying “I love you” and “I am proud of you”.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/venice-film-festival-2021-levenement-golden-lion-award-2171731,French film on illegal abortion wins top prize at Venice festival,"Happening (L'evenement), a hard-hitting French drama about illegal abortion in the 1960s, won the Golden Lion award for best film at the Venice festival on Saturday. The film, by director Audrey Diwan, wowed viewers on the Lido waterfront with its portrayal of a young woman desperate to arrange a termination, at a time when it could mean a prison term or death, to continue with her studies. The movie is set in France in 1963 but its central theme is as relevant today as it was then, a visibly moved Diwan told the audience, just as the debate about abortion rages again in the United States following new restrictions in Texas. ""I did this film with anger, with desire, with my belly, my guts, my heart and my head,"" she said. The awards ceremony wrapped up the 11-day movie marathon, with critics calling the line-up one of the best in years as many films had been held back because of the coronavirus pandemic. ""It is amazing that you managed to make this happen,"" said New Zealand's Jane Campion, who won the Silver Lion prize for best director with 1920 frontier saga The Power of The Dog. ""It is special for us film-makers to be here live with audiences and experience what we dream about."" Stars from far and wide turned out in force on the Venice red carpet – a vital ingredient for the success of a festival, and even more so after last year's subdued edition. Ben Affleck – holding hands with Jennifer Lopez – Matt Damon, Timothee Chalamet and Kristen Stewart were among the Hollywood A-listers who made the trip for the world's oldest film festival. Also creating a big buzz were two films which screened outside of the main contest, and were not eligible for awards – Denis Villeneuve's remake of science fiction classic Dune and Ridley Scott's medieval epic The Last Duel. FEMINIST FESTIVAL? Diwan's film was a fitting winner for a festival with many strong women's stories, in a year where the #MeToo movement has appeared to make a mark on the cinema industry. Adapted from Annie Ernaux's autobiographical novel, the picture's tight framing immerses the audience in the private trauma lived by Anne, its protagonist. ""On set, I was always thinking: Let's not look at Anne, let's be Anne,"" Diwan said. She is the sixth female director to win the Venice showcase, here in its 78th edition. Happening is also the second French movie to triumph at a major festival since Julia Ducournau's Titane scooped the Palme D'Or in Cannes in July. Among other awards, the runner-up Grand Jury prize went to Italian director Paolo Sorrentino for The Hand of God, his deeply personal film about losing his parents as a teenager. Spain's Penelope Cruz won the best actress prize for playing a single mother in Pedro Almodovar's Parallel Mothers. The best actor prize went to John Arcilla from the Philippines for On The Job: The Missing 8."

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/people/chinese-actor-zhang-zhehan-controversy-2115061,Zhang Zhehan accused of ‘unpatriotic behaviour’ in latest China celeb scandal,"Social media has proven to be a double-edged sword for Chinese ambassadors of luxury and lifestyle brands. While a large following means a legion of fans to promote to, social media postings also open the floodgates to scandal and criticism.  A month after Kris Wu’s explosive scandal, Chinese actor Zhang Zhehan is embroiled in a political controversy after Instagram posts of the actor visiting the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo were exposed on Weibo.  The Yasukuni Shrine was built to honour some of Japan’s war dead. Photos of Zhang attending a wedding at Nogi Shrine, another infamous shrine that honours imperial Japanese military officers who invaded China during World War II, also emerged.  Chinese media criticised Zhang of unpatriotic behaviour, while netizens called out the actor for being insensitive towards the suffering China experienced.  More than 25 brands including Lanvin, Longines, Pandora, Coke, Clinique and more swiftly terminated their partnerships with Zhang. Lanvin has also deleted all social media posts featuring Zhang, including its most recent Qixi (Chinese Valentine's Day) campaign.  The China Association of Performing Arts, a semi-official organisation, also proposed to boycott the 30-year-old actor on Aug 15.  “The Yasukuni Shrine is a spiritual tool and symbol of Japanese militarism for waging foreign wars of aggression, and a place for Japan’s right-wing forces to deny history and glorify wars of aggression,” the association said in a statement.  Zhang had issued an apology on Aug 13, saying: “Today, I deeply apologise for my past ignorance, my shame and especially my previous improper behaviour. I attended a friend’s wedding in Japan. It is my mistake for the oversight of [not knowing] the historical background behind the wedding venue and the political background of the other wedding guests. When I used to travel everywhere, I liked to casually take pictures. Due to the lack of understanding for the local architecture and the history and being careless about the content when taking pictures, when I took the pictures, it resulted in content that seriously harmed the feelings of compatriots. I also solemnly apologise here, I am sorry.”  However, his apology has failed to appease critics. Chinese newspaper People’s Daily commented, “As a public figure, you really shouldn’t have such a lack of historical knowledge and be totally unaware of the nation’s suffering”.  China Central Television said in another commentary that Zhang had “touched the scars of history”.“As Chinese, we should remember history and build on it,” it said.  Meanwhile, Chinese social media platforms Weibo and Douyin have since deleted Zhang’s accounts. “As public figures with a lot of fans, being knowledgeable of history should be a basic professional ethical standard that they must stick to,” Sina Weibo said in a statement.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/suicide-squad-james-gunn-justice-league-2085391,What does James Gunn think of a Suicide Squad vs Justice League movie?,"Is The Suicide Squad James Gunn’s best movie to date? With critics raving and positive reviews pouring in, his version of the highly violent, R-rated comic book adaptation is shaping up to becoming the best reviewed DC Extended Universe (DCEU) movie of all time. For the uninitiated, The Suicide Squad isn't a sequel to the critically-panned 2016 David Ayer film of a similar name (it’s just missing a “The”). Instead, it’s a whole new take on the motley crew of supervillains, featuring one heck of an ensemble cast: Margot Robbie, Idris Elba, John Cena, Joel Kinnaman, Peter Capaldi, Taika Waititi, Nathan Fillion, Sylvester Stallone and Viola Davis. And at the helm is Gunn, who cut his teeth making low budget indie horror movies at Troma Entertainment and made his name bringing Marvel’s Guardians Of The Galaxy to life. So what was the switch from Marvel to DC like for the controversial provocateur, best known for bringing both unabashed carnage and poignant heart to his movies? Gunn told CNA Lifestyle he just “never, ever held back”. “There aren't many times that a director is being given the keys to the car by a studio and they say, we trust you – do your thing and do it all out,” said Gunn. “So when I'm writing it, I just never held back. I'm like, we can take any chance we want! “I felt a great responsibility to myself, to Warner Bros, to the fans, to cinema in general – to really try to take some risks and do something that was as crazy as it possibly could (be),” he said. For Gunn, it was important that “we’re creating a type of franchise spectacle film that's outside the bounds, outside the lines of where people are normally colouring.” And it’s not just lip service. Gunn confirmed he had free rein when it came to taking The Suicide Squad to task. “I wrote a screenplay, took it to Warner Brothers and got paid for the screenplay. They said, ‘We want to make the movie. We love it. Will you direct it? And I asked if I could make it Rated R, and they said yes! And so that was the whole thing,” he explained. “And then the movie came out, they saw it and they all were really happy with it from the beginning. Now, they gave notes, but it was always like, you can take the notes if you want or you don't have to take the notes if you didn’t want to,"" he said. ""And the notes were never about the gore or that sort of stuff. It was always ‘story’ things, making sure things were understood. That's all it ever was. And they were just wonderful partners throughout the whole process.” With a no-holds barred green light from the studio, how did Gunn decide on which characters to bring to life? “It was tough because I had so many great DC characters to choose from. I had a lot of characters that I wanted to use and couldn't,” he shared. “But, like, Polka-Dot Man? The way I chose him was I literally looked up on the internet: World's Dumbest Supervillain. And that's who came up,"" said Gunn. ""But he actually has this really dark tragic story underneath that goofy exterior. And so bringing purpose and meaning to a character like that (means a lot). I knew that if I did a Superman movie, somebody else was going to do a Superman movie if I didn’t. But nobody's going to do Polka-Dot Man's movie unless I did it.” So now that Gunn’s officially the first and only Hollywood director to helm films from both DC and Marvel, would he consider upping the ante? Fans have been hoping for a Suicide Squad vs Justice League movie. Should that movie be made and can James Gunn write and direct it? “You've convinced me, okay,” he replied with a big laugh and without missing a beat. “I'd have to think about how to do it though. I haven't put in any thought to do a Suicide Squad vs Justice League movie, but it's not a bad idea, you know? “But I think I got to figure out who the Justice League is first because I have no clue. I'm here in the middle of DC and I don't know. Everybody's always asking me is Henry Cavill still Superman? I don’t know who Superman is! Who knows?” The Suicide Squad is out in cinemas now."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/jj-lin-kris-wu-sex-scandal-legal-action-2087051,JJ Lin threatening legal action against those saying he’s involved in Kris Wu scandal,"Singer JJ Lin will not stand for stories about him being involved in the Kris Wu sex scandal and will take legal action against those spreading them if necessary.  On Sunday (Aug 1), the law firm representing the 40-year-old Singaporean Mandopop star released a statement on Weibo that revealed the 27 accounts active in spreading the rumours.  The statement by Shanghai Jiuze Law Firm read: “The aforementioned Internet accounts have maliciously published/spread false statements against Mr JJ Lin through ways such as slander and insults. Some of them have continued to launch personal attacks against Mr Lin in a deliberate attempt to lower his social status."" The firm urged the users to stop spreading “false information” about Lin immediately, and added that it will collect relevant evidence and “take immediate legal action against netizens who are suspected of infringing on JJ Lin’s legal rights and reputation”. Taiwanese pop star Wilber Pan was also similarly accused and his studio issued a statement on Aug 2 denying the allegations. Among the stories being spread is that Lin and Pan were with Wu when he preyed on minors. Those spreading this rumour also allege that Wu had given up the names of male celebrities, including Lin and Pan, to get a lighter sentence for himself. Investigations are ongoing for Wu’s case. The 30-year-old Chinese-Canadian singer, who was a former member of K-pop group EXO, was arrested on Jul 31 on suspicion of rape. A teenage influencer accused Wu of raping with her while she was drunk. He has denied the accusation. "

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/matt-damon-stopped-using-f-slur-word-told-off-by-daughter-2084441,Matt Damon says he stopped using slur word after being told off by his daughter,"Matt Damon recently decided to stop using a homophobic slur word after his daughter criticised him for it. “The word that my daughter calls the ‘f-slur for a homosexual’ was commonly used when I was a kid, with a different application,"" he told UK's The Sunday Times in an interview that ran on Sunday (Aug 1). ""I made a joke, months ago, and got a treatise from my daughter.” The 50-year-old Hollywood star recounted that, during a recent family dinner, he made a joke and used the term. In response, one of his four daughters called him out on his usage of the word. As she left the dinner table, Damon defended himself saying, “Come on, that’s a joke! I say it in the movie Stuck On You!” “She went to her room and wrote a very long, beautiful treatise on how that word is dangerous,” Damon further explained. “I said, ‘I retire the f-slur!’ I understood.” He added: ""It's a fair point. Anybody should be offended by that behaviour."" However, this revelation has raised a few eyebrows from celebrities and fans alike – specifically, why he was still using the word just ""months ago"" in the first place. The backlash online proves ironic, considering Damon’s decision to be more conscious of what he reveals due to the sensationalist nature of today’s media.     “Twenty years ago, the best way I can put it is that the journalist listened to the music more than the lyrics (of an interview). Now your lyrics are getting parsed, to pull them out of context and get the best headline possible,” he told the Sunday Times in the same interview. “Everyone needs clicks. Before it didn’t really matter what I said, because it didn’t make the news. But maybe this shift is a good thing. So I shut the f*** up more.” Damon’s latest film, Stillwater, premiered in US theatres Jul 30. The actor recently confirmed that he will also be returning for a cameo as “actor Loki” in Thor: Love And Thunder, set for release in 2022."

And you’re in luck because local theatre company Pangdemonium will soon be streaming its production of the satirical musical comedy, Urinetown, for free. Pangdemonium announced on social media on Friday (Jul 30) that they will be showing the hit musical production on Vimeo from Aug 6 to Aug 15. Urinetown: The Musical takes place in a fictional “most expensive city in the world” where a “cross-border water crisis” has led to a government ban on private lavatories. This has resulted in a price surge for pay-to-use public toilets operated by the powerful Urine Good Company. Those caught breaking the law against gratuitous peeing will be sent to the mysterious “Urinetown”, never to be seen again. After being threatened with yet another fee hike, the poor citizens decide to stage a revolution. Pangdemonium’s staging of the show in 2019 was sold out, according to its Jul 30 Facebook post. The post added that while audiences can watch the show for free, “we would also be very grateful if you want to show us some love back and help us keep fighting the good fight, by making a donation to Pangdemonium”. You can do so here. The musical’s original Broadway production won three Tony Awards in 2002. "

Based on the 2001 Sara Gay Forden book, the film follows the real-life saga of the family that turned Gucci into one of the world’s foremost fashion powerhouses. It also tells the story of how Patrizia Reggiani (Gaga) was convicted of orchestrating the murder of her ex-husband Maurizio Gucci (Driver), the grandson of founder Guccio Gucci. The trailer dropped on Thursday (Jul 29) and apart from the big coats and big hair, you’ll also get to see an unrecognisable Jared Leto in action as Paolo Gucci. Fans took to social media to express their disbelief at Leto’s transformation, which was first made evident with the release of the character posters shortly before the trailer. Oscar winner Leto was left unrecognisable with what appears to be prosthetics and heavy makeup.   A post shared by House Of Gucci (@theguccimovie)   The drama also features a host of critically acclaimed actors including Al Pacino as Aldo Gucci and Jeremy Irons as Rodolfo Gucci. It marks Lady Gaga’s follow-up acting role after her acclaimed turn in A Star Is Born.     Despite the excitement surrounding the film’s release, actual members of the Gucci family have been less than thrilled. “We are truly disappointed. I speak on behalf of the family,” Patrizia Gucci told the Associated Press earlier in April. “They are stealing the identity of a family to make a profit, to increase the income of the Hollywood system… Our family has an identity, privacy. We can talk about everything. but there is a borderline that cannot be crossed.” The film is slated for release in November. It is one of two new Scott films arriving this year, with The Last Duel – written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck – set to premiere at the Venice Film Festival in September."

Burstyn starred as Chris MacNeil, the mother of Regan, the little girl who was possessed in the original film. Unfortunately, though, it doesn’t seem like we’ll be seeing Burstyn’s screen daughter reprising her role in the new films.

""To all my fans asking about my involvement in the new Exorcist reboot, as of now there has not been any discussion about me participating or reprising my role,"" she wrote, with the text overlaid on a photo of her as Regan. “I wish all those involved the best and I appreciate the loyalty and passion the fans have for The Exorcist and my character,” she added. In an interview with The New York Post that also ran on Tuesday, Blair said that representatives for screenwriter and director David Gordon Green, production company Blumhouse and Morgan Creek Productions had contacted her to discuss their plans for the series. However, they did not mention a possible comeback for Blair on the show. ""They were polite enough to call,"" Blair told the Post. ""We spoke about how amazing Ellen Burstyn is and that was as far as the conversation went."" The star added that she is uncertain if the support from fans would change the filmmaker’s minds. ""If they want to come back around about what should be done and what the fans want, that's a different dialogue,"" Blair said. ""I don't think they're going to."" Blair won a Golden Globe award and earned an Academy Award nomination for her role as Regan. She went on the reprise her role in the 1977 sequel, Exorcist II: The Heretic.

Mediacorp released the trailer for the show on Monday (Jul 26) with the Facebook caption: “Go back in time to post-World War II Singapore with us and witness the epic fight for the nation’s identity”.

Crew members called an ambulance that took the 58-year-old actor to a local hospital. Shortly before the statement was released, Odenkirk's son Nate, the elder of his two children, tweeted, “He's going to be OK”. The sixth season of the spin-off prequel to Breaking Bad is set to air on AMC next year. Both shows were shot in and mostly set in Albuquerque. An email sent to a representative of AMC seeking more information or comment was not immediately returned. Odenkirk has been nominated for four Emmys for playing the title character, a down-on-his-luck lawyer named Jimmy McGill who becomes increasingly corrupt and adopts the pseudonym Saul Goodman, the “criminal lawyer” who appeared in dozens of episodes of Breaking Bad.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/zz-top-bassist-dusty-hill-dies-in-his-sleep-at-72-2073661,ZZ Top's bearded bassist Dusty Hill dies in his sleep at 72,"ZZ Top’s Dusty Hill, the long-bearded bassist for the million-selling Texas blues rock trio known for such hits as Legs and Gimme All Your Lovin', has died at age 72. In a Facebook post on Wednesday (Jul 28), guitarist Billy Gibbons and drummer Frank Beard said Hill died in his sleep. They didn’t give a cause of death, but a Jul 21 post on the band's website said Hill was “on a short detour back to Texas, to address a hip issue”. At that time, the band said that its longtime guitar tech, Elwood Francis, would fill in on bass, slide guitar and harmonica. Born Joe Michael Hill in Dallas, he, Gibbons and Beard formed ZZ Top in Houston in 1969, naming themselves in part after blues singer ZZ Hill and influenced by the British power trio Cream. Their debut release, ZZ Top’s First Album, came out in 1970. Three years later, they broke through commercially with La Grange, a funky blues song in the style of Slim Harpo’s Shake Your Hips that paid tribute to the Chicken Ranch, a notorious brothel outside of the Texas town of La Grange. The band went on to have such hits as Tush in 1975, and the 1980s songs Sharp Dressed Man, Legs, Gimme All Your Lovin’ and Sleeping Bag. The band’s 1976 Worldwide Texas Tour, with its iconic Texas-shaped stage festooned with cactuses, snakes and longhorn cattle, was one of the decade’s most successful rock tours. Their million-selling albums included Eliminator, Afterburner and Antenna. ZZ Top was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, introduced by Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards. “These cats are steeped in the blues, so am I,"" Richards said. “These cats know their blues and they know how to dress it up. When I first saw them, I thought, ‘I hope these guys are not on the run, because that disguise is not going to work.’” That look, with all three members wearing dark sunglasses and Gibbons and Hill sporting long, wispy beards, became so familiar, in part thanks to their MTV videos in the 1980s, that it was the subject of a New Yorker cartoon and a joke on The Simpsons.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/joey-jordison-founding-drummer-slipknot-dies-at-46-2076161,"Joey Jordison, founding drummer of metal band Slipknot, dies at 46","Joey Jordison, a founding member of Slipknot, who drummed for the influential metal band in its most popular period and helped write many of its best-known songs, died on Monday (Jul 26) at age 46, his family said. “We are heartbroken to share the news that Joey Jordison, prolific drummer, musician and artist passed away peacefully in his sleep,” his family said in a statement. “Joey’s death has left us with empty hearts and feelings of indescribable sorrow."" No cause or place of death was provided. Jordison grew up in Des Moines, Iowa, the eldest of three children, and began playing drums at age eight. He was already a veteran of the city's metal scene when he founded the band that would become Slipknot in 1995, along with percussionist Shawn Crahan and bassist Paul Gray. The three talked plans and concepts for the band in sessions at the gas station where Jordison worked. They would name the group after one of their early songs. The group would become known for its rousing, epic live shows, with nine members wearing masks and sinister costumes and creating a massive, sweeping sound that, like other metal bands of the era, included elements of hip-hop. Jordison often wore a white mask with black paint drippings and a crown of thorns when he performed. Buzz grew through touring, including show-stealing appearances on the Ozzfest tour, and the band broke through to international popularity with its 1999 self-titled album. That was followed by the even more popular 2001 album Iowa. Slipknot would become one of the bands credited with keeping hard rock alive and vital in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with grunge-era bands aging and fading. Jordison was dismissed from the band in 2013. He later said it was because he had transverse myelitis, a neurological condition that left him unable to play. His family said there will be a private funeral. (Source: AP)"

On Tuesday (Jul 27), the 25-year-old Don't Start Now singer wrote, “I’m surprised and horrified at DaBaby’s comments. I really don’t recognise this as the person I worked with”.

He made further disparaging remarks about LGBTQ people and those living with HIV and AIDS. This was caught on video, which was posted on TMZ. Following his onstage diatribe, the 29-year-old rapper took to Instagram to explain, but ended up making more offensive statements – including saying that his gay fans don’t have AIDS because they aren’t “nasty”. Since then, fans have called on Lipa to replace the rapper’s verse in her song’s remix. While her Instagram statement gave no indication that she would do so, she did signal her support for the LGBTQ community. She added: “I know my fans know where my heart lies and that I stand 100% with the LGTBQ community. We need to come together to fight the stigma and ignorance around HIV/AIDS.”"

A representative for the performer said on Monday (Jul 26)  that West planned to remain inside Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium while working to complete Donda, his 10th studio album. The person spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly on the matter. West held a massive listening session at the stadium on Thursday and was seen on social media attending a soccer match over the weekend. Donda, which was slated to release last Friday, is now due Aug 6. The Grammy winner’s album was named after his mother, Donda West, who died at the age of 58 following plastic surgery complications in 2007. West unveiled Donda in front of a sold-out crowd at the venue after he announced two days before that the first public listen of his highly-anticipated album would take place. He barely said a word while introducing his new music during the event, which brought out several big names including Rick Ross, Khloe Kardashian and his estranged wife Kim Kardashian West, who showed up in a red jumpsuit with their kids.     West’s new project is a follow up to his 2019 gospel-themed album Jesus Is King, which won a Grammy for best contemporary Christian album. Last year, West announced on Twitter – with colourful cover art and a track list – that he would release his latest album. At the time, his tweets indicated that his project would release on the same day as his rival Taylor Swift’s project Folklore, but his album was postponed. (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/ronan-keating-accepts-damages-in-tabloid-phone-hacking-2062966,Singer Ronan Keating accepts damages in tabloid phone hacking case,"Irish singer Ronan Keating on Monday (Jul 26) accepted “substantial damages” from a British tabloid newspaper publisher over phone hacking. The former member of boy band Boyzone is the latest in a long list of celebrities whose mobile phone voicemail messages were intercepted by News of the World reporters more than a decade ago. Keating’s lawyer, Ellen Gallagher, told a High Court hearing that the singer had identified a number of “suspicious” articles published between 1996 and 2011 which he said contained his private information. Keating's suspicions about who might be leaking personal information to the newspaper “generated distrust which impacted on his relationships and caused him considerable distress and upset,” Gallagher said. Ben Silverstone, lawyer for News of the World publisher News Group Newspapers, said the company offered “its sincere apologies to the claimant for the distress caused to him by the invasion of his privacy by individuals working for or on behalf of the News of the World”. “The defendant acknowledges that such activity should never have taken place and that it had no right to intrude into the private life of the claimant in this way,” he said. The amount of the damages was not disclosed. Owner Rupert Murdoch shut down the 168-year-old News of the World in 2011 after the revelation that its employees had eavesdropped on celebrities, politicians and crime victims. Since then, police investigations, criminal trials and a public inquiry have revealed that phone hacking was widespread at Britain’s tabloids. News Group Newspapers and rival publisher Trinity Mirror have both paid millions of pounds to settle lawsuits from hacking victims. (Source: AP)"

The 21-year-old, who’s the son of local veteran actors Zheng Geping and Hong Huifang, released the English song that’s been described as a mix of R&B and city-pop on Jul 23. The tune, about being with someone you love and reassuring them that you’re a right fit, is co-written by Calvert and Juan Ezwan, and produced by AOR Global. Calvert admitted in the media release that he was “quite nervous about releasing this song, especially with how people will respond to it”.   A post shared by Calvert Tay 郑凯介 (@calverttay)   “Music has been a big part of my life and I never had the opportunity and courage to put out anything on my own,” he added. Calvert also told 8Days.sg in an interview that he and his sister – actress Tay Ying – took piano classes together from a young age, and that he regained his passion for music during last year’s “circuit breaker” as he had a lot of time on his own. He was later approached by Academy of Rock to work on a song together. He revealed that his parents and sister were among the first to hear his debut single – and that his mum was nervous for him. “It's very funny, actually. It's my first time releasing a song, but my mum is more nervous than I am,” he told the entertainment portal. “She's worrying about how the response would be, and has been asking if everything is going to be okay.” The veteran actress also mentioned in a separate interview with 8Days.sg that she and her husband are not musically inclined but are interested in music, so she’s pleasantly surprised that her son can help her fulfil that particular dream. “No matter what song my son sings, to a mum, it's gonna sound great,"" she said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/reunion-dinner-movie-mark-lee-xiang-yun-lawrence-wong-2036826,Mark Lee will ask Xiang Yun's hubby about sharing intimate scenes with her in Reunion Dinner,"Mark Lee said he will be asking actor Edmund Chen for permission to get intimate with his real-life wife, actress Xiang Yun. The comedian was joking, of course, but it did pique curiosity how the unusual pairing would come about. As it turns out, Xiang Yun, one of Mediacorp’s most respected actresses, will be taking on the role of Yan Ling, a mamasan dating Wei (played by Mark) in the new Chinese New Year movie, Reunion Dinner. “I'll have to ask Edmund Chen if we can have intimate scenes. If he's okay, I'm okay, too”, Mark deadpanned during the virtual press conference on Thursday (July 22).   A post shared by 向云Xiang Yun's Official Account (@xiang_yun_)   Not that there will be much hugging and kissing in these pandemic days anyway. Mark, whose production company King Kong Media is involved, said that social distancing rules will be adhered to and the cast will be tested every three to five days. Reunion Dinner, directed by Ong Kuo Sin, will feature international actors, such as Hong Kong veteran actress Mimi Choo, Chinese actress Cya Liu and Lawrence Wong of Yanxi Palace fame. Included in the cast are also local actors Guo Liang, Zhu Houren and the multilingual Dasa Dharamahsena. The CNY movie will focus on heart-warming familial love rather than romance, as the cast pointed out. It will centre around the soon-to-be-married Chaoyang (played by Lawrence) and Zi Hong (played by Cya), whose parents are meeting for the first time. Embarrassed about his mother Yan Ling, Chaoyang arranged for Wei and a pair of two-bit actors (played by Mimi and Dasa) to act as his family over the CNY reunion dinner to comedic effect. Adding to the complication is Zhu Houren’s baddie, whom the “boy crazy” Yan Ling was romantically involved with in her younger days. Houren’s IRL son Joel Choo will be appearing as the younger version of him. Guoliang, who plays Cya’s father, will appear as a retired military man. Lawrence admitted that he found his role challenging as comedy wasn’t his strong suit. Mark, being the comedy king that he is, quipped that “if their comedic performance doesn't reach our expectations, we will deduct their salary!” The funnyman continued: “We will direct, utilise the dialogue, and edit the scenes to create the comedic effects. I feel their scenes are more emotional and relaxing. It won't be fair for them to do comedy. “We'll let them take care of the emotional, heart-warming, kissy and huggy scenes and we'll do the comedy."" Reunion Dinner is opening in cinemas during the Chinese New Year period in 2022. Audiences in China audiences will be able to stream through iQiyi."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/snake-eyes-character-henry-golding-drew-from-past-as-travel-host-2039326,Snake Eyes star Henry Golding says he drew from past job as travel host to create character,"When Henry Golding first contemplated taking up the role of Snake Eyes when he was at Singapore’s Robertson Quay, the Crazy Rich Asians actor wondered how he could deliver the character fans would want to see. “It’s crazy, it wasn’t that long ago. It was probably three years ago when Crazy Rich Asians came out, but this one was really special. It was a real dedication not only mentally, but physically,” Golding told Geek Culture in an interview on Thursday (Jul 22). “We had to be able to do all these stunts ourselves, we had to sort of put ourselves in a position where we could complete all of this choreography and make Snake Eyes the most badass he could possibly be. It’s been a hell of a ride,” said the Malaysia-born actor. Hailing from the 40-year-old GI Joe franchise, ninja commando Snake Eyes stands as one of its most popular characters.  To build the complexity of the character, the 34-year-old tapped into his past career as a travel host for shows on BBC World News, Discovery Channel Asia and CNA. “My time spent with Channel NewsAsia in places like Tacloban or the Smoky Mountains in the Philippines (helped me understand) that these orphans have to fend for themselves, they have to be able to feed themselves and they have to do things which aren’t savoury.” “And that’s something that we find with Snake Eyes,” continued Golding. “From a very young age, he’s been on his own, he had to go through the school of hard knocks.” For Golding, defining Snake Eyes was a matter of channelling the experiences of people he has met into the character. “I think it’s such a gift that I came into acting a lot later on in my career since I’ve experienced so much of that and hopefully being able to sort of pick at certain characteristics that I’ve come across for certain roles,” he told Geek Culture. With another GI Joe film in the works, Golding is now hoping to be reunited with Morning Light – his character’s katana. “I wrote my name on one of the things! There was one hero sword and it was beautifully crafted, it must have taken some hours and hours, days upon days to create the sword,” the actor said. “I’m looking forward to the day that Paramount gives me my own Morning Light that I can hang up in pride of place in my home.” Snake Eyes: GI Joe Origins – starring Henry Golding, Ursula Corbero and Samara Weaving – is currently showing in cinemas."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/man-confesses-defrauding-kris-wu-sex-scandal-police-2040481,Man confesses to defrauding singer Kris Wu in bizarre twist to sex scandal,"A man has confessed to defrauding Chinese-Canadian pop singer Kris Wu, over a teenager’s accusation he had sex with her when she was drunk, Beijing police said on  Thursday (Jul 22). The announcement added a bizarre twist to a scandal that cost Wu endorsement contracts with brands including Porsche and Bulgari. The former member of Korean boy band EXO has denied the accusation, which prompted an outpouring of support for the woman online and criticism of Wu. A man who saw rumours about the incident online contacted the woman in June and obtained information that allowed him to pretend to be her lawyer, police said in a statement. It gave no indication the woman was accused of taking part in the fraud. The man talked Wu’s mother into sending the woman 500,000 yuan (US$77,000) and then, pretending to be Wu's lawyer, tried to persuade the woman to send the money to him, the statement said. It said he tried unsuccessfully to obtain an additional 2.5 million yuan (US$390,000) from the family. The man, identified only by the surname Liu, was arrested on Sunday in Nantong, near Shanghai, after the singer's mother complained to police that the family had been defrauded, according to the Beijing Public Security Bureau statement. It said he confessed. The woman had been quoted by the internet portal NetEase as saying Wu encouraged her to drink too much at a party in December and she woke up in his bed. In a statement on his social media account, Wu said he met the woman but denied encouraging her to drink and said other parts of her account didn’t happen. The woman was quoted as saying other women told her Wu seduced them with promises of jobs and other opportunities. Police are investigating allegations Wu “repeatedly deceived young women into sexual relations,” the police statement said.     Brands cut ties with Wu the day after the NetEase report, reflecting their sensitivity to public opinion after the ruling Communist Party stirred up anger at shoe and clothing brands in retaliation for Western reports of human rights abuses in the mostly Muslim region of Xinjiang in the northwest. Wu, known in Chinese as Wu Yifan, grew up in Guangzhou in southern China and in Vancouver, British Columbia. He performed with EXO from 2012 to 2014 and then launched a solo career. As an actor, he appeared in 2017′s XXX: Return Of Xander Cage and two Chinese box office successes, Mr Six and Journey To The West: The Demons Strike Back. (Source: AP)"

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/dwayne-johnson-laughs-off-vin-diesel-tough-love-comments-2042121,Fast & Furious feud: Dwayne Johnson laughs off Vin Diesel’s ‘tough love’ comments,"The notorious feud between Fast & Furious co-stars, Vin Diesel and Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson, has resurfaced as Johnson weighed in on a previous “tough love” comment from Diesel. In a Men's Health interview in June, Diesel implied that his hard stance on set was a form of “tough love” used to improve the former professional wrestler’s performance. “Not Felliniesque,” he elaborated, “but I would do anything I’d have to do in order to get performances in anything I’m producing.” In response to Diesel’s comments, Johnson had a good laugh. “I laughed and I laughed hard,” the 49-year-old actor told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview that ran on Wednesday (Jul 21). “I think everyone had a laugh at that. And I’ll leave it at that.” While two more films are planned in the main franchise, Johnson suggested he will not be a part of them. “I’ve wished them well. I wish them well on Fast 9. And I wish them the best of luck on Fast 10 and Fast 11 and the rest of the Fast & Furious movies they do that will be without me,” he added. In the same interview, Johnson’s Jungle Cruise co-star Emily Blunt added jokingly: “Just thank God (Diesel) was there. Thank God. He carried you through that.” “Felliniesque,” Johnson quipped back. The long-running feud between the two Fast & Furious co-stars surfaced in 2016, when both actors made headlines for a reported on-set clash. Johnson wrote an Instagram post at the time saying, ""Some (male co-stars) conduct themselves as stand up men and true professionals, while others don't.” Fans speculated that he was referring to Diesel, whom he reportedly had skirmishes with during filming. While the nature of Johnson and Diesel’s relationship may not be “Felliniesque”, Fast & Furious fans hope that the two can settle their differences so that they can welcome Hobbs back into the fold. After all, in the words of Dominic Toretto (Diesel's character in the franchise), the most important thing in life will always be family. In the meantime, Johnson can next be seen as Frank Wolff in Disney’s Jungle Cruise, slated for release on Jul 29 in Singapore. He will also play the titular character in DC's Black Adam, set for release on Jul 29, 2022."

On Wednesday (Jul 21), Elvin posted a picture of him and Nanxing on Instagram saying, “When I was a kid, people said that I looked like #Nanxing dage,"" which means big brother. He added that he would always respond with ""no, we don’t!"", but deep down, he would feel happy and pleased at the comparison.  The 40-year-old actor then asked his followers: ""So do we look alike? I would be very happy if you say we do.” Some of the comments did agree with Elvin. Others were not so sure but gave the diplomatic answer that both actors are equally handsome in their own right.  One person commented that Elvin and Nanxing should play father and son while another said they could be brothers – are you listening, casting people? In 2018, the older actor posted a throwback photo of himself – maybe this was the Li Nanxing that Elvin was being compared to when he was younger?   A post shared by LiNanXing Official SG FANCLUB (@lnx_officialsgfc)   The two actors have starred together in several Mediacorp dramas such as The Ultimatum (2009) and CLIF 4 (2016) even though their storylines did not cross much in the latter.

Random House expects to release the book, currently untitled, late in 2022. “I’m writing this not as the prince I was born but as the man I have become,"" the Duke of Sussex, 36, said in a statement Monday (Jul 19).  ""I’ve worn many hats over the years, both literally and figuratively, and my hope is that in telling my story – the highs and lows, the mistakes, the lessons learned – I can help show that no matter where we come from, we have more in common than we think.  ""I’m deeply grateful for the opportunity to share what I’ve learned over the course of my life so far and excited for people to read a firsthand account of my life that’s accurate and wholly truthful.” Financial terms were not disclosed. Prince Harry will donate proceeds to charity, according to Random House. “Prince Harry will share, for the very first time, the definitive account of the experiences, adventures, losses, and life lessons that have helped shape him,” Random House announced. “Covering his lifetime in the public eye from childhood to the present day, including his dedication to service, the military duty that twice took him to the frontlines of Afghanistan, and the joy he has found in being a husband and father, Prince Harry will offer an honest and captivating personal portrait, one that shows readers that behind everything they think they know lies an inspiring, courageous, and uplifting human story.” Monday's announcement comes four months after Harry and his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, made worldwide news during their interview with Oprah Winfrey near the couple's home in Montecito, California.  Meghan spoke of feeling lonely and nearly suicidal before they left England last year, and Harry acknowledged tension with his father, Prince Charles, over his decision to step back from his royal duties and his marriage to the biracial American actor. “There is a lot to work through there,” Harry said about his relationship with his father, who was divorced from Diana, Princess of Wales, at the time of her fatal car accident in 1997.  “I feel really let down. He’s been through something similar. He knows what pain feels like. And Archie (Harry and Meghan's son) is his grandson. I will always love him, but there is a lot of hurt that has happened.” Harry told Winfrey that he felt trapped by royal life, and that his family cut off him financially and took away his security. He also acknowledged his relations were strained with his brother, Prince William. “I was trapped, but I didn’t know I was trapped,” Harry said, before adding, “My father and my brother, they are trapped.” Last month, Meghan published the picture book The Bench through Random House Books for Young Readers."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/tosh-zhang-opens-up-personal-struggle-depression-2049576,Actor Tosh Zhang opens up about personal struggle with depression,"Local actor-musician Tosh Zhang recently shared about his personal struggle with depression in a new season of Quan Yifeng’s talk show Hear U Out. In a two-part interview released on Friday (Jul 16), Zhang and his Ah Boys To Men co-star Wang Weiliang opened up in a brutally honest conversation on the lowest points in their lives, during which Zhang revealed that he has been grappling with depression for the past six years. ""My depression stems from childhood trauma,"" he shared. ""When I was younger, I saw and felt some things that children shouldn't have to experience. I had a negative family environment, my parents were always quarrelling and sometimes it got so bad that someone would be hospitalised.” “Every day, I’d go home feeling very scared. My younger sister would cry out of fear (whenever something happened), so I felt I had to be strong. If I wasn’t, I was afraid that my sister and mum would cry. My father couldn’t cope either. If I also broke down, my whole family would collapse,” the actor continued as he began to tear up. Years on, Zhang recalled that certain memories would trigger severe depressive episodes that sometimes led to suicidal thoughts. “Certain things will remind me of the past, and those memories will make me cry uncontrollably. I even thought of jumping off a building. I can’t suppress (the negative thoughts) and they still haunt me now.” However, since signs of his depression surfaced in 2016, Zhang has been taking steps to recover. “I’m in a better place now but it’s not easy to recover from depression,” admitted the 32-year-old. ""My psychiatrist told me I have to address my inner child, that is, the child in me. If I push him aside and fail to comfort him and assure him that everything is fine now, he’ll keep crying.” Despite his progress, Zhang’s healing process has been far from rosy. “I sought treatment for at least a year. I was in and out of the hospital. I've had meltdowns at home where I wanted to commit suicide. I couldn’t feel my face and my hands were numb. When I called my doctor, he said that I could be hyperventilating and was at risk of getting a stroke, so he told me to call an ambulance,” the actor recounted. “My mother realised what was happening as she accompanied me to the hospital. After realising, she cried by my bedside.” As his long-time friend and confidant, Wang weighed in: “I don’t know much about depression, but I’ve seen him in a vulnerable and pitiful state before. Initially I didn’t understand why a person could change so drastically within a second… He’s my brother for life, I’ll keep him company if he has meltdowns.” Zhang’s discussion on this issue is timely, as Singapore faces an increase in the number of suicides amid the isolation and psychological distress brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. “It’s tough. Nobody wants to be depressed. Nobody wants to take their own life,” he acknowledged. Best known for his role in Jack Neo’s Ah Boys To Men, Zhang recently starred in Gangster Nurse, a drama series that touches on the pandemic. Earlier this year, the local actor also opened a streetwear shop in Queensway Shopping Centre with a few childhood friends.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/billie-eilish-embarrassed-comments-she-made-while-younger-2049866,Billie Eilish feels 'embarrassed' over comments she made while younger,"In an interview with Vogue Australia on Friday (Jul 16), 19-year-old pop sensation Billie Eilish reflected on her vulnerable relationship with the Internet, and how she has grown up in the public spotlight. “I said so many things then that I totally don’t agree with now, or think the opposite thing,” said Eilish. “The weirdest thing is how nothing ever goes away once it’s on the Internet. Every interview I did when I was 15 is still out there, and I think about it constantly.” The Lost Cause songstress also went on to explain how she felt “weird” about the all-knowing nature of the Internet, and her regret when it comes to remarks made in the past. ""The internet brings up things from everybody's past and I'm like: 'Don't you guys understand that everybody is incredibly embarrassed and ashamed about their past? Like, do you not think about the fact that maybe you're embarrassed of your past, so maybe everybody else is embarrassed, too?' Over the Zoom interview with the magazine, Eilish also shared the remarks she wished she never made in her younger days. ""I did an interview where somebody said: 'What are you doing when you're not making music?' And I said: 'Even when I'm not making music, I'm making music.' And actually, Lil Wayne said that in an interview and I just saw it and said it, too. And it's not even true!"" ""When you're a teenager, you don't really know yourself, so you're trying to figure yourself out,"" she added. ""That was the hardest thing for me: I didn't actually know how I really felt. So I just came up with this facade that I stuck to."" This latest reveal comes on the heels of the recent controversy Eilish was embroiled in, where a five-year-old video of her using a racial slur resurfaced last month and went viral on TikTok. In the video, she could be seen mouthing along to the song Fish by Tyler, The Creator, which uses an anti-Asian slur. Following backlash, the pop star took to Instagram Stories at the time to apologise unreservedly for her mistake. She explained how she had only ever heard the slur through that song, with none of her close family members having ever used the word around her. However, she went on to explain that this did not excuse the harm she had caused. “Regardless of my ignorance and age at the time, nothing excuses the fact is that it was hurtful, and for that i am sorry…. we all need to continue having conversations, listening and learning. I hear you and i love you. thank you for taking the time to read this,” she wrote on IG Stories."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/gossip-girl-whitney-peak-jordan-alexander-eli-brown-2032901,XOXO: The new cast of Gossip Girl on stepping into the big shoes of the original,"Hello, Upper East Siders! Spotted: Gossip Girl back on the small screen with an 10-episode reboot of the original high society teen drama based on the books by Cecily von Ziegesar, which first ran from 2007 until 2012.  For the uninitiated, the original was a gloriously over-the-top show about New York City’s private school elite and their ludicrous shenanigans. It was a cult hit that was not only beloved, but also launched the careers of stars Blake Lively, Leighton Meester and Penn Badgley. This new HBO series – created by Joshua Safran, a writer and executive producer of its predecessor, and executive produced by its original creators, Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage – features a new storyline that plays as a sequel a decade after the events of the original Gossip Girl, this time with a new cast of ruthless Gen Z students. So how does the new cast feel about the pressure and expectation of taking on the mantle of a pop culture phenomenon? “It plays both ways,” said Eli Brown, who plays super-rich but guilt-ridden teen Obie. “For better or worse, I think that there is a certain kind of expectation to live up to the original. And I also think it kind of provides a sense of relief because you know you have that built-in audience,” he told CNA Lifestyle. “I've said it before and I'll say it again. I'd really encourage people to not even go to that point of trying to draw comparisons between the two shows because even though it does share a name with the original, it's entirely new and it's fresh. There's all sorts of new stuff going on.” 
  Whitney Peak, who plays Zoya, the new scholarship student with a keen sense of justice, was “terrified at the beginning”. “I was like, Oh my god, they are going to rip us apart, tear us to shreds, you know? Because usually that's what happens when a very beloved project is being rebooted, continued or picked up,” shared the 18-year-old. “So I was very nervous. But then, once I read the scripts over and over and over, and then started filming the show, I was very much like ‘wow’. In a weird way, my pain is like such a tribute to the original. It's kind of a compliment, you know? Because you wouldn't be here today if that hadn't happened, so it's a weird surrealism of whoa, this is crazy what we're doing right now.” Nervously stepping into the big shoes of those before them aside, the new cast are obviously fans of the original. And they have their favourite characters. “I was watching the show again and I’ll keep saying what I’ve been saying – which is I love Dorota (Kishlovsky, a recurring character)! She’s my favourite! She's fun!” shared Peak. For Jordan Alexander who plays shaved-head cool girl queen bee Julien Calloway, it’s hands down Serena van der Woodsen (played by Blake Lively).  “I would say Serena because I like how glamorous she was and the maiden-in-distress vibe she had. I feel like (she had both) a little damsel-in-distress vibe, but also a very strong character.  So I kind of like the dichotomy.” 
  Brown, on the other hand, likes both Dorota and Serena. ""It's weird because those were actually (the two) that I was trying to decide between,"" he said with a laugh. ""They are both kind of solid!"" Catch Gossip Girl on HBO Go on meWATCH."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/actor-comedian-ronny-chieng-martial-arts-comedy-sony-2034201,Actor and comedian Ronny Chieng working on martial arts comedy,"Daily Show correspondent Ronny Chieng is working with Sony on an action-comedy feature film. The 35-year-old Malaysia-born comedian will be collaborating with his Daily Show colleague Sebastian DiNatale as co-writers for the currently untitled movie, The Hollywood Reporter wrote on Friday (Jul 15). The pair previously worked together on Chieng’s Netflix original Asian Comedian Destroys America!, with DiNatale serving as director, and have two more streaming specials up their sleeves. The inspiration and concept behind what’s being described as a martial arts comedy was conceived during a roundtable discussion headed by Chieng and piloted by Sony and Ivan Reitman’s Montecito Picture Company. Extensive plot details have yet to be released, although we do know that the film is set in San Francisco. In 2016, Chieng  – who lived in Singapore for 10 years when he was younger – spearheaded and co-wrote his very own sitcom Ronny Chieng: International Student. The successful pilot was then picked up by Comedy Central and ABC TV for a full-length series. He’s also played roles in hits such as Crazy Rich Asians and Godzilla Vs Kong, and he’s set to appear in the highly anticipated Marvel flick Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings, which is due to be released later in the year. The superhero movie also stars Simu Liu, Tony Leung, Awkwafina and Michelle Yeoh."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/bts-coldplay-possible-collaboration-song-2034286,Did BTS and Coldplay collaborate on a song? The K-pop stars' reps have an answer,"BTS’ label Big Hit Music has responded to rumours of a possible collaboration between the K-pop stars and British band Coldplay. According to Soompi, speculation of the partnership began on Thursday (Jul 15), when the alleged lyrics to Coldplay’s new song, My Universe, were leaked on the site MatchLyric. The entertainment site added that the song featured BTS and included Korean lyrics. As rumours began circulating, leaked sound sources of what appeared to be the song spread online. It contained voices believed to belong to Coldplay’s Chris Martin and BTS’ Jungkook. In response, Warner Music Korea and Big Hit Music released a short statement saying, “It’s difficult to confirm the related content”. Both bands have not officially collaborated before, although they have communicated several times over social media – including an occasion earlier this year where BTS covered Coldplay’s song Fix You, and the British rock band praised the group’s performance. Martin also has not ruled out the possibility of a future collaboration with BTS. In an interview with PopCrush in June, the Coldplay frontman said, ""When it comes to BTS, I just have nothing but love and respect for them. All seven guys, I think they're just cool, stand for good things and sing about cool things. I love the fact that they are so huge and sing a lot in Korean, they don't always have to sing in English. I love them a lot and so if the right song came along, I wouldn't ever say no."" The two bands are slated to perform for the 2021 Global Citizen Live 24-hour special alongside Ed Sheeran and Billie Eilish. Last week, BTS unveiled their latest song, the Sheeran-penned Permission to Dance, as part of their CD single Butter. The title track has topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart for seven consecutive weeks, marking their longest run on the No 1 spot."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/ted-lasso-second-season-apple-tv-plus-2034411,Underdog football comedy Ted Lasso finds itself the big dog with Emmy nods,"The creators of the Apple TV+ comedy series Ted Lasso have gotten used to hearing lots of backhanded compliments. People will tell them they didn't expect to enjoy the first season so much. Or that they were surprised the Jason Sudeikis-led show turned out so well. ""Shocked"" is a word they hear a lot. ""We joke in the writers' room how often we read the phrase, 'This show has no right to be this good.' We're always like, 'Really? I mean, we tried really hard,'"" said Brett Goldstein, who is Emmy-nominated for playing tough guy Roy Kent and who co-produces and co-writes the show. On the eve of the show's second season, there's no excuse to be surprised anymore: Ted Lasso roared out of the Emmy nomination process on Tuesday (Jul 13) with 20 nods, including for best comedy, best comedy writing and with seven acting nominations. Ted Lasso begins its second season on Jul 23 no longer an underdog, but all the compliments and honours haven't turned it into a diva, either: Season two was already mapped out before season one even came out. The show centres on an American football coach who takes charge of an elite British football team in England despite having little knowledge of the game. It follows the players and coaches and owners.  If season one established the characters and the tone, season two is about deepening and exploring what the creators have already built, with many secondary characters finding their voices. There's a lot less football, too. ""I'm kind of excited, slightly nervous but in a kind of excited way, about the reaction to the fact that it does turn a few things on its head across the board, really,"" said Nick Mohammed, who earned an Emmy nod on Tuesday for playing kit man-turned-assistant-coach Nate. The second season begins with Lasso's fictional London team relegated from the elite division, its aged champion played by Goldstein retired and the team's arrogant hotshot played by Phil Dunster far away. Viewers follow their journeys, as well as that of a new character, a sports psychologist who has a knack for cutting to the truth, played by Sarah Niles. Niles knew nothing about the show when she was encouraged to submit a casting video during the pandemic. She waited until afterward to binge the first season and fell for the sweetness. ""The British love an underdog and Ted is like the underdog,"" she said.  Sudeikis and executive producer Bill Lawrence (Scrubs and Spin City) have fleshed out a three-dimensional Lasso from the character first created for NBC Sports to sell Americans on coverage of English Premier League soccer. They intentionally made the second season no carbon copy of the first.  ""It would be quite easy to sort of say, 'Oh, well, we've got a winning formula here. Let's just do the same thing.' But the creative team behind Ted Lasso is just not like that. They want to challenge themselves, the viewer. They want it to feel real,"" said Mohammed.  Sudeikis' Lasso may be a fish out of water, but he's relentlessly optimistic and kind, armed with homespun wisdom in the face of hostility. ""Fairy tales do not start nor do they end in the dark forest. That son-of-a-gun always shows up smack dab in the middle of a story. But it will all work out,"" he tells his team in the second season. ""Ted Lasso is a show about a guy who is ignorant – he doesn't know anything about football. But he's not arrogant and he's not shouting people down,"" said Goldstein. ""What he's doing is being open and honest and empathetic.""  Brendan Hunt, an executive producer who plays Coach Beard, compares Lasso to a sort of Jimmy Stewart character, humble and kind, polite and respectful, but true to himself and someone you can count on who will stand up for the correct way forward. ""There's a specifically American goodness there. We have not been exposed to much specifically American goodness in the last few years,"" he said. ""It's in our DNA. We've done it. We've been doing it. We just stopped. And I think that's part of what resonates with at least people here on the home front."" The British, too, have come to embrace the show, says Goldstein: ""I'm amazed how well it has played over here because British people are inherently far more cynical.""  Hunt notes two important men who have publicly said they are fans – Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp and player-turned-TV-commentator Gary Lineker. ""That's a good cross-section. That probably means we're on to something,"" Hunt said. But that doesn't mean the show is a soccer series – or a football series if you're outside America. While there is some kicking a ball on grass, viewers soon learn that's not the most important thing.  ""Football is definitely a backdrop for these characters to exist in this world,"" said Mohammed. ""But I mean it's number five or six in the pecking order of what this show is about.""  (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/take-tour-celebrities-homes-mtv-reboots-hit-series-cribs-2017321,Take a tour of celebrities’ homes as MTV reboots hit series Cribs,"Step aside, Real Housewives. MTV announced on Thursday (Jul 15) that classic TV series Cribs will be returning to the screens in the coming months. The original MTV Cribs first aired in September 2000, with the show allowing viewers a glimpse into the lives of the rich and famous as celebrities walked us through their pads and showed us all their cool toys. It was previously rebooted in 2010. Spanning 19 seasons and more than 100 episodes, past guests include A-list celebrities from Mariah Carey and Naomi Campbell, to Richard Branson and Hugh Hefner. The newest season will feature the real estate of stars such as Martha Stewart, Kathy Griffin, Marsai Martin, Scott Disick, Snooki, Tinashe and teenage personality Jojo Siwa. “Cribs didn’t simply introduce the celebreality genre, it created a blueprint for how we engage on social media,” said Nina L Diaz, President of Content and Chief Creative Officer, MTV Entertainment Group. “We are thrilled to usher in a new era of this iconic franchise for audiences around the world.” The production of the cult classic’s latest iteration will be helmed by Diaz, who was also involved in the development of the original show. “Each intimate 30-minute episode will take viewers beyond security gates to hang out for an up-close-and-personal look, dropping even more legendary moments like never before,” said MTV. The 20th season is set to make its MTV comeback on Aug 11. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/chrissy-teigen-opens-about-being-cancelled-following-cyberbullying-scandal-2017526,Chrissy Teigen opens up about being cancelled following cyberbullying scandal,"Chrissy Teigen took to Instagram on Wednesday (Jul 14) to share a lengthy and candid post about her mental health since joining what she has termed ""cancel club"". “I don’t really know what to say here… just feels so weird to pretend nothing happened in this online world but feel like utter shit in real life,” her post detailed. “Going outside sucks and doesn’t feel right, being at home alone with my mind makes my depressed head race.” The 35-year-old model and mother of two explained that being embroiled in a cyberbullying scandal has left her feeling lost and adrift. “But I do know that however I’m handling this now isn’t the right answer. I feel lost and need to find my place again, I need to snap out of this, I desperately wanna communicate with you guys instead of pretending everything is okay. I’m not used to any other way!!” The post follows a series of bullying allegations levelled against Teigen, which took place earlier this year, following which, her entertainment career and brand partnerships took a hit.   A post shared by chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen)   “Cancel club is a fascinating thing and I have learned a whollllle lot. Only a few understand it and it’s impossible to know til you’re in it,” the post continued. “And it’s hard to talk about it in that sense because obviously you sound whiny when you’ve clearly done something wrong. It just sucks. There is no winning. But there never is here anyhow.” In the message, Teigen reached out to her fans, telling them that “I love you guys, I miss you guys, and I just needed an honest moment with you because I’m just...tired of being sick with myself all day”. The controversy surrounding Teigen, who's married to singer John Legend, began in May, when 26-year-old Courtney Stodden resurfaced a number of Teigen’s past tweets to accuse her of cyberbullying. Stodden, who uses the they/ them pronouns, alleged in a Daily Beast interview that Teigen previously sent them disparaging comments on Twitter – telling them to take a “dirt nap” and “go to sleep forever"". Teigen’s tweets took place when then 16-year-old Stodden faced widespread ridicule for marrying their 51-year-old acting coach, Doug Hutchinson. Since Stodden’s statement, a few other television personalities have piled on the cyberbullying allegations, including fashion designer Michael Costello and former Teen Mom star Farrah Abraham. In response to the allegations, Teigen issued multiple public apologies over Twitter and Medium, describing her former self as an “insecure, attention seeking troll” and explaining how she felt “the crushing weight of regret for the things (she had) said in the past”. Despite her apologies, the backlash surrounding Teigen’s past tweets has taken a toll on her career. This includes losing business deals and dropping out of an upcoming Netflix voiceover role. On top of which, Teigen decided to step back from her cleaning supplies company, Safely, that she launched with her close friend, Kris Jenner. In spite of it all, Teigen seems to be taking her fall from grace in her stride (and with a little humour) – ending off her Instagram post with, “If you or someone you know has also been cancelled please let me know if there is a cancel club reunion because I could use some time off my couch! Thank u and goodbye I love u”."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/akan-datang-tay-ping-hui-making-his-malay-language-drama-debut-2017731,'Akan datang': Tay Ping Hui is making his Malay language drama debut,"We’ve seen Singaporean actor Tay Ping Hui in numerous local English or Chinese dramas such as Channel 5’s Tanglin and his recent special appearance on Channel 8’s Crouching Tiger Hidden Ghost.  Well, now he’s making his Malay language drama debut and yes, he’ll be saying his lines in Malay – a language he doesn't speak. Tay will appear in the Suria drama, Korban, which also stars Khairudin Samsudin and newcomer Rae, that’s scheduled to air in October. The 50-year-old actor will be playing a key supporting role as a Michelin-starred chef called Louis Tay. Most of his lines are in Malay with some lines in English.   A post shared by Tay Ping Hui / 郑斌辉 (@taypinghui)   Tay told 8days.sg over a WhatsApp chat that he was approached by his casting director friend for the role. “I have always been saying half jokingly that I wanted to challenge myself by doing Malay and Indian dramas,” he told the entertainment portal. “It's definitely challenging with the language, but that’s also the most enjoyable part. I guess I am a sucker for challenges and pain.” Tay announced his role on a Sunday (Jul 11) post on Instagram. “A different chef. A different restaurant. Speaking a different language. Akan datang, jumpa lagi,” he wrote. The last line translates to “coming soon, see you again”. The actor is actively learning and trying to expand his Malay vocabulary. However, his favourite word remains constant. “MAKAN,” he told 8days.sg, which means eat. When asked if he was worried about the role, he said, “It’s hard to act in a language that you do not understand. It’s not just about knowing the translation, it’s also about having to memorise the words, speaking in a believable accent and acting at the same time.” He also told Lianhe Wanbao that it takes him three or four times longer to memorise his lines but his co-stars on Suria were very “patient and understanding”. The actor rated himself 5.5 out of 10 for this performance and said that he has to use his SkillsFuture credit for language classes in order to take up more Malay dramas in the future. Tay also did not rule out the possibility of appearing in a Tamil language drama. “It will be interesting to take up a challenge,"" he told the Chinese newspaper. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/new-documentary-explores-anthony-bourdains-own-parts-unknown-2018226,A new documentary explores Anthony Bourdain’s own ‘parts unknown’,"There are many startling moments in Roadrunner, Morgan Neville’s rich and moving documentary about the singular culinary storyteller Anthony Bourdain, who tragically took his life at the age of 61. Here’s just one that sticks out: A quick scene with a therapist, in Argentina. As Bourdain lies on her couch, cameras rolling for an episode of his show, he describes some frightening psychological urges he has. She asks him if he wants to change, and to feel differently. He replies: “I suspect it’s too late.” We never learn here why Bourdain wanted to film what seems a genuine therapy session. But it fits in perfectly with the portrait Neville paints of a man who couldn’t resist being anything but painfully honest, and painfully public, even when it took him down some dark paths. It’s also an example of just how much material Neville had to work with. Between Bourdain’s own recordings and voiceovers, copious footage – much never seen – from production of his TV travelogues, and countless home movies and photos, it comes to feel like Bourdain himself is narrating his life story. And it’s hard to shake the feeling he already knows what happens, especially when he quips early on: “Here’s a little pre-emptive truth-telling: There’s no happy ending”. Neville dispenses quickly with the early stuff – Bourdain dropping out of college, washing dishes in Cape Cod – even his years as chef at Manhattan’s Brasserie Les Halles. It really starts at age 44, when Kitchen Confidential, his wickedly funny memoir about the underbelly of the restaurant world, catapults him into stardom and a life as a globetrotting raconteur bold enough to swallow a still-beating cobra heart or a sheep’s testicle. The transformation is dizzying: People are shouting to Bourdain in the streets. He’s sitting down with Letterman, and with Oprah. They’re saying Brad Pitt wants to play him. “It was like he died and was reborn,” says his brother, Chris Bourdain. In footage from his various shows, which culminated with Parts Unknown on CNN, we accompany Bourdain to an idyllic lunch in Provence with chef-buddy Eric Ripert, or to Vietnam, where he guzzles that cobra heart. Or to Haiti, where an episode on local cuisine leads to a chaotic scene of hungry youths seeking food. In a 2006 episode of No Reservations shot in Beirut, violence flares up between Israel and Hezbollah, and the crew is left to lounge by a pool for days while conflict rages. “I had begun to believe the dinner table was the great leveller,” Bourdain says. “Now I’m not so sure.” A casualty of Bourdain’s outsized fame is his first marriage. Nancy Putkoski doesn’t speak to Neville, but Bourdain’s second wife does – Ottavia Busia, with whom he shared a daughter. Her tearful regret at not having kept a closer eye on him once their marriage was over is one of the more moving moments of the film, as is the frank commentary – loving, sad and angry all at once – from celebrity chef David Chang. The tears flow copiously in this film, a credit to Neville’s vibrant filmmaking. Chang also has one of the catchiest lines about his friend: “It was almost never about food. It was about Tony learning to be a better person.” The first two-thirds are fittingly exhilarating. It’s hard not to be jealous of a man who freely admitted he had the best job in the world: “If I’m not happy, it’s a failure of imagination,” he once told The New Yorker magazine. But if imagination was all it took to be happy, this film makes clear, Bourdain would likely be with us today. The final act of Roadrunner is infused with a feeling of dread. Bourdain had become involved with Italian actor Asia Argento, a key accuser of Harvey Weinstein. She directed an episode of his Parts Unknown in Hong Kong, and we literally watch Bourdain falling in love. We also hear how devastated he was when a tabloid published pictures of her with another man, shortly before his death during filming in eastern France. It’s clear that some of Bourdain’s co-workers felt the relationship with Argento sent Bourdain into a tailspin that led to his death – even though one of them points out, rightly of course, that “Tony did this”. It’s unfortunate that the film does not include Argento’s own voice here. But one cannot fault Roadrunner for not coming up with clear answers. There rarely are clear answers, anyway, and this film seems to want to be about a life, not a death. A fascinating life, parts of which will forever remain unknown. (Source: AP)"

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/oh-mami-singaporean-rapper-yung-raja-gets-featured-jimmy-fallons-talk-show-2020681,Oh Mami! Singaporean rapper Yung Raja gets featured on Jimmy Fallon's talk show,"Local rapper Yung Raja and his latest single Mami made a brief appearance on The Tonight Show, one of America's longest-running late-night talk shows hosted by Jimmy Fallon, this week. However, the feature was … unconventional, to say the least. During a regular Do Not Play segment on the show, where Fallon roasts songs and encourages viewers to avoid them, the Emmy award-winning host held up the cover of Yung Raja’s Mami. Holding the vinyl record, he explained, “This is from a Singapore rapper called Yung Raja”. The host then proceeded to play a snippet of the song for his live audience. Listening to the repetitive post-chorus hook where Yung Raja sings the word ""Mami"" over and over, Fallon looked on unamused. “Now that’s how you write a song right there,” he quipped as the song ended. In-house musician Questlove, though, could be seen dancing along to the beat.    A post shared by YUNG RAJA (@yungraja)   Fallon’s lack of enthusiasm was made up for by Twitter users who expressed their support for the local rapper. The clip, posted on The Tonight Show's Twitter account on Tuesday (Jul 13), has since garnered more than 250,000 views and 1,600 retweets. Despite the less than savoury feature, the 26-year-old rapper took the cameo in good stride. In a Twitter response, Yung Raja thanked Fallon for playing his song, excitedly noting in all caps “THIS IS INSANE”. He also reposted the clip on his Instagram page, commenting, “I think Jimmy Fallon isn’t a big fan of mami BUT HELLO WE MADE IT TO THE TONIGHT SHOW (Questlove do be vibin tho)”. Various Singaporean musicians, including Benjamin Kheng, Jasmine Sokko, Gentle Bones and Lion City Boy, commented on his post, expressing their pride for the young artiste. Known for his breakout hit single Mustafa, Yung Raja was recently signed to US label Alamo Records, marking his entry into the US market. Mami, released in March this year, is his first song with the label. The young rapper is also signed to Def Jam Southeast Asia, which is under Universal Music Group."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/weeknd-bts-billie-eilish-hope-raise-billions-global-citizen-2022311,"The Weeknd, BTS, Billie Eilish hope to raise billions for Global Citizen","The Weeknd, BTS and Billie Eilish will take part in Global Citizen Live, a 24-hour event on Sep 25 that's intended to raise money and awareness to fight worldwide threats including COVID-19, climate change and extreme poverty. Hugh Evans, CEO of Global Citizen, is hoping the event, timed to the United Nations General Assembly, will encourage governments, corporations and philanthropists to fund a billion COVID-19 vaccine doses by September, especially in Africa. The international advocacy group also hopes to raise US$6 billion (S$8.14 billion) for famine relief efforts for the 41 million people worldwide who are estimated to be on the brink of starvation, as well as enough money to plant a billion trees to help counter climate change. For anyone who questions whether these institutions will manage to generate more money to donate, Evans points to the current space race. “As billionaires are leaping into space, we need to remind people that we’ve really only got one planet and we need to make sure that we actually care for it and for those who are on it,” Evans told the Associated Press. “This is something the ultra-high-net-worth community can solve the world’s problems right now. ""We’re literally talking about an investment which sounds big in comparison – US$6 billion to address the famine relief efforts across Africa. Honestly, Jeff Bezos could write that check tomorrow and it would be a percentage point in his total net worth. I’m all for people daring to dream, and may they dream even bigger, but let’s also dream about a world where the absolutely stupid social ills that currently still exist in the world are addressed by those who have the means to do so.” Global Citizen Live – which will run the gamut from pop stars HER, Lizzo, Lorde and Ed Sheeran to rockers Coldplay, Green Day, and Metallica and international artists from Andrea Bocelli and Lang Lang to Angelique Kidjo and Femi Kuti – will take place on six continents. Live events are planned for Central Park in New York City, the Champ de Mars in Paris, as well as venues in London and Los Angeles. Performances and hosted segments will come from Sydney, Rio de Janeiro, Seoul, and Lagos. Like nearly all of the group’s events, Global Citizen Live will encourage millions of fans to urge their governments or individual corporations to donate or take actions to advance the group’s goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030. Evans said that goal has suffered setbacks because of COVID-19 and the economic stagnation that resulted from it, forcing 150 million people back into extreme poverty. “It is very important to me to be a part of this historic event to spread awareness and encourage action toward helping the people of Ethiopia during this devastating humanitarian crisis they are faced with,” The Weeknd said in a statement. “It’ll be an honour to perform and help bring support to these citizens who are suffering so severely.” Also set to participate are Adam Lambert, Burna Boy, Camila Cabello, Christine and the Queens, Davido, Demi Lovato, DJ Snake, Doja Cat, Duran Duran, Hugh Jackman & Deborra-lee Furness, Keith Urban, Shawn Mendes, The Lumineers, Tiwa Savage and Usher. Ticketing details and performances for the individual cities, as well as additional artists, will be announced in August. “The artist community is very selective about what they all rally around, and the sense that I’ve had is that there is this amazing appetite to be part of it,” Evans said. The event has support from leaders around the world, including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi. Evans said education issues will also be in the spotlight at the event, which hopes to get 4.5 million kids back to school learning by raising US$400 million. Only one in three children globally can access remote learning. And the number of children who have had their educations interrupted has grown by 50 per cent since 2020. “I always say that people care either about planetary concern or about social issues,” Evans said. “For September, we’re targeting both.” It’s an ambitious agenda. Evans said he is hopeful because of Global Citizen’s previous successes this year. In May, the organisation sponsored VAX Live, which generated more than 26 million COVID-19 vaccine doses and US$302 million for the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator initiative, which includes the World Health Organization’s COVAX programme for more equitable distribution of vaccines. The event, which included appearances by President Joe Biden as well as the Duke of Sussex, helped raise the issue of vaccine sharing globally. “I believe that VAX Live changed the dialogue and tangibly resulted in vaccines that will be shared,” Evans said. “Yes, US$302 million is still a small amount of money compared to what we need to achieve. Our ambitions are much bigger for September. And that’s why we’re uniting the whole world for this.” (Source: AP)"

This was announced by the brand on Tuesday (Jul 13). The 29-year-old expressed gratitude at her newest appointment. “Becoming a global brand ambassador for Loewe is truly an amazing honour for me. I am very much looking forward to our upcoming projects for this beautiful brand,” she said. The South Korean singer-songwriter and rapper – whose real name is Kim Hyun-Ah – is a powerhouse in the K-pop industry. She made her debut in 2007 and was part of popular girl groups Wonder Girls and 4Minute before going solo. Known for her vibrant and colourful sense of style, HyunA joins English actor Josh O’Connor (he played Prince Charles in Netflix’s The Crown), who is also an ambassador for the brand. “I am thrilled to welcome HyunA to the Loewe family,” said Jonathan Anderson, the brand's Creative Director. “Very much looking forward to this exciting partnership and working closely together.” Earlier this year, Kim released her latest hit solo album titled I’m Not Cool, which has topped the charts of major Korean streaming platforms and the iTunes’ worldwide album chart.     Fashion houses have recently started working with South Korean celebrities for their star power.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/zoe-tay-gets-3-out-10-rating-tiktok-filter-rates-looks-and-finds-it-hilarious-2025836,Zoe Tay gets 3 out of 10 rating on TikTok filter that rates looks – and finds it hilarious,"Local actor James Seah used the Rate My Looks filter on TikTok on Ah Jie Zoe Tay herself and the results were unexpected – but hilarious. The filter gives your face a rating out of 10 – the higher, the more attractive, one would assume. However, it’s obviously not based on science (or even reality) and the case in point is Zoe herself. On Sunday (Jul 12), the 53-year-old actress reposted a video from TikTok to her Instagram of co-star James using the filter on her. Surprise, surprise – she scored 3/10. Both she and James let out big laughs at the results but what was even funnier was that Zoe thought the filter was rating her IQ.   A post shared by Zoe Tay鄭惠玉 (@zoetay10)   “So my IQ is quite low,” she said, while laughing. James commented on her post to say that she's really “10/10”. Fans also flooded the section with the laughing emoji as well as compliments. One said, “Impossible, should be 10/10”, while another said that the rating ""should’ve been 30/10”. Another fan praised Zoe for being a good sport and said it was “always good to laugh at oneself”. As it turns out, Zoe was not the only celebrity James has been going around rating with the TikTok filter. Other “victims” were the cast of Mediacorp’s upcoming Channel 8 drama, Heartland Hero, where Zoe will make a guest appearance. Paige Chua scored a whopping 8/10 and Elvin Ng was rated a solid 10/10. This filter spree started when James was on set and needed to pass some time. When he tried it on himself, he scored -1/10. Say what?     The 130-episode Heartland Hero is currently in production and its airing date has yet to be announced. James replaced actor Shane Pow in the role of a “cute and happy” Ah Beng who was just released from prison and encouraged to start afresh by his older brother, played by Elvin. Shane was terminated from Mediacorp following his recent drink driving charge in April.  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/dining/creative-capital-award-winning-hong-kong-mixologist-shaking-things-singapore-2024741,Creative Capital: This award-winning Hong Kong mixologist is shaking things up in Singapore,"One of the most innovative bar owners here in Singapore must be Colin Chia, the founder of Nutmeg & Clove. Chia is an industry veteran and heavyweight who, before he owned and operated his own bars, was the Asia-Pacific Commercial Head of Diageo, and the man partially responsible for making Diageo’s World Class one of the industry’s most respected competitions.  I had previously featured Colin in this column last year, while he was looking for a new space for Nutmeg & Clove, which finally re-opened on Purvis Street at the start of 2021. Along with the new digs, Chia brought in a new and celebrated young bar manager. Shelley Tai, formerly of the Quinary in Hong Kong, was the winner of the Diageo Reserve World Class HK & Macao competition in 2019. When she moved here, I started to follow her IG feed. During our most-recent semi-lockdown, I was amused and intrigued enough by her posts to want to learn more about this talented and creative new arrival to our shores. HI SHELLEY, WHAT GOT YOU INTO MIXOLOGY? At the time, I was young and really just needed a job for food and rent. I also figured bartending would also be fun to do at the time. I never thought back then it would become my career, but now, so many years later, I still love what I do. WHICH WAS THE FIRST BAR YOU WORKED AT?  The first bar I worked at as a full-time bartender was FINDS, a Nordic restaurant in Hong Kong. It was a great place to learn as it was very cocktail focused despite being a restaurant. We were already making caviars and foams back then. And that was 10 years ago! WHAT WAS THE HARDEST PART OF LEARNING THE ROPES? Patience. When you start your career in bartending, you have to be okay to start from the bottom and pick up skills and experiences along the way. I spent some time working as a barback, supporting the bartenders doing tasks like washing glasses, replenishing the bar, and cleaning the counters and the bar itself, for quite a while before I was allowed to actually make drinks. 
  WHAT WAS THE FIRST ORIGINAL CREATION YOU WERE REALLY PROUD OF?  The first recipe I created and was proud of was called Yuk Bing Siu. I made that drink at Quinary, a fabulous cocktail bar helmed by Antonio Lai, two years ago. I was so happy when I could create a signature drink that Antonio was proud to serve. The Yuk Bing Siu is made with mezcal, apple brandy, toasted rice and amaro. WHAT IS YOUR OWN CREATIVE PROCESS WHEN CREATING A NEW DRINK? I don’t have a precise set of steps, but I like to draw inspirations from daily life, things that I ate, saw or experienced. YOU’VE WORKED AT CLUBS, RESTAURANTS AND SPECIALIST COCKTAIL BARS. ARE THERE DIFFERENCES AND DIFFERENT CHALLENGES IN EACH KIND OF ESTABLISHMENT? Different kinds of establishments means a different pace and different customer expectations. Working in restaurants require multi-tasking skills, whereas working in nightclubs is super fun but physically draining due to the high volume service… and also the drinking! You are often asked by guests to have a drink with them. Of the various kinds of places I have worked, I feel that a dedicated cocktail bar is more suitable for me right now because it allows me to be creative and focus more on flavours and techniques. 
  YOU WERE THE DIAGEO WORLD CLASS HK & MACAO BARTENDER IN 2019. TELL ME ABOUT THAT EXPERIENCE AND WHAT IT WAS LIKE WHEN YOU COMPETED AND WON? To be honest, I am not a very competitive person. However, competitions offer me great opportunities to commit errors, to learn from them, and to grow. For me it’s not about winning, it’s about showing my best. Winning the Diageo World Class competition felt incredible. I actually did not expect to get so far. I was up against so many other great finalists. Once I saw who I was competing against, it seemed impossible at the beginning. But then, all of a sudden, things started to come together, and I realised coming out on top was not impossible at all. I had also spent days and nights practicing for the competition, so it was very fulfilling to be recognised for my work. WHAT DO YOU LOVE MOST ABOUT YOUR JOB? The bar is one of the few places that brings people together from all walks of life. It has given me the opportunity to meet and connect with different people, and I have built many strong friendships through it. 
  HOW DID YOU COME TO SINGAPORE AND NUTMEG & CLOVE?   I met Colin briefly during a guest shift he did at Quinary in Hong Kong. Last year, I was originally planning to move to New York City. I received a job offer there that was really exciting. Then COVID-19 hit and I had to change my plans. Coincidently, Colin called me at this time – it was perfect timing. He asked if I wanted to join him and his team at Nutmeg & Clove. I had been looking for an opportunity to venture outside of Hong Kong so I promptly accepted. I was very excited about the move and the opportunity he gave me. I KNOW THINGS HAVE BEEN A LITTLE CRAZY FOR YOU GIVEN THE LOCK-DOWNS, BUT WHAT’S IT BEEN LIKE IN SINGAPORE SO FAR? Actually it’s been great. I was happy to move to Singapore in midst of the pandemic especially because I wasn’t able to travel at all last year. Being in a completely new environment allows me to be more mindful and present to what I do. Oh, and I love the hawker centres here. Love local Singaporean food WHAT IS THE BIGGEST MISCONCEPTION ABOUT YOU? Some people might perceive me as arrogant or unfriendly outside of work. The truth is that I am just quiet. And while I know this, and have been trying to be more outgoing, I have to agree that I'm not the best when it comes to breaking the ice with new people. Fortunately, this doesn’t affect my professionalism at work. Once I am behind the counter, I work hard to make my guests feel happy to be served by me. WHAT IS THE BEST THING TO EVER HAPPEN TO YOU BECAUSE OF YOUR JOB? Going to Rotterdam and Glasgow for the Diageo World Class global final. Not only because I love travelling, but also because it was such a great chance to meet inspiring people from my industry from around the world. It was a really unforgettable experience. 
  I READ SOMEWHERE YOU ARE AN ACCOMPLISHED CHEF, IN ADDITION TO BEING AN AWARD-WINNING BARTENDER. HAVE YOU PRESENTED ANY DISHES TO COLIN THAT HE MIGHT WANT TO ADD TO THE BAR’S FOOD MENU? I love to cook a lot at home, but I will leave the menu planning to the professionals. WHAT IS YOUR OWN FAVOURITE DRINK WHEN YOU’RE NOT WORKING? When I am out or even at home, I always start with an ice-cold whisky highball.  "

Heritage Auctions in Dallas said the video game sold Friday (Jul 9). The auction house said it was a rare version that was created during a limited production run that took place during a few months in late 1987. The Legend of Zelda is a popular fantasy adventure game that was first released in 1986.  ""The Legend of Zelda marks the beginning of one of the most important sagas in gaming; its historical significance can't be understated ... it is a true collector's piece,"" Valarie McLeckie, Heritage's video game specialist, said in a statement.  In April, the auction house sold an unopened copy of Nintendo's Super Mario Bros that was bought in 1986 and forgotten about in a desk drawer for US$660,000."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-lifestyle/anita-biopic-late-cantopop-legend-anita-mui-scheduled-release-2021-2029031,"Anita, biopic of late Cantopop legend Anita Mui scheduled for release in 2021","Anita, the biopic of the late Cantopop legend Anita Mui is scheduled for release in 2021. Produced by Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon’s Bill Kong and directed by Cold War’s Longman Leung, the movie revisits the close relationships Mui formed with her family, friends and proteges.   Kong shared, in an interview with the Post, that his bond with the late singer is the catalyst for the movie. In 1986, Kong had invited Mui to help promote a niche Japanese movie his then-fledging company Edko Films acquired, the singer readily agreed without mention of remuneration. He attributed her readiness to help as one of the reasons that the Hong Kong film industry flourished. “I am really thankful for her. She saved us; we were a small company. I will remember this forever. That was a most touching experience for me, because she was a big star and I was nobody.” The idea to make a Mui biopic crystalised in Kong’s mind when Mui approached him in 2003 for a film role. “She told me, ‘Bill, I want to make a good movie. I want to make a movie that stays on [in people’s minds]. Can you find me an opportunity?’” Kong promptly lined Mui up as the female lead in Zhang Yimou’s House of Flying Daggers, however, the star’s untimely death that year halted plans. “Over the years, [I kept telling myself], ‘I owe her a movie. I owe her a movie,’” said Kong. “Some people said to me, ‘Who would make a biopic so soon [after someone died]? Let’s wait for 50 years or so.’ But that’s not the type of film I want to make for Mui. She was a big inspiration for me; even up to this day, I’m still behaving as a person in the way she taught me.” Kong's main objective for making this biopic is to remind people of the late star. “One of Mui’s famous quotes goes like this, ‘When you finish your dinner one day and see a star in the sky outside your window, I hope you’d remember a person named Anita Mui.’” 31-year-old Hong Kong model Louise Wong makes her screen debut as Anita Mui. The production team spent over three years looking for an actress who possesses Mui’s charisma. The self-professed Anita Mui fan underwent intensive singing and dance training for over six months to prepare for the role. 
   A post shared by 古天樂 Louis Koo (@kootinlok_louis) Veteran actor Louis Koo plays the role of fashion designer Eddie Lau who served as Mui’s image consultant while fellow veteran actor Lam Ka-tung plays Mui’s other best friend, pianist So Hau-leung. Budding actor Terrance Lau plays Mui’s superstar buddy Leslie Cheung. Mui died from cervical cancer in 2003 at age 40. Besides her unparalleled charisma on stage, the singer is best remembered for charitable ventures and participation in social activism."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/travel/cannes-film-festival-under-covid-19-glamour-gets-unmasked-2029256,"At Cannes Film Festival under COVID-19, glamour gets unmasked","For nearly everybody who has come to the Cannes Film Festival after months in various stages of lockdown and caution, the transition is head-spinning.  Even in normal years, Cannes is an onslaught. But this time, plunging into full-capacity theaters and teeming red carpets is like stepping into another world. The morning after the Val Kilmer documentary Val premiered at Cannes, its co-director Ting Poo was still reeling.  ""Yesterday was so surreal. Just seeing the film with a full theater, and here at the most prestigious film festival,"" said Poo. ""To go from not being around people to that experience in a day was incredible.""  The pandemic is far from invisible at Cannes. A negative COVID-19 test is required every 48 hours for even those vaccinated – unless they got their shots in the European Union. Moviegoers wear masks indoors. Everything is a little muted. Usually well-booked hotels have vacancies. Screenings that would typically leave hundreds queueing outside don't fill up. The usual tuxedoed ticket-seekers praying for a handout have been pushed away from the Palais, the festival hub, to clear space.  But in places like the Cannes red carpet, life is almost normal – if ""normal"" can ever apply to a stretch of carpet where coteries of stars drift in every few hours like parade floats. Glamour has been unmasked, maybe more than any other time in the last year and a half of pandemic.  Over the first few days of the 74th Cannes Film Festival – held two months later than usual, and after last year's edition was scrubbed entirely – the red carpet has looked much as it has always before. Marion Cotillard, Bella Hadid, Matt Damon, Helen Mirren and Adam Driver have all strolled along, though they may have all been outclassed, fashion-wise, by Spike Lee and his flamingo-pink Louis Vuitton suit. Most walk unmasked, as the carpet is outdoors and most attending are vaccinated – though proof isn't required. And there are no fewer photographers than usual jockeying for stars' attention. The spectacle has picked up right where it left off. Nature, even the Cannes sequined variety, is healing.  ""It's a little bit like a strange dream, like waking up from this nap of two years doing nothing and suddenly: Boom,"" said Avshalom Pollak, star of Nadav Lapid's Ahed's Knee, an impassioned Israeli drama competing for the Palme d'Or. ""There is a very particular kind of feeling to it because it's like: Where is the world going? Is it restarting? Is it changing? What's going on here?"" Cannes is taking place on the heels of France easing COVID-19 restrictions and reopening international travel. About half the French have received at least one vaccination shot, while 38 per cent are fully vaccinated. But the delta variant has pushed infections back up slightly recently, stoking fears of a resurgence. On Friday (Jul 9), French Health Minister Olivier Veran said the delta variant would likely become France's dominant strain this weekend.  That, along with images of unmasked attendees at premieres, has pushed the festival to increase pre-screening mask reminders. Swarming beachside after parties have been curtailed, in the hotels along the Croisette film publicists and executives have pushed their chairs out onto open-air balconies. Cannes mayor David Lisnard has even employed a pair of COVID-19-sniffing dogs to help with screening.  Ahead of the festival, its director Thierry Fremaux said dinners would be more favoured this year than cocktails. On the sun-dabbled French Riviera, most restaurants are spread out on the sidewalks. One major concession: Fremaux isn't greeting guests at the top of the Palais stairs with a kiss – though there have been a few rogue smooches.  ""The pandemic is not conquered"" Fremaux said on Tuesday. ""So we all have to be careful, even though most festival-goers are vaccinated."" But since there's such variation country to country in vaccination proof – the US, for example, has no official vaccine passport – the festival is requiring most to test every other day. The joke is that this year a negative test is the hottest ticket in Cannes. And while at first some complained about the less-than-elegant process of retreating to a cubicle to fill a tube with saliva, the tented lab just down the street from the Palais had become a regular stop for festivalgoers – just like the Palais Nespresso bar, only less refreshing.  The specially erected testing site is staffed by 60 medical school students. The lab's director, Guillaume Armana, said Friday that they were conducting up to 4,000 tests daily.  ""We are working with the festival and the regional agency,"" said Armana, who said any positive tests would be confidential. ""For now we have maybe 10,000 people to test and everything is under control. It's the best way to make a festival again here in Cannes and to let the people have a new life.""   "

Label SJ and JYP Entertainment – Heechul and Momo’s agencies, respectively – issued statements confirming that the two had indeed parted ways. However, their representatives declined further comment in order to respect the artistes’ privacy. While the reasons for the couple’s split remain unconfirmed by both agencies, South Korean media outlets attributed the break-up to the pair’s busy schedules. The celebrity couple went public with their relationship in January 2020. However, they were rumoured to have been dating since 2019. At the time, their relationship drew widespread attention for the couple’s differing nationalities – she's Japanese and he's South Korean – and their 13-year age gap. Although Momo may no longer be Kim’s, um, super junior, the pair has reportedly decided to maintain a platonic relationship. “They ended their romantic relationship and returned to being colleagues and having a senior-and-junior relationship,” a source told news outlet Maeil Kyungje.

Her death, due to illness, was confirmed through her personal Facebook page on Tuesday (Jul 6) with a notice about her wake and funeral services. Various members of Singapore’s film and theatre community have expressed their condolences over social media. Founder and artistic director of The Necessary Stage Alvin Tan wrote: “My deepest condolences to Beatrice's family and loved ones. She will be missed. May she rest in peace”. “I am in shock. More than an actress, the world will be a dimmer place without her. Rest in peace Beatrice,” commented filmmaker Sun Koh, who worked with Chien on two short films, The Secret Passion of Madam Tan Ah Lian (2014) and Presence (2018). “Sending my deep condolences to family and friends of Beatrice. I've had the privilege of working with Beatrice on some film shoots and her passion for life and the arts always shone so brightly. Hope her family knows how important she was to our local small and big screens. Rest in peace Beatrice,” wrote film director Kirsten Tan. Although known for her time onscreen, Chien only began her career as a freelance actress at the age of 62, after a 40-year career in nursing. She played various roles on stage, television and feature films – including a regular on long-running Channel 5 and 8 productions, such as Your Hand In Mine (2009 to 2010). She also landed the role of a conflicted grandmother in Eric Khoo’s Ramen Teh (2018), and the supporting role of Ling Cheh in the Hollywood film Crazy Rich Asians (2018)."

The actress' younger sister, Fan Wenqing, wrote in a social media post that their father died after battling an unspecified illness “for a decade with bravery and unwavering belief"", as reported by 8days.sg. “Never did he once falter in the face of relapse or more bad news. He was always a fighter, facing everything head on without any doubt or even complain,” she wrote. The siblings also have an older sister and an older brother. This recent Father's Day in June, the 50-year-old actress posted a picture with her mother and father, who had breathing tubes in his nose, wishing him a happy Father’s Day. She and her family also celebrated her father’s birthday in March this year where her son, Zed, dressed up in a lion dance costume for the occasion.

She has a 10-month-old baby, Khai, with singer and former One Direction member, Zayn Malik.   A post shared by Gigi Hadid (@gigihadid)   The 26-year-old American supermodel was particularly worried about her daughter’s privacy. “You know we have never intentionally shared our daughter’s face on social media,” said Hadid in the letter.  Hadid has posted photos of her baby in a stroller, or of herself carrying her in a baby carrier on social media, but has never revealed baby Khai's face.    A post shared by Gigi Hadid (@gigihadid)   “Our wish is that she can choose how to share herself with the world when she comes of age, without worrying about a public image that she has not chosen.” While the letter spoke of her plea to the media and public to blur out her daughter’s face in images, she also expressed her gratitude towards those paparazzi who showed her that respect.      In particular, she highlighted those who heeded her request to keep their distance when she and baby Khai visited New York City.   “I see you and I appreciate it,” said Hadid.    A post shared by Gigi Hadid (@gigihadid)   The star also dropped hints about how it is still “as overwhelming and disorienting” for her, as an adult, to deal with dramatic paparazzi on a daily basis. The stress that comes with being a new mum can often be overwhelming, “without the stress of the media circus”, she said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/michelle-yeoh-netflix-series-witcher-blood-origin-1987706,Michelle Yeoh joins the cast of Netflix series The Witcher: Blood Origin,"Netflix announced on Tuesday (Jul 6) that 59-year-old Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh has been cast in the upcoming six-part original series The Witcher: Blood Origin – not to be confused with The Witcher, also on the streaming channel, that stars Henry Cavill. Set in an elven world 1,200 years prior to the world of The Witcher, the prequel Blood Origin tells a story lost to time. It will narrate the events leading up to the Conjunction of the Spheres, which merged the worlds of monsters, elves and humans into one, and the creation of the very first Witcher. In a Twitter post, Netflix detailed that Yeoh will be playing the character of Scian, “the very last of her nomadic tribe of sword elves”, and who’s been described as “an artist with the blade, on a deadly quest that will change the fate of the Continent”. She will be joining the likes of other stars such as Jacon Collins-Levy and Laurence O’ Fuarain, who is set to play a warrior named Fjall. Author of the original book series The Witcher, Andrzej Sapkowski will serve as the show’s creative consultant, alongside showrunner Declan de Barra and executive producer Lauren Schmidt Hissrich. Yeoh is no stranger to action roles, with an impressive list of past experiences, including starring opposite Pierce Brosnan in James Bond: Tomorrow Never Dies and her critically acclaimed work in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. She’s also starring in the highly anticipated Marvel flick Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings, set to be released in September 2021. Although no official timeline for the new series has been released, eager fans of the Witcherverse have no need to despair. In collaboration with game developer CD Projekt Red, Netflix will be hosting a global virtual Witcher Con on Jul 9 and 10. Amidst panels and announcements, fans can also expect to see a full-length trailer of Season 2 of The Witcher, which concluded filming back in April 2021. The streaming service has also confirmed that Season 2 of the fantasy-action series will be hitting the screens in the last quarter of 2021."

Taiwanese media estimated that the Mandopop star could have lost at least NT$250 million (US$8.9 million) in potential income, but this was denied by a rep from Lin's agency. Lin’s agency told entertainment portal 8days.sg that it was just speculation from the media. The 40-year-old star was rumoured to be a mentor on the new season of Sing! China, but that’s not likely to happen as he’s currently in Taiwan preparing for his upcoming virtual concert, and filming for the singing competition starts this week in China. He’s also said to have missed out on another reality show called Wonderful Time. Lin’s agency did say, however, that an earlier quote in the media attributed to the singer’s manager was correct, which is that Lin is focusing on his virtual concert taking place on Saturday (Jul 10) before moving on to other plans, including returning to Singapore to get vaccinated and to apply for work visas at the embassy. Lin's Sanctuary Finale concert is a virtual spin-off show from his Sanctuary world tour in March 2018 that covered 43 countries in 66 shows, including four sold-out shows at the Singapore Indoor Stadium. It came to a halt due to the pandemic."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/paul-rudd-tries-prank-seth-rogen-massage-spa-1987926,"Ant-Man actor Paul Rudd tries to prank Seth Rogen, ends up giving him a massage","He’s better known as Ant Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe but it seems Paul Rudd is a man of many talents – and giving massages appears to be one of them. Actor and comedian Seth Rogen revealed his good friend’s useful skill in a tweet on Tuesday (Jul 6). Rogen wrote: “Once I was in the spa in a hotel in Vegas getting a massage. When I finished I turned over and to my shock Paul Rudd was massaging me”. “He saw me go in and convinced the masseuse to let him take over, thinking I’d notice immediately. I didn’t, and Paul did the entire rest of it,” he added. Talk about committing to a part. Rudd – or shall we say, Rubb – must have been doing something right because Rogen didn’t even notice he wasn’t getting a true professional for the job. Some have questioned whether the incident did happen, especially given Rogen’s fondness for pot – he even has his own cannabis company – but the 39-year-old actor insisted that this was not a weed-induced hallucination, responding to one naysayer with, “I’m sure Paul would confirm it”. And indeed, he did. Rudd told media outlet Mediaite that “Haha! It’s 100% true”. Rogen then retweeted Mediaite’s post of the confirmation, saying, “I maintain the utmost integrity with my stories”. Rudd, who is 52, and Rogen are known to be buddies, having worked together on Judd Apatow movies The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up and This Is 40. The spontaneous anecdote garnered so much attention that it became a trending topic on Twitter. Some Twitter users were quick to express envy, with @QondiNtini writing: “Suddenly Paul Rudd turning out to be my masseuse is the thing I want most in the whole world”. Looks like Rudd’s massage skills are in high demand. If the actor is looking for a career change, this could be it."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/britney-spears-court-appointed-attorney-resigns-conservatorship-1988171,Britney Spears' court-appointed attorney resigns from conservatorship,"Britney Spears' court-appointed attorney on Tuesday (Jul 6) filed documents to resign from her conservatorship, the latest of several such moves that have come in the fallout from the pop singer's comments in court decrying the legal arrangement that controls her money and affairs. Samuel Ingham III filed documents in Los Angeles Superior Court requesting that the court appoint Spears a new attorney, and saying his resignation would take effect as soon as that happened. During her Jun 23 speech in court, in which she condemned the conservatorship and asked Judge Brenda Penny to end it, Spears was critical of Ingham, and said she wished the court would allow her to hire a lawyer of her choice. Last week, Bessemer Trust, the estate-management company that Spears had requested replace her father as conservator of her finances, filed its own documents withdrawing from the case. The filing said that circumstances had changed after Spears' comments in court on Jun 23. At a hearing in November, Penny denied Spears' request to have her father replaced entirely, but said James Spears and Bessemer Trust could work together as co-conservators of her finances. And on Monday, in a letter obtained by entertainment industry publication Deadline, Britney Spears' longtime manager Larry Rudolph also resigned, saying she had no intention of resuming her career after a two-and-a-half-year hiatus that has left him with no work to do for her. A veteran probate attorney, Ingham was for years a largely silent figure in the conservatorship, at least publicly, but became a more vocal advocate for Britney Spears starting last year. His statements in court that she feared her father and would not resume her career so long as he had power over it were an early crack in the presumed consensus among the figures involved in the conservatorship. At the Jun 23 hearing, Ingham said that Britney Spears had not asked him to file a petition to end the conservatorship, but said he expected she might do so soon. In her remarks critical of Ingham, Spears said during the hearing that she hadn't known she could file such a petition, and she still has not. (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/black-widow-sequel-possible-says-director-cate-shortland-1990516,"Will there be a Black Widow sequel? It’s possible, says the director","As we gear up for Marvel’s Black Widow coming out on Thursday (Jul 8), fans might be heartened to hear that there is a possibility for a sequel – although it may be without the leading character, Natasha Romanoff, played by Scarlett Johansson. What? We hear you ask. The film’s director, Cate Shortland, offered the possibility during a recent interview with RadioTimes.com on Jun 30. The Australian director was asked about the potential for a follow-up film, to which she responded, “I think following a different character, yes.” She reiterated the sentiment in an interview with Deadline, which ran on Jul 5, saying: “I think these girls have got a lot of asses still to kick.” She wouldn’t confirm, though, if this potential spin-off would focus on Natasha’s sister, Yelena, played by Florence Pugh. Shortland told Deadline that she was the one who suggested Pugh for the film as she would be a good fit against Johansson. The director also told RadioTimes.com that she would love to return if there’s a sequel. “I mean, all the beautiful fights and the spectacle, and I think just creating something really fun and joyous is pretty addictive. So yeah, I would do it again. Yes.” Black Widow sees Johansson reprising her role, although this standalone film’s timeline takes place after Captain America: Civil War, which is why it can even happen, given that the character died at the end of Avengers: Endgame. Shortland explained to Deadline that in this film, Natasha is on the run. “So, she’s totally alone when this all begins, which was great because we saw her without any pretense. She didn’t have to be something. She was just a person,” she said. The director also revealed that she worked with a Russian historian to create a backstory. “We went back, maybe two years into Russia, into Soviet. We looked at what her life would have actually been like before she came to America.” Meanwhile, Johansson, who made her debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2010’s Iron Man 2, is having a bittersweet moment saying goodbye. “I feel really proud of this film and I think it’s great to go out on a high note. This movie is so different from any other Marvel film that we’ve done so far,” the 36-year-old star told Good Morning America. Black Widow opens in Singapore cinemas on Jul 8 and will also be available for streaming on Disney+ Premium Access."

The two band members in question also revealed that they were sleeping in the nude when it happened.  Taecyeon and Chansung told the story during the latest episode of Korean variety show Ask Us Anything on Jul 3. According to Taecyeon, who was also in the K-drama hit Vincenzo, ""We were staying in a hotel, Chansung and I shared a room. But the thing is, Chansung and I don't wear any clothing when we sleep."" The 32-year-old, who’s also the group’s main rapper, added: ""We were sleeping in our room when I suddenly heard the sound of a hotel card key beeping and the door opening. Then I heard the sound of about five or six female voices giggling quietly.” “So I was thinking to myself, ‘Did they enter the wrong room by accident? What is this? What’s going on?’ My heart was pounding in my ears.” When he locked eyes with the intruders, Taecyeon said that he “was so shocked that (he) cursed in English like crazy.” To his surprise, the intruding fans began swearing back at him. Chansung, who was asleep at the time, added that he was awoken by his roommate’s cursing. “I woke up asking, 'What is it? What's going on?',” said the 31-year-old. “When I saw people standing in front of me, I yelled. I was in shock.” Taecyeon explained that the fans had used a key card to get into their room. They told the hotel about it and received some Champagne as an apology. The K-pop stars didn’t specify which hotel or even what year it happened, but the guys were in town in November 2011 for a concert. Incidents where fans stalk or invade the privacy of celebrities are not uncommon in K-pop, where obsessive fans are referred to as sasaengs. The six-member boy band recently made a comeback after a five-year hiatus with the album Must. Their latest release was accompanied by a music video for the track, Make It."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/superman-lethal-weapon-goonies-director-richard-donner-dies-91-1991131,"Superman, Lethal Weapon, Goonies director Richard Donner dies at 91","Filmmaker Richard Donner, who helped create the modern superhero blockbuster with 1978’s Superman and mastered the buddy comedy with the Lethal Weapon franchise, has died. He was 91. Donner died on Monday (Jul 5) in Los Angeles, his family said through a spokesperson. Donner gained fame with his first feature, 1976’s The Omen. A then-unheard-of offer followed: US$1 million to direct 1978’s Superman. Donner channelled his love of the character into making the film, repeatedly facing off with producers over the need for special effects that would convince the audience that a superhero could really fly. In the title role, Donner cast Christopher Reeve, who was associated with Superman for the rest of his life. By the 21st century, the genre was dominating the box office in the US and thriving overseas. The heads of Marvel Studios and DC Entertainment – producers of most of today’s superhero fare – both worked for Donner when they were starting out in Hollywood. Steven Spielberg, who produced The Goonies, wrote in a statement that, “Dick had such a powerful command of his movies, and was so gifted across so many genres. Being in his circle was akin to hanging out with your favourite coach, smartest professor, fiercest motivator, most endearing friend, staunchest ally, and – of course – the greatest Goonie of all. He was all kid. All heart. All the time. I can’t believe he’s gone, but his husky, hearty laugh will stay with me always.” Tributes also poured in on Twitter on Monday, including from Goonies star Sean Astin. “Richard Donner had the biggest, boomiest voice you could imagine,” Astin wrote. “He commanded attention and he laughed like no man has ever laughed before. Dick was so much fun. What I perceived in him, as a 12 year old kid, is that he cared. I love how much he cared.” Director Kevin Smith tweeted that, ""Richard Donner made the devil a child in The Omen, invented the modern day comic book movie with Superman, and reinvented the buddy cop movie with Lethal Weapon. I got to meet with him last year about a project. Guy was a natural born storyteller. Thanks for all the flicks, Dick!” Filmmaker Edgar Wright added, “Richard Donner’s big heart & effervescent charm shone in his movies through the remarkable performances of his cast, which is no mean feat. You remember all the characters in Superman, Lethal Weapon, The Goonies & more, because Donner knew how to capture that magic onscreen.” Wright said he only met Donner once but said, “He was funny, charming and so full of stories (and happy to indulge my geeky questions).” Donner followed Superman with an indie, Inside Moves, in 1980 and The Toy with Richard Pryor in 1982. In 1985, he made the kids’ adventure classic The Goonies and Ladyhawke, which would introduce him to his future wife, Lauren Shuler Donner. The two married the following year. In 1993, they founded The Donners Company, which has produced such hits as Deadpool, The Wolverine and the X-Men franchise. Adjusted for inflation, his films have generated more than US$1 billion in box office receipts. “Let me tell you: Dick Donner directing is truly the sexiest man alive,” Shuler Donner said at a film academy tribute to the director in 2017. She said a director’s personality often reveals itself onscreen. “If you look at Dick’s movies, Dick is fun, larger than life, loud, strong, with a big mushy heart,” she said. “His confidence, his fearlessness, his humour are what make people adore him and has wrapped around me like a protective cloak. “The combination of learning moviemaking from Richard Donner and falling in love with him has made me personally and professionally a better producer and a happier, loving person,” she continued, calling Ladyhawke their “personal love story”. “I’m the hawk and he’s the wolf,” she said. In 1987, Donner cast Mel Gibson and Danny Glover as a mismatched police pair in the buddy-cop action film Lethal Weapon. The film was a smash, spawning several sequels and a TV show. “He was a master storyteller,” Gibson said in 2017. “He was humble. He had this sign over this door that said ‘Leave your ego at the door’, and there was no ego around him. It was hard for me to walk into the room, actually.” Donner followed up with the Bill Murray hit Scrooged in 1988 and Lethal Weapon 2 the next year. His other credits include Maverick, Conspiracy Theory and Radio Flyer. Born Richard Donald Schwartzberg on Apr 24, 1930, in New York City, Donner changed his name when he set out to become an actor. “I would have been an out-of-work actor now if it wouldn’t have been for the great director Marty Ritt,” Donner said. He recalled Ritt telling him, “Your problem is you can’t take direction,” and suggesting he pursue directing instead. “And because I’d been hanging with him a little bit, he said, ‘You’re my assistant on the next show,’ and that turned my life around,” Donner said. “I never went back to acting.” He started working in television, directing episodes of Gilligan’s Island, Perry Mason and The Twilight Zone. Away from the camera, Donner was known for his extraordinary kindness and generosity, covering college tuition for one Goonies star (Jeff Cohen, now an entertainment attorney) and paying for life-saving rehab for another (actor Corey Feldman). Donner told The Associated Press in a 1985 interview that the young cast helped him through the production. “I never had kids of my own, and they became like my family,” he said. Cohen, Feldman and Lethal Weapon star Rene Russo were among those lauding Donner for his kindness at the 2017 film academy tribute. “You were charming and funny and witty and all these amazing (things), but the thing that killed me is you were kind,” Russo said. “You were so kind, and that’s what makes you the sexiest man in the world.” Along with his wife, Donner was also a passionate animal advocate, rescuing dozens of dogs over the years and fighting against the captivity of killer whales. Though a few of Donner’s films generated Oscar nominations, he was never nominated. But he got his chance to thank the academy – and his many friends and colleagues – at that tribute. “This industry is my friend, and it’s been the greatest gift in the world to me,” Donner said. “You guys are all my Oscar.” (Source: AP)"

The Hollywood stars looked to be enjoying a good time in Los Angeles and were photographed laughing and interacting playfully with one another while at a red light. The photos released on Friday (Jul 2) by Page Six showed Holland caressing Zendaya’s chin before leaning in for the smooch. 
   Zendaya, Tom Holland finally confirm they're dating with steamy car makeout https://t.co/kIde61l93Y pic.twitter.com/Uqgc1Tl3nC Naturally, the Internet was overjoyed at the possibility of the pair getting together in real life, christening the couple “Tomdaya”. Rumours of a romance between the two have been heating up since 2017, after they became co-stars in the hit Marvel movie Spiderman: Homecoming, playing love interests Peter Parker and Michelle Jones. They reprised their roles in 2019’s Spider-Man: Far From Home and will next be seen together in the highly anticipated Spider-Man: No Way Home. In 2017, a source told entertainment news site People that they began seeing one another during the filming of Homecoming, and that they were trying to spend as much time together as possible, even going on vacations with one another. However, the pair playfully quashed the rumours at the time, denying that anything serious was going on between them. Since then, the stars have been romantically linked to other people – Holland was spotted out on a date in 2019 in London, holding hands with longtime family friend Olivia Bolton before reportedly splitting up in April last year, while Zendaya dated Euphoria co-star Jacob Elordi for several months before calling it quits as well. While neither one has confirmed any recent relationship rumours, fans can expect to watch them heat up the movie screens again with their on-screen romance in No Way Home, due to be released in December 2021."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/henry-golding-reach-out-3-friends-suicide-prevention-malaysia-1992896,Henry Golding challenges Malaysians to reach out to friends in post about suicide prevention,"Actor Henry Golding recently expressed concern over the climbing suicide rate in Malaysia. In an Instagram post on Sunday (Jul 4), the Snake Eyes star had a special message “especially for my friends in Malaysia”. He started his four-and-a-half-minute clip by saying that it was a tough video to make but he thought it was really important that he tried his best to say something. The Malaysia-born actor spoke about how prolonged lockdowns in the country have left people isolated and missing social interaction, and how amid restrictions and job losses, one thing that gets taken for granted is our mental state.  
   A post shared by Henry Golding (@henrygolding) “We’ve lost our jobs, we haven’t seen our friends in ages, we’re cooped up,” said Golding. “Many people have done without human interaction for so long, and it’s only natural for thoughts to go dark.” In the face of this, the 34-year-old stressed the importance of supporting the people around us. “One thing that I wanted to tell everybody that I could was that there are friends out there who are thinking of you, there are people out there who care for you and are worried about your wellbeing.” As a small step, Golding challenged Malaysians to reach out to three people a day. “Think of three friends who may need that text or that small call of three to four minutes, just to check in on them,” shared Golding. “Really ask them how they are doing and how they are coping with everything.” “The numbers (of suicides) are very sadly climbing. We can do something about it… Having that small outreach can prevent something disastrous from happening,” he said. 
  Golding also included some resources for those who may be going through a tough time and need help, including the numbers for Befrienders KL and the Malaysian Mental Health Association. The Malaysian-British actor made his Hollywood breakthrough in the rom-com Crazy Rich Asians in 2018. He next appears in Snake Eyes: GI Joe Origins, which is set for release in Singapore on Jul 22. He was also recently invited to become a member of the Academy of the Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the group behind the Oscars."

Smith is picking up the roughly US$100,000 (S$134,000) tab for the pyrotechnics over the Mississippi River after learning New Orleans didn't plan a 2021 show, city officials told news outlets. New Orleans cancelled last year's fireworks because of the coronavirus pandemic. Smith is in New Orleans working on his latest film Emancipation, which will tell the story of a slave, Peter, who escaped a Louisiana plantation and whose photo of scars on his back from being whipped exposed the brutality of slavery. He would also fight for the Union in the Civil War. 
  Smith moved production of the film from Georgia to Louisiana in early April after Georgia passed a new voting law that prompted a federal lawsuit saying the overhaul was intended to deny black voters equal access to the ballot. (Source: AP)"

Universal Pictures currently has the top three films at the US box office with F9, The Boss Baby: Family Business and The Forever Purge, according to studio estimates on Sunday (Jul 4).  It’s the first time that’s happened for Universal since 1989, when the studio had Sea Of Love, Parenthood and Uncle Buck topping the charts, and the first time for any studio since 2005. As expected, the Fast & Furious sequel F9 maintained the top spot in its second weekend in North American theatres. The film added an estimated US$24 million over the weekend and is projected to take in US$32.7 million by the end of Monday, bringing its domestic total to US$125.8 million. Worldwide, F9 will likely surpass the US$500 million mark on Monday. In second place, the animated Boss Baby sequel surpassed expectations opening with US$17.3 million for the weekend and US$23.1 million including Monday. The Boss Baby: Family Business features Alex Baldwin voicing the worldly toddler. And in third place, the latest Blumhouse venture, The Forever Purge, is expected to gross US$12.8 million in ticket sales through Sunday and US$15.9 million over the four-day weekend. Although the three films may share a studio name, they’re also all different genres with different audience bases: A PG-13 action pic, an R-rated horror and a PG-rated family film. Almost half of the audience for The Boss Baby 2, for example, was 12 and under, while 64 per cent of the audience for The Forever Purge was in the coveted 18 to 34 range and also very ethnically diverse. While it’s a bit unconventional for a major studio to open two big films on the same weekend, Universal’s head of domestic distribution Jim Orr said they simply saw an opportunity and have historically had great successes on the Fourth of July weekend. “This weekend is just a great glimpse of what we do constantly. which is provide theatrical audiences with a diverse slate of quality films,” Orr said. “The results speak for themselves.” The varied slate, he said, is something the studio takes great pride in. “We have films for every single audience out there,” Orr added. “We have tremendous partners, with DreamWorks and Blumhouse, and we also have some of the biggest franchises in the industry with the Fast saga.” Paramount’s A Quiet Place Part II landed in fourth with an estimated US$4.2 million over the three-day weekend and a projected US$5.6 million including Monday, bringing its total to US$145.8 million in its sixth weekend. The Hitman’s Wife's Bodyguard took fifth with US$3 million for the weekend. “We are still in an unusual marketplace,” said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore’s senior media analyst. “But this is a solid weekend – “81 per cent of theatres are open in North America and moviegoers had a smorgasbord of options. This feels like truly the first fully fledged summer weekend.” The based-on-a-Twitter-thread film Zola also had a strong opening on 1,468 screens. The film about a road trip to Florida gone wrong has earned an estimated US$2.4 million since Wednesday. According to studio A24, many of the New York and Los Angeles showings sold out this weekend. ""Zola is disproving the notion that only blockbusters will bring people to the theatres,"" Dergarabedian said. And despite also being available on Hulu, Questlove's Black Woodstock documentary Summer Of Soul earned US$650,000 from 752 theatres. Although a somewhat modest number, Searchlight said it's the best performing documentary of the year so far. The successes are also notable for what they were up against outside of theatres. This was a weekend where there were quite a few at-home streaming options as well, with Amazon Prime Video’s Chris Pratt blockbuster The Tomorrow War among them. The Universal films accounted for over 77 per cent of the total projected grosses this weekend, which was the third best of the pandemic (behind last weekend's F9 opening and the first Quiet Place 2 weekend), according to data from Comscore. But the reign likely won't continue for long. Next weekend, Disney and Marvel's Black Widow hits theatres. And even Black Widow has a caveat, despite being the first Marvel movie in almost two years: It'll also be available to rent on Disney+. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at US and Canadian theatres, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released on Monday. (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/vincenzo-song-joong-ki-bogota-covid-19-self-quarantine-1994326,Vincenzo’s Song Joong-ki goes into self-quarantine after COVID-19 scare,"Popular Korean actor Song Joong-ki is currently in self-quarantine after coming in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19, according to a report on Korean entertainment website Soompi.com. The actor’s agency, History D &C released a statement saying that Song’s acquaintance had tested positive on June 30. Immediately after, the actor got in touch with the disease prevention authorities and got himself tested upon their advice. It was revealed that Song tested negative for COVID-19. The statement reads as such: “On June 30, an acquaintance of actor Song Joong-ki was informed that they have tested positive for COVID-19, so he cancelled his schedule and underwent pre-emptive testing. Although he tested negative, he was classified as a close contact and was ordered to go into self-quarantine. Therefore, we will halt all his scheduled activities and follow the instructions of the disease prevention authorities”. It further stated: “We ask for your understanding for causing concern to many people, and we will do our best to follow the directions and guidelines from the disease prevention authorities,” it further added. They added, “Everyone who recently came in contact with Song Joong-ki was also tested, and fortunately, they all tested negative. Due to being classified as a close contact of a confirmed case and going into self-quarantine, his schedule is also being cancelled.” According to the same report, Song, who last starred as the titular lead in the wildly popular K-drama Vincenzo, was in the midst of filming his highly anticipated upcoming movie Bogota when this all happened. The film only managed to resumed shooting last month, after coming to an abrupt halt last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bogota first began filming in Colombia in January 2020 before the cast and crew were forced to return to Korea in March that same year, with only 40 per cent of the movie completed. The team then decided to complete the film in Korea this year instead of returning to Colombia. Song, in the meantime, has stopped shooting while he continues to self-isolate. Bogota is set in the 1990s and sees Song in the lead role of Guk Hee, a man facing many hurdles after arriving in titular capital as a 19-year-old struggling to make it big in the world of business. The movie also stars Lee Hee-joon and Kwon Hae-hyo."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/50-years-after-his-death-fans-honour-the-doors-frontman-jim-1993671,Fans honour The Doors' frontman Jim Morrison in Paris 50 years after his death,"Paris on Saturday (Jul 3) was the only place to be for die-hard Jim Morrison fans. Fifty years after his death at age 27, rock music lovers from France and across the world came to the Pere-Lachaise cemetery in eastern Paris where The Doors' frontman is buried. Many brought candles and pictures, and some burned incense sticks near his grave as police watched nearby. “Jim and The Doors have been heroes of ours since we were kids. It's an honour to be here and celebrate the 50th anniversary of his death today,” said Dutuar Platzek. The 50-year-old fan made the trip from Halle, Germany with his childhood friend Mathias Barthel. The two had not been back to the Pere-Lachaise cemetery in over 25 years. Year after year, the place has become a pilgrimage for fans of Morrison, known for his dark lyrics, wavy locks, leather pants, steely gaze and theatrical stage presence. He propelled The Doors to several major hits between 1965 and 1971, including Light My Fire, Hello I Love You, Touch Me and Riders On The Storm. Michelle Campbell was 21 when Morrison died in 1971, living in Texas and studying photography. Her first “July 3rd” – the anniversary of Morrison’s death – was in 1989. Back then, the grave was unmarked and a fan had crafted a wooden cross. She’s since moved to Paris and has been coming to Pere-Lachaise almost every year, taking photographs of Morrison's grave and his fans, many of whom have become friends. “(It's like) people sitting around on couches in someone’s apartment, rather than a grave’s, just talking and meeting each other,” she recalled. “It was really lovely ... I still come as much as I can because it’s just always so wonderful."" Colleen Amblard drove seven hours from her hometown of Domancy, in the French Alps, to visit the grave. The 21 year-old student told The Associated Press “it’s very emotional to be here, to remember Jim Morrison ... to show that he’s not forgotten."" ""We acknowledge his talent and the fact that he was a brilliant person, he was really a genius,” she said. Like many other fans, Amblard was planning to visit other sites Morrison spent time in while living in Paris, from his apartment to the former nightclub where some say he died of a heroin overdose. Born in 1943 in Melbourne, Florida, Morrison was the son of a US Navy officer and moved constantly as a child, growing up in Florida, Virginia, Texas, New Mexico and California. He said he witnessed the aftermath of a terrible car accident on a Native American reservation as a child, an event that loomed large in his later lyrics and poetry. An avid reader, he was heavily influenced by the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, the poet Arthur Rimbaud and the surrealist dramatist Antonin Artaud. In 1965, while living in Los Angeles' bohemian neighbourhood of Venice Beach and frequently taking LSD, he and keyboardist Ray Manzarek, a fellow UCLA film student, founded The Doors. Guitarist Robby Krieger and drummer John Densmore joined soon after. Morrison and The Doors would burn brightly, releasing albums The Doors and Strange Days in 1967, The Soft Parade in 1968 and Morrison Hotel in 1970. Morrison's dynamic stage presence was on full display during appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show and at the Hollywood Bowl. But the band would burn out quickly as Morrison sank into alcoholism. He was twice arrested for his on-stage antics, including a Miami concert that saw him convicted of indecent exposure and profanity. He received a posthumous pardon in 2010. Morrison made his final album with The Doors, LA Woman, in 1971, and moved to Paris soon afterwards. There, on Jul 3, 1971, he was found dead in a bathtub. No autopsy was performed and accounts of what caused his death are disputed. He was one of several rock stars – including Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Cobain and the Rolling Stones’ Brian Jones – to die at 27. His status as a mythic figure for rock fans has never waned. On the 20th anniversary of his death in 1991, the Oliver Stone-directed biopic The Doors was released, starring Val Kilmer as Morrison. (Source: AP)"

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/black-panther-2-sequel-begins-production-chadwick-boseman-1998446,Marvel boss says it's 'very emotional without Chad' as Black Panther 2 begins production,"The highly anticipated sequel to blockbuster superhero film Black Panther began production on Tuesday (Jun 29) at Pinewood Studios in Atlanta, USA. Marvel Studio chief Kevin Feige revealed to Variety that Black Panther: Wakanda Forever will be helmed by returning director, Ryan Coogler, and everyone from the original cast will be back as well, except, of course, the late Chadwick Boseman, who died of colon cancer in August 2020. ""It's clearly very emotional without Chad,"" Feige said on Tuesday before the Black Widow Global Fan Event in Los Angeles. “But everyone is also very excited to bring the world of Wakanda back to the public and back to the fans. We're going to do it in a way that would make Chad proud.” The plot of the movie hasn’t been revealed and no cast member has been officially announced, although Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Daniel Kaluuya, Winston Duke, Lupita Nyong’o, Florence Kasumba and Angela Bassett are widely expected to reprise their roles. Feige said in an interview last year that the sequel will “honour the legacy” of Boseman who played T’Challa, the king of Wakanda, and the role will not be recast. The first movie released in 2018 made US$1.34 billion worldwide, which makes it Marvel’s highest-grossing non-Avengers film of all time. It is also the first superhero movie to be nominated for an Oscar, with seven nods. It won best score, best costume design and best production design. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is set to hit cinemas in July 2022. Also on the cards is a television series about the world of Wakanda developed by Coogler, through a five-year deal between Disney and his production company, Proximity Media.    "

The group is set to make its debut in mid-July. Skyle stands for “Show the Kinetic and Youth Leading a new Episode” and even though the members have yet to be revealed, the group teased their logo on social media on Tuesday (Jun 29). The members were selected from auditions all over Asia and have an average age of 20 and an average height of 1.7m. The group has been in idol training for three to four years with one member reportedly having gone through seven years of training. Advertisers wasted no time in securing a deal with the girls to endorse a global sportswear label and headphone brand. The identity of two members have been speculated by Hong Kong magazine, Weekend Weekly, which published a story on Thursday. They are said to be 22-year-olds Eva Yao and Jennifer Zhou, both from China and who had participated in the second season of entertainment survival show Youth With You in 2020, but were eliminated. Yao was born in Xi'an but raised in Yunnan, and is able to speak three languages: Mandarin, Korean and English. Zhou from Shanghai, who is fluent in Mandarin and Korean, made her debut in a Chinese reality singing show called Girls Fighting in 2016 and also took part in The Unit 2017, a South Korean idol contest. She was also previously a member of Chinese girl group ACEMAX-RED."

The group revealed on Friday (Jul 2) that the track – titled Permission To Dance – will be featured on the upcoming CD release for Butter. The English track was previously released as a digital single. This comes several days after Sheeran himself accidentally let slip the title of the track when he posted clips of him responding to questions from fans on Instagram stories. In one clip, he answered a query about his favourite BTS song by responding with: ""I'd say my favourite BTS song is their new song, Permission to Dance"". He also said the new track will be ""very dancey"".  Though the title of the new track may not have been a surprise with the latest announcement, BTS ARMYs did get some new information, namely, a look at the CD cover image and the four-song track list.  The CD will feature the hit song Butter, the Sheeran-penned track and the instrumental version of both songs. It will drop on Jul 9. This is the 30-year-old Sheeran’s second collaboration with the K-pop singers after Make It Right from the 2019 album, Map Of The Soul: Persona. He first revealed his involvement in the new track on an interview with US radio show Most Requested Live on Jun 27 where he also spoke about his own new single, Bad Habits. In his chat, he called the seven-member group “super, super cool guys”."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/cosby-show-phylicia-rashad-critics-dismissal-calls-support-bill-1999211,"Bill Cosby's TV wife, Phylicia Rashad, draws critics and dismissal calls for defending him","Phylicia Rashad has found herself embroiled in controversy after expressing public support for Bill Cosby's release from prison, with some prominent black voices calling for her dismissal as dean of Howard University's College of Fine Arts. It remains to be seen whether Rashad’s position at Howard is in jeopardy, but the university quickly distanced itself from her comments. Rashad, who played Cosby's wife for years on the family sitcom The Cosby Show, was named dean of the college with great fanfare this year. Cosby was released from prison on Wednesday (Jun 30) after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturned his sexual assault conviction, ruling that Cosby’s agreement with the previous district attorney in 2005 should have prevented him from being charged in the 2018 case. After the ruling, Rashad tweeted a picture of Cosby, with the message: “FINALLY!!!! A terrible wrong is being righted – a miscarriage of justice is corrected!” The tweet drew an immediate online response with a few expressing support but many others attacking Rashad for defending a man accused of drugging and raping multiple women over a period of decades. Some of the harshest critics called for Rashad to be removed from her post, saying her apparent indifference to serial sexual assault allegations made her unfit for a position of authority over students. Jelani Cobb, a Columbia University journalism professor and frequent New Yorker magazine contributor, tweeted directly to Howard University, bluntly stating: “This person should not be a Dean”. Rashad's support for Cosby is not new. She had publicly defended him during his years-long legal battles. But the rise of the #Metoo movement and her new position at a prominent educational institution have contributed to the intense backlash as Cosby goes free. Hours after her tweet on Wednesday, Rashad sent out a clarification, stating her sympathy for all survivors of sexual assault but not mentioning Cosby or his case. “I fully support survivors of sexual assault coming forward. My post was in no way intended to be insensitive to their truth,"" she wrote. ""Personally, I know from friends and family that such abuse has lifelong residual effects. My heartfelt wish is for healing.” In a statement, Howard acknowledged Rashad's clarification and said her initial tweet “lacked sensitivity towards survivors of sexual assault. Personal positions of University leadership do not reflect Howard University's policies. We will continue to advocate for survivors fully and advocate their right to be heard"". Rashad is a prominent Howard alumnus, and her appointment as fine arts dean was hailed as a homecoming, with Howard Provost Anthony K Wutoh stating that her “passion for the arts and student success makes her a perfect fit for this role”. Cosby, 83, had served nearly three years of a three-to-10-year sentence for drugging and violating Temple University sports administrator Andrea Constand in 2004. After his release, he tweeted that he has always maintained his innocence and thanked his fans, supporters and friends who stood by him. (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/sharon-au-shares-sweet-note-to-mum-instagram-2001876,'The greatest love of all’: Sharon Au shares sweet note to mum after being reunited,"One of the most challenging things to do during the pandemic is travelling. From having to go through endless swab tests to being in quarantine for weeks, you would probably have a very good reason to travel. And for Sharon Au, that reason is her mother. The former actress-host, who's based in Paris as an investment director, spent 18 days at Royal Plaza on Scotts for her stay-home notice, where she evidently found lots of content for her Instagram feed with videos of her playing the violin, guitar and piano; singing and dancing ballet to Swan Lake. Sharon has since reunited with her mum and on Wednesday (Jun 30), the 45-year-old posted a picture of the two of them together. She captioned it: “The greatest love of all. My Mother. She has never imposed her dreams nor her fears on me. She never says ‘I told you so’. She lets me fly. She sets me free from all expectations. I love you mum”. Can it get any sweeter? Sharon first mentioned flying back for her mum in early June. On Jun 6, she posted a picture of herself with her luggage at an airport in Paris and said, “I’m flying home to see you Mum. Sorry to keep you waiting for so long”. 
  Two days later, she shared a video call screenshot of her and her mother while she was in quarantine. “I think Mum is happy to see me! She is the reason I flew back but I have to settle for FaceTime for now. 21 days of quarantine is most necessary to protect my loved ones.” Now that mother and daughter have reunited, maybe we can see Mum in some of Sharon’s performances?"

I couldn’t be more grateful and happy (and tired) we are all so excited to welcome Daniella into our family.” She added that she’s sending everyone “love and health”. The actress first revealed that she was expecting in a Mar 1 Instagram post, which she captioned, “Here we go again”, to go with a photo of her husband and kids placing their hands on her tummy. She revealed during an interview with talk show host Jimmy Kimmel in April that she had to explain about the birds and the bees to daughter Maya in a ""PG way"".  ""So we explained the PG way, you know – 'Mummy and Daddy had a big hug, Papa planted a seed in Mummy's tummy’.” Gadot and Varsano have been married since September 2008."

That’s just my culture. That’s my home country. That’s exactly how I look now.” London, who has more than 330,000 followers on Instagram, also said they now wanted to be known as Jimin. “And I also identify as Jimin, that’s my Korean name.” In the video, which has been viewed more than 240,000 times, the influencer said they had just gone through a facelift, brow lift, temple lift, eye surgery and a teeth procedure.  The 31-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation with one Twitter user writing, “You can be non binary that’s who you are but you are not and you will never be Korean”. Another person tweeted that “being Korean is a nationality, not a gender” and that London was “making fun of all the non-binary umbrella, the neo pronouns and the entire lgbtqa + community”. London, who said in the video that they had lived in Korea and spoke the language, made a statement to UK’s Sky News: “I’m not about negativity or sparking controversy. At the end of the day I’m a human being living in my truth. It’s an unfortunate reality for so many to have to hide who they truly are.” Since revealing their new identity, the influencer told TMZ that they had been receiving death threats and that they're scared for their life.  Daily Mail reported that in January 2020, London got married to a cardboard cut-out of the real Jimin in a Las Vegas chapel."

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/princess-diana-legacy-lingers-fans-mark-late-royal-60th-birthday-1931311,Princess Diana's legacy lingers as fans mark late royal's 60th birthday,"Most people wouldn't volunteer to walk through a minefield. Princess Diana did it twice. On Jan 15, 1997, Diana walked gingerly down a narrow path cleared through an Angolan minefield, wearing a protective visor and flak jacket emblazoned with the name of The HALO Trust, a group devoted to removing mines from former war zones. When she realised some of the photographers accompanying her didn't get the shot, she turned around and did it again. Later, she met with a group of landmine victims. A young girl who had lost her left leg perched on the princess's lap. The images of that day appeared in newspapers and on TV sets around the globe, focusing international attention on the then-languishing campaign to rid the world of devices that lurk underground for decades after conflicts end. Today, a treaty banning landmines has 164 signatories. Those touched by the life of the preschool teacher turned princess remembered her ahead of what would have been her 60th birthday on Thursday (Jul 1), recalling the complicated royal rebel who left an enduring imprint on the House of Windsor. Diana had the ""emotional intelligence that allowed her to see that bigger picture … but also to bring it right down to individual human beings,"" said James Cowan, a retired major general who is now CEO of The HALO Trust. ""She knew that she could reach their hearts in a way that would outmaneuver those who would only be an influence through the head."" Diana's walk among the landmines seven months before she died in a Paris car crash is just one example of how she helped make the monarchy more accessible, changing the way the royal family related to people. By interacting more intimately with the public – kneeling to the level of a child, sitting on the edge of a patient's hospital bed, writing personal notes to her fans – she connected with people in a way that inspired other royals, including her sons, Princes William and Harry, as the monarchy worked to become more human and remain relevant in the 21st century. Diana didn't invent the idea of royals visiting the poor, destitute or downtrodden. Queen Elizabeth II herself visited a Nigerian leper colony in 1956. But Diana touched them – literally. ""Diana was a real hugger in the royal family,'' said Sally Bedell Smith, author of Diana In Search Of Herself. ""She was much more visibly tactile in the way she interacted with people. It was not something the queen was comfortable with and still is not.'' Critically, she also knew that those interactions could bring attention to her causes since she was followed everywhere by photographers and TV crews.  Ten years before she embraced landmine victims in Angola, she shook hands with a young AIDS patient in London during the early days of the epidemic, showing people that the disease couldn't be transmitted through touch. As her marriage to Prince Charles deteriorated, Diana used the same techniques to tell her side of the story. Embracing her children with open arms to show her love for her sons. Sitting alone in front of the Taj Mahal on a royal trip to India. Walking through that minefield as she was starting a new life after her divorce. ""Diana understood the power of imagery – and she knew that a photograph was worth a hundred words,'' said Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine and author of Diana: An Intimate Portrait. ""She wasn't an intellectual. She wasn't ever going to be the one to give the right words. But she gave the right image."" And that began on the day the 20-year-old Lady Diana Spencer married Prince Charles, the heir to throne, on Jul 29, 1981, at St Paul's Cathedral.  Elizabeth Emanuel, who co-designed her wedding dress, describes an event comparable to the transformation of a chrysalis into a butterfly, or in this case a nursery school teacher in cardigans and sensible skirts into a fairytale princess. ""We thought, right, let's do the biggest, most dramatic dress possible, the ultimate fairytale dress. Let's make it big. Let's have big sleeves. Let's have ruffles,"" Emanuel said. ""And St Paul's was so huge. We knew that we needed to do something that was a statement. And Diana was completely up for that. She loved that idea."" But Emanuel said Diana also had a simplicity that made her more accessible to people. ""She had this vulnerability about her, I think, so that ordinary people could relate to her. She wasn't perfect. And none of us are perfect, and I think that's why there is this thing, you know, people think of her almost like family. They felt they knew her."" Diana's sons learned from their mother's example, making more personal connections with the public during their charitable work, including supporting efforts to destigmatise mental health problems and treat young AIDS patients in Lesotho and Botswana. William, who is second in line to the throne, worked as an air ambulance pilot before taking on full-time royal duties. Harry retraced Diana's footsteps through the minefield for The HALO Trust. Her influence can be seen in other royals as well. Sophie, the Countess of Wessex and the wife of Charles' brother Prince Edward, grew teary, for example, in a television interview as she told the nation about her feelings on the death of her father-in-law, Prince Philip. The public even began to see a different side of the queen, including her turn as a Bond girl during the 2012 London Olympics in which she starred in a mini-movie with Daniel Craig to open the games.  More recently, the monarch has reached out in Zoom calls, joking with school children about her meeting with Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. What was he like, ma'am? ""Russian,"" she said flatly. The Zoom filled with chuckles. Cowan, of HALO, said the attention that Diana, and now Harry, have brought to the landmine issue helped attract the funding that made it possible for thousands of workers to continue the slow process of ridding the world of the devices.  Sixty countries and territories are still contaminated with landmines, which killed or injured more than 5,500 people in 2019, according to Landmine Monitor. ""She had that capacity to reach out and inspire people. Their imaginations were fired up by this work,"" Cowan said. ""And they like it and they want to fund it. And that's why she's had such a profound legacy for us."" (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/chris-pratt-tomorrow-war-amazon-prime-video-1932826,Hollywood star Chris Pratt rises to a blockbuster challenge: Originality,"Chris Pratt may be a loyal star of two of the biggest movie franchises of the moment, between Marvel and Jurassic World, but even he craves something different sometimes. “I heard the grumblings that people were getting tired of those things,” said Pratt in a recent interview. “I felt inclined to try to do something original.” That’s when Zach Dean’s script for what would become The Tomorrow War, which debuts on Amazon Prime Video on Friday (Jul 2), ended up in his hands. It wasn’t based on a toy or a comic book or a theme park ride. There was no “brand” attached to it or even a bestseller sticker. Then titled “Ghost Draft”, it was a dark and emotional sci-fi action epic about a generation of people who get drafted to go 30 years in the future to fight a losing war against aliens. And the production company Skydance was already on board. But they needed a name, and Pratt has found himself in a rare position in Hollywood where his involvement alone can get a movie off the ground. So, he attached himself to star as Dan Forester, a scientist and father of a young daughter, who gets drafted for the dangerous mission. Pratt also decided he’d serve as an executive producer for the first time, too, meaning he got to be involved in casting, script notes and some creative decisions. And there was a problem they needed to deal with immediately: “Ghost Draft” was way too dark. “It was Children Of Men and then some,” said director Chris McKay. “It made Children Of Men look like a comedy,” Pratt added. If they were going to get more than US$20 million (S$26.9 million) to make it and feasibly attract the whole family to a theatre, they’d need to lighten it up a little: Less hopeless dystopia, more Independence Day. It’s part of the reason Robot Chicken alum McKay, who also directed The LEGO Batman Movie, cast people like Veep’s Sam Richardson, Mr Show’s Mary Lynn Rajskub and The Birthday Boys’ Mike Mitchell in supporting roles. They are, he said, “comedy generators”. “I like movies like Aliens where you’ve got suspense, you’ve got action, but you’ve also got people who are having real human reactions to things and there’s situational or character-based humour,” McKay said. And there’s the dramatic element of the family stakes with an estranged father (JK Simmons) and a loving family (Betty Gilpin and Ryan Kiera Armstrong) he’s leaving behind unwillingly. For McKay, who is making his live-action directorial debut, the opportunity to blend scope and heart was a dream. “I was a genre kid. I grew up on John Carpenter, Steven Spielberg, Joe Dante, George Miller, Kathryn Bigelow, James Cameron. Those are the movies that made me want to be a filmmaker,” he said. “(This) has it has a scale of the kinds of things that I loved as a kid.” And he and Pratt got to go all-out, having their ""Star Wars in Tunisia” moment, shooting on location on oil rigs and glaciers instead of primarily on studio lots in front of green screens. It didn’t make things any easier on them: In Iceland, they got the distinction of being the first people ever to put a crane on one of the glaciers, only feet away from a particularly harrowing cliff’s edge with a 3,000ft drop. But they hope it gives the film a different feel than something entirely generated on the computer. If it seems a little epic for a streaming service, it’s because it is (or at least an outlier). The Tomorrow War was, up until the postproduction phase, going to be a big theatrical release from Paramount Pictures. But like many studio films during the pandemic, it was sold to Amazon (this one in a deal worth a reported US$200 million). McKay said great pains were taken to ensure that the sound mix and colouring would feel as close to a theatrical release as possible. He likes that Amazon subscribers all over the world will have immediate access to it on Friday.     Pratt is back in Los Angeles with his wife, Katherine Schwarzenegger, and 10-month-old daughter after spending much of last year shooting Jurassic World: Dominion in the UK. And he’s proud of The Tomorrow War and being in a position to help films that he wants to see get made. “I feel a little bit more like it’s my baby in a way than I do on other films,” he said. “For so long, any role that I got was the result of someone else saying yes to me. Now I’m in this rare space where if I’m doing a role, it’s because I’ve said yes. And that is really cool. And I don’t know how long that will last or when it will end, but until it does I’m going to do the things that I want to do. And this is a perfect example of the kind of thing that I wanted to do. It’s big and commercial. And it’s fun and it’s moving,” Pratt added. “We want to make a big splash and we want people to think that this is the coolest movie they’ve seen in years. And I think that’s what we did.” (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/edmund-chen-shares-story-of-how-son-yixi-almost-lost-eye-1934131,'My mind went blank': Edmund Chen shares story of how son Yixi almost lost an eye,"It doesn’t matter who you are, it’s never easy for any parent to hear that their child has to undergo a serious surgery. Veteran actors Edmund Chen and Xiang Yun underwent that nightmare scenario when son Yixi, who is also an actor, contracted a cornea infection when he was a teenager and had to undergo surgery with the possibility of losing his left eye. Edmund spoke to Love 972’s breakfast show hosts Chen Biyu, Marcus Chin, Dennis Chew and Mark Lee about the incident that happened to his son many years ago, but which still gets him feeling emotional even now. The 60-year-old recounted that Yixi, who’s now 30, used to wear glasses and would bump into things because he was careless. So when a friend offered hard contact lenses for him to wear overnight, Edmund thought it was a good idea. Unfortunately, when Yixi tried it on, it inflamed his left eye. His condition worsened the next morning and Edmund was shocked to see the white in his son’s eye had turned red and his iris had turned grey. As both he and Xiang Yun needed to work, they asked him to go to the hospital by himself. The moment Edmund was about to step onto the stage for his work event, he received a call from the doctor saying they had to remove his son’s left eye. “They said that they were worried that the infection would reach his brain. I thought that I had misheard what the doctor said because he said it very casually.” But when he got somewhere quieter, the doctor said the same thing. “My mind went blank and I didn’t know what to do,” Edmund shared. Despite hearing the devastating news, Edmund was unable to rush down to the hospital because of work. When the event wrapped up, Yixi was done with surgery as well. Thankfully, the doctor decided not to remove his eye, but to burst the sac for the pus to drain out instead. Recovery was tough as pus oozed out of the wound for weeks. Both Edmund and Xiang Yun also spent years looking for suitable treatment for Yixi’s eyes, following the episode. 
  “We tried everything from western doctors to traditional medicine… We spent seven or eight years looking. We even went to Taiwan in hopes of finding a cure. I went to temples, churches, and just about everywhere to try to find a way to make things better.” The search only stopped when Yixi told his father: “Dad, you seem to be having a hard time. Don’t worry, I’ve gotten used to it.” Yixi's condition has since improved as the young actor got a partial cornea transplant when he was in the army and he now has 75 per cent vision in his left eye."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/frederick-lee-brother-christopher-acting-nomination-hbo-asia-1934301,"Frederick Lee, younger brother of Christopher Lee, says acting nomination is a 'bonus'","Malaysian actor Frederick Lee has scored an acting nod for his role in the Singapore crime thriller Mind’s Eye. For those who think he looks a lot like actor (and Fann Wong's husband) Christopher Lee, there’s a reason for that – they’re brothers. Frederick, who is the younger sibling at 44 to Christopher's 49, was nominated for Best Performance by an Actor at the New York Festivals TV & Film Awards earlier this month for his role as a serial killer. In an interview with Malaysian paper Malay Mail, Frederick said that he was “satisfied” and “grateful” for the acknowledgement. He added that “having an award is a bonus but it is not the main source of motivation”, although “if I win the award, I will be very happy”. This isn’t his first acting nomination, though. He was also nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the 2019 Taipei Film Awards for his role as a villain in the 2018 movie, The Scoundrels. It appears he has a knack for such roles as he’s also playing a villain in his latest show, the eight-episode Trinity Of Shadows, an HBO Asia Original series. The series follows a murder investigation and Frederick plays Hu Ta-Dong, a wanted fugitive. It also stars Kaiser Chuang, Sandrine Pinna and Liu Kuan-Ting, as well as Stanley Yau from Cantopop boyband Mirror. Frederick told Malay Mail: “This story is about good and evil, and the relationship is between people.” He began his acting career a lot later than his brother, only starting in his 30s. In an interview with Taiwan’s Mirror Media earlier this year, Frederick said that “Thanks to (Christopher), everyone got to know me even faster. It’s easier to be seen when you’re in this situation”. 
  Trinity Of Shadows is out now on HBO Go and HBO with new episodes out every Sunday. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/richard-marx-memoir-stories-to-tell-1935616,Richard Marx is right here waiting with new memoir – for respect he's due,"Richard Marx likes to gently mess with the minds of whoever comes to see his solo concerts. He'll start playing a Keith Urban or a Lionel Ritchie song and look out to see the reaction. ""If it’s a couple, I’ll see one of them look at the other with this face like, ‘You’re kidding me. He wrote that?’” Then hits from his career will tumble out: Right Here Waiting, Should Have Known Better, Don't Mean Nothing, Hold On To The Night, Take This Heart, Hazard and Angelia. “And they’ll go, ‘Oh, my God. He did that, too? Like, really? Seriously?’” said Marx. “On my part, there’s a subtle attempt to connect all the dots.” If you've not yet seen Marx in concert, he's offering a written version with his new memoir Stories To Tell, a series of anecdotes from a singer-songwriter who has rubbed shoulders with – and supplied songs to – music royalty. Kenny Rogers, Whitney Houston, Madonna, Barbra Streisand, Burt Bacharach, NSYNC, Julio Iglesias, Josh Groban, Hugh Jackman, Kenny Loggins, Luther Vandross, Paul Anka, SHeDAISY, Philip Bailey and James Ingram – all make cameo appearances in Marx's life and career. He reveals beefs with Brad Paisley, Clive Davis and Night Ranger and a crush on Olivia Newton-John. He made a Vixen song sound better with a little sonic trickery – adding someone else's guitar solo – and watched in horror as his band was held at gunpoint in Taipei. “I have got so many – somewhere between interesting and hilarious – things that have happened in the background of my career,” he said by phone from the Los Angeles home he shares with his wife, Daisy Fuentes. “At the end of the day, I want people to feel the same things I want them to feel about my show – that you feel like you get to know me a little bit.” Stories To Tell is ultimately the tale of a supremely talented, instinctual songwriter who rode the wave of MTV fame for a decade or so and then, when the heat dissipated, reinvented himself as a producer and songwriter for others. “It was just about 10 years straight where everything I put out had success. And then I put out a record that I joked went double plywood instead of double platinum,” he said. “It just was like a signal that everything had shifted from me in my career. I remember thinking, 'What did I do wrong?'” He said it took a year for him to grasp the change. “I started to think, ‘Well, you know what? I had a really great turn for about 10 years. And it’s not my turn now. It’s somebody else’s turn.’” He was still in his 30s and “had a ton of music left"" in him. “I’ll make it with other people,” he concluded. That shift also freed him up to be a very present father to his three sons. Marx over his career has had 14 No 1 songs as a writer – one in each of four different decades. He and Vandross’ Dance With My Father won the 2004 Grammy for Song of the Year. He's written or performed hits on Billboard's country, adult contemporary, mainstream rock, holiday and pop charts. Starting out as a versatile background singer, he got his big break when Lionel Richie heard a tape of his songs and invited Marx to help him with his solo albums. You can hear a teenage Marx on such hits as All Night Long and Running With The Night. That led to him writing songs with Rogers and then writing or singing for a slew of stars before the release of Marx's own 1987 self-titled debut album, which would go double platinum. The book's publication is timed to the release of a two-disc companion album with remastered versions of his biggest hits plus demos, live tracks and fresh interpretations of songs he has written for other artistes. Running through the book is Marx's conviction that he has an almost mystical ability to attract and befriend superstars, something that first happened at age five when he met Davy Jones of The Monkees. As he writes: “I've always had the ability to will people into my path.” Readers get lots of stories about Marx's collaborators and how he comes up with songs from a man who has steered clear of embarrassing, self-destructive scandal. “He hasn’t lived a life that is deserving of VH1 Behind The Music. It’s been pretty even-keeled,” said Sean Manning, his editor at Simon & Schuster. “But I think that he is a master craftsman. That’s what I was really intrigued by – how he does what he does.” Marx in recent years has become a social media phenomenon, enchanting fans by wittily snapping back at trolls and intolerance. In June, when a guy got on Twitter to tell Marx that his pronouns should be “has/been,” Marx actually agreed: “I started writing hit songs at age nineteen and the money 'has been' rolling in ever since.” It was his humour, fearlessness, authenticity and self-awareness that led Manning to reach out to Marx just as the pandemic was gripping the nation. Luckily, Marx had already written some pages, based on the anecdotes he offers on stage. “He’s the first one that will make fun of himself,"" said Manning. ""He doesn’t wait for anyone to do that. And I think that’s where you do relate to him. He doesn’t take himself so seriously, which I found incredibly refreshing.” Readers of Stories To Tell will find a more gentle style than his sharp-elbowed Twitter tone. He says he's a private person and was never going to write a tell-all book with incendiary details. “On Twitter, if I’m dealing with an issue that’s racist or bigoted, there’s no holding back. I’m going to blast it. And if someone’s coming after me, I’m going to respond as you can see,” he said. But a book is another matter: “They’re just two completely different animals.” Marx in real life comes across as that unusual creature in the music business – grounded, fair and happy. He's a Midwestern guy who quickly thanks his parents and people early in his life for not allowing him to come out any other way. Finally, he is asked if he could pick one thing for people to take away from the book. “That I’m taller than they think,” he said, laughing. ”But the answer is actually gratitude."" (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/ed-sheeran-has-written-a-song-for-k-pop-group-bts-1937106,Ed Sheeran has written a song for K-pop group BTS – it’s his second,"It’s confirmed: Ed Sheeran has written a new song for K-pop stars BTS. This is his second collaboration with the group after Make It Right from the 2019 album, Map Of The Soul: Persona. The singer-songwriter first revealed this on an interview with US radio show Most Requested Live on Sunday (Jun 27) where he also spoke about his new single, Bad Habits. He said, “I’ve actually worked with BTS on their last record, and I’ve just written a song for their new record. And they’re like super, super cool guys as well.” Soompi reported that BTS’ agency, Big Hit Music, confirmed the collaboration on the same day, saying, “It is true that Ed Sheeran is participating in BTS’ new song”. BTS is releasing a CD version of their latest English single, Butter, in July, which is slated to also include a brand new track. It hasn’t been revealed, however, if this is the afore-mentioned Sheeran collaboration. The 30-year-old Sheeran released the dance tune Bad Habits on Jun 25. He told Apple Music’s Zane Low that he had written the song in January after finishing his album and realising there were “no songs on there that would surprise people”. “People see me as the acoustic singer-songwriter who does ballads and there was just a lot of that. So I wanted to go in the studio and make something that was totally different. I spent a month and just made lots of mad tunes – and this was one of the mad ones,” he said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/creator-cops-tv-series-john-langley-dies-road-race-mexico-1937536,Creator of Cops TV series dies of heart attack during road race in Mexico,"John Langley creator of the long-running TV series Cops, has died during a road race in Mexico, a family spokeswoman said. Langley died in Baja, Mexico, of an apparent heart attack on Saturday (Jun 26) during the Coast to Coast Ensenada-San Felipe 250 off-road race, family spokeswoman Pam Golum said. He was 78. Cops was among the first reality series on the air when it debuted in 1989, and it would become an institution through 32 seasons. Langley and production partner Malcolm Barbour had shopped the idea for years, and found a home for it on the fledgling Fox network. The show was famous for following police, from deputies in the Deep South to officers from big city police departments, on long, boring nights in patrol cars or in fevered foot chases. Its quirks, including its often shirtless suspects and its reggae theme song Bad Boys, were frequent fodder for standup comics and were often referenced in films, TV shows and songs. It ran on Fox until 2013, when Viacom-owned Spike TV, later re-branded as The Paramount Network, picked it up. It came under criticism for what was considered a slanted, pro-police perspective, and was permanently pulled from the air by Paramount last year during worldwide protests over the killing of George Floyd. Some versions of the show still air internationally in syndication. Langley was born in Oklahoma City and raised in Los Angeles. He graduated from California State University, Dominguez Hills and served in the US Army in the early 1960s. Langley was also a producer on the 2009 film Brooklyn's Finest, directed by Antoine Fuqua and starring Richard Gere and Don Cheadle, and on the non-fiction series Jail, Vegas Strip and Anatomy Of A Crime. He was an off-road racing enthusiast and frequently drove in events like the one he took part in on Saturday. Langley is survived by his son and producing partner Morgan, who oversees their company Langley Productions; another son, Zak; two daughters, Sara Langley Dews and Jennifer Blair; his wife, Maggie, and seven grandchildren.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/fast-furious-9-f9-us-box-office-vin-diesel-1937756,Fast & Furious 9 puts charge back into US movie theatres with US$70m opening,"In the strongest sign yet that life is left in movie theatres, F9 sped to a US box office take of US$70 million (S$94 million) in its first weekend, the biggest opening for a film since the pandemic began, according to studio estimates on Sunday (Jun 27). The ninth installment in the Fast & Furious franchise, starring franchise regulars Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez, opened only in theatres and had the widest release of any movie since the start of the coronavirus crisis. The North American total for Universal Pictures' F9 topped the previous pandemic-best of US$48.4 million for A Quiet Place Part II four weeks ago. It was the biggest opening of any film since Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker in December 2019. “We couldn’t be more gratified to see that the audience embraced the Fast family and came out to see F9 in tremendous numbers,"" said Jim Orr, head of distribution for Universal. “The debut this weekend has really ignited the domestic box office and set it on a tremendous path for the rest of the year.” A Quiet Place Part II came in a very distant second with US$6.2 million. But it has now earned US$136.4 million since its release. The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard brought in US$4.88 million in the third spot. F9, whose release was delayed several times, looks to have landed on just the right weekend to open in North America. It seemed to be a fitting film for the industry moment, with young audiences eager to be in theatres for a movie that emphasises a loud, action-packed, immersive experience. ""It's the perfect intersection of growing consumer confidence and vaccinations in North America, with movies that have already been released creating momentum,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. “I don’t think you could have imagined a better scenario for the industry, with a few speed bumps in there. With Furious 9 being really the first summer blockbuster in two years.” F9 debuted internationally on May 19, and has now grossed more than US$400 million globally. 
  Universal eschewed the hybrid approach of combining theatrical and streaming releases, as Disney did earlier in the year with “Cruella” and Warner Bros. did with “Godzilla vs. Kong."" It also came after most major theatre chains have significantly loosened restrictions on capacity and masking. The trends suggest that Hollywood might have something resembling a regular summer movie season, albeit one that starts months late and won't be setting any industry records. Releases in the coming weeks include Disney and Marvel's Black Widow and Warner Bros' The Suicide Squad. Studios are using a variety of hybrid release plans. While the time movies spend between theatres and streaming has shrunk, probably permanently, there is an increasing emphasis back on the big screen. “It’s a delayed start to a summer that’s been a long time coming. To have late June be ostensibly the start of summer is unusual, but better late than never,"" Dergarabedian said. “A big Fourth of July weekend is coming up, with virtually every genre represented, and a week later we have Black Widow, so we’re on the road to recovery.""

As you would expect of such events, it was chaotic. But it was made even more so when a middle-aged man wearing glasses started shouting and pushing his way to get past the bodyguards.   The man had apparently spent eight hours queuing to meet his idol but as soon as the star appeared, the man was pushed to the back of the line as fans started clamouring for Lau’s attention. Naturally, the fan wasn’t happy and acted out. When Lau found out about the situation, he approached the man, patted him on the shoulder and softly said, “Please calm down”.  The star then put his finger to his lips to signal the crowd to quiet down. Amazingly, the veteran actor’s simple gesture succeeded in hushing the unruly mob. The icing on the cake, at least for the man, was when Lau leaned in smilingly for a photo with him. According to 8 Days, netizens praised the star for his “friendly attitude” and that he had “no look of displeasure on his face at all”. Others chimed in to say that “He is worthy of being a Heavenly King who has been popular for 40 years”, “Andy really loves his fans”, and “Being able to remain popular for so long depends on strength, and of course character”."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/creme-de-la-creme-contestant-cyberbullied-fann-wong-jeanette-aw-1938936,Creme De La Creme contestant cyberbullied for mistake made on baking contest,"Creme De La Creme contestant Ean Cheong found himself to be the target of cyberbullying after the latest episode of the Mediacorp baking competition aired on Jun 23 on Channel 8. It all began when the four semi-finalists – Cheong, Angie Lim, Shawn Pang and Yeo Min – were tasked to replicate judge and dessert maestro Janice Wong's strawberry tart.  In the midst of his hustle, Cheong mistakenly used Lim’s mousse base for his tart. Cheong apologised, and both he and Lim agreed to use each other’s mousse – even though the judges allowed them to remake the component. As it turned out, Lim’s tart caused her to be eliminated from the competition as the mousse base – made by Cheong – was found to contain pieces of cling wrap by veteran actresses and judges Fann Wong and Jeanette Aw. During the episode, Wong commented that ""with the cling wrap, it was a foregone conclusion"". Aw agreed that ""it was a blunder that should never have been made. It shouldn't have happened"". Guest judge Then Chui Foong said that the presence of cling wrap can crop up when the mousse is not spread evenly on the cling wrap and removed after freezing. Although Lim did not blame Cheong for the elimination, viewers felt differently about the judges’ decision. 
   A post shared by Angie Lim KJ (@little_indulgences) Those who took to social media to air their displeasure felt that it was unfair to Lim, especially when the judges acknowledged the mix-up. Comments flooded Channel 8's as well as the actresses' Instagram accounts, with many decrying their decisions. Cheong was also targeted in the online vitriol, making him upload a now-deleted three-part Instagram post, in which he said he would return his trophy and certificate ""as the most undeserving finalist in many people's eyes”. “I’m sorry if the outcome of the decision did not turn out the way many of you wished for,” he wrote, revealing that from the show's very first episode, he had been receiving negative comments such as ""shameless"". He added at the end that he didn't sign up for the competition for the title or trophy, but for ""the knowledge of doing more pastry"".   Wong issued a statement on the incident through Mediacorp: ""The two contestants mutually agreed to continue with the competition using each other's mousse and we respected their decisions.  ""I hope the contestants do not get too affected by the comments. The competition is just a learning experience and not the end of the journey. There's still a long road ahead for everyone."" In a separate statement, fellow judge Aw asked viewers to be kind with their words. ""I am still in contact with the contestants. It’s been rough and you can’t imagine how careless words have impacted and hurt them. Let’s be more aware, more sensitive, and more kind. Thank you"". Citing Sigmund Freud, Aw added: ""Words have a magical power. They can either bring the greatest happiness or the deepest despair"". Earlier on, Aw had announced in an Instagram Story that she would be deleting some comments. ""My platform isn't used to abuse another,"" she wrote. Meanwhile, a Mediacorp spokesperson said: “We do not condone cyberbullying”. On the subject of the mousse mix-up, the spokesperson clarified that ""coloured labels were used to identify all the contestants’ trays"". “When contestants Ean and Angie took the wrong trays of mousse, they were given the option to prepare their mousse again, but they mutually agreed to continue with using each other’s mousse. Hence, the competition proceeded and the judges’ decisions are final,"" said the spokesperson. Cheong appeared to have put the incident behind him. ""I’m not gonna mentioned what really happened behind since the competition had already over but I can only say “I’m Really Sorry @little_indulgences!  ""As much as we trusted each other during the competition, I will learn to move on and learn from incident but I will never forget that I owe her this time round"".

""Try to do what you love with people you love, and if you can manage that, it's the definition of heaven on Earth,"" he said, marking the end of his third late-night show in more than 28 years. It's a tenure second only to Johnny Carson's 30 years on Tonight. O'Brien's next venture is a weekly variety series for HBO Max, set to arrive in 2022 with an as-yet unannounced format. The hour-long Conan finale on Thursday (Jun 24) was largely a trip down memory lane with clips of guests including Steve Martin, Tom Hanks and Sarah Silverman, and highlights of specials taped outside the United States. Will Ferrell appeared by Zoom from Boston, with Jack Black on hand to salute O'Brien. Ferrell noted that he's been a guest for the conclusions of O'Brien's previous shows, Late Night With Conan O'Brien and Tonight, both on NBC but with widely varying runs: The former from 1993 to 2009, the latter for less than eight months in 2009–10. ""It's kind of become a tradition,"" O'Brien said of Ferrell's presence. ""It's become (expletive) exhausting,"" Ferrell replied. He then proceeded to perform farewells that he suggested O'Brien should bank for probable future need, including for his new HBO Max series. ""People would say six episodes isn't a lot, but you packed enough entertainment in them for eight episodes,"" Ferrell said. He then lauded him for a string of projected talk show flops on Al Jazeera and Delta Airlines, and his YouTube ""classic unboxing videos"". O'Brien, a writer for The Simpsons in his salad days, sat for his exit interview with surprise HR rep Homer Simpson, who was unimpressed when reminded that O'Brien was a talk show host. ""Wow, a dying breed,"" Simpson told the animated version of O'Brien. ""There's only like 800 of you left."" Black limped onto the stage wearing an orthopedic boot, which he and O'Brien explained was because of a badly sprained ankle Black suffered during pre-taping of what was supposed to be a big-finish action and dancing skit. In its place, Black serenaded O'Brien and his longtime sidekick Andy Richter with revamped lyrics set to the signature Frank Sinatra standard, My Way. ""Conan, you are my friend. You are the best, and so is Andy,"" Black sang, switching up the lyrics to honour ""Con's way."" The host, whose gravity-defying, trademark swoop of red hair has remained virtually unchanged through the years, wrapped up the show with heartfelt thanks to his colleagues, family and fans. He also shared a slice of philosophy. ""I have devoted all of my adult life, all of it, to pursuing this strange, phantom intersection between smart and stupid,"" things he said many people believe can't coexist. But when the two come together, he said, there is a tiny flicker of ""what is a kind of magic"". O'Brien, formerly a writer for Saturday Night Live, was championed by SNL creator Lorne Michaels to succeed David Letterman as Late Night host. Letterman moved to CBS in The Late Show after losing the post-Carson Tonight job to Jay Leno, a rivalry that became a media fixation. In an effort to design an orderly transition, NBC executives in 2004 anointed O'Brien to take over for Leno in 2009. After ratings for Tonight faltered with O'Brien, Leno ended up reclaiming the show and O'Brien found a new home and, he said, more creative freedom at TBS. (Source: AP) "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/cinema-covid-open-rules-watch-movie-film-stream-netflix-disney-1941631,Commentary: Is this the end of movie theatres in Singapore as we know it?,"SINGAPORE: Predicting the future of cinemas in the middle of a pandemic can be dicey. If travel bubbles closing before they open has taught us anything, it’s a lesson about uncertainty. Full disclosure: I am a streaming enthusiast, with a deep love for television. I appreciate how streaming and cable TV filled a gap and satisfied a need in a pandemic-ridden 2020. Stuck at home, people turned to them for distraction and found ways to connect with friends and family. But our entertainment options were artificially restricted due to our circumstances. What happens when we have full choice again? The situation for cinemas in Singapore and globally is concerning. The challenges aren’t small. 
  CINEMA AS THE COMMON COMMUNAL EXPERIENCE Whether or not movie theatres exist post-pandemic will be shaped by the answers to structural questions not in the control of the average person: First, how governments invest in cinemas and the businesses they interact with. Second, how studios release films once theatres can fill their seats. Public policy and government assistance will be key to recovery for culture industries, including cinemas. In September 2020, the OECD published a report looking at COVID-19’s impact globally on culture industries and making a case for the importance of creative sectors in cities’ economic footprint and employment. Two things struck me. First, cinemas are included in the same category of venue-based arts sectors impacted by social distancing measures as museums and live-performance spaces – places countries are inclined to preserve given their cultural value to communities. Including cinemas in this group acknowledges the worth of that shared experience of watching movies in social spaces. That recognition is a good foundation that justifies public assistance. This is especially true in Singapore, which has one of the world’s highest per capita movie attendances, a whopping 18.5 million in 2019 that plummeted to 4.6 million in 2020, according to the Singapore Film Commission. That’s a big and scary drop. Some of it is surely due to the attendance cap imposed for safety. It’s no wonder cinema operators lamented when Singapore added restrictions for cinema halls in mid-May. But the decent numbers last year suggest the audience appetite is there. 
  WHEN CINEMAS CLOSE, THE OTHER BUSINESSES IMPACTED The second important takeaway from the OECD report is how cultural industries operate within an ecosystem. If we let our cinemas disappear, this will impact other businesses. What could that look like locally? Singapore has 274 cinema outlets. Closing these purpose-built venues would impact commercial real-estate. These venues also have projection equipment and sound systems that require servicing. Local distributors and programmers are responsible for identifying, negotiating terms and acquiring films for cinema houses. Local promotion requires marketing, design, website coding and integration of secure online banking and credit card services. Our cinemas are primarily situated in malls with other stores and F&B outlets. What happens when shopping centres don’t have that foot traffic? Many local film festivals, like the Singapore International Film Festival, partner with Singapore cinemas. If we lose those screening spaces, we will almost certainly lose some festivals and the regional and independent films they showcase. Currently, the Singapore Government appears inclined to preserve cinemas until the retail, arts and culture industries can adjust to the new normal. They’ve included cinema operators and their employees in the Jobs Support Scheme. 
  THE RISE AND RISE OF STREAMING The second structural factor that will influence Singapore’s cinema landscape post-pandemic are the decisions studios make about releasing films. Since the introduction of television, there has been a dilution of entertainment consumption – consumers have new choices over how they spend their time and dollars. The number of options has steadily grown - with streaming services the most recent competitor. Movie theatre attendance has steadily fallen or fluctuated in response to these challenges. One-off peculiarities have boosted attendance: A good year for quality films or event films like Marvel’s Avengers: End Game or Black Panther which became a social event. Streaming services experienced massive growth in 2020. But Netflix recently posted a loss of US$20 billion in market value after missing subscriber growth forecasts. The possible cause? The launch of Disney+ which claimed almost 9 million new subscribers in that same quarter. 
  Add to that the fact that studios pushed back 2020 releases to 2021 and 2022 with hopes of theatrical premieres. Studios clearly view theatrical releases to be critical to their distribution strategies, even if they envision a larger role for streaming services. Studios might not have found their formula yet, but Disney+ and the Marvel Cinematic Universe are an interesting possibility of how they might use both platforms to their advantage. Studios use streaming services to make full use of their intellectual property through television series of backstories or intriguing plot lines expanded from their films. Subsequent films then incorporate the TV details, released in theatres, but eventually returning to the streaming service where everything lives as a collection. 
  WHY WE WILL BE BACK IN NO TIME So the big question remains: Will people still want cinema experiences? Streaming has made inroads that will be hard for theaters to overcome. One obvious challenge is comfort. In my house, I have my favourite snacks, no one to block my view or interrupt with their phones, and can schedule watch parties with family. How can cinemas compete with that? What pleasure can I derive from watching a film in a theatre? One common argument is that the pleasure of cinemas is technical. Big screens and surround sound give us access to visual and aural quality not available at home. This is a favourite argument of major directors who say that their films are made for cinemas and that’s how they prefer we watch them. That is true to some extent. But, to me, technical quality is often not the most memorable aspect of watching in a theatre. 
  The pleasure was in participating in a live audience, the thrill of being around other people moved in the same way you are at a film’s twists, sad moments and jokes. It’s our collective gasp when Thanos snaps his fingers in Avengers: End Game or when Spiderman disappeared in Avengers: Infinity War. We could say cinemas are part of an experience economy that go beyond service delivery. These shared emotions connect us in that specific moment and place, creating something unique that adds to our enjoyment of a film. There’s no doubt cinemas and streaming compete for our attention. But cinemas are still relevant, especially now.  If you don’t believe me, wait until cinemas can reopen with fewer restrictions on crowds. Most of us will be back in no time.

She told entertainment portal 8Days.sg on Thursday (Jun 24) that she loved her quarantine period and was “reluctant’ to leave her “sanctuary and me-time”. The 45-year-old, who is based in Paris as an investment director in a private equity firm, flew back to Singapore earlier this month to visit her mum. She was supposed to serve a 21-day SHN at Royal Plaza on Scotts but recent Ministry of Health guidelines shortened that to just 14 days, which meant that she could leave on Thursday as she’d already served 18 days. She told 8Days.sg via text: “The hotel has called me five times since this morning (to ask), ‘Miss Au, are you ready to go home?’ I am not. I am still packing.” She added a laughing emoji to her message. 
  Sharon had been chronicling her adventures in quarantine on her Instagram account with days spent playing guitar, exercising, doing ballet and practising the violin. 
   A post shared by Sharon Au (@sharonau13) “I was reluctant to leave because I enjoyed tremendously the me-time I had. The past 18 days motivated me to be more creative that I’ve ever been,” she said. “I felt safer in the room than out there in the real world. I know it is warped to feel this way, but I can’t help it.” She did eventually leave though, and despite her initial hesitation, a shorter SHN does mean that she gets to spend more time with her mum, which, she said, is her “one and only plan for this trip”. Sharon is due to return to Paris in late August. We do wonder if she’ll keep up with her new hobbies now that she’s going to have less of that me-time."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/interview-with-the-vampire-tv-adaptation-amc-2022-1943866,Interview With The Vampire TV adaptation coming in 2022,"Anne Rice's Interview With The Vampire is rising again on screen, this time for TV. The bestselling novel, which was adapted for the 1994 Brad Pitt-Tom Cruise film, will be the basis for a new AMC and AMC+ series set for 2022, US entertainment company AMC Networks said on Thursday (Jun 24). The announcement follows the company's 2020 acquisition of 18 works by Rice, including 1976's Interview With The Vampire, its sequels and the Mayfair Witches series. Producer Mark Johnson (Breaking Bad, Halt And Catch Fire) will be in charge of developing the books as a “streaming and television franchise and universe”, according to an AMC release. AMC+ is a subscription streaming service. In a statement, Johnson called the challenge of adapting Rice's work “both intimidating and exhilarating....I recognise both the responsibility and the obligation we owe the material”. The first series, headed by executive producer Rolin Jones (Perry Mason), has been greenlit for eight episodes for season one. Rice and her son, Christopher, are serving as executive producers. “We know how much this book and the ones that follow mean to their massive fan base,” Jones said in a statement. Casting wasn't immediately announced. In Rice’s gothic horror novel, vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac recounts his life to a journalist. The film, which also featured Christian Slater, Kirsten Dunst and Antonio Banderas, received mixed reviews but was a box-office success. (Source: AP)"

Marshall took a break from the band in March after sparking a social media storm by tweeting admiration for Unmasked, a book by right-wing writer-activist Andy Ngo that attacked far-left militant groups collectively known as antifa. Marshall was accused online of endorsing the far right, but said on Thursday that “nothing could be further from the truth. I condemn unequivocally all political extremism, be it of the Right or Left”. Marshall, who plays guitar and banjo with the group, said his bandmates had “invited me to continue with them,” but he had decided to leave so that he could “speak freely without them suffering the consequences”. Marshall said that “as long as I am a member of the band, speaking my mind on the evils of political extremism could bring them trouble. My loyalty and love for them cannot permit that”. Marshall said he plans to undertake new creative projects, “as well as speaking and writing on a variety of issues”. Earlier this year Marshall co-founded Hong Kong Link Up, a charity that works to integrate Hong Kongers settling in Britain. Formed in London in 2007, Mumford & Sons have had huge success with their jangly folk-rock and won the album of the year Grammy for their 2012 record Babel. “We wish you all the best for the future, Win, and we love you man,” the three other band members – Marcus Mumford, Ben Lovett and Ted Dwane – wrote on Instagram in response to the announcement.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/fast-furious-f9-vin-diesel-explains-feud-dwayne-rock-johnson-1946061,'Tough love': Fast & Furious star Vin Diesel explains feud with Dwayne Johnson,"It’s no secret that two of Hollywood's leading action stars, Vin Diesel and Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson, had a falling out several years ago, which first surfaced in 2016. They're both stars in the Fast & Furious franchise.  Johnson has spoken publicly about it and there’s even a since-deleted Instagram post in August 2016 where he wrote, ""Some (male co-stars) conduct themselves as stand up men and true professionals, while others don't”. Now Diesel, too, has shed more light on the feud, which he chalked up to ""tough love"", in an interview with Men’s Health that ran on Tuesday (Jun 22). Diesel, who is also a producer on the franchise, said that he had to take a hard stance with Johnson while filming. ""My approach at the time was a lot of tough love to assist in getting that performance where it needed to be,” Diesel told Men’s Health. “As a producer to say, Okay, we're going to take Dwayne Johnson, who's associated with wrestling, and we're going to force this cinematic world, audience members, to regard his character as someone that they don't know – Hobbs hits you like a ton of bricks.” Johnson joined the franchise in 2011’s Fast Five playing Luke Hobbs, which, according to Diesel, “was a tough character to embody”. Diesel added that he was proud of the aesthetic that was achieved, but it took a lot of work to get there and he would “do anything I’d have to do in order to get performances in anything I’m producing”. He didn’t specify, though, the lengths he went to.  In 2018, Johnson told Rolling Stone magazine that he and Diesel “had a few discussions, including an important face-to-face in my trailer”. He said that conversation led him to realise that they had a “fundamental difference in philosophies on how we approach moviemaking and collaborating”. Johnson next appeared in the 2019 spin-off Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, which also starred Jason Statham.  Diesel stars in the latest installment of the franchise, F9, which opens in Singapore theatres on Jun 24."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/explainer-court-conservatorships-free-britney-spears-movement-1953201,What's with court conservatorships and the calls to #FreeBritney? Here's an explainer,"When Britney Spears, who turns 40 this year, speaks to a Los Angeles judge at her own request on Wednesday (Jun 23), she'll do it 13 years into a court-enforced conservatorship that has exercised vast control of her life and money. But what is a conservatorship, exactly? Here's a look at how conservatorships operate, what's unusual about hers, and why the cry to #FreeBritney keeps getting louder. HOW DO CONSERVATORSHIPS WORK? When a person is considered to have a severely diminished mental capacity, a court can step in and grant someone the power to make financial decisions and major life choices for them. California law says a conservatorship, called a guardianship in some states, is justified for a “person who is unable to provide properly for his or her personal needs for physical health, food, clothing, or shelter"", or for someone who is “substantially unable to manage his or her own financial resources or resist fraud or undue influence"". The conservator, as the appointee put in charge is called, may be a family member, a close friend or a court-appointed professional. HOW DOES SPEARS' WORK? With a fortune of more than US$50 million (S$67.2 million) comes secrecy, and the court closely guards the inner workings of Spears’ conservatorship. Some aspects have been revealed in documents. The conservatorship has the power to restrict her visitors. It arranges and oversees visits with her sons, ages 14 and 15; father Kevin Federline has full custody. It has the power to take out restraining orders in her name, which it has used more than once to keep away interlopers deemed shady. It has the power to make her medical decisions and her business deals. Legally, Spears can get married, but the conservatorship must approve it as with other major life decisions. Like all California conservatorships, it's subject to annual accountings and reviews from a court investigator. WHO HAS POWER OVER SPEARS? Her father has largely been in charge through the years, and the stereotypical image of a parent preying on a famous child’s fortune fuels the enmity against James Spears and the conservatorship, though his every move is scrutinised by the court. From 2008 until 2019, he had power over her life choices, and he and attorney Andrew Wallet controlled her money. Now, he has financial control only, and must share that role with the Bessemer Trust, an estate-management firm. Jodi Montgomery, a court-appointed professional, now acts as conservator over her personal matters. WHY ARE SO MANY CALLING TO #FREEBRITNEY? Fans who dote on Britney Spears' social media posts and public statements, trying to decipher her every utterance, dance move or shared meme, have increasingly coalesced into a movement after becoming convinced she was being controlled unfairly. Key were two women who in 2017 turned their hobby of picking apart Spears’ Instagram posts into a podcast, Britney's ‘Gram. It would help birth the hashtag #FreeBritney. Now, even minor hearings can bring dozens of protesters to the courthouse, carrying signs like “CONSERVATORSHIP IS SLAVERY” and “THIS IS TOXIC”. Many say they relate to her struggles with mental health and the system. The movement, or at least its sentiments, has attracted her fellow celebrities, including Bette Midler, Miley Cyrus, Paris Hilton and Pitbull. James Spears has called the group conspiracy theorists, and says those who shout #FreeBritney don’t understand the totality of the situation. WHY WAS IT IMPOSED IN THE FIRST PLACE? In 2007 and 2008, shortly after she became a mother, she began to have very public mental struggles, with media outlets obsessed over each moment. Hordes of paparazzi aggressively followed her every time she left her house, and she no longer seemed able to handle it. She attacked one cameraman's car with an umbrella. She shaved her head at a salon. She lost custody of her children. When she refused to turn over her boys after a visit, she was hospitalised and put on a psychiatric hold. The conservatorship was put in place within days. WHY HAS IT GONE ON SO LONG? A conservatorship can always be dissolved by the court, though it's rare that a person successfully asks to be released. The burden is on them to prove their competence. Conservatorships can last decades, because few of the circumstances that lead to them are temporary. The mandatory secrecy of medical records has kept murky the reasons why Britney Spears must remain in hers, but it's clear that it involves psychiatric issues. A recent filing said that she wasn't capable of giving consent for medical treatment. Even with required secrecy, it's usually no mystery why someone must stay in a conservatorship, says Sarah Wentz, an attorney who specialises in estates. “Courts don’t just impose these on people,” she says. They’re most commonly in situations with something dramatic like a traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's or dementia."" Spears' father and his attorneys have emphasised that she is especially susceptible to people who seek to take advantage of her money and fame. All sides agree, at least in theory, that she should be able to make her own choices if she becomes able. “The threshold is not, ‘Do I make dumb decisions?’ because we’re entitled in our life to make dumb decisions,” Wentz says. “Think of how many intelligent women make bad choices. You can fall in love with somebody and give them every penny you have.” 
  HOW DOES SPEARS FEEL ABOUT ALL OF THIS? Britney Spears has never asked the court to end the conservatorship. And in a recent court filing she said it “rescued her from a collapse, exploitation by predatory individuals and financial ruin” and made her “able to regain her position as a world class entertainer”. But she has sought more say in who runs it, has emphasised that she reserves the right to seek to end it at any time and has welcomed the scrutiny of #FreeBritney fans. She's been clear in saying she wants her father out entirely. Her lawyer said at a recent hearing that she fears him and will not end her lengthy career pause as long as he maintains control.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/four-decades-on-tv-chef-martin-yan-faces-a-new-audience-1957161,"Four decades on, TV chef Martin Yan faces a new audience and a new world","Live from his home kitchen in the San Francisco Bay Area, Martin Yan flashed a smile, raised his cleaver and chanted the catchphrase that the 150 or so people watching him online were clamouring to hear: “If Yan can cook, so can you!” For Yan – who over a four-decade career has played the roles of television personality, cookbook author, restaurateur and now YouTube host – this longtime slogan is more than just a shtick. It’s a summary of all he believes in. If a soft-spoken boy from Guangzhou, China, can make it big in America cooking stir-fries and dumplings, he figures, anyone can do just about anything. Yan does not have an enormous social media following or a list of viral recipes to his name. But his impact on the culinary sphere is immeasurable. In 1982, at age 33, Yan became one of the first people of Asian descent to host a cooking show in the United States. Yan Can Cook, on PBS, was a contemporary of programmes like Julia Child & More Company and later on, Today’s Gourmet, starring Jacques Pepin. His show is still syndicated around the world, making it one of the longest-running American cooking programmes. Yan, now 72, introduced legions of people to Chinese flavours, and eventually to other Asian cuisines. In the 1980s and ’90s, he achieved what many nonwhite cooks still struggle to do today – to get Americans to view the cooking of other countries as something they can replicate at home. Today, Yan has reenergised his existing fans and found new ones – both on Instagram, where he has been posting more frequently, and on YouTube, where he livestreams himself cooking from home. KQED, the San Francisco PBS affiliate, has been releasing old episodes of Yan Can Cook to YouTube weekly since January 2020. His cooking repertoire is more wide-ranging, his style a little more relaxed – and he remains as kinetic as ever. “Look at this physical specimen,” he exclaimed to an iPhone on a camera rig, standing in a power pose before tossing a piece of ginger into a wok to make adobo. “I haven’t gained weight in 35 years.” Yet Yan now inhabits a landscape that is vastly different from the one in which he came up. Food media has been rocked by calls for racial justice and equity, and continuing criticism of how frequently non-Western cuisines and ingredients are appropriated or whitewashed in recipes. And throughout the United States, Asian Americans have become the targets of widespread violence. Yan, in his perennially cheery way, focuses on the progress that has been made – pointing to, say, the ubiquity of Chinese restaurants in America, or the availability of ingredients like soy sauce in grocery stores. Asked about his experience with discrimination, he insisted he had been “fortunate.” But the next day, after thinking about it, he told a story: Forty years ago, he was taking out the trash at his San Francisco apartment, near a lake with ducks. A young white couple, seeing him with a bin, accused him of trying to kill and eat the ducks, saying that Asians like him were destroying the environment. Yan assured the couple he had no plan to kill anything, and invited them to come over that evening for Peking duck. He believes many conflicts can be resolved with a smile, a conversation and a sense of humour. “I cannot change my accent, I cannot change my background, I cannot change the colour of my face, I can’t change,” he said. “I truly believe, as long as we are doing things to project a positive image,” that’s enough. The couple accepted his explanation. They did not come over for duck. Food television is now big business, but when Yan Can Cook premiered, Yan became one of only a few chefs teaching cooking to a national audience. “It was very weird to see someone like” Yan on screen, recalled Hua Hsu, 43, a staff writer for The New Yorker who watched the show with his mother as a child. “You are used to seeing an Asian face in detective stories, as the Dragon Lady, or as a delivery worker or as a scientist,” but not as a home cook. A few chefs, like Joyce Chen and Cecilia Chiang, were already bringing more attention to Chinese food. But Yan said that when Yan Can Cook first appeared, few people foresaw that cooking shows would become a cultural touchstone. He felt simply lucky to be on TV considering where he started, as the child of working-class parents in Guangzhou. At 13, he moved to Hong Kong alone, at his mother’s urging, to work at a family friend’s restaurant. He worked long hours filleting fish and chopping chicken, sleeping on the kitchen floor. Once he finished high school, a church elder helped him secure a visa so he could attend college in Calgary, Alberta. Yan filled in at the last minute for a cooking segment on the Calgary station CFAC-TV in 1978, then was asked to keep coming in. Those demonstrations became Yan Can Cook, which aired daily on CFAC-TV for four years before shifting in 1982 to KQED in San Francisco, which broadcast it weekly. June Mesina Ouellette, associate producer of Yan Can Cook, remembers that Yan “had this energy that could have filled the space.” Before she met him, she did not know how to cook. As she worked on his show, “I got over my fear,” she said. “He made it fun.” Yan also highlighted local Chinese businesses on his show – he took viewers inside an egg roll factory and the kitchen of a dim sum restaurant. Because he spoke several Chinese dialects and understood the culture, “he had access” that a white host would not, said Bernie Schimbke, art director for Yan Can Cook. Still, Yan was well aware of the xenophobia directed at Chinese people in America, starting with the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which banned immigration by labourers from that country. “Chinese food and Chinese culture were not as well received” when his show debuted, he said. He was hesitant to introduce any dish that people might consider too different or difficult. “I do either steamed, deep-fried or stir-fried.” The show carefully avoided ingredients like chicken feet, said Gayle Yamada, a former executive producer. “You self-censor,” she said. Mesina Ouellette wondered how exhausting it must have been for Yan to be constantly fighting people’s biases. But he did not see it that way. There were not many Chinese cooking classes in America at the time, he said. He started with straightforward dishes so he could draw people in and, over time, introduced more complicated ones. He tried to keep to traditional ingredients, but always suggested substitutions, said Tina Salter, the former culinary producer at KQED. “He would rather see them cooking and stir-frying than skipping and staying with a hamburger.” Yan retained a good deal of control over his show. In fact, he recruited sponsors himself, and set his own compensation – US$3,500 (S$4,694) to US$4,000 per episode, on average, he said. “I made myself indispensable. I said, ‘Okay, go find another Martin Yan.’” From Yan Can Cook, he built a lucrative career doing television specials, cooking and speaking at schools, companies and festivals around the world, writing cookbooks and running restaurants in China and California. But the pandemic forced him to slow down. Last year, he had planned to travel to Vietnam and Malaysia to film a television special titled Martin Yan’s Mobile Kitchen, in which he would drive around a food truck and cook with locals. That project has been postponed indefinitely. In November, he closed his last restaurant, M.Y. China in the Westfield San Francisco Centre, because it did not have the space for outdoor dining. Before the pandemic, he was never a fan of social media – it takes up too much time, he said. But he has been posting more of late. In March, he published a photo to Instagram of himself on a communal walk to stand against Asian hate, with the gentle caption, “How’s that for perfect exercise?” It was one of the first times he used his account for activism. “The disadvantage of us Asians,” he said, is that “we don’t like to make noise.” Despite his on-camera bravado, Yan considers himself a quiet person. It is easier to give in to the model-minority myth and put one’s head down, he said; but more Asian Americans, himself included, should be speaking out. He followed the upheavals in the food media last summer, most notably the resignation of Adam Rapoport as editor-in-chief of Bon Appetit, after a photo surfaced of him dressed in an offensive costume. “I think you and I, all of us in the media, would like to see change faster,” Yan said. “But the problem is that will never happen.” So, he reasons, it’s best to be happy with whatever shifts do occur. He pointed to the success of other Asian American chefs like Brandon Jew and Ming Tsai as proof that there has been plenty of advancement. “They are bringing Asian food to another level,” in a way he was not able to, Yan said. When, in 2003, Tsai started hosting Simply Ming on PBS, Yan helped him find sponsors. When Jew’s San Francisco Chinatown restaurant, Mister Jiu’s, opened in 2016, Yan showed up with cleavers for the cooks. “He is like the Jackie Robinson of Asians,” said Jew, 41. But these days Yan is not a household name in the same way as Jackie Robinson or Julia Child, who has inspired an exhibit in the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of American History, a movie starring Meryl Streep and several biographies. Both Child and Yan wrote bestselling cookbooks. Both have led fascinating lives. So where is Yan’s movie? A few of his former colleagues pointed to systemic racism as the reason. Yan disagreed, saying that Child, who lived on the East Coast, benefited from her proximity to the mainstream media. But he also found the question to be flawed. “If the public says, ‘Oh, Martin, you are not as famous,’ I really don’t care,’” he said. After all, “how many people in our business can last as long as Martin Yan?” By Priya Krishna © 2021 The New York Times This article originally appeared in The New York Times. https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/15/dining/martin-yan.html"

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/netflix-penguin-town-1964951,'Like watching a reality show': Waddling into view are the stars of Penguin Town,"They arrive every year in their snazzy black and white tuxedos, causing traffic jams and clamouring for quality real estate. Endangered African penguins have long been a source of delight to visitors of the South African community of Simon's Town, mixing with humans as they go about their penguin tasks, which includes the important one of finding a nest and breeding. Now these critters are the stars of a new eight-part series on Netflix starting Wednesday (Jun 16) called Penguin Town, which follows several of the birds and reveals their personalities, from a middle-aged pair nicknamed “the poster penguins for monogamy” to a young bachelor looking for his first mate. “It became very clear very quickly that this was like watching a reality show like Love Island or Big Brother,” said Cayley Christos, a field producer on Penguin Town and co-owner at production company Red Rock Films. “I know people don’t love anthropomorphising all the time, but it’s hard not to do when they so clearly have these personalities,"" she added. ""And so we didn’t really have a choice but to make it really personal.” The show is narrated by comedian Patton Oswalt, a veteran at voiceover work. “I jumped at the chance because I watched a lot of the raw footage and I was just kind of bowled over how enchanting and sweet it was.” Among the some 1,000 breeding pairs that arrive each mating season, the filmmakers capture relatable characters, including a whimsical misfit they call “Junior” and a pack of troublemaking penguins known as the “Car Park Gang”. “You really do kind of latch on to some of these personalities,” said Oswalt. “You follow all these little stories and you’re rooting for these guys.” Behind the sweetness is serious business. Only 2 per cent of the African penguin population is left from the number that existed 100 years ago. Christos cites estimates that the species has about 10 years left before extinction. “Living among people isn’t easy. It’s not the best place for them. They really should be on an island, but they have no choice. They’d rather face these huge giants walking around them all day long than die,” she said. The flightless, aquatic birds first started showing up in Simon's Town on the Western Cape in the early 1980s as boat traffic around their natural habitat increased. They usually arrive in November and stay for six months. “Slowly, slowly, slowly they realised that this was quite a safe, nice place to be. They weren’t getting attacked by land predators,” said Christos. Initially, the arrival of the colony was greeted with some dismay by residents. “Like any good wildlife, they march around and they poop in people’s gardens. And so I think it’s been an interesting adjustment,” she said. Townsfolk soon realised that the penguins were a tourist draw and a potential source of income. “They really are gods in that town and everybody’s businesses are named after them.” The team from Red Rock Films initially focused on about 80 nests and then whittled the list down to 50 pairs they would follow 24 hours a day. One more cut led them to a final five to concentrate on. Filmmakers used all sorts of equipment to capture the penguins – nest cams, drones, waterproof cameras, special tripods and an antigravity rig. So committed to environmentalism was the 30-member team that they pledged to abstain from meat and fish during the eight-month shoot, eating an exclusively plant-based diet. While light and fun, the series also may have something to say about how humans can live in peace with animals, finding a way to achieve mutual benefit. “I love that the story shows that you can coexist. Even if it’s a water-loving crazy bird, you can live with them and it can be a peaceful coexistence. I think that’s a good recipe for us to take forward to any other species that that we come across,” Christos said. (Source: AP)"

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/park-seo-joon-reportedly-join-brie-larson-captain-marvel-sequel-1966761,Is Korean actor Park Seo-joon joining Brie Larson in the Captain Marvel sequel?,"Several media outlets were buzzing on Tuesday (Jun 15) with reports that Itaewon Class actor Park Seo-joon may be joining the cast of The Marvels, the sequel to the 2019 hit, Captain Marvel. The scoop was attributed to industry representatives.  The 32-year-old actor’s agency, Awesome ENT, however, has simply said: “No comment”. According to Soompi, Park is said to be heading to the US in the second half of this year to work on the film, after he wraps up filming on Concrete Utopia, the disaster thriller co-starring Lee Byung-hun and Park Bo-young.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/luca-pixars-latest-animated-film-invites-you-summer-italian-riviera-1967971,"Luca, Pixar’s latest animated film, invites you to summer in the Italian Riviera","When filmmaker Enrico Casarosa left Italy for New York more than two decades ago, all he wanted to do was assimilate. He wanted to sound American. He wanted to order lattes like an American. He was, he said, “Very shy about showing my Italian identity”. And yet, like so many artists before him, the Genoa-born director has been continually drawn to and inspired by his home country. As an adult living an ocean away, he developed a newfound passion for the art, the literature and the cinema from the place he left behind. Both his Oscar-nominated short La Luna and his latest feature Luca, available on Friday (Jun 18) on Disney+, are unabashed love letters to Italy. The decision makers at Pixar often ask their creatives to mine the personal for their stories, so five years ago in a pitch meeting Casarosa found himself talking about growing up on the Italian Riviera and his childhood friend Alberto, who was louder and bolder than him and a bit of a troublemaker. It would provide the seed of the idea for Luca, a charming coming of age story about the friendship that helps coax a shy, sheltered boy out of his comfort zone. There are a few fantastical modifications too, like the fact that 13-year-old Luca and Alberto are sea monsters who outside of water appear to be human boys. “This idea of sea monsters as a possible metaphor for feeling odd and out of place (at that time in your life) clicked for a lot of people,” Casarosa said. Even his friend Alberto approved. Yes, they still keep in touch. Casarosa decided to set Luca in a fictional seaside town named Portorosso in the late 1950s and early '60s. He figured it would give it a timeless feel and also allow him to reference some of his favourite touchstones from the era, from the films and the music to the 1959 Vespa, which the boys become obsessed with. There are “easter eggs” everywhere in Luca. One of the first images is a boat named Gelsomina, a reference to Giulietta Masina’s La Strada character. Pixar artists also designed their own La Strada and Roman Holiday posters that adorn the walls of the town. A few lucky Luca collaborators even got to go on some scouting trips to Cinque Terra and Genoa during the story development phase so they could get a feel for the place and the uniqueness of the architecture and the cliffside towns. Naturally, it also involved a lot of eating: Gelato, focaccia and even his mother’s lasagna. “They had a tough job of trying a lot of amazing food,” he said, laughing. “It was really about making sure that everybody had a common ground to build this story upon."" The team spent years developing the story and the look of Luca at Pixar headquarters, figuring out ways to make the animation software that is engineered to achieve realism, hit the more poetic, storybook style that Casarosa wanted. “You’re trying to capture texture,” said producer Andrea Warren. “We were adding imperfections to it. Instead of the shiny computer images, we wanted it to look like a brush stroke or the edge of a pastel."" Even the waves, she said, are designed to evoke the “feeling of a wave” and not a photorealistic rendering. It wasn't the only challenge they faced: Right as the next phase of production was about to begin, the pandemic hit. Suddenly everyone was scrambling to finish Luca from home. “We had to get inventive really quickly to stay on track because our release date never changed,” Warren said. “It definitely brought out a scrappiness, ingenuity and flexibility on the part of the team. We were sending iPads and microphones to people’s houses ... asking actors to be technicians on top of being actors.” It caused some headaches. There were lost takes when someone would forget to hit record or the zoom session would cut out. Jack Dylan Grazer, who voices Alberto, recorded his dialogue from his mother’s closet where he sometimes lost a take when his arm would bump up against a hanger. “It was not ideal, but I think it was inspiring,” Warren said. “There was a sense of all of us getting through it together. And although the release date for Luca never changed, it did pivot from a major theatrical release to a streaming one at the last minute as an offering to Disney+ subscribers. “It was a little sad at first,” said Casarosa. “We worked so hard on this movie. We’re so ready to be in the theatre experiencing something together with other people ... (but) we felt very fortunate that we’re able to share the movie with everybody.” “It’s a joyous movie and I hope it brings some of the light that it brought us making it while we were all stuck indoors,” he added. “We hope to give a little bit of that dive into the beautiful aqua water to everybody.” (Source: AP)"

Mok had also changed her Weibo profile photo to one of her wearing the colourful bathrobe from the Italian brand. Her studio apologised on Weibo on Saturday (Jun 12) afternoon for “neglect(ing) to investigate the brand” and also sought forgiveness from fans and friends of the artiste. It added that it had asked for the music video to be removed from all platforms and said that the photo won’t appear in any publicity for Mok’s new album. The 51-year-old singer has also since replaced her profile photo on Weibo. According to Global Times, the hashtag “Karen Mok, Dolce & Gabbana” attracted 260 million views in just a few hours on Saturday with many netizens asking why Mok would wear a brand that has insulted China. In November 2018, the Italian luxury brand released three short videos on Weibo to promote its runway show in Shanghai. The videos showed an Asian woman dressed in Dolce & Gabbana trying to eat pizza and spaghetti with chopsticks as a Mandarin-speaking voiceover says, “Welcome to the first episode of 'Eating with Chopsticks' by Dolce & Gabbana"", in a manner that mocks Chinese speech.   To make matters worse, leaked screenshots of a private conversation with the label’s co-founder Stefano Gabbana showed him making disparaging remarks about China. He later claimed his account had been hacked. The scandal caused many Chinese celebrities to cut ties with the brand."

Jackson, the daughter of Michael Jackson, has a one-on-one discussion with fellow paparazzi target and friend Willow Smith on Wednesday’s (Jun 16) edition of the online talk show that airs on Facebook Watch. During the show's introduction, Smith says she met Jackson on the set of mum Jada Pinkett Smith's TV show Hawthorne. Smith and Jackson soon forged a bond over growing up with parents in the spotlight, and over love of music, modelling, and issues like mental health, sexuality and body image. One way Jackson says she keeps some privacy is by asking people in her home to sign non-disclosure agreements. Jackson, who has dated men and women, tells Smith that while there is tension with some of her family members over her sexuality, she has leaned on her brothers – Prince and Prince Michael II – and longtime family friend Omer Bhatti. “They've always been super-supportive,” she says, noting that to better connect with his sister, Prince Jackson in high school joined a student-run club that unites LGBTQ+ and allied youth. “Not a lot of people can say they have siblings that support them like that.” In 2020, Paris Jackson and then-boyfriend Gabriel Glenn – who formed the acoustic duo The Soundflowers – had a docu-series on Facebook Watch called Unfiltered, which provided a glimpse into her private life. Jackson revealed self-harm and suicide attempts in her testimonials, and said music was a way to channel her pain. She released her debut solo album Wilted in November.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/lee-kwang-soo-says-farewell-to-running-man-his-final-episode-1856441,Lee Kwang-soo bids farewell to Running Man variety show in his final episode,"Lee Kwang-soo, one of the stars of the popular Korean variety show Running Man, has bid farewell to the show on the Sunday (Jun 13) episode. As reported by Soompi, the episode saw the 35-year-old Lee initially meeting with the production staff to create a memorable race for the rest of the cast members.  Lee wanted to go to the first place where they started filming the series 11 years ago, and he also wanted to go to the Han River as the team often went there during the show. He also shared that he had fond memories of the chicken and kalguksu (a noodle soup dish) they ate while filming at his home. Lee added: “Personally, I want it to feel like normal. That’s my honest feeling.” The episode's race kicked off at the same location where Running Man started filming in July 2010 with the cast members racing to help Lee reduce his sentence after the production staff sentenced him to 1,050 years in prison after reviewing his actions over the past years on the show.  At the end of the episode, the atmosphere got emotional as Lee and the other cast members read out letters they'd written.   Yoo Jae-suk said, “It will feel empty without you, but you should do all the things you wanted to do now without worrying about us"", while HaHa wrote, “Kwang-soo, you worked hard. Who will I tease now? Who will I con now? Who will I talk all night with now? I’ll pray for you to shine wherever you are and achieve all the dreams you want”. Lee told his cast mates that they helped him get to where he is today.  He said, “I wasn’t always great in the past 11 years, but I always did my best. Running Man is a show where everyone without exception does their best and throws their whole bodies into filming. I ask that people continue to show it more love and interest in future.” He ended his message by telling viewers, “I am so happy and thankful for the time we’ve shared”. Lee announced in April that he was leaving the show. His agency revealed that the actor had been having trouble keeping up with the physical demands of the show due to an injury he sustained in a car accident last year. Despite receiving regular physical therapy, the agency said there were times when Lee “felt that it was difficult to maintain the top physical condition during Running Man filming”."

The Thor actor sent Evans a birthday greeting on social media, writing in the caption: ""Happy 40th birthday Chris Evans, you’ll always be number 1 in my book”. He even tagged Evans, who played Captain America in the Marvel franchise. Of course, this being Hemsworth – known for his sense of humour – there had to be a twist. And that twist was, he had uploaded a photo of himself with another Chris – Pratt, fellow Avengers co-star who plays Star-Lord in the films. 
   A post shared by Chris Hemsworth (@chrishemsworth) The photo is thought to be a behind-the-scenes shot from the upcoming Thor: Love And Thunder film, which Hemsworth announced recently that they’d finished filming, also with another hilarious social media post. Both Hemsworth and Pratt are reprising their roles in the new film.  
  Hemsworth’s fans got in on the joke as well with one person writing, “Chris Evans looks different”. Another wrote, “Come on… That’s obviously Chris Pine”, referring to the other Hollywood Chris, who plays Steve Trevor in the Wonder Women movies and Captain James T Kirk in the Star Trek films.  For those who need a reminder of what Chris Evans looks like, here you go.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/actor-ned-beatty-deliverance-network-superman-dies-83-1856666,"Actor Ned Beatty of Superman, Deliverance and Network fame dies at 83","Ned Beatty, the indelible character actor whose first film role as a genial vacationer raped by a backwoodsman in 1972's Deliverance launched him on a long, prolific and accomplished career, has died. He was 83. Beatty's manager, Deborah Miller, said Beatty died on Sunday (Jun 13) of natural causes at his home in Los Angeles surrounded by friends and loved ones. After years in regional theatre, Beatty was cast in Deliverance as Bobby Trippe, the happy-go-lucky member of a male river-boating party terrorised by backwoods thugs. The scene in which Trippe is brutalised became the most memorable in the movie and established Beatty as an actor whose name moviegoers may not have known but whose face they always recognised. “For people like me, there’s a lot of ‘I know you! I know you! What have I seen you in?’” Beatty remarked without rancour in 1992. Beatty received only one Oscar nomination, as supporting actor for his role as corporate executive Arthur Jensen in 1976′s Network, but he contributed to some of the most popular movies of his time and worked constantly, his credits including more than 150 movies and TV shows. Beatty's appearance in Network, scripted by Paddy Chayefsky and directed by Sidney Lumet, was brief but titanic. His three-minute monologue ranks among the greatest in movies. Jensen summons anchorman Howard Beale (Peter Finch) to a long, dimly lit boardroom for a come-to-Jesus about the elemental powers of media. “You have meddled with the primal forces of nature, Mr Beale, and I won’t have it!” Beatty shouts from across the boardroom before explaining that there is no America, no democracy. “There is only IBM and ITT and AT&T and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon. Those are the nations of the world today.” He was equally memorable as Otis, the idiot henchman of villainous Lex Luthor in the first two Christopher Reeve Superman movies and as the racist sheriff in White Lightning. Other films included All The President’s Men, The Front Page, Nashville, and The Big Easy. In a 1977 interview, he had explained why he preferred being a supporting actor. “Stars never want to throw the audience a curveball, but my great joy is throwing curveballs,” he said. “Being a star cuts down on your effectiveness as an actor because you become an identifiable part of a product and somewhat predictable. You have to mind your P’s and Q’s and nurture your fans. But I like to surprise the audience, to do the unexpected.” He landed a rare leading role in the Irish film Hear My Song in 1991. The true story of legendary Irish tenor Josef Locke, who disappeared at the height of a brilliant career, it was well reviewed but largely unseen in the United States. Between movies, Beatty worked often in TV and theatre. He had recurring roles in Roseanne as John Goodman’s father and as a detective on Homicide: Life On The Streets. On Broadway he won critical praise (and a Drama Desk Award) for his portrayal of Big Daddy in a revival of Cat On A Hot Tin Roof, a role he had first played as a 21-year-old in a stock company production. He created controversy, however, when he was quoted in The New York Times on the skills of his young co-stars, Ashley Judd and Jason Patric. “Ashley is a sweetie,” he said, “and yet she doesn’t have a lot of tools.” Of Patric, he remarked: “He’s gotten better all the time, but his is a different journey.” His more recent movies included Toy Story 3 in 2010 and two releases from 2013, The Big Ask and Baggage Claim. He retired soon after. Ned Thomas Beatty was born in 1937 in Louisville, Kentucky, and raised in Lexington, where he joined the Protestant Disciples of Christ Christian Church. “It was the theatre I attended as a kid,” he told The Associated Press in 1992. “It was where people got down to their truest emotions and talked about things they didn’t talk about in everyday life. ... The preaching was very often theatrical.” For a time he thought of becoming a priest, but changed his mind after he was cast in a high school production of Harvey. He spent 10 summers at the Barter Theater in Abingdon, Virginia, and eight years at the Arena Stage Company in Washington, DC. At the Arena Stage, he appeared in Chekhov’s Uncle Vanya and starred in Arthur Miller’s Death Of A Salesman. Then his life changed forever when he took a train to New York to audition for director John Boorman for the role of Bobby Trippe. Boorman told him the role was cast, but changed his mind after seeing Beatty audition. Beatty, who married Sandra Johnson in 1999, had eight children from three previous marriages. (Source: AP)"

Labelling it a “vicious cancer”, Kim imposed harsher penalties on citizens who are consuming South Korean movies, K-dramas and K-pop videos. The New York Times detailed the secretive anti K-pop campaign that came to light via leaked internal documents from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The news was first reported by the Seoul-based new source Daily NK. The state media has slammed the spread of “anti-socialist” influence, which has reportedly altered the “attire, hairstyles, speeches, behaviours” of young North Koreans. Kim has ordered his government to crack down on these anti-socialist dispositions. Kim introduced a series of new laws in December that enforces stricter punishment for watching or possessing South Korean entertainment from five years of hard labour to 15 years in a labour camp. North Korean state media warned that if these influences are left unchecked, it would make North Korea “crumble like a damp wall.” Those caught smuggling South Korean content are at risk of receiving even harsher punishments, including the death penalty.  "

Tay promptly hand-delivered a care package to Au at the hotel where she is serving a 21-day quarantine. Au shared a snap of the contents of the care package consisting of a pair of pastel coloured bralettes and half a dozen bottles of fragrances. Au fondly recalls her first encounter with Tay, “when I was a rookie in the industry and had to interview Zoe, she knew I was nervous and made extra effort to be affable and reassuring.” Au also added, “now I’m all grown up and she continues to care and encourage. That’s why she is our Ah Jie forever. Thank you for the surprise Zoe.” But Au wasn’t the only one who received a care package from Tay. Singer Stef Sun also received a similar package. While Sun was grateful for the “sweet surprise”, she was quick to point out that Tay must have got her [bra] size wrong. “Ah Jie you really think very highly of (my size) hor,” Sun wrote on Instagram."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/dining/8-refreshing-cocktails-with-a-twist-you-can-make-1852556,Beat the heat: 8 refreshing cocktails with a twist you can make at home,"Like moving turtleneck sweaters to the back of the closet, it’s time to retire well-aged whiskeys and bring on the clear spirits, fruit juices and crushed ice. The warmer seasons demand refreshing drinks, alcoholic or not, served in tall, frosted glasses. The classic repertoire has much to offer in this category; it’s hard to go wrong with a gin and tonic or a caipirinha. But many of these summer staples could stand a creative update or a touch of surprise without compromising their honest appeal. Detailed below are a gin and tonic with a Spanish twist, sangria made with rose wine and a Bellini buzzed with one of the new pink proseccos that did not exist when Giuseppe Cipriani created the now-classic in Venice, Italy. There is also a slushy Southside, with rum replacing the usual gin, a Paloma bolstered with grapefruit liqueur and spiked with chile, and a spritzer bejeweled with cherries, which always ramp up the refreshment level of a glass of wine, especially red. For drinks of the nonalcoholic sort, Agua Fresca is the Mexican and Central American quencher made by simply adding some fruit puree or juice to cold water with a squirt of lime and, depending on the ripeness of your fruit, a touch of sweetener. Almost anything goes for this drink, even nonsweet additions like cucumbers. The Fourth of July American version would be lemonade, an almost blank canvas that can be splashed with summery flavors like strawberry, peach or mango. 
  Beyond these suggestions, you can add liqueurs like triple sec and elderflower or white rum to make a happy-hour iced tea, or drop a jigger of sambuca into iced coffee to serve with or instead of dessert. Gin in the lemonade is a quick nod to Tom Collins, a summer standby, and crushed fresh berries enliven chilled sparkling cider, alcoholic or not. You can add liqueurs like triple sec and elderflower or white rum to make a happy-hour iced tea, or drop a jigger of sambuca into iced coffee to serve with or instead of dessert. Having fresh fruit, like watermelon and strawberries, on hand will give you access to festive, colorful summer drinks on a moment’s notice. Process some of it, diced, in a blender, stir into a glass of ice with (or without) the spirit of your choice and top it off with soda water. You might consider expanding your wardrobe of fruit liqueurs and spirits beyond the usual orange to include grapefruit, lemon, raspberry and apricot. In small amounts they can brighten up many summer drinks. And for sweetening drinks, especially chilled ones, it’s a good idea to have simple syrup on hand, made by simmering equal parts granulated sugar and water together until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is clear. Refrigerated, the syrup will keep for a month. To serve, warm-weather drinks demand generous glasses; tall ones are best, chilled before filling. To serve, warm-weather drinks demand generous glasses; tall ones are best, chilled before filling. Plastic is often the choice for outdoors, and manufacturers have improved the quality of these, though glass has more class. And then there’s the question of straws. Avoid plastic; look for paper in the disposable department, or some of the new, reusable stainless-steel ones. There are also silver straws, long, and often with a spoon at the end for a posh yet convenient touch. 
  For drinks to serve more than two (or to have refills ready and to transport outdoors), you’ll want a pitcher; some have lids or come fitted with an enclosed receptacle for ice. A long mixing spoon is a useful accessory, and a good citrus juicer is also a worthwhile investment. Frozen drinks also call for a blender to reduce the ice to slush or fruit into puree; there are compact cordless ones on the market that can even go to the beach or on a picnic. And be sure your ice-maker or ice cube trays are ready for overtime.

The 44-year-old Hsu made the announcement to Taiwan newspaper Apple Daily, saying that she was working on divorce papers and that she can’t comment on her husband’s words and actions.

A journey back through the Kardashians as TV show ends,"It's almost time for all those famous Kardashians to shuffle off to Hulu and new projects as their 20-season reality TV mainstay comes to an end. But before they do, here's a journey back through the tears, tantrums and togetherness that propelled the Keeping Up With The Kardashians clan to superstardom: THE MEN & THE MARRIAGES With five sisters and a brother, along with the Kris and Caitlyn drama, the years have taken us through many a man, a woman or two, and a myriad of love tangles. And the action started at the get-go. The very first episode references the sex tape with Brandy's brother Ray J that launched the show and their mega-careers. Before that, there was Kim's first husband, music producer Damon Thomas, followed by a 72-day marriage to second husband, basketball player Kris Humphries, and a third trip to the altar with Kanye West. All three unions ended in divorce. Kim's divorce from Humphries dragged on far longer than the marriage, threatening to keep her legally tethered to Humphries at the birth of her first child, with West. That didn't happen. North West was born two months after mum's second divorce was finalised in 2013. And that's just one sister! There's Kourtney's on-again, off-again relationship and three kids with Scott Disick, who makes his first appearance in Kardashian TV land on Episode One. The two never married amid his alcohol and drug abuse scandals, but they co-parent and he's a die-hard on the series. Disick has become a fan favourite to some as the K family has embraced him as one of their own. Sister Khloe married basketballer Lamar Odom in 2009 and filed for divorce in 2013, but she withdrew the papers after Odom suffered a drug overdose and went into a coma for several days. He was found slumped on the floor of a Nevada brothel. The divorce was finalised in late 2016.  Khloe never married the father of her child – another basketball player, Tristan Thompson. He cheated on her while she was pregnant – and again with her younger half-sister Kylie Jenner's best friend, Jordyn Woods. But Khloe and Tristan are now more than a little friendly and co-parenting three-year-old True, even quarantining together during the pandemic. Are you keeping up? Let's not forget Kylie's relationship with rapper Travis Scott. They never married but also have a child together. And there was Kylie's romance with Tyga, who just happens to have a child with Blac Chyna, who just happens to have a child with Kardashian bro Rob. Does your head hurt yet? Chyna and Rob had a tailspin of their own, leading him to post revenge porn on Instagram that got him banned from the platform. Kardashian stepparent Caitlyn Jenner is OG Keeping Up With The Kardashians and continued to appear after her divorce from Kris. She's the parent with Kris of Kylie and Kendall. Kris filed for divorce before Caitlyn became Caitlyn. Caitlyn publicly came out as transgender in a Diane Sawyer interview in April 2015. NAME THOSE CHILDREN The Kardashian-Jenner clan has oh so many kids, and they're creative name-pickers. Caitlyn has six children with three successive wives, including Kylie and Kendall with Kris. Kris had four children with her first husband, the late OJ Simpson attorney Robert Kardashian before she divorced him, too: Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Rob. Kim had three kids following North: Saint, Chicago and Psalm. Oldest sister Kourtney has her three with Scott: Mason, Penelope and Reign. There's also Khloe's True, Kylie's Stormi and Rob's Dream. Some of the Kardashians brought viewers along while giving birth, and we've been treated over the years to home movies showing Kris bringing children into the world. A 12-year-old Kendall watched herself being born. Recently, during the final season, 11-year-old Mason watched his mum pull him into the world herself. SPIN-OFFS OF SPIN-OFFS They're in LA. They're in Miami. They're in New York. No, wait, the Hamptons. Part of keeping up has been chasing all the spin-offs. Is there a record number? It depends on how spin-off, franchise and canon are defined. But it certainly is a lot in the reality TV genre, and several had various sisters ""taking"" various cities. In all, there were 11 spin-offs on TV – many short-lived. Like the show, they were driven by Ryan Seacrest Productions and the E! network. The first was Kourtney & Khloe Take Miami in 2009. It morphed into Kourtney & Kim Take Miami after Khloe spun herself back into real life to do other work. There was a plethora of bikinis and big boats as the ladies sought to broaden the reach of their boutique Dash with new locations. True fans, especially Scott watchers, will remember the 2013 web series Lord Disick: Lifestyles Of A Lord that was shown weekly in the third season of all that Miami taking. Scott bought himself the royal title in 2012 while on a trip to London and showed off his high-life trappings like fleets of fancy cars while offering tips on how we, too, can live like lords. In 2011, Khloe & Lamar began as the two tried to figure out married life. And there were three seasons of the fitness fest Revenge Body With Khloe Kardashian after the marriage didn't work out. Khloe also had a short-lived talk show, Kocktails with Khloe. Kris briefly had an eponymous talk show in 2013, culminating in an appearance by Kanye West and his reveal of the first photos of North. The Fox network did not offer her a second season. After Caitlyn came out, she got her own show: I Am Cait. It was a serious dive into her transition and whether she was up to being a role model as new friends educated her on issues facing the trans community. It was cancelled after two seasons amid low ratings. ROBBERY, NUDITY & MORE MOMENTS Perhaps the scariest of all developments was Kim's 2016 armed robbery in a luxury Paris flat during fashion week. Season 13 of the series took on the case and the emotional aftermath. She has openly discussed her terror at being tied up at gunpoint and robbed of her jewels. Kim said she thought she was going to die. Among their far happier moments: All those over-the-top birthday bashes, lavish weddings and baby showers, let alone the weddings themselves. Two of Kim's weddings were on air and in the news. Khloe's 2009 wedding with Odom a month after they met was featured on Season 4. After the Khloe-Lamar nuptials, the two bought a dream house while Kim was still in a condo. Just sayin'. Mansion is now Kim's middle name. The sisters are also fond of posing for photos sans clothing, though Kim wasn't always comfortable with the idea. Soon after turning that sex tape into gold, an up-and-coming Kim had a Playboy magazine moment, appearing on the cover of the December 2007 celebrity issue. After an initial photo shoot, Playboy's Hugh Hefner came back for more. ""Does she have to take her clothes off,"" Kris asks Hef in the show's first season. ""Oh yes,"" he responds. They compromised: Kim posed naked, strategically draped in long strands of pearls. Kylie also landed on the cover of Playboy, in 2019 wearing nothing more than a cowboy hat with a shirtless Travis in jeans. And then there's Kendall. The supermodel – along with an entire world of other celebrities – has taken her share of nudes and has weathered a few scandals of her own, though her love life has been on the down-low in comparison to her siblings. There was her ill-fated Pepsi commercial in 2017, when she hands a frontline lawman a can of soda during a protest. The imagery was bashed as stolen from the Black Lives Matter movement. It was pulled and Kendall sobbed an apology on air. Kylie and Kendall were accused of exploitation the same year for superimposing their faces onto images of Tupac, Notorious BIG and a host of other music icons for a line of US$125 T-shirts. They pulled the merch. Fans need not worry. The series is ending, but this famous family isn't going anywhere. (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/conjuring-3-tops-a-quiet-place-2-us-box-office-theatres-1839136,Battle of horror films: Conjuring 3 tops A Quiet Place 2 at US box office,"The box office is getting back to normal, with moderate wins and sizable second weekend drops. After its triumphant first weekend, A Quiet Place Part II fell 59 per cent at the North American box office leaving room for the third movie in the Conjuring franchise to take first place.  Warner Bros' The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It earned an estimated US$24 million (S$31.8 million), according to studio estimates on Sunday (Jun 6), making it the biggest R-rated opening of the pandemic. The film opens in Singapore on Jul 1.  Paramount's A Quiet Place sequel meanwhile earned US$19.5 million in ticket sales, bringing its North American total to US$88.6 million. It opens in Singapore on Jun 10.  ""You normally don't see two horror movies at the top of the chart. But it was a solid weekend for both movies,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. ""The movie theatres are coming back and Memorial Day was no flash in the pan ... It feels like summer again."" The Conjuring 3 has Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga returning as paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. Although there's a whole extended universe set around these films that have thus far grossed over US$1.8 billion, this is the first Conjuring since 2016, and the first to be helmed by someone other than James Wan (Michael Graves directed). With an additional US$26.8 million from international territories, globally, the R-rated pic has grossed over US$57.1 million. ""It's a terrific result,"" said Jeff Goldstein, the head of domestic distribution for Warner Bros. ""We're continuing to see a ramp up of return to life outside of our homes. It was never going to be a light switch."" In a pre-pandemic world, The Conjuring 3 might have been considered a bit disappointing – the previous installments both opened around US$40 million. But, as Goldstein noted, the third films in a horror franchise often take a hit. It has another caveat too: The film is also currently streaming free for subscribers on HBO Max. Warner Media did not say how many people watched it on streaming over the weekend or how many new customers signed up for the service.  
  It has become more normal than not for films to embrace a hybrid day-and-date release strategy, with the major studios using their biggest titles to drive potential subscribers to their streaming services. A Quiet Place Part II had the rare distinction of being exclusively in theatres, but even so it will be a shorter stint than usual before it hits Paramount+.  The Walt Disney Co's Cruella, which opened in theatres last weekend, was also made available to rent on Disney+ for US$29.99 (S$38.98 in Singapore). The Emma Stone and Emma Thompson pic added US$11.2 million from 3,922 theatres this weekend to take third place. Disney also did not say how much it earned from streaming rentals, but the company did note the drop from last weekend was only 48 per cent. Globally, Cruella has earned US$87.1 million thus far. 
  The animated family film Spirit Untamed also opened wide theatrically this weekend in 3,211 theatres to an estimated US$6.2 million. The DreamWorks Animation film features the voices of Isabela Merced, Eiza Gonzalez, Julianne Moore, Marsai Martin and Jake Gyllenhaal. Most family films have gone straight to streaming over the past year and many big studios are opting to continue with the strategy for the near future. Disney and Pixar's Luca is skipping theatres and going straight to Disney+, where it will be free for subscribers on Jun 16. DreamWorks Animation's Boss Baby sequel is also debuting on Peacock Kids and in theatres on Jul 2.  The North American theatrical landscape is still a bit hobbled by the pandemic. Most Canadian theatres remain closed and around 27 per cent of US locations are still shuttered too. Many chains have also said vaccinated customers can now go mask free in theatres. Hollywood titles have also started performing better than they have been internationally during the pandemic over the past few weekends. In particular, Universal's latest in the Fast & Furious franchise, F9, continued to pick up speed prior to its US debut on Jun 25. This weekend F9, which has already grossed US$256 million from eight territories, became one of only 19 US movies to have earned more than US$200 million in China. And although release strategies continue to differ company by company in unprecedented ways, Dergarabedian said the numbers are promising for the theatrical business even with the at-home viewing options.  ""Over the past two weeks, the industry has been able to test out theatrical only (A Quiet Place Part II), a day and date with a (pay) subscription model (Cruella) and a day and date that's part of a subscription (The Conjuring 3). The numbers have been solid,"" Dergarabedian said. ""As long as we keep getting solid movies released, we're going to see the box office ramp up week after week."" (Source: AP)"

The Cannes Film Festival official selection was announced on Thursday (Jun 3). The 74th edition of the festival will take place from Jul 6 to 17.   Chen is one of seven filmmakers involved in the film, with each one creating a short film in response to the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. His contribution is called The Break Away, a 24-minute film, and features Chinese stars Zhou Dongyu and Zhang Yu. They play a young couple struggling through an extended lockdown with a young son. Zhou is known for the film Better Days, for which she won the Golden Rooster award for best actress last year, while Zhang won the Golden Horse for best leading actor for Dying To Survive in 2018. Chen wrote and directed his short film remotely from London. It was shot in China and produced by Chen’s Giraffe Pictures and China’s Rediance. The anthology film – produced and financed by Neon, the US distributor of Parasite – will be showcased in the Special Screenings section. The six other international directors involved are Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Jafar Panahi, Laura Poitras, Dominga Sotomayor, David Lowery and Malik Vitthal.     This is the 37-year-old Chen’s third outing at Cannes, following his short film Ah Ma, which won a Special Distinction Prize in 2007, and his debut feature Ilo Ilo, which was awarded the prestigious Camera d’Or in 2013. Ilo Ilo – the first film in his 'Growing Up' trilogy – went on to win 40 awards internationally, including four Golden Horse Awards. His second feature film, Wet Season, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2019. The third film in the trilogy, We Are All Strangers, is also a pandemic-set project. It is slated to start production next year and will star the two lead actors from the previous films, Yeo Yann Yann and Koh Jia Ler."

In December, Cruise launched an expletive-laden rant at colleagues on the Mission: Impossible set, after he reportedly spotted two crew members violating social distancing rules. In audio released by the Sun tabloid, Cruise can be heard warning that anyone caught not following the rules to stay at least 2m away from others will be fired. The film, which paused production for months early last year along with the rest of the film industry when the coronavirus pandemic took hold, is scheduled to be released in 2022.     (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/shang-chi-star-simu-liu-slams-cancellation-kim-s-convenience-1829136,"Shang-Chi star Simu Liu slams cancellation of Kim’s Convenience, news of spin-off","Simu Liu, the star of Canadian sitcom Kim’s Convenience and whom we’ll soon see as Shang-Chi in the upcoming Marvel superhero movie, has let loose his feelings about the TV series’ cancellation. This comes after the final season of the show dropped on Netflix in the US.  Liu wrote in a lengthy Facebook post on Wednesday (Jun 2) that he was feeling a “host of emotions” about the series ending after season five, and not season six as was originally planned. (The show’s producers decided to end the series after the departure of two showrunners, Ins Choi and Kevin White.)  He also revealed his mixed feelings about the planned spin-off, which will focus on the Shannon character, played by Nicole Power. Liu’s character, Jung, was dating Shannon in Kim’s Convenience. Liu wrote: “I love and am proud of Nicole, and I want the show to succeed for her... but I remain resentful of all of the circumstances that led to the one non-Asian character getting her own show. And not that they would ever ask, but I will adamantly refuse to reprise my role in any capacity.""  The 32-year-old actor also refuted claims that he would not have participated in the sixth season of the show because of his Marvel fame. ""This could not be further from the truth. I love this show and everything it stood for. I saw firsthand how profoundly it impacted families and brought people together. It's truly SO RARE for a show today to have such an impact on people, and I wanted very badly to make the schedules work.""  Another gripe he touched on was the lack of opportunities for the actors in the series to develop their characters, and also that the writer’s room ""lacked both East Asian and female representation” with the only Korean voice being Choi.  ""I can appreciate that the show is still a hit and is enjoyed by many people. But I remain fixated on the missed opportunities to show Asian characters with real depth and the ability to grow and evolve,"" he wrote.   
  He also admitted that there were times that he and the other cast members did not get along, which, he said, breaks him because “I think we all individually were SO committed to the success of the show and SO aware of how fortunate we all were"". However, he wrote, ""We just all had different ideas on how to get there"".  Liu ended his post by saying that while he’s saddened that the audience won’t get to watch the characters again, he still believes in what the show once stood for – “a shining example of what can happen when the gates come down and minorities are given a chance to shine""."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/ayden-sng-renews-contract-mediacorp-despite-rumours-quitting-1829246,Ayden Sng renews contract with Mediacorp: Rumours he's quitting acting untrue,"Singapore actor Ayden Sng confirmed on Wednesday (Jun 2) that he has renewed his contract with Mediacorp. This comes despite rumours that he may be quitting the industry. He told entertainment portal 8 DAYS: “I can only say that I give my word to those who support me that I will try my very best to find a way to stay (in this industry) no matter how challenging it is to me.” Rumours swirled after the Star Awards in April that the 27-year-old was going to quit acting because he wasn’t nominated in any category. That likely stemmed from an interview he did with a Chinese daily paper where he spoke about not being nominated and the article’s sensational headline made it sound like he was going to leave the industry because of the snub. 
  Ayden revealed to 8 DAYS that he was “actually quite upset” about that article because it was “factually untrue”. He added that he had told the journalist from the Chinese daily that although he had reservations about the entertainment industry, it had nothing to do with not being nominated. He went on to explain that the “tension” he was feeling from the industry had more to do with his personality and how ""it takes a longer time for me to acclimatise and get used to what is expected of me and it was wearing down on me a bit"". He also revealed that he got hate mail after the article was translated and reported in an English-language publication.   Ayden didn’t reveal the duration of his new contract with Mediacorp but he did say that his “drama addiction” is keeping him going. He said, “I got to take on a lot of challenging scenes in the second half of (Recipe Of Life), and the more I did it, the more enraptured I was by acting.” He has two other Mediacorp shows in the pipeline after Phase Two (Heightened Alert) ends, namely, a 10-episode mental health project where he plays a school counsellor, and a 9pm drama with Felicia Chin and Shaun Chen where he’ll have a major supporting role. Ayden also revealed to 8 DAYS that he’s looking to expand his repertoire. ""I want to reach a point where I can open my eyes to different scales of production and see how far acting can go. For example, there's method acting, which is not a common thing in Singapore, because the roles here don't really require it, but there are Hollywood and Chinese productions that do."" He added: ""I don't know if I'll get there, but it's something to look forward to and it reminds me not to settle for what I think is good acting."""

The couple, who got engaged in November 2020, have been dating since 2018. Perry, who is 51, told People magazine in an exclusive statement on Tuesday (Jun 1) that “sometimes things just don’t work out and this is one of them"". He added: “I wish Molly the best.” 
   A post shared by Matthew Perry (@mattyperry4) Perry also spoke to People when he announced his engagement in 2020, saying that Hurwitz was “the greatest woman on the face of the planet at this time”.  Hurwitz is a 29-year-old literary agent. They went public with their romance in December 2019 and had apparently split up before getting engaged. Perry and his Friends castmates got together for the much-anticipated reunion episode, which aired in Singapore on HBO Go on May 27. It was said to be only the second time the six cast members had been together in the same room since the series wrapped 17 years ago. 
  The actor revealed on the reunion show that he suffered from anxiety while filming the sitcom in front of a live audience. He said: “To me, I felt like I was gonna die if they didn’t laugh. And it’s not healthy for sure, but I would sometimes say a line and they wouldn’t laugh and I would sweat and just go into convulsions if I didn’t get the laugh I was supposed to get.

Arne Johnson, the boyfriend and later husband of Deborah Glatzel, Carl and David's sister, alleged that a demon left the boy and entered him during an exorcism and caused him to murder his landlord, Alan Bono, in 1981. Johnson was convicted of manslaughter and served four years in prison. A defense attorney tried to defend Johnson against the charges, saying the devil had made him do it. The judge did not permit the arguments, which were based on claims by a couple, Ed and Lorraine Warren, who said they were paranormal investigators. The couple feature as the main characters in the film franchise. Carl Glatzel has said the Warrens exploited his family for monetary gain. He told The Associated Press in 2007 that his brother had suffered from mental illness as a child but has now recovered. “It was living hell when we were kids,"" Glatzel told the AP that year. “It was just a nightmare. I’m not going to go through that again. Neither is my brother.” The case was made into a 1983 NBC television movie, The Demon Murder Case, and was the subject of a book The Devil In Connecticut, by Gerald Brittle. Carl Glatzel sued Brittle and Lorraine Warren when the book was reprinted in 2006, though the case was dismissed. Brittle told the newspaper the book was taken out of print because of the lawsuit. “I did it because I was fed up with the case, fed up with Carl Glatzel,” Brittle said. “It just wasn’t worth it to me. It had no bearing on the fact that the book was true.” The Conjuring 3 opens in US theatres on Jun 4 and will be available on streaming service HBO Max for 31 days from theatrical release. It opens in Singapore on Jul 1. This is the eighth film in the franchise, which also includes the Annabelle films and The Nun.  The newspaper could not reach Arne Johnson for comment. Deborah Johnson, Ed Warren and Lorraine Warren have died, the newspaper reported. (Source: AP)"

He also took the opportunity to celebrate “national don’t flex day”, which we’re fairly sure doesn’t exist. The buff, Australian actor uploaded a photo of himself with director Taika Waititi and jokingly captioned it: “That’s a wrap on Thor Love and Thunder. It’s also national don’t flex day so I thought this super relaxed photo was appropriate”. 
   A post shared by Chris Hemsworth (@chrishemsworth) Of course, Hemsworth’s biceps and upper body look massive in the “super relaxed” photo. For fans of Thor wondering what to expect from this fourth film, Hemsworth is giving it a very positive review. He added in his Instagram caption: “The film is gonna be batshit crazy off the wall funny and might also pull a heart string or two. Lots of love, lots of thunder!"". Hemsworth’s body double, Bobby Holland Hanton, revealed in an interview with an Australian radio station earlier this year that keeping up with the actor’s form was a challenge. Hanton told Nova 96.9’s breakfast show hosts: “Everyone is like, ‘Wow look at the size of him’ and I’m like, 'Yeah, that’s brilliant, I’m that guy’s double' so I text him, I’m like, ‘Thanks very much dude you’ve just made this even harder’”. “I train with him a lot, we train all the time, we’re on the same diet regimen and training. He’s the biggest he’s ever been so I have to be the biggest I’ve ever been, which is a challenge - but I’m up for it,” added Hanton. 
  The upcoming film features lots of big names such as Karen Gillan, Tessa Thompson, Natalie Portman, Matt Damon, Russell Crowe, Melissa McCarthy, Sam Neill, Sean Gunn, Jaimie Alexander and Christian Bale. Waititi directed 2017’s Thor: Ragnarok, which grossed almost US$854 million (S$1.13 billion) worldwide. Thor: Love And Thunder is set for release on May 6, 2022."

The TV personality said she ended almost four years of sobriety in April 2021 as the COVID-19 pandemic was waning, triggered into drinking alcohol again after seeing a couple sipping champagne. “I was alone, sitting by a pool and waiting for somebody to come have a meeting with me. And I saw this woman and her husband had a glass of champagne. It looked really nice and I was like, ‘I can do that, too,’” she said on the Facebook Watch show. “And the next day, I had two glasses. And the day after that, it was bottles.” Osbourne's episode of Red Table Talk airs on Facebook Watch on Wednesday (Jun 2). Osbourne also told the hosts – Jada Pinkett Smith, her daughter, Willow Smith; and her mother, Adrienne Banfield-Norris – about the origins of her addictions. Her first opiate-based drug addiction was with Vicodin which was prescribed to her after an operation to remove her tonsils when she was 13, sending her on a lifelong battle. “That was all I needed,” she said sadly. Osbourne said the drug silenced her insecurities. “It felt like life gave me a hug.” Pinkett Smith responded wryly: “Vicodin will do that.” Osbourne added that Vicodin led to her misusing Percocet to eventually heroin “because it was cheaper”. Osbourne has discussed her drug and alcohol battles before in several interviews, her 2017 memoir and on podcasts like Dax Shepard's Armchair Expert. She has said her drug use became the heaviest during her mother’s cancer battle and after her father, Crazy Train singer Ozzy Osbourne, almost died after an ATV accident in 2003. Red Table Talk has recently made headlines with its interview with Olivia Jade Gianulli and when Pinkett Smith and her husband, Will Smith, discussed their marriage. (Source: AP)"

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/lee-hyun-woo-joins-korean-remake-of-money-heist-1824111,New cast member announced for Korean remake of Money Heist,"The Korean remake of the Spanish crime drama series Money Heist has a new Rio. Actor Lee Hyun-woo will be playing the role in the remake, taking over from actor Park Jung-woo, whose agency announced on Monday (May 31) that he had to step down because of scheduling conflicts with the current drama he’s filming. Lee’s addition to the show concludes the roster of robbers, of which there are eight in the original series. They are Park Hae-soo as Berlin, Jeon Jong-soo as Tokyo, Lee Won-jong as Moscow, Kim Ji-hoon as Denver, Jang Yoon-joo as Nairobi, Kim Ji-hoon as Helsinki and Lee Kyu-ho as Oslo. And leading the team is Yoo Ji-tae as the Professor. Lee released a statement through his agency, saying that he’ll do his best to create “a cool, memorable character and an appealing production for those who are anticipating the Korean remake of Money Heist”. 
  The original Spanish drama is returning for its fifth and final season on Netflix. Originally titled La Casa De Pape (The House Of Paper), it follows a group of robbers – led by a criminal mastermind known as the Professor – who carry out a massive heist on the Royal Mint of Spain, and later on the Bank of Spain. The remake, set in Korea, will also be released on the streaming service. Plans for the remake were first announced in June last year and confirmed in December."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/three-things-to-look-out-for-in-disney-cruella-emma-stone-1420181,Disney's Cruella: 3 things to expect from star Emma Stone,"Adding to the impressive list of Disney creations this year is Cruella played by La La Land actress Emma Stone. Sure, we are expecting a combination of badassery, brilliance and wit in the two-hour live action movie. But if you are looking to level out some expectations from the movie (minor spoilers ahead), here’s what to watch out for.  WATCH EMMA STONE TEACH US HOW TO BE A FEARLESS WOMAN At some point in our lives, it’s totally relatable to prioritise what people think about us. Stone was no exception. In an interview with The New York Times on May 27, the 32-year-old actress expressed enjoyment towards “playing these women who are much less concerned with what people think about them”. 
   A post shared by Walt Disney Studios (@disneystudios) In short, watching Stone play Cruella De Vil on the screen is equal parts inspiring and sobering, as she “simultaneously works on that herself in her life”. THERE ARE NO SMOKING SCENES Based on the iconic 1956 children’s novel Hundred And One Dalmations written by Dodie Smith, an obvious accessory the Disney character Cruella De Vil never failed to flaunt was her conspicuously long cigarette holder. So before you question why it is missing, it was intended to be that way. Disney has, in fact, banned smoking from all its owned movies (including Marvel, Pixar and Lucas) since 2015. MARVEL AT THE COSTUME DESIGNS Designed by 71-year-old Academy Award-winning designer Jenny Beavan (she’s been nominated several times, including for Mad Max: Fury Road), there’s a lot to watch for. “The sheer luck of doing a movie like this is that the costumes do a lot of the work for you,” Stone explained in a video interview with Walt Disney Studios. “Once you put those things on, you feel like Cruella De Vil.” According to Beavan, Cruella is the biggest film she’s ever done. Having designed 47 sets for the film, “it was very important to her for Cruella to be black, white, grey and red”. Emma herself has admitted to taking a lot of pictures on the first day the looks were put together, which she called “a narcissistic day”. As Cruella’s movie director Craig Gillespie summed it up perfectly, “She’s done it all”. Watch the trailer below:  Cruella is out in cinemas and available on Disney+ Premier Access from May 28 (for S$38.98). Alternatively, you can wait for it to drop on the Disney+ collection on Aug 27.

Sheeran got together with Friends star Courteney Cox – who played Monica on the iconic sitcom – to recreate the ""Routine"". For the uninitiated, that’s the dance routine that Ross (David Schwimmer) and Monica performed in Season 6 Episode 10 at Dick Clark’s New Year’s Eve countdown party taping, titled “The One With The Routine”. 
   A post shared by Courteney Cox (@courteneycoxofficial) For their part, 56-year-old Cox and 30-year-old Sheeran nailed it – except for the ending where they toppled to the ground instead of the more graceful end in the original where Ross manages to catch Monica as she jumps on him.  The Shape Of You singer captioned his Instagram post, “Had a reunion of our own this weekend” and he also added hashtags #TheRoutine, #IKnow, #Friends4eva and #ObviouslyBetterThanRoss. Cox captioned her post: “Just some routine dancing with a friend…”. Fans and fellow celebs flooded both posts with comments, with several wondering if the duo had broken the Internet with their post. Big Bang Theory and The Flight Attendant star Kaley Cuoco wrote, “THIS IS EPIC”, while One Republic singer Ryan Tedder said, “Neeaaaaaarly perfect mate”. Model and actress Cara Delevingne, who made an appearance on the Friends reunion special dressed in Rachel’s pink bridesmaid dress and as the Holiday Armadillo, commented with three heart emojis. Ben Winston, who directed Friends: The Reunion, told The Hollywood Reporter’s TV’s Top 5 podcast that he did float the idea of Cox and Schwimmer reenacting the dance during the TV special but the stars couldn’t remember the moves and didn’t want to do it in front of an audience. Watch the original ""Routine"" to see who did it better."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-lifestyle/raindrops-keep-fallin-my-head-singer-bj-thomas-dies-78-1420631,Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head singer BJ Thomas dies at 78,"BJ Thomas, the Grammy-winning singer who enjoyed success on the pop, country and gospel charts with such hits as I Just Can't Help Believing, Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head and Hooked On A Feeling, has died. He was 78. Thomas, who announced in March that he had been diagnosed with lung cancer, died from complications of the disease on Saturday (May 29) at his home in Arlington, Texas, his publicist Jeremy Westby said in a statement. A Hugo, Oklahoma-native who grew up in Houston, Billy Joe Thomas broke through in 1966 with a gospel-styled cover of Hank Williams' I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry and went on to sell millions of records and have dozens of hits across genres. He reached No 1 with pop, adult contemporary and country listeners in 1976 with (Hey Won't You Play) Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song. The same year, his Home Where I Belong became one of the first gospel albums to be certified platinum for selling more than 1 million copies. Dionne Warwick, who duetted with Thomas, sent out a tweet on Saturday with her condolences.  ""My sincere condolences to the family of one of my favorite duet partners, BJ Thomas. I will miss him as I know so many others will as well. Rest In Peace my friend,"" she said.  Thomas' signature recording was Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head, a No 1 pop hit and an Oscar winner for best original song as part of the soundtrack to one of the biggest movies of 1969, the irreverent Western Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid. Thomas wasn't the first choice to perform the whimsical ballad composed by Burt Bacharach and Hal David; Ray Stevens turned the songwriters down. But his warm, soulful tenor fit the song's easygoing mood, immortalised on film during the scene when Butch (Paul Newman) shows off his new bicycle to Etta Place (Katharine Ross), the girlfriend of the Sundance Kid (Robert Redford).  Raindrops has since been heard everywhere from The Simpsons to Forrest Gump and was voted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2013. But, at first, not everyone was satisfied. Thomas was recovering from laryngitis while recording the soundtrack version and his vocals are raspier than for the track released on its own. Redford, meanwhile, doubted the song even belonged in Butch Cassidy. ""When the film was released, I was highly critical – how did the song fit with the film? There was no rain,"" Redford told USA Today in 2019. ""At the time, it seemed like a dumb idea. How wrong I was."" Thomas would later say the phenomenon of Raindrops exacerbated an addiction to pills and alcohol which dated back to his teens, when a record producer in Houston suggested he take amphetamines to keep his energy up. He was touring and recording constantly and taking dozens of pills a day. By 1976, while (Hey Won't You Play) Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song was hitting No 1, he felt like he was ""number 1,000"". ""I was at the bottom with my addictions and my problems,"" he said in 2020 on The Debby Campbell Goodtime Show. He cited a ""spiritual awakening"", shared with his wife, Gloria Richardson, with helping him to get clean. Thomas had few pop hits after the mid-1970s, but he continued to score on the country charts with such No 1 songs as Whatever Happened to Old-Fashioned Love and New Looks From On Old Lover. In the late 1970s and early '80s, he was also a top gospel and inspirational singer, winning two Dove awards and five Grammys, including a Grammy in 1979 for best gospel performance for The Lord's Prayer. Fans of the 1980s sitcom Growing Pains heard him as the singer of the show's theme song. He also acted in a handful of movies, including Jory and Jake's Corner and toured often. Recent recordings included Living Room Music, featuring cameos from Lyle Lovett, Vince Gill and Richard Marx. He had planned to record in 2020 in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, but the sessions were delayed because of the pandemic.  Thomas married Richardson in 1968, and had three daughters: Paige, Nora and Erin. He and his wife worked on the 1982 memoir In Tune: Finding How Good Life Can Be. His book Home Where I Belong came out in 1978 and was co-authored by Jerry B Jenkins, later famous for the million-selling Left Behind religious novels written with Tim LaHaye. Besides music, Thomas loved baseball as a kid and started calling himself BJ because so many Little League teammates also were named Billy Joe. By his teens, he was singing in church and had joined a local rock band, the Triumphs, whom he would stay with into his 20s. He enjoyed Ernest Tubb, Hank Williams and other country performers his parents liked, but on his own he was inspired by the soul and rhythm and blues singers he heard on the radio or saw on stage, notably Jackie Wilson, whose hit ballad To Be Loved Thomas later covered and adopted as a kind of guide to his life.  ""I was raised in a fairly dysfunctional situation and I went through years of intense alcoholism and drug addiction so the song was always a touchstone for me. When you open yourself up to drugs and alcohol at such a young age it becomes something you have to deal with the rest of your life,"" he told the Huffington Post in 2014.  ""What a road block and heartbreak and times of failure these addictions have caused me. But I had that little piece of lightning from that song. That's the essence of the whole thing. To love and be loved. And that takes a lifetime to accomplish. It's always been an important part of my emotions."" (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/quiet-place-sequel-cruella-us-box-office-1421041,Movies aren't dead: Quiet Place sequel opens with US$58.5m at US box office,"Moviegoing increasingly looks like it didn't die during the pandemic. It just went into hibernation. John Krasinski's thriller sequel A Quiet Place Part II opened over the Memorial Day weekend in the US to a pandemic-best US$48.4 million (S$64 million), according to studio estimates on Sunday (May 30). The film opens in Singapore on Jun 10. Including the Monday holiday, the studio forecasts the film will gross US$58.5 million in North America. It added another US$22 million in ticket sales overseas. The film's performance cheered a movie industry that has been punished and transformed by the pandemic. Paramount Pictures' A Quiet Place Part II, which was on the cusp of opening in March 2021 before theatres shut, was the first big film this year – and one of the only larger budget COVID-era releases beside Christopher Nolan's Tenet – to open exclusively in theatres. Chris Aronson, distribution chief for Paramount, called the opening “an unqualified success”. “It's a huge sigh of a relief and a sense of optimism for sure,” Aronson said. ""Movies, moviegoing, movie theatres aren't dead. Yes, they've been threatened but they're proving once again that they're resilient and that people do want to have that communal experience."" Many studios have trotted out hybrid release plans during the pandemic, debuting films simultaneously in the home. The Walt Disney Co did that this weekend with its live-action PG-13 Cruella De Vil prequel, Cruella, making it available to Disney+ subscribers for US$30. In theatres, it grossed US$21.3 million, Disney said, and an estimated US$26.4 million over the four-day weekend. Cruella also added US$16.1 million in 29 international territories. Disney didn't say how much the film made on the company's streaming platform. A Quiet Place II will also turn to streaming after 45 days in theatres when it becomes available on Paramount+. One clear result of the pandemic is that the theatrical window has shrunk, probably permanently. Three months was once the customary length of a movie's run in theatres. The year's previous best debut belonged to Warner Bros' Godzilla Vs Kong, which opened with US$32.2 million, or US$48.5 million over its first five days, while simultaneously streaming on HBO Max. The contrasting release strategies between A Quiet Place Part II and Cruella offered a test case for Hollywood. How much does a day-and-date release cost a movie like Cruella in ticket sales? Is it worth it? Without knowing how much Cruella benefitted Disney+, a true comparison isn't possible. But the strong returns for the theatre-only A Quiet Place Part II are telling, says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore. He called it a “pivotal weekend” for the movie industry that proved predictions of the movie theatre's demise “flat-out wrong”. “That Quiet Place Part II did so well makes a strong case that a theatrical-first release for a big movie is the way to go,” Dergarabedian said. “This is the best possible news for an industry that's been dealing with probably the most profoundly challenging chapter in the history of the movie theatre.” The debut of A Quiet Place Part II was much watched throughout Hollywood as the kickoff to its delayed summer movie season. After largely sitting out the pandemic, or diverting to streaming platforms, a lineup of blockbusters are again queuing up. On tap are Warner Bros' In the Heights, Universals' F9 and Disney's Black Widow. Last week, Universal Pictures' ninth installment in the Fast & Furious franchise, F9, opened with US$162 million in ticket sales in eight international markets, and US$135 million in China alone. In its second weekend, F9, which opens in North America on Jun 25, raced toward US$230 million worldwide. A Quiet Place Part II had already had its red-carpet premiere in March last year, and spent some of its marketing budget. But it opened remarkably in line with predictions of how many tickets it would sell before the onset of the pandemic. In the intervening months, Paramount sold off many of its films to streamers – Coming 2 America, The Trial Of The Chicago 7 – but Krasinski and the studio felt strongly that the hushed intensity of A Quiet Place Part II worked best on the big screen. In an interview ahead of the film's release, Krasinski said a theatrical release was “non-negotiable"". And Krasinski worked hard to stoke excitement, travelling the country in the week leading up to release to surprise moviegoers. Still, given the circumstances, he had little idea whether audiences would come out. “As bizarre as the entire year has been is how bizarre whatever opening weekend is,"" Krasinski said. ""I don’t really know what it is anymore."" In the end, A Quiet Place Part II performed a lot like how the first one did. That 2018 hit, which ultimately grossed US$340 million globally on a US$17 million budget, launched with US$50.2 million in North American ticket sales. Sequels usually do better than the original but Part II had far more challenges due to pandemic. Rich Gelfond, chief executive of IMAX, where A Quiet Place Part II earned US$4.1 million domestically, called the film “the first domestic release this year to cross the threshold from ‘great opening weekend given the pandemic’ to ‘great opening weekend, period'."" Memorial Day weekend, usually one of the busiest for theatres, still didn't look like it normally does at the movies. Total box office exceeded US$80 million but that's about a third of the holiday weekend's normal business. Last Memorial Day, when nearly all operating theatres were drive-ins, ticket sales amounted to US$842,000, according to Comscore. Many theatres, particularly in New York and Los Angeles, are still operating with social distancing measures. But guidelines are thawing. Last week, the nation's top theatre chains – AMC, Regal, Cinemark – said they would no longer require vaccinated moviegoers to wear face masks. (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/how-did-zheng-geping-quit-20-year-smoking-habit-1414251,How did veteran actor Zheng Geping kick his 20-year smoking habit?,"Zheng Geping used to smoke up to 40 cigarettes a day before he finally kicked the habit in 2009. Given his status as a hunkle and his focus on health and fitness now, it’s hard to believe that he was a chain smoker for around 20 years. In an Instagram post on Tuesday (May 25), the veteran actor revealed that he’s been smoke-free for 4,380 days and it took him four attempts to successfully quit smoking. 
   A post shared by zhenggeping-Edmund Tay郑各评 (@zhenggeping) He added that his family and love for sports helped him to succeed and that it is okay to ask for help or get support from family, friends and even tools like nicotine replacement therapy. His post also featured a giveaway contest in conjunction with the upcoming World No Tobacco Day on May 31. In an interview with entertainment site 8 DAYS, Geping said that he picked up the habit when he was in NS, adding that cigarettes were cheaper back then at around S$2.50 a pack. He said that he smoked when he was bored, stressed, or happy, “basically whenever I felt all sorts of emotions”. However, he stopped smoking at home when wife Hong Huifang was pregnant with their first child, daughter Tay Ying. According to Geping, his first few attempts to stop smoking didn’t pan out because he wasn’t motivated enough but in the end, picking up running showed the best results. “When I started running, I just didn’t want to have the smell of cigarette smoke around me. When I came across some old folks smoking on the street, I felt very disgusted (when I smelled the smoke). Within two weeks of jogging and doing other cardio exercises, I stopped smoking completely,” he told 8 DAYS. He’s now so over smoking that even when he had to light up for a movie character, he felt “very dizzy, and very disgusted”. Here's hoping he keeps kicking (cigarette) butt!   "

The Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, DC announced on Thursday (May 27) that it will stage Once Upon A One More Time, featuring Spears' tunes, including Oops!… I Did It Again, Lucky, Stronger and Toxic. The musical will have an original story written by Jon Hartmere about classic fairy tale princesses – Cinderella, Snow White and Little Mermaid, among them – who are transformed after reading The Feminine Mystique, a landmark feminist text. Once Upon A One More Time begins performances at Sidney Harman Hall in Washington, DC on Nov 29. It represents a significant pivot for The Shakespeare Theatre Company, known for its more stately offerings. The temptation to use already proven, popular songs to fuel a musical is an old one and on Broadway has lately led to shows with music from The Temptations, The Go Go's, Tina Turner and Alanis Morissette.      Spears has been under the spotlight lately after the recent FX and Hulu documentary The New York Times Presents: Framing Britney looked at the circumstances that led to the establishment of her conservatorship in 2008 and has spurred sympathy for the singer.

Their wedding was held in her Montecito, California, home with only 20 guests consisting of friends and family.       A post shared by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande)   The 27-year-old uploaded a series of photos over three posts, with the first one captioned, “5.15.21”, which refers to their wedding date.

The final post, captioned with their wedding date, is a monochrome picture of the new Mr and Mrs sharing a sweet kiss.   A post shared by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande)   The comments sections were flooded with congratulatory notes from both celebrities and fans alike. “Congratulations a beautiful goddess! I am so so so happy for you and your hubby,” wrote Khloe Kardashian. Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown reacted with, “you look STUNNING”. Singer Katy Perry, on the other hand, was more impressed by the decorations as she commented, “Your home” with a heart emoji. Other celebs like Hailey Bieber, Dua Lipa, Seth Rogen, Lizzo, Bella Hadid, Victoria Justice, and manager Scooter Braun, also gave their well wishes to the new couple as well. The couple met when Gomez was introduced to the singer to help her find a new home. They've been dating since January 2020 and got engaged in December. A source told Entertainment Tonight that “Ariana's brother Frankie and her mom are so happy for her. They think Dalton really balances Ariana out and allows her to be her true self”. The groom is also described as very low-key and unfazed by celebrities – “he's a little nerdy and hardworking and she loves that about him. He's also very protective over her and goes above and beyond to make her happy”."

Actor Chris Noth will reprise his role as Mr Big (real name John James Preston) in And Just Like That…, joining co-stars Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis. The reboot, which will air on streaming service HBO Max, will follow Carrie (Parker), Miranda (Nixon) and Charlotte (Davis) as they navigate life and relationships in their 50s. The fourth main character Samantha, played by Kim Cattrall, will not return. The series, from executive producer Michael Patrick King, will have 10 30-minute episodes.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/a-quiet-place-ii-cinema-release-covid-19-1412871,"A year later, A Quiet Place II is ready to make noise in the cinema","John Krasinski, whose A Quiet Place Part II is one of the biggest studio releases to open exclusively in theatres this year, recently returned to the movies, himself. Krasinski screened the film for his in-laws in London, and the experience of being back in a theatre was unexpectedly moving. “It’s a sanctuary to begin with for me. It’s one of my favourite places. Emily and I go on movie dates pretty much every week,” Krasinski says, referring to Emily Blunt, his wife. “But going back this time had a lot more weight to it. Seeing my movie up there felt more emotional because of all we’ve been waiting for.” The wait for A Quiet Place Part II has been as long as the pandemic. Last March, its release was imminent just as COVID-19 shut down US theatres. A premiere was held in New York on Mar 8, 2020. Buzz was strong. Opening-weekend box office was expected to exceed US$50 million (S$66 million). But one delay followed another as Paramount Pictures and A Quiet Place Part II awaited the chance to return to the big screen. While many other films were sold off to streaming services (including Paramount’s own Coming 2 America and The Trial Of The Chicago 7), holding out for theatres was essential for Krasinski. His movie is predicated not just on science-fiction spectacle but an immersive and chilling sound design. “For me, it was non-negotiable. We designed this movie to be for theatres, specifically,” Krasinski said in a recent interview by Zoom from his home in Brooklyn during a break from shooting the Amazon series Jack Ryan. “I said I really wanted to wait for theatres and they supported it from the very beginning. Even more so, I give them so much credit for going with me on being this early.” A Quiet Place Part II, which opens in theatres in Singapore on Jun 10, is an intensely realised nightmare that will try, with jolts and jump scares, to awaken moviegoing from its pandemic slumber. As the Memorial Day weekend kickoff to Hollywood’s delayed summer season (it opens in the US on May 28), it will pose a much-watched stress test for the industry’s theatrical future. It’s a high-pressure position that Krasinski meets with a mixture of pride and anxiety. “It’s definitely thrilling and nerve-wracking and all those things at the same time,” he says. “But that’s what our movie is.” A Quiet Place, written and directed by Krasinski, followed the Abbott family (played by Krasinski, Blunt, Millicent Simmonds, Noah Jupe and an infant) in an upstate New York dystopia where creatures with hypersensitive hearing stalk the land, ruthlessly hunting by sound. It was a hit, grossing US$340 million globally on a US$17 million budget. Pressure for a sequel, naturally, grew. “I was like, no, just preserve it,” Blunt said in an interview last year. “Paramount said we’re going to make one, whether we were a part of it or not. I think that was what they wanted. But John just then came up with the most undeniable idea.” Krasinski’s idea: Make Simmonds’ character the lead. In Part II, the surviving Abbotts are forced to leave their home and, on barefoot tiptoes, search beyond for any remaining humans, and maybe some sanctuary. The scope and scale of A Quiet Place enlarges, while the story remains focused on family. “If the first one was a love letter to my kids, this one’s a letter to my kids about what I hope they are going forward in their lives, which is brave and courageous not only for their own happiness but also to make real change,” says Krasinski. In the first A Quiet Place, Simmonds’ character, Regan, figures out a way to defeat the creatures by using her hearing aid to create feedback intolerable to their ears. In the second film, she grows even bolder with her unique power. “I knew that she could carry the entire franchise,"" says Krasinski. “She’s one of the most stunning actors I’ve ever worked with. She’s so incredibly talented but also so emotional intelligent.” Before Krasinski had even shared his script with Blunt, he contacted Simmonds by Facetime to tell her she would be the sequel’s lead. “She immediately covered her mouth and was shocked,” says Krasinski. “She turned to her mum and then this look came back that was as heroic as her character. She looked at the camera and said, ‘I’ll do it’.” Simmonds, the 18-year-old who starred in Todd Haynes’ Wonderstruck, was surprised by the opportunity but resolved to do her best in a role that simultaneously drew from her own strength and encouraged greater confidence in herself. “As a person, I’m a little bit more shy. I might fade into the background a little more than Regan,” Simmonds says through an interpreter by Zoom. “But playing Regan really helped me because Regan was very confident in herself, and that really affected me. In the first film, she wasn’t as confident. She was highly self-critical and blamed herself for a lot of the things that happened to the family. That’s something that I experienced personally. I thought to myself: What if I wasn’t deaf? What if I was a quote-unquote ‘normal person’? “But when Regan became this powerhouse in the second film, I realised that she was using what she had – all of her deficits, if you will – as strengths,” says Simmonds. That gave me a new perspective on myself. I was able to look at myself and say: I’m not broken. I’m unique. I have something to offer and I can take that and use it as an advantage.” The two A Quiet Place films, where sign language is a life-saver, are part of a surge of recent films that authentically and dynamically represent characters with hearing impairment, including last year’s Sound Of Metal and the upcoming CODA. Simmons, who during the pandemic helped create transparent face masks to aid in lip-reading, believes the movie industry is progressing in the right direction – and that people like herself shouldn’t be shocked at fronting a summer blockbuster. “We need to start asking ourselves: Why not me?” says Simmonds. After A Quiet Place Part II, Krasinski will pass writing and directing a third installment to Jeff Nichols (Mud, Take Shelter), who Krasinski says just turned in his script. More films beyond that, he grants, are also possible. Like most upcoming films, A Quiet Place Part II will have a shorter, 45-day run in theatres before streaming, on Paramount+. But in the week before release, Krasinski is travelling nationwide to surprise moviegoers and rekindle some of the communal excitement of going to the movies. “Finally,” he told a crowd in Cleveland, “I'm all dressed up with somewhere to go"".

Most kids would probably want to grow up to be just like the superhero too. The actor's young son, though, has other aspirations, as the star revealed in a hilarious Instagram post on Tuesday (May 25). 
   A post shared by Chris Hemsworth (@chrishemsworth) The Australian actor posted a picture of him and one of his twin sons, who is seen from the back wearing a red cape. He captioned the photo: “Holding my little man’s hand and asking him the age old question. ‘What do you want to be when you grow up’.” The young boy apparently replied, “Dad i wanna be Superman”, to which Hemsworth quipped: “Lucky I have two other kids”. Apart from the fact that it's just a funny exchange between a dad and his son, there's also the added layer that Thor is from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) while Superman is part of rival DC Comics. Celebrity friends and netizens did not hesitate to poke fun at the situation. His Avengers: Endgame co-star Josh Brolin simply wrote: “Hahahaha”. Deadpool star Ryan Reynolds commented with two hearts and a crying laughing emoji while Wonder Woman Gal Gadot contributed something similar. Hemsworth and his wife, Elsa Pataky, are parents to seven-year-old twin boys – Sasha and Tristan – and a nine-year-old daughter called India Rose.  He often posts videos on Instagram of the family having fun together and in one of his latest posts in April, he was seen play fighting with his son. Netizens observed that he may have been on the set of the upcoming Thor flick as he had his “Thor hair” on. Thor: Love And Thunder, the fourth installment of the franchise and part of Phase 4 of the MCU, is slated for release in May 2022."

The 34-year-old The Umbrella Academy actor shared his first shirtless photo on Instagram – in swim trunks by the poolside – since coming out as trans in December 2020. He captioned his Tuesday (May 25) post, “Trans bb’s first swim trunks”, and added the hashtags #transjoy and #transisbeautiful. 
   A post shared by @elliotpage Page revealed in a past interview that he had undergone top surgery and in his chat with Oprah Winfrey for the latter’s Apple TV+ series in April, he said that the part of his transition journey that brought him the most joy was being able to touch his chest and feel comfortable in his body. Numerous comments on Page’s Instagram post mentioned the actor’s visible abs as well as the big smile on his face. Actress Nina Dobrev wrote: ""You look amazing. And most of all happy"". Model-actress Ruby Rose wrote, “You look phenomenal”. Game Of Thrones star Lena Headey went with three heart emojis, while singer Miley Cyrus just wrote, ""Hot"".  
  Page, who was nominated for an Oscar for Juno in 2008, has embraced his role as an advocate for the trans community.  He told Winfrey that it felt imperative for him to detail his coming out journey publicly because of the time we’re in right now where there’s been “horrible backlash” towards trans people, particularly trans youth.  "

The confirmation from Da-in’s agency came soon after Korean news outlet Sports Kyunghyang first broke the news on Monday (May 24), reporting that the couple have been together since the end of 2020. According to the report, they got closer because of their common passion for acting and golf, and that Seung-gi often spent time with Da-in when he wasn’t working on his recent drama, Mouse. The actress’ agency, 9Ato Entertainment, said she confirmed “they had met as a senior and junior (in the same industry) and have been carefully getting to know each other since five or six months ago”. South Korean entertainment portal Dispatch also released on May 24 several photos of the couple out and about in late 2020, including a shot of them visiting the actor's grandmother. The 35-year-old Seung-gi debuted as a singer in 2004 before starting to act. Notable roles include in Vagabond and A Korean Odyssey. He previously dated Yoona of K-pop band Girls’ Generation in 2014 but they broke up the following year.   The actor was also reported to be leaving his long-time agency on May 31 to establish his own company. Da-in, who is 30, is the daughter of veteran actress Kyun Mi-ri and the younger sister of actress Lee Yu-bi. She started acting in 2014 and recently starred in the series, Alice."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/italy-eurovision-song-winner-maneskin-tests-negative-for-drugs-1402061,Italy's Eurovision song winner tests negative for drugs after cocaine rumours,"Eurovision Song Contest organisers said on Monday (May 24) that the lead singer of Italian glam rock band Maneskin tested negative for drug use, putting to an end speculation that had tarnished the band’s victory. “We consider the matter closed,” the European Brodcasting Union, which produces the annual kitsch-filled song festival, said in a statement. EBU said it came to the conclusion after it reviewed all the available footage of the TV broadcast on Saturday night and saw the negative results of Maneskin singer Damiano David’s voluntary drug test. Rumours had swirled on social media – and were raised at a Eurovision news conference – that David had snorted cocaine when he was seen leaning awkwardly over a table during the live TV broadcast. David immediately rejected the claim, saying he never uses drugs and that he was leaning over because his guitarist had broken a glass. 
  The claims found a particular echo in mainstream French media. France, which was a leading contender for the Eurovision victory, came in second place after the popular votes were tallied. “We are alarmed that inaccurate speculation leading to fake news has overshadowed the spirit and the outcome of the event and unfairly affected the band,” the EBU statement said. Maneskin's win gave Italy a sorely needed boost after a dreadful year as one of the countries worst hit by the coronavirus and will bring next year’s competition back to the place where European song contests began.

The 44-year-old Hollywood star tweeted on Monday (May 24) a photo of himself holding an autographed bottle of Aviator gin (he’s a co-founder of the brand) meant for band member Bang Chan.  He said in the caption that he will be sending the bottle to Chan this week and also asked for his autograph “as a new Stray Kids fan”. The tweet came several days after Reynolds first gave Stray Kids a shout-out following the group’s May 20 appearance on Korean show Kingdom: Legendary War, where they performed a Deadpool-inspired mashup of their song God’s Menu and Blackpink’s Ddu-Du Ddu-Du. Reynolds responded to that performance with a tweet tagging the band and saying, “Oh hello Stray Kids”. Group member Bang Chan, who is known to be a big fan of Reynolds, took to a livestream on May 24 to express his excitement at the shout-out.  He said that it was “actually crazy” that the actor saw the performance and asked for the actor's autograph, which led to Reynold’s recent tweet. Chan added: “To be noticed by someone that you really, really admire and someone that you really think of as a role model just hits different. I am very, very happy and I think I can die peacefully now.” The singer also offered to buy Reynolds some delicious food if he ever came to Korea. Sounds like this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship. "

He took to Instagram on Friday (May 21) to share the “very exciting” news. He wrote: “I’ve been a fan of Highlander since I was (a) lad. From the movies in all of their 80s, Queen slathered glory to the TV show with an actor who looked remarkably like one of my brothers.” The 38-year-old actor included a photo of the books Those Bloody Kilts and So You’re Going To Wear A Kilt; a dagger and a “straight from cask” bottle of Scotch and wrote in the caption: “And as you can see from the swipe, I've lately been dipping into some of my Scottish heritage, and inadvertently getting my base line research underway!” 
   A post shared by Henry Cavill (@henrycavill) The original 1986 fan-favourite film starred Christopher Lambert, Sean Connery and Clancy Brown as warring immortals who have to fight to become the last man standing – hence the oft-quoted catchphrase, “There can be only one”. It spawned four sequels and three TV series. The film was also known for its soundtrack, which featured rock band Queen with tracks such as Princes Of The Universe and A Kind Of Magic. According to Deadline, which first reported the news, it’s unclear if Cavill will play a character from previous iterations or a brand new one. The reboot will have John Wick director Chad Stahelski at the helm and Kerry Williamson writing. Cavill is currently filming the second season of the Netflix hit, The Witcher. He will also return as Sherlock Holmes in another Netflix sequel – Enola Holmes – together with star Millie Bobby Brown. "

Drake, who extended his record as the most decorated winner in the history of the awards show to 29 wins on Sunday (May 23), was surrounded by family and friends who presented him with the Artist of the Decade Award. He walked onstage outside the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles with his son Adonis holding his hand. ""I wanna dedicate this award to my friends, to my longtime collaborators ... to my beautiful family, and to you,"" he said, looking to Adonis and picking him up to kiss him. Drake placed his first song on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 2009, and since has logged the most songs ever on the chart, with 232 entrees. He's also logged a record 45 Top 10 hits on the Hot 100 and a record 22 No 1s on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop songs chart. He was also named top streaming songs artist on Sunday. Pink received the Icon Award and was joined onstage by her nine-year-old daughter – showing off their powerful gymnastic skills as they spun in the air in a jaw-dropping performance. Known for her signature aerial and acrobatic moves, Pink was matched by Willow Sage Hart as Cover Me In Sunshine played in the background, Pink's song featuring vocals from her daughter. ""Willow, you nailed it,"" Pink said after the performance. ""I love what I do and I love the people that I get to do it with, and we're pretty good at what we do, but it wouldn't matter if no one came to see us and play with us. So all you guys out there ... thank you for coming out!"" Pink's performance was one of several pre-taped moments at the awards show, which aired on NBC and was hosted by Nick Jonas. Live performances were held outdoors, in front of audience members wearing masks. The Weeknd was on hand to accept the most wins of the night – 10. He walked into the show with 16 nominations, winning honours like top artist, top male artist, top Hot 100 song for Blinding Lights and top R&B album for After Hours. ""I wanna take this opportunity to thank you, my parents,"" he said. ""I am the man I am today because of you. And thank you to my fans, of course. I do not take this for granted."" The late rapper Pop Smoke was also a big winner: He posthumously earned five honours, including top new artist and top rap artist, while his debut – Shoot For The Stars, Aim For The Moon – won top rap album and top Billboard 200 album, which his mother accepted onstage. ""Thank you to the fans for honouring the life and spirit of my son, so much that he continues to manifest as if he was still here in flesh,"" Audrey Jackson said.  Another late rapper was also honoured during the show. Before presenting top rap song to DaBaby, Swizz Beatz dedicated a moment to those who have recently died in hip-hop, including his close friend and collaborator DMX. And Houston rapper and activist Trae Tha Truth, who earned the Change Maker Award, ended his speech with a powerful sentence: ""We still gon' need justice for Breonna Taylor."" Other winners on Sunday included Bad Bunny and BTS, who both won four awards and also performed. Breakthrough country singer Gabby Barrett won three awards, including top female country artist and top country song for the hit I Hope. The song's remix featuring Charlie Puth won top collaboration. ""Oh my gosh. Thank y'all so much. This means so much to me,"" Barrett said as she broke into tears. ""I've been performing for 10 years really hard. ...We've worked so hard to get here."" Another country star also won big on Sunday though he wasn't allowed to participate in the show. Morgan Wallen, who was caught on camera using a racial slur earlier this year, won three honours, including top country artist and top country album for Dangerous: The Double Album, which has had major success on the pop and country music charts despite his fallen moment. Wallen was nominated for six awards, and Billboard Awards producer dick clark productions said it couldn't prevent Wallen from earning nominations, or winning, because finalists are based on album and digital sales, streaming, radio airplay and social engagement. The producers did ban Wallen from performing or attending the show. The Billboard Awards kicked off with a collaborative performance by DJ Khaled, HER and Migos, who brought the concert vibe back to life a year after live shows were in the dark because of the pandemic. Doja Cat and SZA – accompanied by futuristically dressed background dancers – sang their big hit Kiss Me More inside the venue, where the seats were empty. Alicia Keys, celebrating the 20th anniversary of her groundbreaking debut Songs In A Minor, sang songs from the album including the hit Fallen. The performance was introduced by former first lady Michelle Obama. Other performers included Karol G, twenty one pilots, Duran Duran, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, Jonas Brothers and Glass Animals. Stars like Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga and Kanye West won honours at the show though they didn't attend. Machine Gun Kelly, who started in rap but has had recent success on the rock charts, won top rock artist and top rock album. ""I released my first mixtape 15 years ago and this is the first big stage I've ever been invited to accept an award on,"" he said, kissing his actor-girlfriend Megan Fox before walking to the stage. ""To the box that society keeps trying to put me, you need stronger material because you can't keep me in it,"" he proclaimed. (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/italy-eurovision-winners-maneskin-return-home-drug-test-1397756,"Italy Eurovision winners Maneskin return home to cheers, a drug test","The Italian glam rock band that won the Eurovision Song Contest returned home on Sunday (May 23) to the adulation of fans, congratulations from the government and so much speculation that the lead singer had snorted cocaine during the show that he vowed to take a drug test. “We want to shut down the rumors,"" Maneskin lead singer Damiano David told reporters at Rome's Leonardo da Vinci airport as the band arrived home after their victory in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Rumours spread on social media after David was seen bending over a table during the Saturday night live television broadcast. Asked at a post-victory news conference whether he’d snorted cocaine, David said he doesn’t use drugs and that he’d bent over because another band member had broken a glass at their feet. Eurovision confirmed that broken glass was found under the table in question, but announced David had offered to take the test, which is scheduled for Monday. In Italy, the drug claim didn't mar the praise that poured in Sunday from the Italian establishment for the victory of the rather anti-establishment Maneskin, a glam rock band that got its start busking on Rome's main shopping drag. Their win gave Italy a sorely needed boost after a dreadful year as one of the countries worst hit by the coronavirus and will bring next year's competition back to the place where European song contests began. The band was the bookmakers’ favourite going into the Eurovision finale and sealed the win early Sunday with the highest popular vote in the enormously entertaining, and incredibly kitsch, annual song festival. “We are out of our minds!” Florence’s Uffizi Galleries tweeted, echoing Maneskin's winning song lyrics, along with an image of a Caravaggio Medusa and the hashtag #Uffizirock. Maneskin, Danish for “moonlight"" and a tribute to bass player Victoria De Angelis' Danish ancestry, won with a total of 529 points. France was second while Switzerland, which led after national juries had voted, finished third. “It is amazing. It is amazing,“ band members said as they got off the plane and were met by a gaggle of reporters outside baggage claim. De Angelis said the band was shocked at the claims of drug use, which were echoing particularly loudly in runner-up France, where mainstream media prominently reported the suspicions and the country’s foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, was even asked about them on a news show on Sunday. Le Drian stayed clear on the controversy, saying: “If there is a need to do tests, they’ll do tests.” De Angelis said the band wants to put the controversy behind them because drug use goes against their ethos and message. “We are totally against cocaine and the use of drugs and we would have never done it of course, so we are shocked that many people believe this,"" she said. The band got its start performing on Via del Corso, the main commercial thoroughfare in downtown Rome. Their scrappy performances in front of a Geox shoe store were a far cry from the over-the-top, flame-throwing extravaganza on Saturday night that literally split David's pants. David told a news conference this week that starting out on the street was embarrassing, since the group had to contend with other musicians vying for the same prized piece of sidewalk while neighbours complained about the noise. “They were always calling the police,"" De Angelis said, laughing. Maneskin’s win was only Italy’s third victory in the contest and the first since Toto Cutugno took the honour in 1990. The victory means Italy will host next year’s competition, with cities bidding for the honour. Launched in 1956 to foster unity after World War II, Eurovision evolved over the years from a bland ballad-fest to a campy, feel-good extravaganza. It has grown from seven countries to include more than 40, including non-European nations such as Israel and far-away Australia. Legend has it that Eurovision got its inspiration from Italy’s Sanremo Music Festival, which began in 1951 as a post-war effort to boost Italian culture and the economy of the Ligurian coastal city that has housed it ever since. Perhaps best known for having launched the likes of Andrea Boccelli and one of Italy’s most famous songs Nel Blu, Dipinto Di Blu — popularly known as Volare — the Sanremo festival usually picks Italy’s official selection for the Eurovision contest. Maneskin won Sanremo this year with the same song, Zitti E Buoni (“Quiet And Good”) that it performed Saturday night in Rotterdam. De Angelis said she hoped that their victory would send a message to future Italian contestants that ballads aren't the only genre that can win contests. “We think maybe from now on more bands will have the chance to play what they want and not be influenced by the radios or what the main genre is in Italy,"" she said. “They can feel themselves and play rock music too.""

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/zack-snyder-army-of-the-dead-zombies-netflix-justice-league-1389401,Why Justice League’s Zack Snyder wants you to care about zombies in Las Vegas,"Seventeen years ago, a young hotshot who was known for directing commercials wowed the world with his critically acclaimed remake of the legendary George A Romero's acerbic satirical zombie movie, Dawn Of The Dead. Suffice it to say, Zack Snyder’s career since 2004 has been nothing short of prolific and eventful – from bringing to life Frank Miller’s 300 and Alan Moore’s supposedly “unfilmable” Watchmen, to rebooting Superman with The Man Of Steel and carrying the DC Comics torch into an extended film universe.  The man may have been ridiculously busy of late – what with re-editing and releasing of the epic four-hour Justice League: The Snyder Cut – but the fan-favourite auteur still managed to find the time to return to his zombie roots with Netflix’s Army Of The Dead which premieres Friday (May 21). The official plot reads as such: ""Following a zombie outbreak in Las Vegas, a group of mercenaries take the ultimate gamble, venturing into the quarantine zone to pull off the greatest heist ever attempted."" A heist movie? With zombies? In Sin City? Not to mention a cast that includes Guardians Of The Galaxy's Drax (Dave Bautista) and Mortal Kombat’s Scorpion (Hiroyuki Sanada)? We’re all in. After all, it has Snyder's trademark mix of popcorn, flair, action and blood all over it. Plus, he multitasks as director, camera operator, director of photography, writer and producer. But the burning question for genre (and Snyder) devotees is this: Will he be subverting or leaning into all those zombie and heist movie tropes? It’s a combination of both, he told CNA Lifestyle. “Because you really want to deconstruct the tropes. That was sort of the thesis when I wrote the script,” said the 55-year-old. “I really want to try it like we’re going into this walled city, it's like (the movie) Escape From New York! And then they're going to nuke the site. I think that the tone allows it, you know? The tone is always saying like, ‘Okay. Of course, they're going to nuke the site. Why not? I think that's the way the movie kind of works.’” He continued: “It seems just fun at first, like they are going to nuke the site and got to get the money. And there's zombies in there and all this stuff. And then, slowly, you start to pull those things apart, and those sort of consequences and the why of it. And the emotion and everyone's like, now, you're really invested in these people, and you want them to live! “And suddenly now you care about the zombies. Like, wait, what? Why do I care about the zombies? You know?” he said with laugh. That said, it’s not just about fans ending up with a soft spot for the undead. Army Of The Dead, like any card-carrying zombie flick worth its bite, also screams cultural and political allegories very befitting of these COVID-19 pandemic times. “Yeah, we’re definitely deep in it,” shared Snyder. “We shot the movie before the pandemic. But now, this whole world has suddenly turned on its head and our movie has, you know, this weird other messaging that sort of came up through the world that we live in. And so I find that really interesting.” Snyder said recent events will change the way audiences look at the movie. “But I think this message is still the same. It's just the lens that we see (through),” he said. “I think the thing about this movie is that, you know, the best zombie movies have a political spin, because that's what makes zombie movies amazing,” he explained.  “Like, I always say that the zombie movies are, you know, it's a monster movie where we're the monster, right? So, of course, you have to have the social commentary at the same time. And we really did endeavour at almost every turn to insert, to intertwine and interlace some sort of message about like, whether it be building a wall or refugee camps or the disease that is the zombie plague that's spreading, and how we're dealing with that.” Army Of The Dead premieres on Netflix on May 21.  "

""We hope you will continue to warmly support us both.""  Aragaki and Hoshino co-starred in the 2016 comedy, Nigeru Wa Haji Da Ga Yaku Ni Tatsu, or It's Shameful To Run, But It Works, as youngsters who enter a roommate-like contractual marriage. That story spoke to the dilemma of Japanese society, where people are increasingly holding off on marriage and children, resulting in one of the lowest birth rates in the world.  The catchy theme song, composed and sung by Hoshino, which ran with the credits, also was a megahit, including its dance moves.  Caroline Kennedy, who was then US ambassador to Japan, had posted a video clip on YouTube of the embassy staff and herself doing the dance. ""Heartbeats throb within distance"", the song Koi, or Love, goes. ""Go beyond man and wife.""  The show, based on a ""manga"" comic, also highlighted the perennial gender inequalities of Japan. The heroine has a university degree but loses her job and, without better opportunities, decides to work as a housekeeper. The relationship that develops is a comfortable mutual respect, devoid of fiery eroticism.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/pose-star-billy-porter-hiv-positive-status-1383101,No more shame: Pose star Billy Porter breaks silence on HIV status,"Billy Porter has broken his silence over his HIV diagnosis, saying he told nearly no one for 14 years out of shame and fear of retaliation and marginalisation in his industry. “The truth is the healing. And I hope this frees me. I hope this frees me so that I can experience real, unadulterated joy, so that I can experience peace, so that I can experience intimacy, so that I can have sex without shame. This is for me,” the award-winning Pose star told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview published on Wednesday (May 19). The 51-year-old Porter, who won an Emmy for his HIV-positive character Pray Tell on the FX series, said the isolation of the pandemic led him to reflect on his secret, kept from his mother and those involved with his ballroom drama set in New York at the height of the AIDS crisis in the '80s. Telling his mother was the most difficult. Having grown up in the Pentecostal church, in an intensely religious family, the stage and screen star said the shame of being queer was compounded by his HIV status. “She said, ‘You’ve been carrying this around for 14 years? Don’t ever do this again. I’m your mother, I love you no matter what. And I know I didn’t understand how to do that early on, but it’s been decades now,'” Porter recalled. He said he's now the “healthiest I've ever been”. Porter called 2007, the year he was diagnosed, the worst year of his life. In addition to his HIV status, he was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes that year, and he signed bankruptcy papers. “I survived so that I could tell the story. That’s what I’m here for,” he said. “I’m the vessel, and emotionally that was sufficient – until it wasn’t. Until I got married (in 2017). Now I’m trying to have a family; now it’s not just me. It’s time to grow up and move on because shame is destructive – and if not dealt with, it can destroy everything in its path.” The LGBTQ watchdog group GLAAD praised Porter for his candor. ""The tremendous levels of stigma facing people living with HIV today can only be broken by icons like Billy Porter showing the world that HIV is not at all a barrier to a healthy and successful life,” said DaShawn Usher, the group's associate director for communities of colour. Porter's series is in its third season, the final round for the show. He's writing a memoir, working on a Netflix documentary about his life and will play a genderless Fairy Godmother this year in a new film take on Cinderella, scheduled for release in September on Amazon Prime.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/jj-lin-virtual-concert-june-sanctuary-finale-postponed-covid-19-1412821,JJ Lin’s virtual concert in June postponed due to COVID-19 situation,"JJ Lin’s virtual concert Sanctuary Finale, which was slated to take place on Jun 6, has been postponed. Event organiser Isotope Productions announced on Instagram on Tuesday (May 18) that the move was to “prioritise the safety of the production team and to comply with safety distancing regulations in view of the escalating pandemic situation”. The show is produced in Taiwan. The post added that a new concert date will be announced at a later date. “We apologise for any inconvenience caused by the concert postponement and seek your patience and kind understanding,” Isotope Productions said. The 40-year-old Singaporean singer also posted the announcement on his Instagram page with the caption, “Let’s brace through this tough period together! Thanks for your understanding!”. Fans flooded the comments section with words of encouragement, saying that they will wait for his concert. The Sanctuary Finale is a virtual spin-off show from Lin’s Sanctuary world tour in March 2018 that covered 43 countries in 66 shows, including four sold-out shows at the Singapore Indoor Stadium. It came to a halt due to the pandemic. There is currently no information on the new concert date but fans who have already purchased e-tickets will be able to use those for the rescheduled concert. Fans who are unable to make the new date will be entitled to a full refund with further updates on the process to be revealed later."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/emma-watson-addresses-rumours-about-career-love-life-1412816,"Harry Potter star Emma Watson addresses rumours about career, love life","It’s been months since actress Emma Watson posted on Instagram or Twitter but she took to the latter on Tuesday (May 18) to address some rumours about her love life and career that have been going around. Watson, who hasn’t posted on Instagram since June last year and on Twitter since August, tweeted: “Rumours about whether I’m engaged or not, or whether my career is ‘dormant or not’ are ways to create clicks each time they are revealed to be true or untrue”. The 31-year-old actress added in the four-part post that if she had news for her fans, she promised she would be the one to tell them. While Watson didn’t identify any particular news outlet, a Daily Mail article had claimed in February that the Harry Potter star had gone “dormant” and was stepping back from acting to focus on her relationship with her “rumoured fiance”. Her manager quickly responded to the rumours in a statement that said ""Emma's social media accounts are dormant but her career isn't"". Watson went on to say in her tweets that in the absence of any news from her, fans should assume she’s “quietly spending the pandemic the way most people are – failing to make sourdough bread (!), caring for my loved ones and doing my best not to spread a virus that is still affecting so many people”. She ended her multi-post tweets by thanking everyone who have been “working so hard to keep us safe and well”. Watson’s last film was Little Women in 2019, where she played Meg March in the adaptation by Greta Gerwig. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-lifestyle/rapper-ti-wife-tiny-investigated-after-sexual-abuse-allegation-1379881,"Rapper TI, wife Tiny investigated after sexual abuse allegation","Rapper T.I. and his wife Tameka “Tiny” Harris are under investigation by police in Los Angeles after a sexual abuse allegation. Los Angeles Police Officer Rosario Cervantes said on Tuesday (May 18) that an active investigation is underway. The investigation comes after a woman in Los Angeles and another in Las Vegas filed a police report that accused the couple of sexual assault. A report was taken on Apr 8 for a sexual assault involving the couple that occurred in 2005, Cervantes said. The police did not provide any additional details. Las Vegas police received a report this month of a sexual assault incident in 2010 involving the couple. But the case was closed because it was reported outside the statute of limitations. Steve Sadow, the attorney for TI and his wife, said his clients “steadfastly deny and repudiate” all the allegations. He said the couple has not spoken or been contacted by police in Los Angeles, Las Vegas or any other jurisdiction in the country. “The LAPD ‘accuser’ once again remains anonymous, thereby preventing us from being in a position to disprove or refute her allegations – or even examine them,” Sadow said. “Meanwhile, although we now have for the first time a name of an ‘accuser,’ who apparently filed a police report with (Las Vegas Metropolitan Police), we have essentially no specifics about her or her claim, and her attorney has thus far refused to disclose a copy of the report for public scrutiny.” The Associated Press generally does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted. In March, attorney Tyrone A Blackburn said more than 30 women contacted him accusing TI and his wife of “forced drugging, kidnapping, rape and intimidation” in at least two states, including California and Georgia. He said the allegations span more than 15 years. A spokesperson for TI and Tiny denied those accusations. Production for the VH1 reality series TI & Tiny: Friends & Family Hustle was suspended in February amid the sexual abuse allegations. (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/charles-grodin-actor-midnight-run-heartbreak-kid-dies-86-1380571,"Charles Grodin, star of Midnight Run and Heartbreak Kid, dies at 86","Charles Grodin, the droll, offbeat actor and writer who scored as a caddish newlywed in The Heartbreak Kid and later had roles ranging from Robert De Niro's counterpart in the comic thriller Midnight Run to the bedeviled father in the Beethoven comedies, has died. He was 86. Grodin died on Tuesday (May 18) in Wilton, Connecticut, from bone marrow cancer, his son, Nicholas Grodin, said.  Known for his dead-pan style and everyday looks, Grodin also appeared in Dave, The Woman In Red, Rosemary's Baby and Heaven Can Wait. On Broadway, he starred with Ellen Burstyn in the long-running 1970s comedy Same Time, Next Year, and he found many other outlets for his talents. With bone-dry understatement, Grodin could steal entire scenes with just a look. His commitment, whether acting across De Niro or Miss Piggy, was unsurpassed. In his many late-night appearances, he once brought a lawyer with him to threaten David Letterman for defamation. (The lawyer instead took a shine to Letterman.) Hosting Saturday Night Live, he pretended to not understand live television, ruining all the sketches. Steve Martin, who co-starred with Grodin in 1984's The Lonely Guy, remembered him as ""one of the funniest people I ever met"".  In the 1990s, Grodin made his mark as a liberal commentator on radio and TV. He also wrote plays and television scripts, winning an Emmy for his work on a 1997 Paul Simon special, and wrote several books humorously ruminating on his ups and downs in show business. Actors, he wrote, should ""think not so much about getting ahead as becoming as good as you can be, so you're ready when you do get an opportunity. I did that, so I didn't suffer from the frustration of all the rejections. They just gave me more time"". He spelled out that advice in his first book, It Would Be So Nice If You Weren't Here, published in 1989. Grodin became a star in the 1970s, but might have broken through years earlier: He auditioned for the title role in Mike Nichols' 1967 classic The Graduate, but the part went instead to Dustin Hoffman.  Grodin did have a small role in Rosemary's Baby and was part of the large cast of Nichols' adaptation of Catch-22 before he gained wide notice in the 1972 Elaine May comedy The Heartbreak Kid. He starred as a Jewish newlywed who abandons his comically neurotic bride to pursue a beautiful, wealthy blonde played by Cybill Shepherd. The movie was a hit and Grodin received high praise. He commented: ""After seeing the movie, a lot of people would approach me with the idea of punching me in the nose."" ""I thought the character in The Heartbreak Kid was a despicable guy, but I play it with full sincerity,"" Grodin told the AV Club in 2009. ""My job isn't to judge it. If it wasn't for Elaine May, I probably would never have had that movie career."" In the next few years, Grodin played in a lavish 1976 film remake of King Kong as the greedy showman who brings the big ape to New York. He was Warren Beatty's devious lawyer in Heaven Can Wait, and Gene Wilder's friend in The Woman In Red (Less successfully, he appeared in May's 1987 adventure comedy Ishtar, a notorious flop). His turn in 1981's The Great Muppet Caper was typically dedicated as a thief wooing Miss Piggy. In 1988's Midnight Run, Grodin was a bail-jumping accountant who took millions from a mobster and De Niro was the bounty hunter trying to bring him cross-country to Los Angeles. They're being chased by police, another bounty hunter and the Mob, and because Grodin is afraid of flying, they are forced to go by car, bus, even boxcar. Grodin and De Niro improvised in many scenes in the film, revered as among the greatest buddy comedies. Often Grodin was genuinely trying to amuse his more intimidating co-star. One line he threw at De Niro: ""You ever had sex with an animal, Jack?"" ""I moved a little more toward drama and he moved a little toward comedy,"" Grodin said at the time. ""And we met on a very good ground."" Beethoven brought him success in the family-animal comedy genre in 1992. Asked why he took up such a role, he told The Associated Press he was happy to get the work. ""I'm not that much in demand,"" Grodin replied. ""It's not like I have this stack of wonderful offers. I'm just delighted they wanted me."" Amid his film gigs, Grodin became a familiar face on late-night TV, perfecting a character who would confront Johnny Carson or others with a fake aggressiveness that made audiences cringe and laugh at the same time. ""It's all a joke,"" he told The Los Angeles Times in 1995. ""It's just a thing. It was a choice to do that."" His biggest stage success, by far, was Same Time, Next Year, which opened on Broadway in 1975 and ran nearly for three and a half years. He and Burstyn were two people who – though each happily married – meet in the same hotel once a year for an extramarital fling. Beyond the humour, the play won praise for deftly tracing the changes in their lives, and in society, from the 1950s to the '70s. Critic Clive Barnes called Grodin's character ""a monument to male insecurity, gorgeously inept"". After 1994's My Summer Story, Grodin largely abandoned acting. From 1995 to 1998, he hosted a talk show on CNBC cable network. He moved to MSNBC and then to CBS' 60 Minutes II. In his 2002 book, I Like It Better When You're Funny, he said too many TV programmers' believe that viewers are best served ""if we hear only from lifelong journalists"". He argued that ""people outside of Washington and in professions other than journalism"" also deserved a soapbox. He returned to the big screen in 2006 as Zach Braff's know-it-all father-in-law in The Ex. More recent credits include the films An Imperfect Murder and The Comedian and the TV series Louie. Grodin was born Charles Grodinsky in Pittsburgh in 1935, son of a wholesale dry goods seller who died when Charles was 18. He played basketball and later described himself as ""a rough kid, always getting kicked out of class"". He studied at the University of Miami and the Pittsburgh Playhouse, worked in summer theatre and then struggled in New York, working nights as a cab driver, postal clerk and watchman while studying acting during the day. In 1962 Grodin made his Broadway debut and received good notices in Tchin Tchin, a three-character play starring Anthony Quinn. He followed with Absence Of A Cello in 1964. He co-wrote and directed a short-lived 1966 off-Broadway show called Hooray! It's A Glorious Day ... And All That. That same year, he made his movie debut in a low-budget flop called Sex And The College Girl. In 1969, Grodin demonstrated his early interest in politics by helping write and direct Songs Of America, a TV special starring Simon and Garfunkel that incorporated civil rights and antiwar messages. But the original sponsor pulled out and Simon later called the little-noticed effort ""a tragedy"". Simon returned with a special in 1977 that spoofed show business and featured Grodin as the show's bumbling producer. Grodin and his co-writers won Emmys. Grodin and his first wife, Julia Ferguson, had a daughter, comedian Marion Grodin. The marriage ended in divorce. He and his second wife, Elissa Durwood, had a son, Nicholas (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/70s-show-actor-danny-masterson-rape-charges-judge-hear-evidence-1417856,Judge to hear evidence on That 70s Show actor Danny Masterson's rape charges,"Prosecutors on Tuesday (May 18) are set to begin presenting evidence to a judge as they attempt to show That 70s Show actor Danny Masterson should stand trial in the rapes of three women. Masterson, 45, who has pleaded not guilty and has been free on bail since his June arrest, is charged in a Los Angeles County court with three counts of rape by force or fear. At his preliminary hearing scheduled to begin Tuesday morning, prosecutors say they will present evidence that he raped a 23-year-old woman sometime in 2001, a 28-year-old woman in April of 2003, and a 23-year-old woman between October and December of 2003. Prosecutors have said all of the attacks happened in his home. He could face up to 45 years in prison if convicted. Such hearings generally provide a limited glimpse at the broader evidence that would be presented should the case be ordered to trial. At a hearing last year, the actor's attorney Thomas Mesereau, who also represented Bill Cosby and Michael Jackson in their sexual misconduct cases, said Masterson ""is absolutely not guilty and we’re going to prove it”. He called the case politicised, the charges the result of unfair hype from media outlets and pressure to prosecute his client as Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey faced an election, which she would later lose. Masterson is accused of rapes at the height of his fame as he starred as Steven Hyde on the ensemble retro sitcom That 70s Show alongside Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis and Topher Grace. The series ran on Fox TV from 1998 to 2006 and has had a long afterlife in reruns. He was removed from the Netflix show The Ranch in 2017 over the allegations that would eventually lead to the charges. Masterson’s arrest last year came after a three-year investigation that resulted in the rare prosecution of a famous Hollywood figure in the #MeToo era. (Source: AP)"

The daytime host, who has seen a ratings hit after allegations of running a toxic workplace, has decided that the upcoming 19th season will be the last, ending in 2022. It coincides with the end of her contract. ""Although all good things must come to an end, you still have hope that the truly great things never will,"" Mike Darnell, president of unscripted TV for Warner Bros, said in a statement Wednesday (May 12). ""It was and is an indelible piece of the television landscape, and it will be sorely missed.""  In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, which first broke the news, DeGeneres said that ""as great as this show is, and as fun as it is,"" it's no longer a creative challenge. The Ellen DeGeneres Show, which started airing in 2003 and is distributed by Warner Bros, has a mix of dancing, games and giveaways along with A-list celebrities. But the host, who built her brand on the motto ""Be Kind,"" opened season 18 in September with a lengthy apology. Three of the show's producers exited over the summer amid allegations of a dysfunctional workplace that harbored misbehaviour, including sexual misconduct and racially insensitive remarks.  While the allegations were ""very hurtful to me"" they didn't influence her decision to leave the show, DeGeneres told The Hollywood Reporter. ""I wouldn't have come back this season"" if they had, she said. Nielsen data shows The Ellen DeGeneres Show viewership dropped by 1.1 million people this season, from 2.6 million viewers to 1.5 million viewers.  DeGeneres was the recipient of the Kennedy Center's Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in 2015 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom under Barack Obama in 2016. In addition to her talk show, she has had a hand in Fox's The Masked Dancer, NBC's Ellen's Game of Games and HBO Max's Ellen's Next Great Designer. DeGeneres's scripted TV show ""Ellen"" became a historic landmark in TV history in the 1990s when her character came out as gay."

Each will be honoured during an induction ceremony in Cleveland on Oct 30 before what organizers hope is a full house of fans enjoying live music again. The hall will also welcome LL Cool J, Billy Preston and Randy Rhoads with musical excellence awards, and honor Kraftwerk, Gil Scott Heron and Charley Patton as early influencers. With Jay-Z, the hall inducts a 23-time Grammy winner and the first rap artist in the Songwriters Hall of Fame. His discography includes Hard Knock Life, 99 Problems and Empire State of Mind. He has had 14 No 1 albums to his credit. After serving as Nirvana's drummer, Dave Grohl stepped to center stage with Foo Fighters, becoming one of the few modern rock bands comfortable in arenas. Their hard-hitting sound produced the hits Best of You, Everlong and Times Like These. As an all-female band that played their own instruments, the Go-Go's were a relative rarity in the early 1980s. Born from Los Angeles' punk rock scene, they had a string of melodic hits that included We Got the Beat, Our Lips Are Sealed and Vacation. Turner, recently celebrated in an HBO documentary,  was one of rock's most stirring comeback stories. After escaping from an abusive relationship with husband and musical partner Ike Turner, she became a solo star in the 1980s behind the world-weary What's Love Got to Do With It, and scored other hits with Private Dancer and We Don't Need Another Hero. King's life was celebrated in the Broadway musical Beautiful: The Carole King Musical. Stepping forward following a career writing songs for others, her 1971 album Tapestry became one of music's best-selling albums of all time. Hits include It's Too Late, You've Got a Friend and (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman. A power pop pioneer, Rundgren is known for melodic hits like Hello It's Me, I Saw the Light and We Gotta Get You a Woman. With Bang the Drum All Day, he's also responsible for the song most celebrated by hooky players everywhere. Clarence Avant, a former manager, label owner and concert organiser, is being given the Ahmet Ertegun Award as a non-performer. His impact on the music industry was highlighted in the 2019 Netflix documentary, The Black Godfather. Grohl, King and Turner bring the number of artists inducted into the Rock Hall twice to 26. Prior to King and Turner, Stevie Nicks had been the only woman with that distinction. Two new inductees – Belinda Carlisle of the Go-Go's and Pat Smear of Foo Fighters – were once members of the LA punk band the Germs before getting the jobs that led to later fame. Before getting into the hall in their special categories, both LL Cool J and Kraftwerk had each been nominated six times as performers without being elected. Five of the six inducted performers are still working artists. Only Turner is retired, and no doubt the hall will try recruiting Beyonce – she should be in town anyway – to pay tribute onstage. Either way, the hall is hoping for one of the first big concerts since the live music business essentially shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic. ""We really see it as a true celebration of the reopening of music – not only in America but in the world,"" John Sykes, chairman of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, said in an interview with The Associated Press. The induction ceremony, to be held at the Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse in Cleveland, will simulcast on SiriusXM and air later on HBO."

An audience of 4,000 witnessed the glitz of Britain's leading music prize ceremony at the O2 Arena as part of a test return to mass attendance events in the age of the coronavirus. Among them were 2,500 key health workers and their guests who had received tickets in recognition of their efforts during the pandemic. Lipa, who took home the British female solo artist and album of the year titles, highlighted the words of nurse and academic Elizabeth Anionwu to say there was a ""massive disparity between gratitude and respect"" for those on the health front line. ""I think what we should do is we should all give a massive, massive round of applause and give (British Prime Minister) Boris (Johnson) a message that we all support a fair pay rise for our front line,"" she said. In her acceptance speeches, the Levitating singer also paid tribute to Anionwu, who has campaigned against racial injustice for decades, as well as Folajimi Olubunmi-Adewole and Joaquin Garcia, who jumped into the River Thames near London Bridge to try to save a woman last month. Olubunmi-Adewole, 20, did not survive the rescue attempt. Taylor Swift said it was an ""incredible honour"" to receive the global icon title, which has previously been awarded to superstars such as Elton John and David Bowie. ""I'm really proud to be part of this musical community especially in a year where we needed music so much,"" Swift said. ""And what we needed even more was the help and support of the NHS and the key workers that are here for us tonight."" Little Mix became the first all-female band to win best British group, and called attention to ""sexism and a lack of diversity"" within the music industry. Harry Styles took best British single for his song Watermelon Sugar, while J Hus received best British male solo artist. Former US first lady Michelle Obama sent a video message as she presented The Weeknd with the international male solo artist prize. Billie Eilish was named international female solo artist winner, while Haim were dubbed best international group. Live performers at the ceremony, which was hosted by comedian Jack Whitehall, included Lipa, Coldplay and a collaboration between Rag'n'Bone Man, Pink and National Health Service choirs. It was the largest audience for a live music event in the UK since March 2020, when pandemic restrictions were first introduced. The event is part of the government's Events Research Programme, which has recently seen crowds return to soccer matches, an outdoor concert and a nightclub. Attendees were not socially distanced or wearing face masks, but had to provide a negative coronavirus test ahead of the show.  ""It's the first event we've been to since the pandemic, there's a great buzz,"" said police nurse Brian George, who brought his 18-year-old daughter to the ceremony. ""I'm hoping that with a few more events like this it'll be like, by the autumn, let's open up everything again,"" he said. ""That would be fantastic."" Those who attended also will be tested and monitored after the event as part of the research. Britain has recorded more than 127,500 coronavirus deaths, but deaths have dropped to single digits after a lockdown at the start of 2021 and the rapid vaccination rollout. Lockdown is slowly being lifted and measures are set to be further eased in England on Monday with the reopening of indoor hospitality venues and outdoor gatherings of up to 30 people. Social distancing guidance will remain in place. All restrictions have been set out to be lifted by June 21 under the government's current roadmap, with gigs and music festivals due to return for the first time since early 2020. (Source: AP)"

Now she has taken over TikTok with her fresh dance moves (which includes a high kick) to BTS’ hit song, Dynamite. The 74-year-old has been appearing in her helper’s TikTok videos in recent months and netizens love watching them together. Even NTUC Fairprice is a fan. According to 8 DAYS, the supermarket chain invited Jin-jie to share a recipe for its Mother’s Day feature and also asked if the trio could shoot a TikTok dance at one of its supermarkets as they’re “really cute”. The result, which you can watch on her helper's TikTok page, is a high-energy performance of Dynamite complete with a high kick that we dare say not many people her age can execute with such gusto. The local actress is known to have a good relationship with her two helpers. When she clinched her Top 10 Most Popular Female Artistes award at the recent Star Awards, she took the time to thank them during her acceptance speech. They call her “nai nai”, which means granny, and said that she treats them just like her own daughters. Their TikTok videos are often flooded with positive comments regarding Jin-jie. For this recent dance, commenters were impressed by her high kick, with some commenting that their TikTok videos bring people joy.

The Wonder Woman actress said in a new interview with Israeli news station N12 that the director had threatened her career during the reshoot for 2017's Justice League. Whedon was brought on to complete the film after original director Zack Snyder left the production following the death of his daughter. Gadot confirmed her bad experience after the interviewer asked about the issues she faced with Whedon, including him saying that she should just look pretty and say her lines. She told N12: “What I had with Joss basically is that he kind of threatened my career and said if I did something he would make my career miserable. I handled it on the spot.” Gadot is the latest in what appears to be a growing list of actors who'd worked with Whedon who have spoken out about his on-set harassment. Actor Ray Fisher, who played Cyborg on Justice League, tweeted in July last year that ""Joss Whedon's on-set treatment of the cast and crew of Justice League was gross, abusive, unprofessional, and completely unacceptable”. Stars of the television hit, Buffy The Vampire Slayer, have also made similar allegations. Charisma Carpenter said in a social media post that Whedon had a “history of creating toxic and hostile work environments”, including the one she experienced on Buffy and while she was pregnant. The TV series’ star, Sarah Michelle Gellar, responded to Carpenter’s post by saying that although she is proud to have her name associated with Buffy Summers, “I don’t want to be forever associated with the name Joss Whedon"". Another Buffy alum, Michelle Trachtenberg, has said that Whedon’s interactions with her when she was still a teenager were “not appropriate”."

Global Citizen announced on Saturday (May 8) that the funds raised helped procure more than 26 million doses at the “Vax Live: The Concert to Reunite the World.” The organisation said money was garnered through several philanthropic and corporate commitments. President Joe Biden, Prince Harry and Jennifer Lopez were among the big names who took part in the event, which was recorded May 2 and aired on Saturday. The concert was staged at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California. Selena Gomez hosted the show, which was attended by several thousand fully-vaccinated concertgoers who cheered on performances by Eddie Vedder, Foo Fighters, J Balvin, HER and Lopez, who enjoyed a duet with her mum. Ben Affleck, Chrissy Teigen, Jimmy Kimmel, Sean Penn and David Letterman served as special guest speakers. Vax Live was one of the largest concert gatherings in Southern California since the coronavirus pandemic roiled the world more than a year ago. Organisers called the event the country’s first large-scale music event for a COVID-19-compliant audience. Media and production staff needed to show a negative COVID-19 test before entering the stadium. (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/henry-golding-dakota-johnson-netflix-jane-austen-persuasion-1412786,Henry Golding to star in Netflix’s adaptation of Jane Austen’s Persuasion,"Henry Golding is set to appear alongside Dakota Johnson in a new Netflix film, Persuasion, a modern-day retelling of Jane Austen’s classic 1817 novel. Johnson is the leading lady here, playing Anne Elliot who is described as a non-conforming woman with modern sensibilities. She lives with her snobby family who are on the brink of bankruptcy. Golding will play Mr Elliott, her distant cousin. His character is described as callous and a classic Austen foil. When Anne reconnects with Frederick Wentworth, a naval officer she was persuaded to reject several years before, she faces the dilemma of giving love a second chance or turning him down again. According to Deadline, which first reported the news, Golding was attracted to the role as it was a chance for him to play against type. The 34-year-old actor shot to fame after his breakout role in 2018’s Crazy Rich Asians, and since then, has been in black comedy A Simple Favour and rom-com Last Christmas, among other films. Golding and his wife, Liv Lo, welcomed their first child in early April.  Next up, fans can catch him as the titular character in the action flick Snake Eyes, a GI Joe spinoff, set for release this July. Production for Persuasion is reportedly beginning in May and so far, there’s no confirmed release date."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/family-chris-cornell-settles-with-doctor-over-death-1348241,Family of rock singer Chris Cornell settles with doctor over his death,"The family of Chris Cornell and a doctor who they alleged over-prescribed him drugs before he died have agreed to a settle a lawsuit. Court documents filed by attorneys for the rock singer's widow, Vicky Cornell, and their children, Toni and Christopher Nicholas Cornell, said a confidential settlement had been reached. The documents were filed in April, but they had gone unnoticed before City News Service reported on them on Thursday (May 6). The Cornell family alleged in the lawsuit filed in 2018 in Los Angeles Superior Court that medication, especially the anti-anxiety drug lorazepam, prescribed by Dr Robert Koblin led to erratic behaviour from the Soundgarden front man before his death in Detroit in 2017 at age 52. Coroner's investigators in Michigan ruled Cornell's death a suicide by hanging. Tests showed the presence of lorazepam, better known by its brand name Ativan, in Cornell's system along with barbiturates and the anti-opioid drug naloxone, but did not cite them as a factor in his death. The lawsuit said Koblin and his Beverly Hills, California, office “negligently and repeatedly” prescribed “dangerous mind-altering controlled substances to Chris Cornell which impaired Mr Cornell’s cognition, clouded his judgment, and caused him to engage in dangerous impulsive behaviors that he was unable to control, costing him his life”. The lawsuit said the doctor did this knowing Cornell had a serious history of substance abuse. In court documents responding to the lawsuit, Koblin and his attorney denied any wrongdoing or responsibility for Cornell's death. Emails seeking comment sent Thursday night to attorneys for both sides were not immediately returned. “After years of litigation and settlement negotiations, Plaintiffs and Defendants ... have reached a confidential settlement agreement to resolve all claims,” the Cornell family attorneys said in the Apr 2 court filing. The document said essential to the compromise was the agreement to minimise publicity and keep the terms confidential. The case has “received significant media coverage and attention from fans of Mr Cornell and allies of Plaintiffs,"" the court filing says. ”Unfortunately, as with many celebrity cases, this action has also attracted the attention of troubled individuals who have harassed Plaintiffs, including by threatening the life and safety of Plaintiffs Toni Cornell and Christopher Nicholas Cornell."" A judge must still approve the parts of the settlement that involve the children, who are both minors, and the documents say the lawsuit will proceed toward trial if that doesn't happen. Cornell’s wailing voice and his long-haired, shirtless stage presence made him an essential figure in the grunge rock of the 1990s. Soundgarden was among the first groups to surge to national attention in a wave that later included Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains. (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/stranger-things-season-4-trailer-eleven-dr-brenner-1412781,Stranger Things Season 4: What's happening to Eleven in the new trailer?,"Netflix has just dropped a new trailer for Stranger Things season four on Thursday (May 6) and it looks like we’ll be delving into Eleven's world. Just to recap: At the end of season three, the gang battled the Mind Flayer at the Starcourt Mall and fans were left wondering if Jim Hopper (David Harbour) survived the huge explosion. (Spoiler alert – he did, as was revealed in the previous teaser trailer in February 2020. Unfortunately for him though, he’s imprisoned in Russia.) The new 70-second clip opens with a close-up of a clock that’s about to strike 3 o’clock. We then see groups of kids with buzz cuts and dressed in hospital gowns playing games and solving puzzles in a large, sterile-looking room with a rainbow-coloured wall. A grey-haired man – whose face we don’t get to see – walks in and greets the kids and they respond, “Good morning, Papa”. He tells them he has something special planned for them as the camera pans to one of the rooms outside with the number 11 on the door. The trailer ends with Eleven, played by Millie Bobby Brown, looking wide-eyed as a voice asks, “Eleven, are you listening?” The voice is assumed to belong to Papa, that is Dr Martin Brenner (played by Matthew Modine), who had been experimenting on test subjects at the Hawkins National Laboratory, including Eleven herself. What’s not clear is if the scene is a flashback of Eleven’s time at the facility or something that’s happening to her in the present moment. The was such a big delay between the two trailers – more than a year apart – because COVID-19 affected work and the crew was only able to get in two weeks of filming at the start of 2020. Work has since resumed in September. There’s still no word yet when the latest season of the streaming service’s monster hit will be released but there’s hope that it’ll come sooner rather than later, especially now that we have a new trailer. For now, we do know that there are new additions to the cast this season, which was announced in November. These include Robert Englund – yes, Freddy Krueger himself – who will play Victor Creel, a “disturbed and intimidating man” at a psychiatric hospital; Jamie Campbell Bower, a caring orderly at the psychiatric hospital; and Eduardo Franco, a pizza delivery guy and Jonathan’s (Charlie Heaton) best friend. Joining Heaton are the rest of the main cast, including Finn Wolfhard, Noah Schnapp, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Natalia Dyer, Joe Keery, Winona Ryder and Maya Hawke. "

The prequel, which stars Matt Smith, Emma D’Arcy, Steve Toussaint, Olivia Cooke and Rhys Ifans, is set 300 years before the events of Game Of Thrones.  Other cast members include Paddy Considine, Eve Best, Sonoya Mizuno and Fabien Frankel. House Of The Dragon will focus on House Targaryen and the civil war that became known as the “Dance of the Dragons”.   In one photo, we get to see Smith as Prince Daemon Targaryen and D’Arcy as Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen. Smith’s character is the younger brother of King Viserys (played by Considine) and heir to the throne. His character is described as a “peerless warrior and dragonrider” who “possesses the true blood of the dragon”. Unfortunately, it is said that “whenever a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin in the air…”. D’Arcy’s Princess Rhaenyra is the king’s first-born child; she is of pure Valyrian blood and is a dragonrider. Another photo shows Toussaint as Lord Corlys Velaryon (also known as the Sea Snake), who is the most famed nautical adventurer in the history of Westeros, while the third photo is of Cooke as Alicent Hightower and Ifans as Otto Hightower. Alicent is the daughter of Otto Hightower, who is the loyal Hand of the King and who views Prince Daemon as ""the greatest threat to the realm"". The 10-episode series, which is set to premiere on HBO in 2022, is based on George RR Martin’s Fire And Blood book. House Of The Dragon is just one of several Game Of Thrones-related projects in the works at HBO. There’s also a theatre show in development that's planned for Broadway and West End in 2023. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/shane-pow-apologises-drink-driving-charge-mediacorp-1412771,‘I made a mistake and I regret it deeply’: Shane Pow apologises for recent troubles,"Actor Shane Pow has made his first public statement following his recent drink driving charge on Apr 22. Pow, who left Mediacorp on May 4 after the company terminated his contract, wrote a lengthy apology on Instagram on Wednesday (May 5). In the note, Pow, who is 30, started out by saying that he has had a rough few weeks. He then apologised to his “family, friends and everyone who has shown me love and support”. “I made a mistake and I regret it deeply with all of my heart. I am sorry that I let you down,” he added. The actor thanked Mediacorp and his managers for the opportunities they had given him and apologised for the trouble he had caused. “I should have known better and be a better role model,” he admitted. Mediacorp said in a statement on Apr 26 that it would “part ways” with the actor following his recent run-ins with the law. Apart from the drink driving offence – his second – that took place in September last year, Pow was also part of a group of people who breached COVID-19 restrictions at a birthday party in October last year. If convicted of his latest drink driving charge, Pow faces a driving ban of at least five years as a repeat offender, a jail term of up to two years and a fine of between S$5,000 and S$20,000. He continued in the post: “I have to be responsible for my actions and face the consequences that I deserve and accept whatever punishment that comes my way. But I will make certain that this is the last of it. It is a hard lesson but I will better myself and come out stronger than before.” The actor left Mediacorp after completing his work on the upcoming Channel 8 drama The Heartland Hero. His role in the long-form series has been recast; Pow completed filming up to episode 31 and actor James Seah will take over the role for the rest of the 130-episode drama.   He ended his post by saying that he can only hope that “when all is said and done, you will find it in your heart to forgive my mistakes and allow me another chance to prove my sincerity once more”. Pow’s celebrity friends have written messages of support in response to his post. Chantalle Ng wrote, “We love you Shane!” while Ben Tan said, “We are all behind you”. Cynthia Koh wrote: “Mistakes we all make, most importantly is how you pick yourself up.”

Smith announced the new unscripted six-part series, tentatively titled Best Shape Of My Life, just two days after he posted a photo of himself on Instagram – wearing a jacket and black shorts and with a visible tummy – and declaring that he was in “the worst shape” of his life. In that initial post, Smith wrote: “I’m gonna be real wit yall – I’m in the worst shape of my life.” The post drew lots of support from fans and famous friends, who undoubtedly could relate to his confession. The post turned out to be a precursor to the announcement of this new series. In a follow-up post on Instagram on Tuesday (May 4), Smith shared another photo of himself – again in black shorts and with a visible tummy. He captioned it: “This is the body that carried me through an entire pandemic and countless days grazing thru the pantry. I love this body, but I wanna FEEL better. No more midnight muffins."" 
   A post shared by Will Smith (@willsmith) He added that he was teaming up with YouTube to get his health back on track. “Hope it works!” he said. The show, produced by Smith’s Westbrook Media, is described by YouTube as a “fun, funny, inspirational, wildly adventurous, and deeply entertaining story of Smith challenging himself to improve every aspect of his fitness”. It will also feature guests, including athletes, scientists and experts, and will debut next year. YouTube also announced a new four-part series featuring Alicia Keys that will go behind the scenes as she records a new album."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/court-hands-tax-win-michael-jackson-heirs-value-assets-image-1343296,"After years-long battle, court hands tax win to Michael Jackson's heirs","A US tax court has handed a major victory to the estate of Michael Jackson in a years-long battle, finding that the IRS wildly inflated the value at the time of his death of Jackson's assets and image, leading to an estate tax bill for his heirs that was far too high. The IRS had put the value of three disputed aspects of Jackson's worth at the time of his 2009 death at about US$482 million (S$643 million). In his decision issued on Monday (May 3), Judge Mark Holmes put that figure at US$111 million, far closer to the estate's own estimates. The estate’s executors said it was a huge and unambiguous victory for Jackson’s children. “We’re pleased,” co-executor John Branca told The Associated Press on Tuesday. “We always try to do the right thing. We tried from the beginning to follow the IRS rules and regulations, and relied on the best experts possible. It’s unfortunate that we were forced to litigate to protect ourselves.” The judge most disagreed with the IRS over the value of Jackson’s image and likeness. While the IRS put it at US$161 million, Holmes ruled it was just US$4.15 million. He noted that despite Jackson's acquittal on all counts at his 2005 trial for child molestation, the allegations continued to dog him, and while Jackson was selling out dates for a planned world tour when he died, he could not find a sponsor or merchandise partner. “The fact that he earned not a penny from his image and likeness in 2006, 2007, or 2008 shows the effect those allegations had, and continued to have, until his death,” Holmes wrote in the sprawling 271-page decision that tracks Jackson's fame and finances through most of his life. The tax fight had led to a bill of about US$700 million after an audit of the 2013 taxes on the estate, whose heirs are Jackson’s mother and three children, about US$200 million of it a penalty for underpaying. A new tax bill will now be calculated using Holmes’ figures, and it will include no penalties. Also in dispute were Jackson's 50 per cent stake in Sony/ATV Music Publishing, a catalog that includes 175 Beatles songs; and his interest in another catalog that includes the songs he wrote. The IRS expert had put those assets at a combined total of about US$320 million. The judge found that with Jackson's debts, both combined were worth only US$107 million at the time of his death. The ruling, awaited for years, resolves one of the few disputes that still hovered over Jackson’s estate nearly a dozen years after his unexpected death on Jun 25, 2009, after a lethal dose of the anaesthetic propofol. Another was resolved a week earlier when a judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by choreographer Wade Robson, one of two men featured in the 2019 documentary Leaving Neverland, who alleged Jackson sexually abused him as a child. The similar lawsuit of James Safechuck, the other man featured in the documentary, was dismissed in October. The men’s attorney called the decisions a dangerous precedent for protecting children, and said they plan to appeal. With years of disputes cleared and a pandemic-forced delay on projects lifting, the estate’s leaders feel like they are in an excellent spot to again start promoting Jackson’s legacy. “We’re at an absolute turning point,” Branca said. “I think people have come to realise that Michael was innocent of any charges and unable to protect himself. We’ve got a wonderful Broadway play coming, we’ll be reopening our Cirque du Soleil show soon and we’ve got some surprises coming.” The judge noted the huge success that the estate has seen since Jackson's death through such shows, a hit concert film, and several strategic decisions to sell assets. However, he said, the IRS appeared to be factoring those successes into its decisions rather than considering only the circumstances at the moment of Jackson's death, when things were considerably more grim after several years of waning popularity, poor management and reckless spending from Jackson. The judge mocked the estate’s initial valuing of Jackson’s image and likeness at only US$2,000, however, saying it was putting “one of the best known celebrities in the world – the King of Pop – at the price of a heavily used 20-year-old Honda Civic”.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/judge-orders-kevin-spacey-sexual-abuse-accuser-reveal-identity-1340976,US judge orders man accusing Kevin Spacey of sexual abuse to reveal his identity,"A man accusing Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey of sexually abusing him in the 1980s when he was 14 cannot proceed anonymously in court, a judge ruled on Monday (May 3). US District Judge Lewis A Kaplan in Manhattan refused to let the man proceed only as “CD” in a lawsuit filed in September in New York state court and later moved to federal court. The man had met Spacey in the actor's suburban New York acting class before the alleged abuse, according to the lawsuit which seeks over US$40 million in damages. Kaplan said CD’s privacy interest does not outweigh the presumption of open judicial proceedings and the prejudice to Spacey's defense that would occur if he could proceed anonymously. Individuals with information that might support Spacey also would not know to come forward, the judge added. CD since the 1990s had spoken to an unknown number of people about his claims against Spacey and had apparently cooperated for a New York magazine article that appeared on an online website, Vulture, in November 2017, Kaplan said. He said “the evidence suggests that CD knowingly and repeatedly took the risk that any of these individuals at one point or another would reveal his true identity in a manner that would bring that identity to wide public attention”. 
  Kaplan noted that CD also recruited for the lawsuit his co-plaintiff, Anthony Rapp, who has appeared in Rent on Broadway and in Star Trek: Discovery on television. The lawsuit said the older actor made a sexual advance to a teenage Rapp at a 1980s party. When Rapp first spoke publicly of his claim in 2017, others went public too and Spacey’s then-celebrated career abruptly halted. At the time, Spacey issued a statement saying he didn’t remember the encounter but apologised. The judge said claims by CD's lawyers that using their client's name would trigger post traumatic stress disorder and the anxiety, nightmares and depression that come with it is a consequence that likely cannot be prevented as the case proceeds and CD is ultimately forced to testify in public. He gave lawyers 10 days to reveal CD's name if he continued to make the claims. In an early March letter to the judge, attorney Peter Saghir said CD feels “extreme anxiety and psychological distress at even the thought of being required to proceed publicly” and had reluctantly decided to drop his claims if Kaplan ordered him to proceed publicly. Saghir and other lawyers for CD did not return requests for comment on Monday. Neither did lawyers for Spacey, who won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in American Beauty, a 1999 film in which he played a frustrated suburban father who lusts after his daughter's best friend. If CD drops his claims, he would not be the first to do so. Two years ago, a man who said Spacey groped him in a Nantucket bar in 2016 dropped his lawsuit. Meanwhile, investigators in England have not yet said whether they will bring criminal charges against Spacey in connection with accusations made against him there for events alleged to have occurred from 1996 to 2013.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/plus-size-boy-band-china-seeks-inspire-fans-2014926,'Plus-size' boy band in China seeks to inspire fans,"BEIJING: Gathered in a practice room, five generously proportioned young men in baggy black sweaters are patting their bellies and waggling their arms. Bearded with double chins, they shout “Hoo-Ha!” in time to upbeat African drums. The choreography is for the new song Good Belly by Produce Pandas. DING, Cass, Husky, Otter and Mr 17 weigh an average of 100kg and proudly call themselves “the first plus-sized boy band in China"". That's a radical departure from the industry standard seen in South Korean super groups such as BTS, whose lanky young members are sometimes referred to in China as “little fresh meat"". Yet, it seems to be working for Produce Pandas, who rose to fame after making it about halfway through Youth with You, an idol talent competition hosted by iQiyi, one of the largest video platforms in China. 
  On the show, mentors and audience voters pick nine finalists, either individuals or group members, to come together to form a new band. “The five of us may not have the standard look and shape of a boy band but we hope to use the term ‘plus-sized band' to break the aesthetic stereotypes,"" Cass said in an interview. The five, two of whom formerly sang in bars, are also unusual for their relatively advanced ages in an industry that worships youth and stamina. Most of their fellow contestants on Youth with You began South Korean-style training while in their teens. While Produce Pandas excited audiences and sparked discussion about how a pop idol should look, some taunting also appeared online. Users of China's Weibo microblog seized on the Chinese word for panda, a homonym of which appears in the Chinese name for the Japanese horror movie Ring, suggesting that watching them dance was similarly frightening. 
  Mr 17, the band's main dancer, was the oldest contestant in the competition at age 31. He had been discovered on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, where he posted clips of himself dancing in pajamas or while holding a bowl of rice. He nicknamed himself “17” after his favorite age. The former petroleum company worker said he doesn't feel old, but admits that after rehearsals, “I felt my energy was emptied"". The five were solicited from more than 300 hopefuls by Beijing-based DMDF Entertainment, which wanted to build a band that would be rotund and approachable as well as inspiring. Husky, who worked in IT, thought he would fit in perfectly because he has been chubby since primary school and has failed repeatedly to lose weight. 
  “I often work out one day then take a rest for the next three days, so the result is clear that I gained some weight instead,” he said. The point is “stay in shape (and) not to lose weight, but to lose fat"". Echoing Husky, Cass said the upside to being on such a team is that they don’t need to abstain when it comes to food. “We don’t mind eating like a horse. I feel sorry for the ‘little fresh meat' bands whose members must follow a diet to stay slim. I feel great whenever they look on enviously as we dig in!"" Team leader DING quit plus-sized modeling when he heard about auditioning for an “XXL” boy band, saying, “I feel this is probably the closest I can get to being on a magazine cover"". The five are now working on a new album, with songs including Pursue Your Dreams. 
  “Saddle up on the horse and pursue your dreams. Don’t idle your time away,” the lyrics go. Vocalist Otter, who has idolised the South Korean boy band Super Junior since he was seven, never thought he could be in a band that lives and performs together, and more importantly, encourages ordinary folk. “I hope people will feel encouraged when watching our performance,"" he said. They can think, “If Produce Pandas can make a breakthrough and perform on a bigger stage, then ‘why can’t I?'” "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/women/gal-gadot-wonder-woman-impact-national-geographic-1382706,Wonder Woman's Gal Gadot wants you to meet the real 'women of wonder' around the world,"Right smack in the middle of one of Rio de Janeiro’s most dangerous favelas, or shanty towns, is a ballet teacher with a mission. She’s been giving young girls a chance to dream of something positive amid all the violence and bullet-dodging by holding free dance lessons. The inspiring story of Tuany Nascimento and her programme Na Ponta dos Pes (On Tiptoe) was what gave a certain Wonder Woman actress the idea to hook up with National Geographic for a new series called Impact With Gal Gadot. “For a while we were looking for the right project until we finally met with Ryan Pallota, who had done this beautiful piece about a ballet dancer from Brazil and from the favelas,” Gadot told CNA Lifestyle. “We completely fell in love with the story of Tuany, the dancer with determination and leadership. And we decided to build the whole concept around her story.” The six-episode short-form docuseries is a project by Gadot, her husband Jaron Varsano and Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker Vanessa Roth, who are all executive producers. The show comprises stories of six women around the world, who have all become beacons of hope within their communities, despite tough circumstances. “They are the women of wonder of the world,” shared the actress. “We decided that each episode would focus on a different story on a different woman – ordinary people who do the extraordinary,” she said. With so many such stories of women around the world, was it difficult to come up with a short list? “Yeah, it was hard to choose,” she shared. “But essentially, we've been through two different processes. Because at the beginning, it was important for me to show the connectivity of humankind across the globe. So we had one story in the Middle East, one story in Asia, one story in America – to show that no matter where you are from, essentially we all suffer from similar issues.” She continued: “But then COVID-19 hits, so we had to choose whether or not we're going to wait or we're just going to have a different approach and just tell domestic stories.” Gadot admitted that in the beginning, she was worried about not finding enough impactful stories. “But I was happy to learn that there were so many different stories to choose from, (so much so) that it was actually a challenge to choose which one was going to be the right one. But essentially, we made sure that every episode has a different theme… and that all of them will feel relevant to the world we live in today.” Case in point was one episode about Kelsey Ellis, a trauma therapist in California, who lost her twin sister to COVID-19 and is turning her grief into something meaningful by helping other women cope through surf therapy. It was a story that was especially meaningful to Gadot. “I connected with all of them, they all resonated with me. But I think the only one that is like kind of irreversible and deals with loss is Kelsey’s story. She lost her twin sister Audrey to COVID-19. So that one really gets under my skin,” said Gadot, who is now pregnant with her third child. She continued: “But again, Kelsey is so inspiring. The way she took the loss, the trauma and the grief she felt, that she was dealing with? She turned it into a strength and a tool where she can help heal herself and others. Now that is just super incredible for me because you know the easiest thing is always to feel bad about yourself, feel sorry for yourself and be sad or angry. But she completely harnessed that into something good.” With documentaries as empowering for women as this, just how important is it to get men more involved and not be somehow turned off by what sceptics and detractors might consider “too much” feminism? 
  “It's very simple. We just need to include them in the conversation and to make sure that we're not turning against them,” said Gadot. “I love people for who they are and I don't love women more than I love men or vice versa – I love people for their hearts. And if we want to be really empowering, if we really want to reach the place where it wouldn't be an issue, and we wouldn't be asked about feminism and women empowerment, and all of that, we need to include them in the conversation and make them part of it. For Gadot, it’s important that her detractors know that women are not “making (men) our enemies”. “We are making them part of the solution,” she said. “No one is doing this to the women because they don't like us. It's just generations and generations and generations of behaviour that have just been the norm and now it's changing, finally, for the better. I have the best father that I love so much, I have a husband who I'm so in love with. I am pro everyone working together.” National Geographic Presents: IMPACT WITH GAL GADOT is currently available on National Geographic’s YouTube Channel. The documentary shorts will first release digitally and then culminate in a full-length documentary special to premiere on the National Geographic channel in September 2021 for Southeast Asia."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-lifestyle/5-people-arrested-violent-robbery-pop-star-lady-gagas-french-bulldogs-2015796,5 people arrested in violent robbery of pop star Lady Gaga's French bulldogs,"The woman who returned Lady Gaga’s stolen French bulldogs was among five people arrested in connection with the theft and shooting of the music superstar’s dog walker, Los Angeles police said on Thursday (Apr 29). Detectives do not believe that the thieves initially knew the dogs belonged to the pop star, the Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement. The motive for the Feb 24 robbery, investigators believe, was the value of the French bulldogs – which can run into the thousands of dollars. The dog walker, Ryan Fischer, is recovering from a gunshot wound and has called the violence “a very close call with death” in social media posts. He was walking Lady Gaga's three dogs – named Asia, Koji and Gustav – in Hollywood just off the famed Sunset Boulevard when he was attacked. Video from the doorbell camera of a nearby home shows a white sedan pulling up and two men jumping out. They struggled with Fischer and one pulled a gun and fired a single shot before fleeing with two of the dogs, Koji and Gustav. The video captured Fischer’s screams of, “Oh, my God! I’ve been shot!” and “Help me!” and “I’m bleeding out from my chest!” Lady Gaga offered a US$500,000 (S$660,000) reward – “no questions asked” – to be reunited with the dogs. The singer had been in Rome at the time filming a movie. The dogs were returned two days later to an LAPD station by a woman who originally appeared to be “uninvolved and unassociated” with the crime, police initially said. The woman, identified Thursday as 50-year-old Jennifer McBride, had reported that she’d found the dogs and responded to an email address associated with the reward, police said. McBride turned out to be in a relationship with the father of one of the suspects, the LAPD said Thursday. It was not immediately clear if she had received the reward. Police arrested James Jackson, 18; Jaylin White, 19; and Lafayette Whaley, 27, in connection with the violence. They are charged with attempted murder, conspiracy to commit robbery and second-degree robbery, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. Jackson, who authorities say was the shooter, also faces charges of assault with a semiautomatic firearm and a felon carrying a concealed firearm in a vehicle. White faces one count of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury. White's father, 40-year-old Harold White, and McBride were arrested and accused of being accessories to the attack. The elder White also was charged with one count of possession of a firearm and McBride faces a charge of receiving stolen property. Jackson, Whaley and the Whites are all documented gang members, according to the LAPD. The five suspects were scheduled to be arraigned on Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. It was not immediately clear if they had attorneys who could speak on their behalf. All five were being held on US$1 million bail each, online jail records show. Lady Gaga did not immediately address the arrests on her social media accounts on Thursday afternoon. Fischer and Lady Gaga's representatives did not respond to requests for comment. (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/the-weeknd-16-nominations-billboard-awards-pop-smoke-juice-wrld-2066401,The Weeknd scores 16 nominations for Billboard Awards after Grammys snub,"The Weeknd was snubbed by the Grammys but he’s the leading nominee at the 2021 Billboard Music Awards, where rappers Pop Smoke and Juice WRLD earned multiple posthumous nominations, including top artist, and disgraced country singer Morgan Wallen is a six-time nominee. The Weeknd, Juice WRLD and Pop Smoke – the third most-nominated act – are up for top artist along with Taylor Swift and Drake, the show’s most decorated winner of all-time. The Billboard Awards will air live on May 23. The Weeknd earned 16 nominations, including top male artist, top R&B artist, top Billboard 200 album for After Hours and top Hot 100 song for Blinding Lights, the No 1 song of last year. DaBaby – thanks to his own hit Rockstar and his guest appearance on Jack Harlow’s What’s Poppin – is second with 11 bids, and he will battle himself in categories like top rap song, top streaming song and top collaboration. Pop Smoke, who follows with 10 nominations, died last February at age 20 as his songs and mixtapes began to make a splash on the pop and rap charts. His official debut album, Shoot For The Stars, Aim For The Moon, was released last July and dominated the charts and streaming services, along with platinum-selling songs like For The Night, What You Know About Love and Dior, which earned him a Grammy nomination this year. His Billboard nominations include top new artist, top male artist, top rap artist and top Billboard 200 album. Juice WRLD died in Dec 2019 at age 21. His posthumous album, Legends Never Die, was released a week after Pop Smoke’s album and set several records on the Billboard charts, becoming the biggest posthumous debut in 23 years since Tupac and Notorious BIG posthumously released albums in 1997. His seven Billboard nominations include top male artist, top rap artist and top Billboard 200 album. Others battling The Weeknd, Pop Smoke and Juice WRLD for top album include Lil Baby’s My Turn and Swift’s folklore, which last month won the star her third album of the year Grammy. Morgan Wallen wasn’t allowed to compete at this month’s Academy of Country Music Awards because the singer was caught on camera using a racial slur earlier this year, but he’s one of the top nominees at the Billboard Awards. His six nominations include top song sales artist, top country artist and top country album for Dangerous: The Double Album, which is currently No 3 on the pop charts and continues to sell extremely well despite Wallen’s crisis moment. He’s even a double nominee in top country song, competing with the hits Chasin’ You and More Than My Hometown. Wallen is a contender because the Billboard nominees are based on album and digital sales, streaming, radio airplay and social engagement, and they “are not chosen by a voting committee or membership organisation,"" dick clark productions said. The producers said though Wallen is a multiple nominee, they won’t allow him to participate in the show. “Morgan Wallen is a finalist this year based on charting. As his recent conduct does not align with our core values, we will not be including him on the show in any capacity (performing, presenting, accepting),” the statement read. “It is heartening and encouraging to hear that Morgan is taking steps in his anti-racist journey and starting to do some meaningful work. We plan to evaluate his progress and will consider his participation in future shows.” Wallen's not the leading country music nominee though – that goes to breakthrough singer Gabby Barrett, who is the most-nominated woman with nine bids. She dominated both the country and pop charts with her Charlie Puth-assisted hit I Hope, and she’s up for honours like top new artist, top Hot 100 song, top radio song, top country album and top collaboration. She’s the sole woman nominated for top country artist and top country song. The Billboard Awards are based on the chart period of Mar 21, 2020 through Apr 3, 2021. Two of the 51 categories are fan-voted, including top collaboration and top social artist, where Asian acts dominate. Nominees include K-pop groups BTS, BLACKPINK and Seventeen; Filipino boy band SB19; and Ariana Grande. Others who scored multiple nominations include Bad Bunny, Chris Brown, Megan Thee Stallion, Doja Cat and Justin Bieber. (Source: AP)"

Page spoke with the media mogul in an interview that will air on Apple TV+ on Friday (Apr 30) as part of Winfrey’s series, The Oprah Conversation. Previous episodes included chats with former US President Barack Obama and country singer Dolly Parton. In one of the preview clips, the 34-year-old actor – formerly Ellen Page – was shown getting emotional and tearing up as he (Page’s preferred pronoun) talked about what part of his transition journey brought him the most joy. He said, ""It's, you know, getting out of the shower and the towel is around your waist, and you're looking at yourself in the mirror and you're just like 'There I am’. And I'm not having the moment where I'm panicked... It's being able to touch my chest and feel comfortable in my body probably for the first time."" The actor, who was nominated for an Oscar in 2008 for his role in Juno, explained that he was crying “tears of joy”. Page also told Winfrey, as seen in another preview clip, that it felt imperative for him to detail his coming out journey publicly because of the time we’re in right now where there’s been “horrible backlash” towards trans people, particularly trans youth. 
  ""It felt important and selfish for myself and my own wellbeing and my mental health and also with this platform, I have the privilege that I have and knowing the pain, and the difficulties and the struggles I faced in my life, let alone what so many other people are facing, it absolutely felt just crucial and important for me to share that."" 
   See an exclusive clip from Elliot Page’s upcoming interview with Oprah Winfrey:��: https://t.co/DT2qBXMCao pic.twitter.com/Jv6iAMoif1 The Umbrella Academy and X-Men actor has also opened up in a new Vanity Fair interview with trans journalist Thomas Page McBee where he said that the most significant difference in his life after coming out as a trans man is that he’s “really able to just exist”. He shared, “This is the first time I’ve even felt really present with people, that I can be just really relaxed and not have an anxiety that’s always pulling”."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/james-seah-replaces-shane-pow-drama-heartland-hero-1412746,James Seah to replace Shane Pow in upcoming drama series The Heartland Hero,"James Seah will replace Shane Pow in the upcoming 130-episode Channel 8 drama The Heartland Hero. This comes after Mediacorp announced earlier this week that it will “part ways” with Pow following his drink driving charge, which came to light on Apr 22.   The show’s executive producer Leong Lye Lin told 8 DAYS in an interview on Wednesday (Apr 28) that Pow will complete filming up to episode 31 while Seah will join the production in the second week of May. There will no change to the plot and no explanation in the show as to why the actors have been switched. According to Leong, Pow’s character in the long-form drama is a “cute and happy” Ah Beng who has just been released from prison and is encouraged to start afresh by his older brother, played by Elvin Ng. Leong also shared that Seah was chosen to replace Pow as he was suitable in terms of age (they’re both 30), looks and acting skills. “Some might assume it’s an easy character to play, but it’s not ’cos you have to be someone who is naughty yet lovable at the same time.” She also said that the character needed to be “very manly”. Another important reason was that Seah was available, having just completed shooting his previous show. Seah, who was also present at the interview, told the entertainment portal that his thoughts about replacing his good friend in the show were “complicated”. He added: “I was sad, but when Shane heard about it, he was very encouraging and told me, ‘Bro, if you need any help, let me know. I’ve got your back.’ I’m really touched that I have such a good friend.” Leong also revealed that she had just seen Pow and he was doing well. She said he’s focused on finishing his work and was being “very brave”. “All we can do now is to give him our biggest encouragement and hope that he can complete his remaining scenes smoothly.” Pow faces a driving ban of at least five years, a jail term of up to two years and a fine between S$5,000 and S$20,000 if he is convicted of his recent drink driving charge as that would make him a repeat offender. He was charged in court on Apr 22 for the September 2020 incident. According to Mediacorp’s Apr 26 statement, Pow will leave the company on May 4 after completing his outstanding work. Actor and comedian Mark Lee, who also heads his own entertainment company, recently shared in an interview that he’s open to signing Pow on in his company if he “doesn’t mind joining”. He added that drink driving is a serious charge but he also feels that everyone “deserves a second chance”."

The 27-year-old posted a photo of himself on Instagram on Sunday (Apr 26) and again a day later sporting dreadlocks, which had critics swiftly calling him out for being racially insensitive. Many commenters on his post expressed dismay at his chosen hairstyle, with one person writing, “It’s really disappointing to see you with dreads. I thought you educated yourself”. Another commenter wrote: “This is cultural appropriation… I know you can do better”.   A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber)   Others defended him, though, saying that “this is just a hairstyle” and that he can wear his hair however he liked. Bieber faced similar criticisms of cultural appropriation in 2016 when he wore his hair as cornrows. Speaking to UK newspaper the Guardian, Irene Shelley, editor of Black Beauty and Hair magazine, said of Bieber’s latest look: “I think why people are annoyed with Justin Bieber casually wearing locs is that it’s seen as not respecting the origins of the style…. (He) is seen as a dilettante, a person who’s dipping his toe in the culture, without any real commitment or knowledge of the style’s history”."

K-pop sensation BTS announced on Tuesday (Apr 27) that it will release its second English-language single titled Butter on May 21. The song is set to be a “dance pop track brimming with the smooth yet charismatic charm of BTS”, according to the band’s label BigHit Music. Their first English single, Dynamite, made history by becoming the first song by an all-South Korean act to debut at No 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. BTS also became the first K-pop group to be nominated for a Grammy when it scored a nod in the best pop group performance category at this year’s ceremony. To mark the announcement, the group held an hour-long livestream on YouTube featuring a slab of butter bearing the BTS logo that eventually melts into the shape of a heart. BTS fans are undoubtedly excited about the new music although some have expressed sadness that the new track will be in English. One Twitter user called Vincent wrote that although he was “hyped for Butter”, he was also a little sad that it’s not in Korean. He said: “(I know) people are gonna come at me saying I’m ungrateful or whatever, but look at the bigger picture. If the music industry wasn’t centered around America + English, would they feel the need to sing in English??” Others have chosen to focus on the positive aspect, that is, new music from their idols. Twitter user Fatima wrote: “I am blocking out negativity/downers when it comes to butter. bts are comfort & joy for me, and I’m looking forward to a fun new song from them and I’m excited to see what they’re doing with it.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/britney-spears-set-to-speak-in-court-on-conservatorship-2066366,Pop star Britney Spears set to speak in court on her conservatorship,"Britney Spears has asked to address the court to talk about the conservatorship that has controlled her life and finances for 13 years, her attorney said on Tuesday (Apr 27), and a judge scheduled a June date to hear from her. Spears' court-appointed attorney, Samuel Ingham III, said in a hearing in Los Angeles Superior Court that she had asked to speak to the court soon, and agreed with Judge Brenda Penny on a Jun 23 date. He did not say what she would specifically like to say. It would be the first known time in more than two years that the 39-year-old pop star has spoken in court. The last time, on May 10, 2019, the courtroom was sealed. None of what she said became public. The judge may also close the June hearing to the media and public. But Spears, through Ingham, has been pushing for more transparency in the court proceedings and documents of the conservatorship. Spears did not take part in Tuesday's hearing, and she very rarely attends them. As with nearly every Spears hearing, about 50 fans from the so-called #FreeBritney movement picketed outside the downtown courthouse. 
  On Tuesday, they carried signs that read ""CONSERVATORSHIP IS SLAVERY"" and “THIS IS TOXIC"". One woman, wearing a #FreeBritney T-shirt, had her head shaved during the demonstration in solidarity with Spears, who famously shaved her own head just before the conservatorship was put in place in 2008. Spears herself has said in court documents and on social media that she welcomes the support for her and scrutiny of her circumstances that have come from fans. Through Ingham, she has been pushing in court to incrementally exercise more control over her life and finances. But she has yet to request that the court end the conservatorship. (Source: AP)"

Neelofa's husband Muhammad Haris Mohd Ismail, also known as PU Riz, was also given a compound notice for RM10,000 for violating regulations on inter-state travel. The couple had travelled to Langkawi shortly after their wedding in what they described as a work trip but which many people speculated was their honeymoon after videos emerged of them going on a cable car ride and jet-skiing. 
  Mohamad Zainal said 20 members of the couple’s family were also issued compound notices of RM1,500 each, totalling RM30,000, for failing to observe physical distancing of at least 1m apart during the marriage solemnisation ceremony on Mar 27. ""All of them will be issued the compound, totalling RM60,000, today, with no discount on the compound issued to Neelofa and her husband,” he said in the statement. On the offences committed by Neelofa, Mohamad Zainal said, the first was as the organiser of the event whereby she failed to comply with the directive issued by the Health Director-General on compliance with the SOP on social distancing at social events. The second was for breaching regulations on inter-state travel. On Mar 27, a picture was posted on social media showing a number of guests at Neelofa's wedding failing to comply with the SOP on social distancing. Guests were seen not wearing masks and not following safe distancing rules by sitting shoulder to shoulder. Neelofa apologised for the violations in a video sent to the media on Apr 9. She said: “I sincerely apologise for violating the SOP, within and beyond my knowledge on these two matters. My husband and I admit and accept any actions or decision from the authorities.” She also apologised for being insensitive towards the issue. “There are a lot of things I might have overlooked and I should have set a better example,” she added.

This was confirmed by his management agency on Tuesday (Apr 27) and reported by several media outlets.  Lee is an original cast member of the variety game show and has been with the popular series for 11 years. According to his agency, KingKong by Starship, he will film his last episode on May 24. The agency said that the actor has been having trouble keeping up with the physical demands of the show due to an injury he sustained in a car accident last year. Despite receiving regular physical therapy, the agency said there were times when Lee “felt that it was difficult to maintain the top physical condition during Running Man filming”. After long discussions with the production staff, crew, fellow cast members and his agency, Lee decided that he “needed time to recuperate, both physically and mentally”. ""We sincerely thank all the viewers for the love they showed Lee Kwang-soo on Running Man,"" the agency said.  TV network SBS also released a statement announcing Lee’s departure and urging viewers to “show warm support and encouragement to Lee Kwang-soo and the members who made a difficult decision”. The show, which first aired in July 2010, will continue with its other members."

In her Friday (Apr 23) appearance on talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the Wonder Woman actress related that she had accidentally sliced off the top of her finger while chopping salad after having had a few drinks. And what’s worse – her husband then threw the fingertip down the garbage disposal in a moment of panic and disgust. The actress laughed and said, “Yeah it was a mess, we were a mess. Then I stopped cooking and stopped drinking”. The 35-year-old explained that the incident took place in the early days of the pandemic, “when you start drinking mimosa or sangria or whatever at 11am”. “And then I decided I’m gonna make a cabbage salad, because that’s what one wants to do. So anyways I started to chop the thing and I chopped the top of my finger.” Hilariously, host Kimmel could sympathise because he had also cut his fingers and the two bonded over how they both liked to touch the tip of their fingers now. Gadot also said she was waiting for it to grow back, but it never did. When asked if she went to the hospital after the incident, Gadot, who's pregnant with her third daughter, explained that they did not as there was nothing to “sew back on”. She said, “Yaron (her husband) went to the chopping board, and he held the finger. Then he got so disgusted that he threw it into the garbage disposal”. During the interview, Gadot also discussed her new six part docu-series called IMPACT With Gal Gadot, which features real-life superwomen around the world."

The actress, who starred in Minari, won the best supporting actress trophy on Sunday (Apr 25), edging out fellow nominees Glenn Close, Maria Bakalova, Olivia Colman and Amanda Seyfried. Youn was also only the second Asian actress to ever win in the category after Japanese-born Miyoshi Umeki picked up a trophy for her role in Sayonara in 1957. Following her win, her peers in the South Korean entertainment industry swiftly sent their congratulations, including actor Lee Byung-hun, who shared a photo of the actress with her trophy and wrote “Impossible is not a fact, it’s just an opinion”. He included the hashtags #Bravo and #AcademyAwards. The two stars worked together in Keys To The Heart. 
   A post shared by LeeByungHun 이병헌 (@byunghun0712) Actress Song Hye-kyo posted a photo on her Instagram stories of Youn with her trophy. She wrote, “Sunsaengnim, congratulations!” together with a rose emoji.

Jeon said through her agency that she was “so proud”. “Simply saying congratulations is not nearly enough, but I wholeheartedly congratulate her and wish she will bask in this great joy.” Parasite star Choi Woo-shik said that he cried as he watched the broadcast as it was an outcome that everyone wanted.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/explainer-weird-oscars-ending-248966,Explainer: What was with that weird Oscar ending and why did the show look different?,"The 93rd annual Academy Awards were always going to be a bit surreal this year. The pandemic changed many of the usual rhythms and traditions of the Oscars on Sunday (Apr 25) night. There was a glamour-filled red carpet but no onlookers or teams of publicists. There were in-person, mask-less winners but not in the usual order, and the speeches were never drowned out with play-off music. Compounding the differences this year was a telecast, steered by producers Steven Soderbergh, Jesse Collins and Stacy Sher, that wanted a new look and feel to an often stodgy, persistently unchanging ceremony. But what was with that ending? How staged was Glenn Close's dance? And where, oh where, was the play-off music? Here are the answers to some of the night's befuddlements. THE ENDING – WHY? The Oscars have known more dramatic and more shambolic endings (""Envelopegate"" was a mere four years ago) but this may have set a new bar for anti-climactic. You would swear someone even played a sad trombone. Going into Sunday, the show's producers had said they wanted to take “some big swings"" in the telecast. One turned out to be switching the normal awards order. Best director, usually one of the final awards, was handed out mid-show. Best picture was third-to-last and the night's final two awards were best actress and best actor. Presumably, the thinking was that best actor would go to Chadwick Boseman (he won virtually every best-actor trophy leading up to the Oscars), and thus end the ceremony on a meaningful note of tribute. But there had been hints of an upset. Two weeks earlier, Anthony Hopkins won at the BAFTAs, an award he was also absent for – though the show managed to track him down in his native Wales to talk to the BAFTA press. The Oscars had pressed nominees to attend, if possible, or join from a remote location. But the 83-year-old Hopkins (who became the oldest actor to win an Oscar, his second) elected not to travel to Los Angeles or the hub in London. Knighted living legends who adore the Welsh countryside get to do that. Only the next morning did Sir Anthony, with a bucolic vista behind him, post an Instagram video of thanks, and a few words on the late Boseman. “At 83 years of age, I did not expect to get his award, I really didn't,” he said. 
  Posthumous Oscars are also hard to come by. There's a reason it's only happened twice before among actors (Peter Finch and Heath Ledger). For some voters, it can seem like a wasted vote, since the honoree isn't there to accept it. And one of the longest Oscar seasons ever (the ceremony was postponed two months) may have sapped some of the momentum for Boseman, who died last August; some may have felt he had been already honoured by previous awards like at the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild Awards. Perhaps the Independent Spirit Awards on Thursday  supplied foreshadowing when Riz Ahmed (Sound Of Metal) was chosen over Boseman. The Oscars haven't always ended with best picture, but it's been more than 40 years since another category was last. Even the best picture winners – who usually conclude the telecast with trophies raised – weren’t expecting it. “It surely was a surprise,” said Nomadland producer Dan Janvey backstage to reporters. “I think a lot of us grew up watching the Oscars and I’ve gotten used to it being last.” But on Sunday, the category switcheroo culminated in an absent winner and a strange empty-stage finale – a fitting end to a thoroughly strange movie year. WHERE WAS THE PLAY-OFF MUSIC? No snark was part of the mandate of this year's Oscars, Sher said. From top to bottom, the show was a sincere celebration of cinema and the night's nominees. Introductions were lengthy and detailed. And when winners clutched their Oscars, they were given wide latitude to speak. Not once did music director Questlove turn up the music. This was partly because the show had more time. Performances of the best song nominees were pre-taped and aired during the red-carpet preshow, meaning the broadcast – which also had few comedy bits – wasn't in a race. That went with the overall tone of the show: To earnestly celebrate the artistry and craft of moviemaking. On-camera talent, Soderbergh noted before the show, only accounts for a fraction of a film set. 
  WHY DID FRANCES MCDORMAND HOWL? “We give this one to our wolf,"" McDormand said while accepting the best picture award for Nomadland. McDormand, a producer as well as star of Chloe Zhao's film, let a howl that could have been a reference to her nomadic, lone wolf character in a melancholic open-road tale about the primal necessities of life. But McDormand's howl was more pointedly poignant than that. It was a way to honour Michael Wolf Snyder, the film's production sound mixer, who died in March at the age of 35. “That howling to the moon is for Wolf,” Zhao explained to members of the press. McDormand earlier said of Snyder in a statement to Variety: “Wolf recorded our heartbeats. Our every breath. For me, he is Nomadland."" WHY DID THE SHOW LOOK DIFFERENT? Soderbergh conceived of the telecast a movie, complete with opening credits (presenters were the cast), a slinky opening tracking shot with Regina King and all the technical aspects of film. That included a more letterbox format, a frame rate of 24 instead of the more typical television rates of 30 or 60. Whatever you thought of the show, it had to be the best looking Oscars in ages. WAS CLOSE'S DANCE REHEARSED? Well of course it was. Close did her best to suggest her knowledge of Experience Unlimited’s Da Butt (featured in Spike Lee's School Daze) was completely off the cuff, but Lil Rel Howery acknowledged during the post-show that their music trivia bit had been discussed beforehand. Still, credit the 74-year-old Close for being willing to boogie shortly after losing out on an Oscar for the eighth time – a record among living performers. (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/anthony-hopkins-honours-chadwick-boseman-after-oscar-win-245161,Anthony Hopkins honours late actor Chadwick Boseman after Oscar win,"Anthony Hopkins has honoured the late Chadwick Boseman after winning the best actor Oscar, hailing his fellow performer as a man “taken from us far too early”. The 83-year-old Hopkins took the award for his performance in The Father, becoming the oldest actor or actress to win an Oscar, edging out Christopher Plummer’s supporting actor win at age 82 in the 2010 film Beginners. Hopkins’ win was anticlimactic on a show where he wasn’t present to accept the trophy. Presenter Joaquin Phoenix’s reading of his name was the last dramatic moment of a most unusual ceremony. Hours later, Hopkins made a belated acceptance speech in a short video message posted on Instagram, standing in front of the rolling green fields of his native Wales. 
   A post shared by Anthony Hopkins (@anthonyhopkins) “I want to pay tribute to Chadwick Boseman, who was taken from us far too early,” he said. “I really did not expect this, so I feel very privileged and honoured.” It is Hopkins' first Oscar since he was victorious for playing Hannibal Lecter. Despite his pedigree, Hopkins was a surprise winner of the Academy Award for best actor for his work on The Father, playing the role of a man fighting dementia. Boseman had been expected to win the award, which, in a very rare move from the academy, was the last to be handed out this year instead of best picture. Boseman was nominated for Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, his final film before cancer claimed his life last August at age 43. The Black Panther star had been diagnosed with the disease four years earlier and kept it private as he continued working. Hopkins has received four other Oscar nominations, including last year for his role as Benedict in The Two Popes; as the eponymous president in Nixon; John Quincy Adams in the slavery drama Amistad, and a loyal butler in The Remains Of The Day. In a 2016 interview with The Associated Press, Hopkins said an acting career wasn’t in the plan. “I wanted to be a musician, but I drifted into this business by mistake,” he said. “I’m still looking over my shoulder thinking somebody will say, ‘Sorry, Tony, you’re in the wrong business.’” 
  Hopkins, who started in the theatre but found it ill-fitting, focused on movie roles after getting his screen break playing Richard the Lionheart in The Lion In Winter in 1968. In 2000, he became a US citizen. He'd been knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1993, giving him the right to use “Sir” before his name. In Associated Press writer Jake Coyle’s review of “The Father,”  he called it riveting “to see Hopkins play all these ever-fluctuating turns of mood. ... For an actor so intense, so rigorously unsentimental, this is his Lear”. Besides Boseman, the other nominees were Riz Ahmed, Gary Oldman and Steven Yeun."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/style/celebrity-beauty-advice-mothers-iman-fandi-ann-kok-tanya-chua-1969881,These 9 celebrities share the best beauty advice from their mothers,"When it comes to life lessons and advice, mothers often know best. And that could also apply to skincare tips. In fact, many of us have our mums to thank for starting us on some sort of beauty routine – be it suggesting our first cleanser, moisturiser or sunblock. And with Mother’s Day coming up in a couple of weeks, CNA Lifestyle caught up with nine celebrities who revealed the best beauty advice they received from their mothers – or observations they gleaned from them. Keen to find out how Wendy Jacobs schooled her model-singer daughter Iman on the finer points of how to love her skin? How Ann Kok’s mum saved her from sagging and wrinkled skin on her neck, otherwise known as “turkey neck”? Or why Tanya Chua’s 77-year-old mother doesn’t have liver spots? Read on.  
  TANYA CHUA, 46, SINGER “My mother has amazing skin. At 77, she doesn’t have any liver spots because she takes such good care of her skin and is always experimenting with beauty products. When I was younger, I would experiment with the latest fads and imagined that expensive creams and lotions would help me achieve good skin. “But as I move into my late 40s, I now pay more attention to the inner voices of my body. I believe that your skin is the best ‘doctor’ as it tells you what the body needs – physically, mentally and emotionally. Staying young and wrinkle-free is not the goal but rather to let our skin radiate and tell their own life story as you gracefully age.   “My beauty routine now is very simple: Cleanser, serum and moisturiser. But I do make an effort to use an infrared mask (which looks like a Robocop mask) that I put on for 10 minutes every morning – it’s the first thing I do when I wake up. It helps rejuvenate and heal the skin of any possible inflammation and sensitivity. And I also do hairbrush tapping all over my head, face and lymphatic nodes to help with circulation. “I find that being a little childlike and playful not only helps inspire me musically, this mindset also helps in ‘looking’ younger than one’s age. That and drinking plenty of water.” JASMINE SOKKO, 25, SINGER “Mum does not use any makeup because she always felt that confidence and beauty should stem from within. As a result, I was exposed to makeup at a much later age than most girls. She was, however, very religious about the use of sunscreen. “She taught me to always prioritise skincare over makeup and her philosophy has indirectly impacted my minimal beauty regimen which only involves cleansing, moisturising and wearing sunscreen. “I hope this simple approach to skincare becomes a generational thing that my future daughter passes down to her daughter and so on.” 
  ANN KOK, 48, ACTRESS 
   A post shared by ANN KOK (@ann_kok) “Mum used to always tell me that our neck is very important which is why my beauty regimen not only cares for the face but the neck and body as well. I adhere to a simple four-step skincare regimen – cleansing, toning, using a serum and a moisturiser. When possible, I love to treat my skin to a hydration mask. Drinking enough water – especially warm water – is like slapping on a hydration mask for the body. “If there’s one beauty tip I want to share, that would be to be responsible towards your own health. Take care of your body, drink warm water and wear sunscreen. And never forget to take off every stitch of makeup before going to bed.” KIMBERLY CHIA, 25, ACTRESS “Mum absolutely loves her facial masks, in particular she loves concocting a DIY version out of yoghurt and lemon. I picked up this masking habit from her, it helps that I adore sheet masks so I try to apply one every day to give my skin extra hydration. While masking, I would massage my face with a roller to debloat and improve blood circulation. It’s so relaxing. “I like experimenting with new beauty products but regardless of what I introduce into my beauty regimen, I never forget to use sunblock. I didn’t start using sunblock as early as I should which resulted in a few dark spots on my cheeks. If I have a daughter, I would definitely make sure she starts using sunblock as early in life as possible.” 
  DAWN YEOH, 34, ACTRESS “Less is more – that’s what Mum used to say. She doesn’t believe in doing more than what is necessary. But no thanks to climate change, our diet today is very different, it is therefore so much harder to get good skin by doing less. Thankfully the ever-evolving beauty innovations now offer state-of-the-art products that can help us achieve the goal of good skin health. “I’m always exchanging beauty tips with friends, because no one knows everything and there will always be something to learn. One thing I’ve learned is that nothing is an overnight elixir. Consistency is key to reaping benefits. “Getting plenty of sleep, drinking lots of water and using multi-purpose skincare products help me take care of my skin.” JACELYN TAY, 45, ENTREPRENEUR “Mum has never used any commercial facial products in her life. She uses soap to wash her face and relies on cucumber and coconut oil to nourish her skin. She used to apply aloe vera from the garden on me. This helped me understand from a young age that we don’t need a lot of skincare products to have good skin. “Eating right is key. Good skin comes from good gut health, a clean and healthy internal system allows the body to absorb nutrients from the food we consume. Our skin is the greatest detoxification organ and our body has the ability to tighten, nourish and hydrate skin from within.   “My beauty regimen is somewhat unusual. I only use a 100 per cent natural oil as my makeup remover, a cleansing milk to wash my face, and a body cream as moisturiser and makeup base.”  
  IMAN FANDI, 20, MODEL AND MUSICIAN “Always clean off your makeup and use a good moisturiser that suits my skin – that’s what Mum always tells me. It’s not how expensive a product is but rather to consistently care for my skin that matters. Because of the heat and humidity, I found that water- or gel-based moisturisers work better for me as cream moisturisers tend to disagree with my skin. “When it comes to taking care of my skin, eating healthily and sticking to a simple skincare routine are vital. My routine entails cleansing, toning and moisturising, and if I remember, sunscreen.” JESSECA LIU, 42, ACTRESS “We lived on an island where the sun was strong. Back then, Mum knew little about sun protection and as a result, she has pigmentation on the face and the body. She was worried that we would suffer the same fate, therefore she inculcated in us the habit of using sunscreen from a young age.    “For me, an essential morning beauty ritual is massaging my face with a beauty device. If that isn't enough to get rid of the morning bloat then I would turn to Gua Sha to dispel it. I’m very particular about how I cleanse my face. Even if I’m only wearing sunscreen, I will clean my face with a water-based makeup remover, followed by a cleansing cream. And I only wash my face with cold water."" 
  CHANTALLE NG, 25, ACTRESS 
   A post shared by Chantalle Ng 黄暄婷 (@chantalleng) “I learned from Mum that caring for the body starts from within, she is a firm believer of the benefits of TCM. It’s never about splurging on skincare but instead a sensible diet and maintaining a healthy exercise regimen are more important. “Mum is very blase about skincare, the only thing she is adamant about is using skincare that consists only of natural ingredients and that’s a habit I picked up from her. Although I think I’m a lot more extreme than her, I would take the time to research each and every ingredient on the ingredient list to find out exactly what they are just to be sure they will not cause harm to my skin.     “I’m obsessed about getting my skincare regimen right especially now that I have dark spots as a result of not taking good enough care of my skin when I was younger. I’m very diligent about sun protection now.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/oscars-2021-winners-nomadland-chloe-zhao-red-carpet-245991,"It was a socially distanced Oscars 2021: Nomadland, Chloe Zhao and a red carpet","Chloe Zhao’s Nomadland, a wistful portrait of itinerant lives on open roads across the American West, won best picture on Sunday (Apr 25) at the 93rd Academy Awards, where the China-born Zhao also became just the second woman to win best director, and the first woman of colour. The Nomadland victory, while widely expected, nevertheless capped the extraordinary rise of Zhao, a lyrical filmmaker whose winning film is just her third, and which – with a budget less than US$5 million (S$6.6 million) and featuring a cast populated by non-professional actors – ranks as one of the most modest-sized movies to win Hollywood’s top honour.  Zhao’s next film, Marvel’s Eternals, has a budget approximately 40 times that of Nomadland. Only Kathryn Bigelow, 11 years ago for The Hurt Locker, had previously won best director. But Nomadland, as a plain-spoken meditation on solitude, grief and grit, stuck a chord in a pandemic-ravaged year. It made for an unlikely Oscar champ: A film about people who gravitate to the margins took centre stage. “I have always found goodness in the people I’ve met everywhere I went in the world,” said Zhao when accepting best director. “This is for anyone who has the faith and the courage to hold on to the goodness in themselves and to hold on the goodness in other no matter how difficult it is to do that.” With a howl, Nomadland star Frances McDormand implored people to seek out her film and others on the big screen. Released by the Disney-owned Searchlight Pictures, Nomadland premiered at a drive in and debuted in theatres, but found its largest audience on Hulu. “Please watch our movie on the largest screen possible and one day very, very soon, take everyone you know into a theatre, shoulder to shoulder in that dark space, and watch every film that’s represented here tonight,” McDormand said. Soon after, McDormand won best actress, too. The win puts McDormand (previously a winner for Fargo and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri) in rare company as a three-time acting winner. Only Katherine Hepburn (a four-time winner) has won best actress more times. In the night’s biggest surprise, best actor went to Anthony Hopkins for the dementia drama The Father. The award had been widely expected to go to Chadwick Boseman for his final performance in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom. Hopkins was not in attendance. The most ambitious award show held during the pandemic, the Oscars rolled out a red carpet and restored some glamour to the nearly century-old movie institution, but with a much transformed – and in some ways downsized – telecast.  It was a year when, to paraphrase Norma Desmond, the pictures got smaller were overwhelmingly seen in the home, not in the big screen, during a pandemic year that forced theatres close and prompted radical change in Hollywood. It was also perhaps the diverse Academy Awards ever, with more women and more actors of colour nominated than ever before – and Sunday brought a litany of records and firsts across many categories, spanning everything from hairstyling to composing to acting.  It was, some observers said, a sea change for an awards harshly criticised as “OscarsSoWhite” in recent years, leading the film academy to greatly expand membership. The ceremony – fashioned as a movie of its own and styled as a laidback party – kicked off with opening credits and a slinky Regina King entrance, as the camera followed the actress and One Night In Miami director in one take as she strode with an Oscar in hand into Los Angeles’ Union Station and onto the stage. Inside the transit hub (trains kept running), nominees sat at cozy, lamp-lit tables around an intimate amphitheatre. Some moments – like Glenn Close getting down to “Da Butt” – were more relaxed, but the ceremony couldn't just shake off the past 14 months. “It has been quite a year and we are still smack dab in the middle of it,” King said. Daniel Kaluuya won best supporting actor for Judas And The Black Messiah. The win for the 32-year-old British actor who was previously nominated for Get Out, was widely expected. Kaluuya won for his fiery performance as the Black Panther leader Fred Hampton, whom Kaluuya thanked for showing him “how to love myself”. “You’ve got to celebrate life, man. We’re breathing. We’re walking. It’s incredible. My mum met my dad, they had sex. It’s amazing. I’m here. I’m so happy to be alive,"" said Kaluuya while cameras caught his mother's confused reaction. With the awards capping a year of national reckoning on race and coming days after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted for killing George Floyd, police brutality was on the minds of many attendees. King said that if the verdict had been different, she might have traded her heels for marching boots. Travon Free, co-director of the live-action short winner Two Perfect Strangers, wore a suit jacket lined with the names of those killed by police. His film dramatises police brutality as an inescapable time loop like a tragic Groundhog’s Day for black Americans. “Today, the police will kill three people. And tomorrow, the police will kill three people. And the day after that, the police will kill three people because on average, the police in America every day kill three people, which amounts to about a thousand people a year,"" said Free. ""Those people happen to disproportionately be black people.” Best supporting actress went to Yuh-Jung Youn for the matriarch of Lee Isaac Chung’s tender Korean-American family drama Minari.  The 72-year-old Youn, a well-known actress in her native South Korea, is the first Asian actress to win an Oscar since 1957 and the second in history. She accepted the award from Brad Pitt, an executive producer on Minari. “Mr Brad Pitt, finally,"" said Youn. “Nice to meet you.” Hairstylists Mia Neal and Jamika Wilson of Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom became the first black women to win in makeup and hairstyling. Ann Roth, at 89 one of the oldest Oscar winners ever, also won for the film’s costume design. The night’s first award went to Emerald Fennell, the writer-director of the provocative revenge thriller Promising Young Woman, for best screenplay. Fennell, winning for her feature debut, is the first woman to win solo in the category since Diablo Cody (Juno) in 2007. The broadcast instantly looked different. It’s being shot in 24 frames-per-second and in more widescreen format. In a more intimate show without an audience beyond nominees, winners were given wider latitude in their speeches. The telecast, produced by a team led by filmmaker Steven Soderbergh, moved out of the awards' usual home, the Dolby Theatre, for Union Station.  With Zoom ruled out for nominees, the telecast included satellite feeds from around the world. Performances of the song nominees were pre-taped and aired during the preshow. Husavik (My Hometown) from Eurovision Song Contest: The Story Of Fire Saga, was performed from the Iceland town’s harbour. Others were sung from atop of the academy’s new US$500 million film museum. Pixar notched its 11th best animated feature Oscar with Soul, the studio’s first feature with a black protagonist.  Peter Docter’s film, about a about middle-school music teacher (Jamie Foxx), was one of the few big-budget movies in the running at the Academy Awards. (It also won best score, making Jon Batiste the second black composer win the award, which he shared with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.)  Another was Christopher Nolan's Tenet, which last September attempted to resuscitate moviegoing during the pandemic, took best visual effects. David Fincher's Mank, a lavishly crafted drama of 1940s Hollywood made for Netflix, came in the lead nominee with 10 nods and went home with awards for cinematography and for production design. Best adapted screenplay went to the dementia drama The Father. My Octopus Teacher, a film that found a passionate following on Netflix, won best documentary. Danish director Thomas Vinterberg’s Another Round won best international film, an award he dedicated to his daughter, Ida, who in 2019 was killed in a car crash at age 19. The red carpet was back on Sunday (Apr 25), minus the throngs of onlookers and with socially distanced interviews. Only a handful of media outlets were allowed on site, behind a velvet rope and some distance from the nominees. Casual wear, the academy warned nominees early on, was a no-no. Stars, limited to a plus-one, went without their usual battalions of publicists. But even good show may not be enough to save the Oscars from an expected ratings slide. Award show ratings have cratered during the pandemic, and this year's nominees — many of them smaller, lower-budget dramas — won't come close to the drawing power of past Oscar heavyweights like Titanic or Black Panther.  Last year's Oscars, when Bong Joon Ho's Parasite became the first non-English language film to win best picture, was watched by 23.6 million, an all-time low. Sunday's pandemic-delayed Oscars bring to a close the longest awards season ever — one that turned the season's industrial complex of cocktail parties and screenings virtual. Eligibility was extended into February of this year, and for the first time, a theatrical run wasn't a requirement of nominees. Some films – like Sound Of Metal – premiered all the way back in Sep 2019. The biggest ticket-seller of the best picture nominees is Promising Young Woman, with US$6.4 million in box office. Following is a list of winners in key categories: BEST PICTURE Nomadland BEST ACTOR Anthony Hopkins – The Father BEST ACTRESS Frances McDormand – Nomadland BEST DIRECTOR Chloe Zhao – Nomadland BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR Daniel Kaluuya – Judas And The Black Messiah BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS Youn Yuh-jung – Minari BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY Promising Young Woman BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY The Father BEST ANIMATED FEATURE FILM Soul BEST DOCUMENTARY FILM My Octopus Teacher BEST INTERNATIONAL FEATURE FILM Another Round (Denmark) BEST ORIGINAL SONG Fight for You – Judas And The Black Messiah (Source: AP) "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/mediacorp-part-ways-actor-shane-pow-drink-driving-charge-1922871,Mediacorp to 'part ways' with actor Shane Pow after drink driving charge,"Mediacorp released a statement on Monday (Apr 26) to say that it will ""part ways"" with actor Shane Pow. The company also clarified that it was not aware of the actor's drink driving charge prior to it being reported in the media on Apr 22.   In the statement, Mediacorp said that it does not condone “any behaviour that runs afoul of the law”. “We constantly remind our artistes that their fans and members of the public look to them as role models, and they are expected to behave as such.” Mediacorp said that the 30-year-old Pow did not inform the artiste management team about the incident, which took place in September 2020. This was his second recent run-in with the law after having been found to have breached COVID-19 safe management measures in an incident that took place in October last year where several Mediacorp artistes gathered for a social event. He was fined for the offence and also faced internal disciplinary action from the company. Pow will remain with Mediacorp to complete outstanding work until May 4 due to contractual obligations. He will appear in two dramas that are mostly completed and “in consideration for the efforts of the entire cast and crew” as well as the investments that have been made, these shows will be aired as planned. They are Soul Old Yet So Young and The Heartland Hero, which are scheduled for June and July, respectively. Pow was charged in court on Apr 22 with drink driving. He had at least 49 microgrammes of alcohol in 100ml of his breath (exceeding the 35-microgramme limit) while driving a “motorvan” at about 11.20pm on Sep 17, 2020. The actor was previously convicted in July 2014 of drink driving and if found guilty again, would face a driving ban of at least five years as a repeat offender. He could also receive a jail term of up to two years and a fine of between S$5,000 and S$20,000."

The 24-year-old Cheong emerged victorious during the final battle on Sunday (Apr 25) where the finalists each had to prepare a three-course meal, featuring an appetiser, main dish and dessert. Cheong prepared a four seasons-inspired menu while Lim, a private tutor, created interpretations of his favourite hawker dishes. Judges Audra Morrice, Damian D’Silva and Bjorn Shen had to score each dish out of 10 points and in the end, Cheong was awarded 78 points out of a possible 90, while Lim scored 77 points. Cheong took home more than S$100,000 worth of prizes including S$22,000 cash, a book publishing deal with Marshall Cavendish, more that S$3,000 worth of Nespresso products, household and kitchen appliances, a staycation and spa package from Fullerton Hotel, as well as internship opportunities with chefs D’Silva and Shen. Both Cheong and Lim will also continue to be supported by Mediacorp in their cooking pursuit, including with an opportunity to be commercially represented by The Celebrity Agency. “This is it – I am Singapore’s next MasterChef,” said Cheong in a statement. “This is really a dream come true for me. When I was younger, I imagined myself one day to be in the MasterChef kitchen carrying that trophy, with confetti falling around me. I feel like I am one step closer to fulfilling my dream of opening my own restaurant to showcase who I am on a plate.” Cheong added that he had “grown tremendously as a cook” in the MasterChef kitchen. “I believe this life-changing experience will allow me to soar to greater heights and guide me in my journey to become a professional chef.” The second season of the cooking competition saw a total of 10 episodes – up from eight in the previous season. This season, the focus was on “hyperlocalism”, featuring Singapore’s multicultural cuisine. The Top 12 contestants included singer Inch Chua and the son of a Top 10 contestant from the show’s first season. The first season of MasterChef Singapore ran in 2018 where Zander Ng was crowned the inaugural winner. In the final cook-off, he and runner-up Genevieve Lee had to create a five-course Asian-inspired banquet."

The actor and DJ revealed that as one of the hosts of the show, he'd been ""the most nervous person of all"" during the announcement of the Top 10 Most Popular Male Artistes, as he was in the running for his all-important 10th trophy. If he won it, he would receive an All-Time Favourite Artiste award the next year. There were only three places left when his name was announced and by then, he was a huge bundle of nerves. His mind was preoccupied with his lines and hosting duties, and his hands were full, holding his microphone and cue cards. But what the audience couldn't see, he wrote, was that Romeo, who had already received his trophy, was standing next to him the whole time. ""He was encouraging me through his body language, and widened his eyes at me in a manner that said, 'Don't worry',"" Dennis wrote. And then when his name was finally called, ""I heard the warmest and most enthusiastic voice of all. It was Romeo with his hands outstretched, saying, 'Hand me the microphone, quickly! Hand all those things to me!'"" Dennis continued that he was struck by how gallant Romeo was. ""He could have stood there looking good, but he chose to help me,"" he wrote. ""And I'm short – he even had to bend over to take the microphone and cue cards from me!"" He went on to thank Romeo, saying, ""Bro, thank you. We don't meet every day, nor are we the kind of friends who hang out over meals or drinks, but I was touched by what you did."" Then he added, ""Singapore's entertainment scene may be small, but its competition is fierce and things are unpredictable. However, Romeo Tan has dispersed the dark clouds."" He wanted to share the story because otherwise, no one would ever know what had taken place, he said. Fellow artistes commented with messages of affection and support, but Romeo himself downplayed his deed. ""You're too polite,"" he commented. ""It was nothing. Congratulations, lah."""

Aloma's repertoire seems to consist mainly of renditions of kids' songs like the Doraemon theme song, and children's hand-clapping games like Inai Inai Baa!, a Japanese relative of peek-a-boo, to the tune of trendy pop ditties. There's even a number called – no, really – the ""Baby Carrier Dance"". You can't make this stuff up. Members Nei Nei, Mahito, Keito, Junya, Nao, Yuki and Kantaro look far too fresh-faced to have children of their own, but it seems like personal experience isn't a necessary job qualification.  Instead, their role is simply to provide Japan's young mothers with encouragement and support. The band makes appearances at events and roadshows, where fans have an opportunity to see them in person - and maybe even glean some baby carrier-wearing fashion tips. Or not."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/mark-lee-gets-emotional-talking-about-daughter-kidney-disease-1922881,Actor Mark Lee gets emotional talking about daughter’s past health scare,"All parents wish for their children to be happy and healthy. Unfortunately, Singaporean actor Mark Lee had to go through the heartache of seeing his daughter in the hospital as she was diagnosed with a rare kidney disease when she was just five. The actor-comedian, who’s usually very cheerful on-screen, got emotional on the latest episode of Mediacorp talk show The Inner Circle on Wednesday (Apr 21) when talking about his youngest daughter’s kidney disease. He even broke down several times while recounting the story.  Young Calynn was diagnosed with glomerulonephritis in 2018 when she was five years old. Mark recounted the day at the hospital when samples had to be taken from his daughter’s kidney to determine the seriousness of her disease to see if it was a chronic or acute condition – with the worst case scenario being that both her kidneys would fail within nine months.  Lee admitted that he had to stay strong for his wife as they both watched the needle being inserted into their daughter’s kidney. “If I wasn't strong, she would have fallen apart, so I held back my tears,” he said. The 52-year-old father got emotional when he told host Guo Liang that he had to rush to the hospital before his daughter was sedated for the procedure, just in case it was his last chance to see her. It was one of the toughest challenges for him as he was also directing his first movie, Make It Big Big, during that period. ""I think this is the saddest part of being in the movie industry,"" the veteran actor said. ""We were in a rush and many companies had invested in the movie, so I was definitely under a lot of pressure.""  Mark didn’t want to burden his wife with his worries and added that he’s not someone who usually confides in others about unhappy things. “I was sad, but I think my wife had it even harder. After all, she did carry Calynn in her body for nine months.” Thankfully, his daughter, now seven years old, got her disease under control within three months of treatment. Mark’s family, including his daughter, appeared as special guests on the talk show, with everyone looking healthy and cheerful. The loving father closed the show by telling his children: “Your studies are important, but your health should come first. I want you to grow up healthy and remember how good I am to you.” "

During the chat, the 27-year-old star told Corden that he was calling in from Beijing, where it was 6.30 in the morning. He also plugged his upcoming second solo English album, slated for August, by saying that it will feature “a very new sound and it’s something that people won’t expect from me”. The chat was followed by a pre-recorded music video performance of the catchy pop tune. Wang’s appearance on the Late Late Show comes just days after the Hong Kong-born singer was rumoured to be featured on the soundtrack of the upcoming Marvel superhero flick Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings. Fans speculated that it was Wang's unreleased song on the trailer for the show and although it’s not exactly a confirmation, more fuel was added to the fire when the Instagram account for record label 88rising – which has worked with Wang – shared the trailer and tagged his account in the post. He was also recently featured in Forbes Asia’s 30 Under 30 list. Wang is a member of the Korean boyband GOT7 and earlier this year, the group left the JYP Entertainment label. However, in the May issue of Harper’s Bazaar Korea, where he is featured, Wang reassured fans by saying that the band will continue and that nothing has changed. He also said that he might release an album in Korea this year. It’s not the first time Wang has appeared on the Late Late Show; in 2019, he was in a segment where he and Corden taught each other about their cultures."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/nat-ho-new-song-next-better-playa-gayle-nerva-tat-tong-1882341,What does a stolen car and a flaky singer have to do with Nat Ho’s latest song?,"Nat Ho is releasing a new single on Apr 23, and the weird thing about it is that its theme of getting over let-downs and betrayals played out in the actual making of the song.   The actor-singer’s Next Better Playa is a catchy, upbeat pop song about moving on from people who aren’t right for you, and finding the “next better player”. Inspired by 8-bit retro gaming sounds, the track also features the vocals of Singapore Idol’s Gayle Nerva. But Gayle, Nat revealed, was actually the “next better player” for the song, on which he had initially asked another singer to collaborate.     “I had offered this song to someone else. But this person was super flaky about it,” said Nat, who would only reveal that the singer is female, Singaporean and “recognisable”. She had agreed to be part of the project, he told us, but when he contacted her to arrange for the studio recording to take place, he encountered a situation of “blue ticks all the way”. HE GOT GHOSTED “A week or two later, I bumped into her,” he recounted. “I checked in with her – I didn’t want to jump to conclusions and I figured maybe she was busy. I said, ‘I sent you a message.’ She said, ‘Oh, yeah, send me the message again – I was just very busy.’” But when he did, “the same thing happened” and he received no replies. Naturally, Nat said, he won’t be working with this person again. “If somebody thinks it’s not a good fit, it’s fine. If you’re busy, it’s fine. It’s part of being in the industry. You go for an audition and you may not get the role. It’s okay.” But, “Just be professional about it”. He’s very grateful to Gayle for coming on board, he said. “She was such a trooper. She came in and recorded all her parts in one afternoon. She pulled some really amazing vocal acrobatics in the song. It’s very impressive.” And as for how she came to be involved, he said, “I thought it was very apt” in light of the song’s message. “Next Better Playa was written at a place where I was becoming very intentional about my friendships and relationships, about who I wanted to work with or allow into my life,” he said. “Many people have inadvertently experienced both heartache and headaches of partnering with people who may not have been ideal for them – be it in terms of friendship, love, or business, so this song is a reminder to stay the course, to keep moving forward, and trust that the Next Better Playa will show up.” A GRAMMY-NOMINATED SINGAPOREAN ON BOARD The song, co-written by Nat and Grammy-nominated Singaporean producer-songwriter Tat Tong, was first conceived back in 2016, when Nat was juggling shooting the drama Tanglin with running his own business, the casual food stall Love Bento. The stall ran into difficulties when his business partner absconded, leaving bills unpaid and forcing Nat to pitch in to run the stall personally, cashiering and serving customers when he wasn’t at work on set. “I literally was in survival mode,” he said. “It probably aged me by about 10 years. I was working so hard and was so stressed out that my health was affected. One day, I was sorting change at the cashier when my neck and back locked up. There was this shooting pain like fire down my neck and back. I don’t even know how I managed to get home. The next morning, it literally took me 10 minutes just to sit up in bed, and the entire bed was drenched because I had broken into a cold sweat.” There had been other setbacks in his life, too, like moving to Taiwan to pursue a singing career only to have to leave his agency after releasing one album due to a mismanagement of funds. “It was kind of frustrating because it felt like all the hard work went down the drain,” he said. “That, to me, highlighted the importance of finding your dream team and your ride-or-die people who can go through life with you, and everybody kind of co-elevates together.” Right now, “I’m at a very different place in my life as an artist, and musically, I think my sound is very different right now,” said Nat, who is studying music production in Los Angeles and has started his own production and marketing company in the US. What keeps him bouncing back from adversity? “I think a trait that has enabled me to have been around for so long in the industry is that I’m kind of an eternal optimist,” he said with a laugh. “Dust yourself off, try again, and get up and go. The world is not going to wait for you. “I think also, in recent years, I’ve adopted the philosophy of resonating at your highest self, truth or purpose. Then, the right people will come along. I think this has helped me immensely (and) I feel peaceful and settled. So much so that last week, I found out that my car in Los Angeles got stolen, and I’m still strangely calm about it. Maybe the next better car will show up!” Next Better Playa is available at https://backl.ink/145519422"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/hilary-duff-how-i-met-your-mother-sequel-father-1975276,Wait for it: Hilary Duff set to star in How I Met Your Mother spin-off series,"How I Met Your Mother is getting a spin-off series and it’s going to be legen – wait for it – dary. Legendary. Streaming service Hulu announced on Wednesday (Apr 21) that How I Met Your Father will star Hilary Duff and – similar to the premise of the original – will see her character, Sophie, in the future telling her son the story of how she met his father.  The series will then follow Sophie – the new Ted Mosby, if you will – and her friends back to the year 2021 as they navigate life and relationships. According to Variety, which cited an individual with knowledge of the project, it’s unclear at this stage how or if the new show will tie in to the original. Ten episodes have already been ordered.  This Is Us showrunners and Love, Victor creators Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger will serve as writers and executive producers, while creators of the original series, Carter Bays and Craig Thomas, are attached as executive producers. The 33-year-old Duff said that she's a big fan of the original series and was looking forward to playing the role of Sophie. She added that she was “honoured and a little nervous” that Bays and Thomas “would trust me with the sequel of their baby”. “I realise these are big shoes to fill and I’m excited to slip my 6 ½’s in there!” she said. 
   A post shared by Hilary Duff (@hilaryduff) Bays and Thomas said: “Kids, I’m going to tell you an incredible story: It’s the story of how two writers got lucky enough to make their dream TV show for nine seasons and now get to pass the torch to an inspired new creative team with their own incredible story to tell, the story of How I Met Your Father."" How I Met Your Mother ran for nine seasons from 2005 to 2014. It starred Josh Radnor, Jason Segel, Alyson Hannigan, Cobie Smulders and Neil Patrick Harris, with Bob Saget voicing the part of the narrator. This isn’t the first time a follow-up to How I Met Your Mother has been attempted – a pilot for How I Met Your Dad was created in 2013 but wasn’t picked up."

This was revealed by Lady Whistledown herself, well, the actress who plays her, to be specific. On Wednesday (Apr 21), actress Nicola Coughlan, who plays Penelope Featherington, tweeted: “As the world’s number one @bridgerton Stan does @KimKardashian know that the Kardashians were a massive inspiration for the Featheringtons and we talked about them all the time during our fittings? Because I feel like she should know this."" Kardashian responded that she was “freaking out” at the information. She wrote: “This tweet was sent to me on my @bridgerton group chat! Can I please come to a fitting?!?! It would make my whole life!!!!!! I love you Lady W!!!” The reality star and entrepreneur had expressed her love for the steamy Netflix period drama back in March and was excited to find out that her famous family had a part to play in this series. The interactions continued as Coughlan invited the 40-year-old Kardashian to the show's fitting, saying that they would love to have her.    A post shared by Bridgerton (@bridgertonnetflix)   She added that Kardashian had “been part of the Bridgerton world for longer than you know”, referring to the fact that the same designer who made Kardashian’s corset for the Met Gala also made hers for the show. That piece of information stirred up even more excitement for Kardashian as she replied, “Does this make me an honorary Duchess in Bridgerton?!?!?!?"" Coughlan later tweeted a Kim Kardashian gif and captioned, “You know I’ve loved Kim for like over a decade, I can’t even deal”. Could we be seeing a Kardashian on the show in future seasons?"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-lifestyle/los-angeles-union-station-books-another-starring-role-oscars-237786,Los Angeles' Union Station books another starring role: The Oscars,"The Oscars are headed to downtown Los Angeles' Union Station this year for the first time, but the historic site and active transportation hub is already a movie star. John Parkinson and his son Donald Parkinson’s stunning blend of Mission Revival and Art Deco styles has been a popular film site since it was completed in 1939, with supporting roles in movies from Blade Runner to The Dark Knight Rises. “Visually, it’s such an incredible place and it’s such a throwback to old Hollywood,” said JJ Levine, a location manager. “I love that the Oscars are going to be there."" Union Station has been in car commercials, reality shows and procedurals (Levine shot there for “NCIS: Los Angeles”). But with its beamed ceilings, Spanish tile floors and regal bronze chandeliers, it really shines in cinema when it’s playing a train station, bank, police station, club or airport. “Through its corridors and main lobby have passed gangsters (Bugsy), drug dealers (Mike’s Murder), political protesters (The Way We Were), munchkins (Under The Rainbow) and even an alien in heat disguised as a railroad conductor (Species),” filmmaker Thom Andersen observed in his 2003 documentary Los Angeles Plays Itself. The building is also a “favourite site for movie kidnappings"" in films like Nick Of Time and To Live And Die In LA. And it doesn't always “play itself”. It’s the police station in Blade Runner and the Los Angeles International Airport in The Replacement Killers. It was a New York railway station in the World War II epic Pearl Harbor and the modern Justin Timberlake rom-com Friends With Benefits; the exterior of a 1950s movie studio in Hail, Caesar!; Demi Moore’s pad in Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle; and the insurgents’ Gotham City courthouse in The Dark Knight Rises. It also had a starring role in the 1950 film noir Union Station with William Holden and Nancy Olson, but that was set in Chicago. “I can’t wait to see it. I'm sure it will look fantastic,” said Mike Fantasia, a supervising location manager who worked there on Catch Me If You Can and Seabiscuit. In Catch Me If You Can, the ticketing area was transformed into the Miami bank where Leonardo DiCaprio’s character meets Elizabeth Banks’ teller. For Seabiscuit, they turned the then-defunct Harvey House restaurant into a club. “Everyone wants to go there because it’s an iconic building in Los Angeles. It’s been beautifully maintained and restored. It’s just a classic building,” Fantasia said. “You see the exterior, you see that ticket booth – anyone who knows LA knows where you are.” It’s not cheap, Fantasia said, but, “You more than get your money’s worth"". Union Station also recently wrapped an eight-year, US$4.1 million restoration project, so it will be looking its best for the stars and viewers around the world on Sunday (Apr 25). The Academy Awards show has moved around quite a few times in its 93 years. The first ceremony, a banquet with 270 guests, was held at The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel in 1929. After that it shifted to the Ambassador and Biltmore hotels. It’s been held at Grauman’s Chinese Theatre, the Shrine Civic Auditorium, the Academy’s Melrose Avenue Theater, the Pantages Theater, the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, and, since 2002, the Dolby (formerly Kodak) Theater at Hollywood and Highland, just a block away from the inaugural show’s location. “The producers were clear that they were committed to doing this in a different way and looking at alternative venues,” said David Rockwell, the production designer for the 93rd Oscars. “We thought about ways to create the elegance of the earliest Oscars."" There will still be some show elements from the Dolby, but the bulk of the action – from the red carpet to the ceremony – will be at Union Station. Rockwell said the venue was “appealing on the concept level and the practical level."" He noted the “generous scale” and distinctive look of the spaces. The show's producers will be using natural light from the 40ft windows in the main show area before the sun sets during the ceremony, and localised lighting at the tables in the room. It’ll be a significantly less crowded affair than in the past, down from the 3,400 available seats at the Dolby to only 170 in the main room at any given time, due to COVID-19 protocols. The idea is to make the ceremony an intimate experience for both attendees (just nominees and a guest) and the audience at home. “It’s not about spectacle, it’s about storytelling,” Rockwell said. A constant refrain from those involved is that this year will feel more like a movie than a television show. “It’s kind of a brilliant notion to use LA’s Union Station as a setting for the Oscars,” said Fandango Managing Editor Erik Davis. “It’s got that movieland history as a classic filming location and as a destination where the stars arrived in town during Hollywood’s Golden Age."" The venue choice did not come without some controversy and worries about how it will impact bus and rail services, which Metro has said will not be affected. Reporter Alissa Walker wrote in Curbed that, “As anyone who has been there during a film shoot, navigating closed-off entrances and heavily patrolled detours, knows, it will end up negatively impacting people who rely on transit.” But the decision had already been made. Davis thinks Union Station might be just what the show needs. “It’s a real chameleon as a movie location with so many different looks that viewers will feel like the show is constantly changing, and that kind of versatility will hopefully help keep their attention for more than three hours. It should re-energise the Oscars,” Davis said. “There’s a sense of cinematic déjà vu about the place... even if you never visited, you have been there in many movies! When producer Steven Soderbergh said that this year’s Oscars would feel like a movie, we now know exactly what that is.“ Viewers in Singapore can catch the awards show live on Channel 5 and meWATCH on Apr 26 from 6.30am for red carpet arrivals and at 8am for the main show.  (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/tay-ping-hui-nothing-against-cyclists-wants-accountability-1922901,"Tay Ping Hui has 'nothing against cyclists’, thinks current system can be better","Singaporean actor Tay Ping Hui has once again taken to Instagram to share his thoughts about unsafe cycling practices, after initially posting earlier in April about a group of cyclists he had encountered. Tay shared two Instagram posts late last week to thank netizens for their support for his initial post, and to address the issue once again. He wrote: ""It’s been a while since my last post and the furore that followed was unexpectedly explosive. It’s absolutely heartwarming that so many people, drivers and cyclists alike, supported me on so (many) levels. Thank y’all for your affirmation!” In his original post on Apr 1, the 50-year-old actor posted dashcam footage that showed a group of cyclists who came into his right of way without slowing down, which resulted in him having to brake sharply to avoid collision. Tay then suggested that registration of bicycles should be mandatory in Singapore so that all cyclists will have a license plate for easy identification. This fired up a huge debate with numerous people weighing in on the necessity of such a measure. He gave a more detailed account of the incident in his most recent post to show that he was placed at risk because of the cyclists’ irresponsible riding. Despite receiving support from the public, Tay also faced criticism from some netizens who accused the star of having a “big ego”. “One cannot help but feel the irony when so many of those who righteously chastised me for not being gracious enough, have done so with pretty ungracious words,” he wrote. He clarified that he’s not the enemy. “I have nothing against cyclists in general. If anything, I actually think we should encourage cycling as a healthy, alternative way of transportation and leisure. That is why we need to move toward making it safer for everyone, cyclists and motorists alike, and the current system can definitely do much better.” The actor highlighted the need to hold irresponsible cyclists accountable for their actions “because they are the primary culprits that are destroying the reputation of the entire cycling community”. He ended the post by saying that cyclists and motorists need to “stop this degradation before it’s too late”, or else they will face “implementation of extreme corrective measures because of some major loss of lives, and cycling meets the same sorrowful demise as our beloved PMDs”. Safety first, everyone!

According to Taiwan’s Apple Daily, Hui was spotted arriving at Taoyuan International Airport on Friday (Apr 16). Hui told the portal that he will be there for about a month and that he will spend the 14-day quarantine period memorising the show’s script, as well as exercising. He added that his wife Sammi Cheng was not accompanying him as she was busy with work. The 53-year-old will be playing the role of a Hong Kong singer in the drama with the translated title Accept The Challenge, Producer! and he will also sing the show’s theme song. The series will focus on the challenges faced by a group of singers in 2020. The TV series will also star Taiwanese actor Yo Yang, who will play the music producer.   Hui’s career took a nosedive after he was photographed getting cosy with actress Jacqueline Wong in a taxi in April 2019. His wife forgave him and he has slowly been trying to restart his career, first by performing on a ViuTV programme in June last year, then returning to the recording studio in November."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/shang-chi-legend-ten-rings-teaser-trailer-marvel-asian-superhero-1922916,Marvel's 1st Asian superhero movie Shang-Chi finally has a trailer out now,"We finally get to see Simu Liu in action as the first Asian Marvel superhero as Disney released the trailer for Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings on Monday (Apr 19), which also happened to be the Chinese-Canadian star’s 32nd birthday. We also see Tony Leung in the two-minute clip as villain Wenwu, head of the Ten Rings terror organisation. As the story goes, as narrated by Leung’s character in the trailer, Wenwu had trained Shang-Chi from young to be a skilled assassin. However, he escaped and had been living a normal life in San Francisco for 10 years where he’s friends with fellow hotel valet, Katy (played by Awkwafina). However, it looks like Shang-Chi's past has caught up with him as Wenwu now wants him to return, leading to some fast-paced martial arts action, including a fight scene in a moving bus. Liu shared the film’s teaser poster on Instagram and wrote in the caption that ""Shang Chi is more than just a movie – it is a celebration of our culture and a rallying cry for the forgotten, the unseen, and the overlooked. It is a reminder to take up space, to stand tall, and to be unapologetically ourselves”. Shang-Chi, which features a predominantly Asian cast, is part of Marvel’s Phase 4 and is directed by Destin Daniel Cretton. The director told Entertainment Weekly: ""There are many iterations of Shang-Chi throughout the comics, but there was always a core relationship between him and his father that was extremely complicated – and that was something I really related to."" The film also stars Fala Chen, Michelle Yeoh and Ronnie Chieng and is expected to hit theatres on Sep 3 after initially slated for February this year. Other Marvel films expected for release this year include Black Widow, Eternals and Spider-Man: No Way Home."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/elvin-ng-bandung-drink-star-awards-2021-1922921,Actor Elvin Ng knows he looked like a bandung drink at the Star Awards,"Local celebrities were out in the freshest and finest threads on Sunday (Apr 18) for Star Awards 2021. As is common with such events, though, it was also time for the fashion police to bear down on those whose outfits were deemed to have broken style rules. One particular outfit bore the brunt of jokes as it resembled that ubiquitous drink – bandung. Fortunately, the wearer of said ombre Alexander McQueen outfit – Elvin Ng – knows how to laugh at himself.   A post shared by ELVIN NG 黄俊雄 (@elvinngchoonsiong)   The 40-year-old actor leaned into the joke and posted a picture of himself with a cup of ice-cold bandung on Monday (Apr 19). He captioned the shot: “Fashion also means not taking ourselves too seriously, and having a sense of humour. Craving for #bandung last night, I wonder why.” He added the hashtags #whysoserious and #ilovebandung and laughing emojis. Many netizens were amused at his post and some commented that he still looked very handsome despite being compared to the pink drink made of rose syrup and evaporated milk. Even his celebrity friends like Romeo Tan, Ian Fang, and Jia Qi Woo joined in the fun and commented with laughing emojis, calling him “Mr Bandung”.  Class95 DJ Jean Danker also commented: “Can’t say enough how much I love this post babe, you’re a trooper! And the suit was fun!!” Elvin went on to do a poll on Instagram where he posted a photo of his outfit with the caption, “Can someone tell me now if the bandung was hot or not? #hotbandung”, and let his followers select, “Hot” or “Not”.     Apparently, Elvin was not the only celebrity to wear the suit in recent times. American comedian Kevin Hart shared a photo of himself on Instagram wearing the exact outfit as Elvin on Apr 19. While he didn’t get called out fans for looking like bandung, he did get comments that likened his suit to a feminine sanitary product. Anyone craving bandung now?"

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/mad-max-prequel-chris-hemsworth-anya-taylor-joy-australia-2023-229246,"Mad Max prequel starring Chris Hemsworth, Anya Taylor-Joy coming in 2023","A prequel to the Mad Max movie franchise starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth will be filmed in Australia, officials said on Monday (Apr 19). Furiosa is slated for release in mid-2023 and is expected to become the biggest film ever made in Australia, New South Wales state Premier Gladys Berejiklian said. Hemsworth said being involved in such a project in his homeland was a dream come true. “This will be my fourth or fifth film here in Australia,” the Thor star said in Sydney. “It really is, out of everything I’ve done, the biggest pinch-myself moment, because I’ve grown up watching it and it’s so iconic,” Hemsworth said. “It is a huge honour. A lot of pressure, but exciting pressure that is certainly motivating,” he added. Actors and crews will travel to locations across New South Wales, including the mining town of Broken Hill, the surrounds of which have traditionally provided the post-apocalyptic landscapes of the movies. The latest movie in the franchise, Mad Max: Fury Road, released in 2015, was mostly shot in Nambia because unseasonal rain left Outback New South Wales unusually green. The lead actor in The Queen’s Gambit miniseries, Taylor-Joy will star in the film as a younger version of Furiosa, who was played by Charlize Theron in the 2015 installment. Writer and director George Miller, who with Byron Kennedy started the Mad Max franchise starring Mel Gibson in 1979, said he was grateful to shoot the film in his home country, thanks to financial support from the state and federal governments. “I had friends in England shooting movies that were shut down two or three times,” Miller said, referring to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact. Miller said he was also excited by the role an Australian film boom was playing in the nation's recovery from the pandemic. Australia has been dubbed “Aussiewood” in the media because a number of actors have left Los Angeles for the freedoms of Sydney while Australia has been relatively successful in halting community transmission of COVID-19.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/star-awards-2021-jewel-changi-airport-winners-1882346,Now boarding: Why Star Awards 2021 at the airport was bittersweet for some,"The Star Awards 2021 took off at full speed on Sunday (Apr 18) in an exciting departure from its usual format: For the first time ever, the event was held at Jewel Changi Airport and Changi Airport Terminal 4. Instead of gathering in a theatre, groups of artistes were seated in individual armchairs in front of different stages in various locations, such as at boarding gates and in front of Jewel's iconic HSBC Rain Vortex, in line with safe distancing measures.  
  Of course, everyone left their passports at home, but for many artistes, there were mixed feelings about being at the airport going nowhere.  Accepting his Best Actor award for his work in the drama A Quest To Heal, Qi Yuwu mentioned in his thank-you speech that the last time he'd been at the airport, it was to go home to see his family in Guangzhou – something he unfortunately hadn't been able to do in a long time. And when Ann Kok, back on the scene for the first time in seven years, received a Top 10 Most Popular Female Artistes trophy to her teary-eyed surprise, she also referenced the venue, saying, ""Getting this award feels like I'm taking flight again"".  For hosts Guo Liang and Quan Yi Fong, leading the show's proceedings at Jewel Changi Airport in the midst of a pandemic presented an unusual challenge. The pair were stationed at their own stage, without a live audience. 
  ""It's the first time in my many years of hosting live shows that there has been no audience,"" Guo Liang remarked during an interview with media after the show. ""There weren't any artistes in front of us, and there was no one to interact with."" That makes a host's job more difficult, said Yi Fong, because ""we have to generate our own energy and excitement, instead of relying on interaction with the audience"". And, she added, having to raise her voice so she could be heard above the waterfall's crashing waters resulted in a sore throat. Still, the novelty of holding the show at the airport was exciting, said most artistes we spoke to. ""I think this is something that might not happen ever again in the future, so I’m really blessed that I'm part of this historic event,"" Desmond Tan told CNA Lifestyle, before he bagged a Top 10 Most Popular Male Artistes award. In addition, he and other celebs including Zoe Tay, Elvin Ng, Rui En, Rebecca Lim, Chantalle Ng, Xu Bin and Ian Fang got to do a runway fashion shoot on the tarmac, in front of a Singapore Airlines Airbus A350-900. Zoe shared that the shoot had been planned for the daytime, but because of rain, it was pushed back to the evening. The end result, though, was very satisfying, she said, as the still-glistening ground reflected the light of what Desmond called the ""golden hour"". At one of the high points of the show, everyone applauded when a visibly stunned Zoe's name was announced in the category of Best Actress. Mediacorp's Ah Jie beat out favourites including Felicia Chin, Rebecca Lim and Rui En to the top acting accolade for her turn as a single mother who goes from riches to rags in the drama My Guardian Angels, making this her second win in a row – she also won Best Actress at the last Star Awards in 2019. She wasn't the only nominee who wasn't expecting to win, though. Looks of surprise flashed across the faces of veteran artistes Chen Shucheng and Jin Yin Ji when their names were called out during the presentation of the Top 10 Most Popular Artistes awards. Because voting this year was carried out online and not through telepoll, ""I thought my friends wouldn't know how to go on the Internet,"" Shucheng said. ""People told me, 'Never mind, I'll ask the youngsters at home to help me.' I don't know how many of them did, but I'm very thankful to friends for voting."" Younger actresses Hong Ling and Bonnie Loo were also pleasantly surprised when they received their first coveted Top 10 trophies. But perhaps no one was more elated than Marcus Chin, who, at the age of 67, received his first popularity award. ""I can't believe it. I'm shaking,"" he said. ""I never thought I would ever win this. I even feel taller after winning this award!"" He added that hard work pays off, saying, ""I invest in believing – believing in myself, believing in action and believing in perseverance."" Of course, there were also those who surprisingly lost out on popularity awards, such as Felicia Chin, Xu Bin and Chantalle Ng. Chantalle had also been nominated for Best Supporting Actress for her work in Terror Within, and received an outpouring of positive feedback for playing a Vietnamese bride in My Star Bride. Speaking to media after the show, her mum Lin Meijiao said it was okay that Chantalle hadn't bagged an award, as it was her first nominations. In fact, it might even have been too soon if she had won, she said, because ""there's still a long road ahead of her"". 
  For others, winning an award was bittersweet. Accepting her ninth Top 10 trophy, Rebecca Lim said a special thank-you that she later explained was meant for her late grandfather, and apologised to her family for ""not being able to share moments, including sad ones, with you"". She later told media backstage that the life of an artiste really isn't all glitz and glamour. ""Often, we don't have time to spend with people we love. Many people don't realise this. Sometimes, we suffer indignities. I don't think it's a bad thing – I have grown a lot and become very strong – but I do sometimes wonder whether it's necessary to go through so much."" Bryan Wong, on the other hand, opined after winning the Best Supporting Actor prize for his portrayal of an evil eunuch in time-travel drama A Quest To Heal: ""We're human. At our low points, we wonder if we made the right decision. But that regret lasts only a couple of minutes."" The 50-year-old was speaking of his decision to switch career paths at 40, going from hosting to concentrating on acting. ""Either you’re very brave or you’re just plain stupid. I hope I’m not plain stupid,"" he said. ""In certain things, I’m still a dreamer. I still believe this world is beautiful. I believe if you have the passion and chase your dreams, maybe one day, you’ll get good results. And today I got it.""

Unfortunately, she did not get a chance to use it. The My Star Bride actress told entertainment portal 8 DAYS after the show on Apr 18: “It’s okay, maybe the next time. If I get an award next year, I can use my speech.” 
  Chantalle had prepared the speech after seeing the screenshots of votes that her fans had sent her. She was nominated for Best Supporting Actress and Top 10 Most Popular Female Artistes. She told 8 DAYS: “When the fifth name was announced, I already had the feeling I wouldn't be going on stage. When it was the eighth or ninth name, I was looking at Xu Bin (her My Star Bride co-star). Obviously we were rooting for each other, and he was giving me that face like, ‘Mmm you better win something’”. The 25-year-old rising star added that she was afraid she had disappointed the people who had been supporting her, “especially my make-up artist, my managers and the fans who have been sending me screenshots of their votes”. “My main concern was that they were more disappointed than I am. I was trying to make sure that everyone was okay after the show, but they were asking me how I was,” she said. 
  When asked about how her mother, veteran actress Lin Meijiao, reacted, Chantalle choked up and said, “If I were to win an award, the happiest person would be my mum. And if I did not win, she might be the most disappointed. But she encouraged me and told me I can try again, that this is only my first year. I plan to continue working hard”. Mums FTW!"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/helen-mccrory-death-husband-damian-lewis-pays-tribute-1922926,Harry Potter actress Helen McCrory’s death: Husband Damian Lewis pays tribute,"Billions actor Damian Lewis has paid a touching tribute to his late wife, the Harry Potter and Peaky Blinders actress Helen McCrory. She died of cancer at the age of 52 on Friday (Apr 16). McCrory played Narcissa Malfoy, Draco’s mum, in the Harry Potter movies, and was also Aunt Polly in the drama Peaky Blinders. Lewis, who announced McCrory’s death on Twitter, wrote a eulogy for her, which was published in the UK newspaper Sunday Times on Apr 18. The 50-year-old Lewis, who’s also known for his role in Homeland, wrote in The Sunday Times: “Helen was an even more brilliant person than she was an actress. She was a people person, sure. ‘I’m much more interested in who I’m with than where I am’, she would say, and innately wanted to share.” “But she also lived by the principle of kindness and generosity,” he added. “That you put these things out into the world to make it better, to make people feel better.” Lewis shared that McCrory repeatedly thanked her caregivers even while on her deathbed, and had a way of making the person she met feel special “as though they were the only person in the room”. “I’ve never known anyone able to enjoy life as much. Her ability to be in the present and enjoy the moment was inspirational,” he continued. The couple got married in 2007 and have two children together. Lewis said that his late wife told their two children repeatedly before she died: “Don’t be sad, because even though I’m about to snuff it, I’ve lived the life I’ve wanted to.” She also encouraged him to move on after she passed. “Only a couple of weeks ago she said to us from her bed, ‘I want Daddy to have girlfriends, lots of them, you must all love again, love isn’t possessive, but you know, Damian, try at least to get through the funeral without snogging someone.’” Lewis added that McCrory's ""greatest and most exquisite act of bravery and generosity has been to 'normalise' her death"". He wrote: ""She's shown no fear, no bitterness, no self-pity, only armed us with the courage to go on and insisted that no one be sad, because she is happy. I'm staggered by her. She's been a meteor in our life.""  In Lewis’ initial Twitter announcement, he wrote that his late wife died “peacefully at home” after a “heroic battle with cancer”. Cillian Murphy, McCrory’s Peaky Blinders co-star, said he was “broken-hearted to lose such a dear friend”. “Helen was a beautiful, caring, funny, compassionate human being. She was also a gifted actor – fearless and magnificent. She elevated and made humane every scene, every character she played. It was a privilege to have worked with this brilliant woman, to have shared so many laughs over the years. I will dearly miss my pal,” he said in a statement."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/alma-wahlberg-mother-of-actors-mark-donnie-dies-at-78-229871,"Alma Wahlberg, mother of actors Mark and Donnie Wahlberg, dies at 78","Alma Wahlberg, the mother of entertainers Mark and Donnie Wahlberg and a regular on their reality series Wahlburgers, has died, her sons said on social media on Sunday (Apr 18). She was 78. “My angel. Rest in peace,” Mark Wahlberg tweeted. Donnie Wahlberg posted a longer tribute to his mother on his Instagram account. “It’s time to rest peacefully, mom,” Donnie Wahlberg wrote. “I love you, miss you, thank you and will celebrate you, today and always.” No information was given about the cause, date or location of her death. Donnie Wahlberg often posted about his mother on his accounts and in July updated his fans on her health, writing that she “didn’t remember much and was often confused but somehow she was still Alma”. The Boston-born mother of nine became a household name thanks to her appearances on the series Wahlburgers, about the family’s burgeoning burger chain. “She made no apologies for who she was, but never put herself above anyone else. She kicked our butts if we messed up, kicked anyone else’s butts if they messed with us. Taught us right, made us pay the price when we were wrong,” Donnie Wahlberg wrote on Sunday. “She was the epitome of the word grace.” He also included a video of them dancing at his wedding to one of her favourite songs, If I Could by Regina Belle. He wrote that she danced to that song at each of her children’s weddings, but at his own, he surprised her by having Belle there to perform it live. On the Today show in 2018, Alma Wahlberg opened up about her parenting and how hard it was early on. “I invented the craziest meals,” she said. English muffin pizzas were among her creations to feed her hungry lot. More than a few of her children went on to great successes and fame. Her son Paul Wahlberg, who is the chef behind the namesake burger chain, also named the Alma Nove restaurant in Hingham, Massachusetts, after her. “People know me as being the mother of famous children, and although this fact has brought many gifts into my life and has afforded me opportunities that may never have been possible otherwise, there is a whole lot more to my story than most people know,” Alma Wahlberg said in an interview with Boston’s WCVB-TV in 2018.  “I’ve lived with alcoholism and abuse; struggled with poverty and experienced great wealth; lost so many that I’ve loved; struggle to raise nine children, and I love them more than anything else; watch them suffer, learn and come out on the other side; lost myself; found myself, again and again; and kept moving forward, no matter what.” Alma Wahlberg is survived by eight children. Her daughter Debbie died in 2003. (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/star-awards-2021-winners-list-best-actor-actress-1882351,"Star Awards 2021: Zoe Tay, Qi Yuwu and the rest of the winners","After a hiatus last year thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Star Awards returned in a way that made its presence felt on Sunday (Apr 18).  For the first time ever, the show took place across multiple stages at the HSBC Rain Vortex at Jewel Changi Airport, the Shiseido Forest Valley and Changi Airport Terminal 4. And, giving new meaning to ""runway fashion"", the stars walked the red carpet with a Singapore Airlines Airbus A350-900 as their backdrop. 
   A post shared by CNA (@channelnewsasia)  Artistes nominated for acting awards faced a tougher-than-ever fight this year, as the number of nominees for each category was increased to seven – up from the usual five – to make up for last year's lack of an awards ceremony. 
   Taking the award for Best Actor for his role in the time-travel drama A Quest To Heal – which was also named Best Drama – Qi Yuwu acknowledged the emotional aspect of being at the airport and going nowhere. “The last time I was here at the airport was the year before, when I was going home to Guangzhou for Chinese New Year. It’s been a long time since I was home, so I feel quite emotional,” said the China-born actor. Accepting the trophy, he also drew attention away from himself towards the nature of the entertainment industry, saying, “To the other nominees – please don’t feel that this means I’m a better actor. Our industry needs different types of actors in order to have richer productions.” In a turn of events that was surprising even for the winner herself, the Best Actress award went to Zoe Tay, who played a single mum who goes from riches to rags in My Guardian Angels. “I’m very surprised, because I wasn’t even the dark horse,” said the actress, who was also named Best Actress at the last Star Awards two years ago. She thanked the crew for fostering a positive atmosphere on set and said she enjoyed playing a character that was both easy to love and easy to hate. In both the Best Supporting Actor and Actress categories, the awards were swept by artistes better known for their hosting than for their acting: Bryan Wong took home a trophy for his role as a scheming eunuch in A Quest To Heal, and Kym Ng won an accolade for her portrayal of a woman accused of murder in the drama Daybreak. Both Bryan and Kym had been tagged by various media outlets as hot favourites to win, but Kym said, “The members of my own fan club said they thought I probably wouldn’t win, because they felt the other nominees were excellent. They told me earlier, ‘It’s okay if you don’t win this year because it’s very competitive – there are seven nominees.’”  On the other hand, “My husband said he’d still love me even if I didn’t win anything! So, I think he’ll be proud!” Bryan said he was already “very proud and moved” when the media proclaimed him a favourite. “I told myself that even if I didn’t win, it was okay because I was the hot favourite. To have this award… I feel like I’m validated, like a carpark coupon,” he quipped, adding, “It’s been so long since I won something! I don’t have a trophy in this colour!” Reflecting on his and Kym’s wins, Bryan said, “Kym has been my battle buddy for many years. The two of us getting acting awards – it’s a special day.” He also said he thought his host friends were all adept at acting.  “Kym and I started out with City Beat, and 50 per cent of that variety show was us acting in sketches,” he said. “I played so many roles, including women, from young to old; from uncle to auntie!”  What’s more, he divulged, “Actually, Quan Yi Fong is also very good at acting – she just doesn’t want to do it because she finds it too much hassle.” She’s clearly just as good, if not better, at hosting, because Yi Fong took home the Best Programme Host (Entertainment & Infotainment) award for captaining the celebrity tell-all talk show Hear U Out.  In the Top 10 popularity awards, first-time winners included Marcus Chin, Hong Ling and Bonnie Loo. Conspicuously missing from the list, though, were this year’s breakout star Chantalle Ng; and Felicia Chin, for whom it would have been her all-important 10th award. Notably, a Top 10 award went to a teary-eyed Ann Kok, who said, “It’s my first award since leaving Mediacorp seven years ago. We are at the airport, and it feels like taking flight.” What's more, everyone’s favourite Korean auntie Jin Yin Ji took home a Top 10 award on top of the Evergreen Artiste award. “In the past, I was always nominated and watched other people win. I always thought, ‘When will it be my turn?’ I had gotten used to being contented with just dressing up and being able to gather with people,” she said. Having won 10 Top 10 Most Popular Male Artistes awards, Dasmond Koh accepted his All-time Favourite Artiste award, dedicating it to his mother’s memory. “Mum isn’t here any more. To have been able to share this honour with her would have been a very happy thing,” he said. Taking home their 10th popularity awards this year were Dennis Chew and Zheng Geping, who will consequently receive their All-time Favourite Artiste trophies next year. Hosted by Guo Liang and Quan Yi Fong, the show also featured musical performances by Joanna Dong and Hong Kong pop star Gigi Leung, as well as video appearances by special guest stars including Ella Chen, Kevin Tsai, Matilda Tao, Chung Hsin-ling, James Wen, Lau Dan, Lawrence Cheng, Gordon Lam and Sandra Ng. In addition, a new award was introduced for the first time this year: Best Radio Programme, which went to The Breakfast Quartet of Love 97.2FM's Mark Lee, Chen Biyu, Marcus Chin and Dennis Chew. *** STAR AWARDS 2021 WINNERS LIST Best Actress: Zoe Tay (My Guardian Angels) Best Actor: Qi Yuwu (A Quest To Heal) Best Drama Serial: A Quest To Heal Best Supporting Actor: Bryan Wong (A Quest to Heal) Best Supporting Actress: Kym Ng (Daybreak) All-Time Favourite Artiste Award: Dasmond Koh Evergreen Artiste Award: Jin Yin Ji Best Newcomer: Zhang Zetong (A Jungle Survivor) Young Talent Award: Goh Wee Ann (C.L.I.F. 5) Best Short-form Drama Serial: Beijing To Moscow Bioskin Most Charismatic Award: Romeo Tan Best Entertainment Special Programme: Star Awards 2019 – Awards Ceremony Best Entertainment Programme: King of Culinary Best Infotainment Programme: Fixer 3 Best Programme Host (Entertainment & Infotainment): Quan Yifong (Hear U Out) Best Theme Song: A Quest To Heal Best Short-form Entertainment Programme: Hear U Out Best Radio Programme: Love 972 – The Breakfast Quartet *** Top 10 Most Popular Male Artistes 1.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/star-awards-2021-backstage-behind-the-scenes-1882356,"No wefies, no hugs: How celebs got ready backstage for Star Awards 2021","What’s the biggest concern on our celebs’ minds at this year’s Star Awards? Not being able to give hugs or handshakes. Thanks to safe distancing guidelines, they’ll have to hold back their expressions of affection for friends and colleagues they haven’t seen in a long time.   And when the show itself starts at 7pm on Sunday (Apr 18), they’ll have to rein in their congratulations when winners are announced. 
  On the morning of the biggest day in local Chinese television, our stars showed up bright and early at Mediacorp's makeup rooms to begin preparations for the Star Awards before they headed to the show's location: Jewel Changi Airport, a special departure from the usual venue of Mediacorp's TV Theatre. With masks on, however, the atmosphere was distinctly different from previous years’, with no one congregating in groups, no eating or drinking, and no wefies. (And in case you're wondering, the artistes are permitted to remove their masks for television as long as safe distancing measures are in place.) “It’s been almost a year since I’ve seen most of my colleagues. By nature, you’d want to give them a hug,” Best Actor nominee Romeo Tan told CNA Lifestyle backstage while still in his casual clothes and slippers. But, “I think we just need to keep reminding everyone about keeping a safe distance. I’ll try to keep my hands to myself!”  How strict are the safe distancing measures? Well, suffice it to say that we overheard a manager telling some artistes, ""Remember not to touch anyone. Even if she falls down, you're not allowed to help her up!"" “I think that might be one of the greatest challenges today – not to be affectionate to people and not going forward to congratulate them,” Bryan Wong told us. Then again, quipped the Best Supporting Actor nominee, “I guess for those who are not fans of physical emotion, it’s a good day for them!” In the makeup chair, a chirpy Rebecca Lim was happy to be back in the thick of the Star Awards atmosphere. “I think there’s a lot more excitement because we missed last year’s. I’m definitely looking forward to tonight because it’s been a while since all of us got to dress up and glam up. And there’s been so much hard work put in behind the scenes, by the actors as well, for the last two years. I just miss seeing everyone together,” said the Best Actress nominee. Plus, she added, “We’ve been cooped up at home or only been able to meet within our team. This awards ceremony allows us to sort of see each other – even if it’s from afar, at least we can wave to each other! And at least we’ll look beautiful tonight, so that will be something different, as opposed to our sweats and T-shirts!” Nerves were running high among most of the nominees, as seven actors are nominated in each acting category, up from the usual five. “Right now, I’m still quite relaxed but I’m sure that as time goes by, I’ll start to get more nervous,” Romeo said. “This year is challenging – we have seven guys up for Best Actor. So, to be honest, I’m really nervous about later on.” He usually hides his nerves well, but the telltale sign, he divulged, is that “my ears turn red if I’m really nervous.” It happens on set too, if he messes up too many takes, he said. “Once, the cameraman said, ‘Hey, your ears are too red. Can the makeup artist apply some concealer?’” Someone who’s statistically likely to go home with at least one award is Kym Ng, who’s nominated for Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress and Best Programme Host. “Most people think I will get the Best Supporting Actress award,” she revealed as she was getting her hair braided. “I wish to get Best Actress, but chances are very slim because i’m competing with all the experienced actresses. I just hope for the best, lah. You never know!” Bryan is also gunning for a trophy for his turn as a conniving eunuch in A Quest To Heal, telling us, “Everyone thinks I stand a pretty good chance and I so desperately hope that everyone is correct.” But there’s one person who’s kind of hoping he doesn’t win an award, and that’s Pierre Png, who joked to us while he was getting his makeup done that he doesn’t want to have to make a thank-you speech in Mandarin. “I think I might be the only artist who dreads going on stage,” the Best Actor nominee grinned. “We are no longer allowed to hold hands or hug each other and I usually do that to buy time. Now I have one whole minute, and from where I’m seated, it takes me less than three seconds to go up on stage!” In any case, he’s modest about his chances this year. “With Chen Hanwei in the running, I think the rest of us can just take a back seat,” he quipped. Will he be proven right? We'll be watching the show to find out. Star Awards 2021 is broadcast on Apr 18 on Channel 8 and Channel U, with a simulcast on meWATCH and Mediacorp Entertainment Channel on YouTube.  The “Walk of Fame” will run from 5pm to 6.30pm while the awards ceremony will run from 7pm to 10pm.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/selena-tan-selfies-co-stars-jennifer-lopez-josh-duhamel-kravitz-1975286,"Check out Selena Tan's selfies with co-stars Jennifer Lopez, Josh Duhamel, Lenny Kravitz","Singaporean actress Selena Tan made some new famous friends on the set of her latest Hollywood movie, it appears. On Friday (Apr 16), the Dim Sum Dollies star took to Instagram to share photos of herself with her co-stars from the upcoming romantic-comedy-action flick, Shotgun Wedding. She posted three selfies, one each of herself with Jennifer Lopez, Josh Duhamel and Lenny Kravitz. 
   A post shared by Selena Tan (@bigdimsumdolly) She captioned the post: “The end of part 1 of this adventure that is #shotgunwedding these are the three legends I got to work with JLo Lenny Kravitz Josh Duhamel and so many more amazing, talented cast and crew... my new friends and more photos will follow!” She added that she was happy to head home “to the two guys I love and miss so much”, likely referring to her husband and son. Tan first teased her involvement in this project on Instagram back in February where she shared that she had arrived in the Dominican Republic and received her COVID-19 test. She told CNA Lifestyle that she was “super excited to be in the movie” and she was still pinching herself in disbelief. This isn’t her first Hollywood rodeo – so to speak – as the 50-year-old was also in the 2018 blockbuster Crazy Rich Asians. 
  Shotgun Wedding is directed by Jason Moore, who is known for the comedy Pitch Perfect (2012).  The story follows a couple, Grace (Lopez) and Tom (Duhamel), who are having cold feet as they deal with a destination wedding. To make things much, much worse, a group of criminals hijack their extravagant wedding and takes everyone hostage. As they try to save their family members, they rediscover why they fell in love with each other. The film also stars four-time Grammy award winner Kravitz, who plays Lopez’s on-screen ex, while comedian Cheech Marin plays her father."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/prince-william-harry-won-t-walk-side-by-side-philip-funeral-224496,"Princes William, Harry won't walk side-by-side at grandfather Prince Philip's funeral","Prince William and Prince Harry won’t walk side-by-side on Saturday (Apr 17) as they follow their grandfather’s coffin into the church ahead of Prince Philip’s funeral, minimising the chances of any awkward moments between the brothers who are grappling with strained relations since Harry’s decision to step away from royal duties last year. Buckingham Palace on Thursday released the broad outlines of the funeral programme for Queen Elizabeth II's husband, who died Apr 9 at the age of 99. The palace revealed that William and Harry’s cousin, Peter Phillips, will walk between the princes as they escort the coffin to St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle, west of London. Prince Charles, the heir to the throne and the father of the princes, together with his sister, Princess Anne, will lead the 15-member procession. The brothers had been closely watched as Saturday’s funeral will almost certainly remind the pair of their shared grief at another royal funeral more than two decades ago. As young boys, both walked behind their mother Princess Diana’s coffin in 1997 in London in a ceremony watched around the world. Palace officials refused to comment when asked whether the positioning of William and Harry was an effort to minimise family tensions, which have grown after Harry and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, gave an explosive interview to Oprah Winfrey that suggested an unnamed member of the royal family had made a racist comment to Harry before the birth of their child Archie. Meghan, who is pregnant and living in California with Harry, is not coming to the funeral on the advice of her doctor. “We’re not going to be drawn into those perceptions of drama or anything like that,"" a palace spokesman said while speaking on condition of anonymity in line with policy. “This is a funeral and the arrangements have been agreed and they represent Her Majesty’s wishes.” In another effort to preserve family unity, the palace said senior royals would wear civilian clothes to the funeral. The decision, signed off by the queen, means that Harry won’t risk being the only member of the royal family not in uniform during the funeral. Members of the royal family often wear uniforms to public events by virtue of their honorary roles with the British Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, but Harry lost his honorary military titles when he decided to give up frontline royal duties last year. As a result, protocol suggests that Harry, an army veteran who served two tours of duty in Afghanistan, would only wear a suit with medals at royal functions. The decision also sidesteps another potential controversy after reports that Prince Andrew, the queen's second-oldest son, considered wearing an admiral’s uniform to his father’s funeral. Andrew retains his military titles even though he was forced to step away from royal duties after a disastrous interview with the BBC about his acquaintance with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Attendance at the funeral will be limited to 30 people because of the coronavirus restrictions in England. The list will include several of Philip’s relatives from Germany, together with immediate members of the royal family. The children in the family will not attend. Guests will wear masks inside the chapel and observe social distancing. The queen, always the first to set an example, will also wear a mask. In other details released about the funeral, Royal Marine buglers will play Action Stations, an alarm that alerts sailors to prepare for battle. 
  Philip, also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, served in the Royal Navy for 12 years and maintained close ties to the armed forces throughout his life. Military personnel will have a large role in honouring him on Saturday despite the attendance limit. Members of the Royal Navy, the Royal Marines, the Royal Air Force and the British Army will take part in the funeral procession. Philip’s coffin will be carried to St George’s Chapel on a specially adapted Land Rover that he designed himself. On Thursday, Charles and his wife Camilla visited Marlborough House in central London to see a sea of floral tributes for Philip, which have been moved there from the gates of Buckingham Palace. The couple spent some time looking at the cards and notes with the flowers. The items left in tribute included a model of a Land Rover similar to the one that will bear Philip’s coffin on Saturday, with the words “The Duke R.I.P” on the roof. (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/singapore-raffles-hotel-staycation-package-1883776,Fancy solving a mystery while on staycation at Singapore’s Raffles Hotel?,"Are you a fan of Singapore’s iconic Raffles Hotel, Singapore theatre, mystery writer Agatha Christie and writer-actor Noel Coward? Here’s the perfect confluence of all your favourites colliding in one interactive swoop.  A first-of-its-kind virtual play, The Curious Case Of The Missing Peranakan Treasure is a collaboration between Raffles Hotel Singapore, actor-comedian Hossan Leong’s Double Confirm Productions and Sight Lines Entertainment. It promises to immerse audiences in the role of a detective tasked to figure out who stole the crown jewel artefact in a fictional Treasures Of The Straits exhibition at the hotel. Written by award-winning playwright Jean Tay and directed by Leong, this interactive format allows audiences to explore the hotel's historic grounds (both virtually and physically), all the while piecing clues together, and deciding how the whodunnit story unfolds. It was filmed entirely on site at the Raffles Hotel using 360-degree virtual reality (VR) cameras to capture locations and create an immersive experience to allow AR (augmented reality) choice-based functions. Running from now until Jun 30, the virtual play is readily accessible to wannabe sleuths globally online, as well as in-house guests staying on the property itself. For the latter, there’s a Stay And Play staycation package that sees a player start from a luxurious suite of one's choosing, before moving through various checkpoints across the hotel to receive and solve clues. Included in the package are complimentary Singapore Slings for two, a satay platter at Raffles Courtyard, a gift from Raffles Boutique and a Heritage Evening dinner at The Grand Lobby. For those looking to experience the play in real life but are not guests at the hotel, there are also limited “daycation” packages where players are allowed to venture all around the storied hotel’s extensive grounds. This package also proffers the same complimentary gifts and offerings. Depending on the package chosen, all successful mystery solvers will receive prizes ranging from Raffles Boutique e-vouchers to an Afternoon Tea Experience for two at The Grand Lobby worth S$156. Fans of local theatre will spot familiar faces like Siti Khalijah Zainal, Audrey Luo, Frances Lee, Dwayne Lau, Julius Foo and Pavan J Singh, as well as Leong himself in the cast. “I have always wanted to create an arts piece or production with the beautiful Raffles Hotel Singapore as a backdrop,” shared actor-director Leong.  “The perfect opportunity arose recently with the current emphasis to embrace technology and explore bringing the arts onto a digital platform. So, I took up the challenge and conceptualised this novel project to work with people that would encourage me to go beyond my comfort zone.” For the hotel’s general manager, Christian Westbeld, the unique project is also a way to continue supporting homegrown talents. “This innovative theatrical production, centred around the Grand Dame, reflects our continued desire to create unforgettable, unique and treasured memories for each and every guest,” he said.  “Through this immersive virtual experience, our guests will be able to appreciate the Grand Dame in a new light, watch as history and mystery collide, and revel in the hotel's culture and heritage – no matter where they are.” Tickets are priced from S$38 onwards and are available on SISTIC and Raffles Hotel Singapore's website.   All winners who are able to solve the mystery are entitled to participate in the Grand Draw for a chance to win a one-night stay in the Raffles Hotel Presidential Suite, complete with breakfast for two people (worth more than S$18,000++)."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/house-gucci-heirs-worry-family-depiction-ridley-scott-lady-gaga-220031,Gucci family concerned over depiction in Ridley Scott film starring Lady Gaga,"The great-grandchildren of Guccio Gucci, who founded the luxury fashion house that bears his name nearly a century ago in Florence, are appealing to filmmaker Ridley Scott to respect their family’s legacy in a new film that focuses on a sensational murder. The House Of Gucci, starring Lady Gaga and Adam Driver, is based on a book about the 1995 murder-for-hire of one of Gucci's grandchildren, Maurizio, and the subsequent trial and conviction of his ex-wife. Patrizia Reggiani, portrayed by Lady Gaga, who served 16 years in prison for contracting the murder. One of Maurizio’s second cousins, Patrizia Gucci, is worried that the film goes beyond the headline-grabbing true-crime story and pries into the private lives of the Guccio Gucci heirs. “We are truly disappointed. I speak on behalf of the family,"" Gucci told The Associated Press on Wednesday (Apr 14). “They are stealing the identity of a family to make a profit, to increase the income of the Hollywood system....Our family has an identity, privacy. We can talk about everything, but there is a borderline that cannot be crossed."" Patrizia Gucci said she reached out to Ridley Scott’s wife, Giannina Facio, for clarification on the scope of the film, but has not received any reply. Facio met with members of the Gucci family in the early 2000s to discuss another project that was to have focused on the roles of Patrizia Gucci's father, Paolo, and grandfather Aldo in expanding the brand into a global luxury player. The fact that the production company did not reach out for the new film only heightens the family's concerns, she said. Ridley Scott’s production company did not respond to requests for comment, made also through their Italian counterpart. The Guccis are not the first Italian fashion family to wrestle with onscreen depictions about tragic events. The Versace family put out a statement in 2018 about the season of Ryan Murphy’s American Crime Story that dealt with the murder of fashion house founder Gianni Versace, saying the TV series was not authorised and should be considered “a work of fiction”. Patrizia Gucci said her family will decide what further action they might take after seeing the film. Their concerns stem from top actors having been cast to play family members whose stories intersect little with Maurizio Gucci’s murder, the lack of current contact with Scott’s production company and inaccuracies they see in the book on which the film is based. Al Pacino plays Aldo Gucci, whom his granddaughter remembers as an expert salesman who opened Gucci stores on Rome’s via Condotti and in New York, bringing in VIP clientele and expanding the brand's global reach. And Jared Leto plays Paolo Gucci, whose creative contributions included the idea to create the Gucci brand's famed double-G logo as well as its trademark plasticised bags and moccasins. It is this story that she recounts in her own book, Gucci, The True Story Of A Successful Dynasty, which was published in Italian in 2015. Patrizia Gucci said paparazzi photos from the House Of Gucci set have not been at all reassuring. “My grandfather was a very handsome man, like all the Guccis, and very tall, blue eyes and very elegant. He is being played by Al Pacino, who is not very tall already, and this photo shows him as fat, short, with sideburns, really ugly. Shameful, because he doesn’t resemble him at all,” Patrizia Gucci said. Leto’s Paolo Gucci, meanwhile, is shown with unkempt hair, and a lilac corduroy suit not at all in line with his daughter’s recollections. “Horrible, horrible. I still feel offended,’’ she said. The Gucci family has not been involved with the Gucci fashion house since 1993, when Maurizio sold his remaining stake to the Bahrain-based company, Investcorp. It was later bought by the French group PPR, which is now Kering. The fashion house is cooperating with the The House Of Gucci, opening its archives to the film company for wardrobe and props. Salma Hayek, the wife of Kering CEO Francois-Henri Pinault, appears in the film. Leto is a close friend of creative director Alessandro Michele. (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/dasmond-koh-not-prepared-speech-star-awards-favourite-artiste-1922931,Why Dasmond Koh doesn't want to 'over-prepare' his Star Awards acceptance speech,"In just a few days, Dasmond Koh will be receiving his All-Time-Favourite Artiste award at the 2021 Star Awards on Sunday (Apr 18). The award is given to an artiste who has won the Top 10 Most Popular Male or Female Artiste award 10 times.  The reception is taking place a little later than initially expected as Dasmond was supposed to have received it in 2020, but the ceremony was postponed because of the pandemic. 
  However, as of Apr 9, the actor-host hadn’t even prepared his acceptance speech. In his interview with 8 DAYS on that date that ran on Apr 14, he told the entertainment portal that he wants to be in the moment. “It’s not that I don’t treasure the award, but if I over-prepare, my speech might not come off as genuine ’cos I tend to try and perfectly memorise the script, so I’d rather say the thoughts that are running through my mind,” he said. And it appears the 49-year-old has also mellowed when it comes to his awards show fashion choices, recalling how he used to have multiple outfits for the evening.  “I guess the older you get, the more down-to-earth you are,” he said. “I still remember for my first few Star Awards, I would put so much care into my hairstyles and clothing, and would even change into two or three suits in one night, dunno for what,” he told 8 DAYs with a laugh. “But this year, I will just have one outfit.” The artiste also remarked that it didn’t matter that he was only getting his award a year after the fact because “my mum, who was the one I wanted to share the award with the most, left in February last year, so she wouldn’t have been able to make it to the show anyway”. Dasmond started his career in entertainment in 1996 when he joined YES 933 as a DJ. He clinched his first Star Awards trophy for Best Newcomer just four years later. He’s now the boss at media agency Noontalk Media, which he started in 2011. The company manages numerous artistes. In the latest episode of Mediacorp talk show The Inner Circle, Dasmond admitted to host Guo Liang that he deliberately “humiliates” his artistes in order to help them build psychological resilience. He explained: ""Imagine you're on a film set and a director shouts at you without any ounce of politeness and everyone there is looking on. If you feel embarrassed, you won't be able to continue acting there and then. But if you are already used to me scolding you in the office with everyone looking at you, you would be able to quickly continue doing what you are supposed to do, having experienced such a situation before and possessing this sort of resilience."" We guess he's a believer of the tough love approach. "

Fury Of The Gods,"Lucy Liu is the latest star to join the anticipated sequel to the 2019 DC Films superhero hit Shazam!. Liu will play the villain Kalypso in Shazam! Fury Of The Gods, scheduled for release in June 2023. The film will begin shooting in May.  The character is the sister of main villain Hespera, who will be played by another new cast member Helen Mirren, whose involvement was announced late last month.  The actresses join the stars from the original film who are reprising their roles, namely Zachary Levi, who plays the title character, and Asher Angel, who plays Shazam’s teenage alter ego Billy Batson. Also returning is director David F Sandberg, who welcomed Liu to the show by tweeting a digitally altered photo of her character from Kill Bill, holding Levi's head.  
   pic.twitter.com/TSh5dMqAWt The characters of Kalypso and Hespera are daughters of Greek god Atlas – the ‘A’ in Shazam. The superhero’s name is an acronym of ancient gods and heroes from whom he draws his power, specifically, the wisdom of Solomon, the strength of Hercules, the stamina of Atlas, the power of Zeus, the courage of Achilles and the speed of Mercury. The 52-year-old Liu has been seen in television projects more recently, including in Why Women Kill and Elementary, where she played Dr Joan Watson in a modern take on the Sherlock Holmes saga. She has also starred in Charlie’s Angel and Kill Bill."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/netflix-live-action-gundam-movie-director-kong-skull-island-1922936,Netflix is making a live-action Gundam movie with the director of Kong: Skull Island,"Netflix’s live-action Gundam adaptation is taking shape – it now has a director attached to the project. Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts is the latest addition to the film after comic book writer Brian K Vaughan (Saga, Y: The Last Man) was announced as writer and executive producer in 2019. Vogt-Roberts is best known for 2017’s Kong: Skull Island. He’s also directing another mech franchise, Metal Gear Solid, which stars Oscar Isaac as Solid Snake. Gundam, the long-running mecha anime, was created by animation studio Sunrise in 1979. The series has spawned dozens of sequels and spinoffs, as well as manga, toys, model kits and video games. The Gundam story is set in the Universal Century when humans have expanded their territory into space colonies. These colonies wage war against the people of Earth for independence with battles fought in Mobile Suits that are giant mechanised robots. Legendary Pictures, the studio behind Pacific Rim and the Godzilla and King Kong “Monsterverse” franchise, will be partnering with Sunrise for Netflix’s live-action project. No further details on the plot or the cast have been released. The upcoming film isn’t the first live-action adaptation of a Sunrise anime, though – Netflix is already working on a live-action version of Cowboy Bebop starring John Cho. That could be released as early as this year.    "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/experiences/singapore-large-scale-events-organised-220711,"As Singapore gradually opens up, how are large-scale events being carried out safely?","When IMC Live Global announced the first live concert line-up for 2021, Singapore music fans were elated and immediately on standby to book their tickets. All 11 editions of IMC’s Al!ve series at Capitol Theatre featuring various Asian artistes, such as Singaporean jazz musician Jeremy Monteiro and singer Art Fazil, and Taiwanese Mandopop artiste Yuming Lai, are now sold out. IMC Group Asia’s group chief operating officer Romell Song said that the support showed Singaporeans’ desire to gain some semblance of normality back into their lives. “There’s an energy and excitement that only a live performance can bring, and our artistes and their fans look forward to that.” From Apr 24, up to 750 persons are allowed at live performances, sports events and business-to-business meetings such as conferences and exhibitions. Official guidelines for concerts are yet to be known and the maximum capacity remains at 250 at the time of writing. While pre-event testing looks like the most viable method for holding large-scale events safely, it remains to be seen if attendees would find multiple tests worth their time and effort. The largest concert with mandatory pre-event Antigen Rapid Test (ART) to-date was a 400-strong crowd at a two-night indoor concert at the Sands Theatre in Marina Bay Sands last December. Some attendees arrived several hours prior to the show for testing – ART takes half an hour to yield results – while others had to make their way to designated clinics earlier on the same day. With vaccinations underway, event attendance would be easier for vaccinated individuals: Those who have completed the full regimen and developed sufficient protection (i.e. two weeks after the second dose of the vaccine) can skip pre-event testings. 
  In March, organisers of tech conference Geo Connect Asia 2021 used pocket-sized movement dongles to track the location, distance and interaction time between attendees at the two-day conference held at Marina Bay Sands. Facial recognition and a QR code-based, contactless check-in system were also used for the event. For IMC, current safe-distancing measures include compulsory check-in via the TraceTogether app, zoning of the audience into groups of 50, prohibiting intermingling between zones and having single-direction entry and exit points. Song said that all overseas artistes entering Singapore undergo a Stay-Home Notice or centralised quarantine, and they are encouraged to tell fans to clap along instead of singing out loud during the concerts. Song shared: “We launched Singapore's first series of live concerts in 2021 because we felt it was necessary for us to operationalise early and improve as the situation gets better. This mode of concert management is still relatively new and we will use this opportunity to study how to make it smoother and more efficient so that the experience for concert-goers will be enhanced.” Those attending the O Soothest Sleep – Bitten’s Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings performance at the indoor Esplanade Concert Hall had to produce negative COVID-19 ART or Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test certificates to be admitted into the venue. Esplanade also worked with ticketing service and solution provider SISTIC on a new ticketing system that can automatically assign chosen seats to be “bubble wrapped” with empty seats around to ensure physical distancing between audiences. Rachelle Tan, Esplanade’s director of venues and planning, said: “We continue to experiment and improve on various seating configurations such as single seating, seating in pairs or groups of four persons. We also stagger the arrival and exiting of audiences into and out of the venue and implemented more contactless and self-service solutions at the front-of-house.” During the Huayi Chinese Festival of Arts from Feb 19 to Mar 14, one of the performances was that of sound artist GayBird performing via livestream from his home base in Hong Kong alongside Singapore’s music ensemble Concordia Quartet live in the Esplanade Recital Studio. Another Esplanade festival, A Tapestry of Sacred Music, held at the beginning of April, featured a musical dialogue between Turkish ney (reed flute) musician Kudsi Erguner in a pre-recording alongside ancient music singers La Voix Medievale live on stage. Tan said: “While digital allows us to reach a wider audience beyond the live performance, we know that it can never replace the immediacy and community of the live experience. We will continue to programme hybrid festivals with both digital and live components, and continue to learn, improve and evolve our offerings. “We will need to find the right balance and a sustainable operating model as there are higher cost implications, digital fatigue, as well as more demands technically and in terms of preparation.” It looks like the industry is heading in the right direction. Louis Vuitton’s first “phygital” catwalk coupled with a livestream on Mar 23 signalled confidence in Singapore’s technical capabilities and the execution of large-scale events safely without losing the crucial personal touch. “From a luxury or fashion brand’s perspective, a major fashion show or event like this is held in key markets for the brands. When a forward-looking brand like Louis Vuitton is prepared to invest in a ‘phygital’ show in Singapore in such times, it is a strong endorsement on several fronts,” declared David See, founder and managing director of Lumina Live!, who collaborated with local fashion veteran Daniel Boey to direct the show. See already has a number of branded exhibitions in the pipeline and “an exciting activation with an international brand” for the second half of the year. “Branded exhibitions and pop-up stores are currently possible, as well as exclusive by-invitation-only product previews. It remains to be clarified if gala dinner events for luxury brands are permissible under the new guidelines. I would like for the regulations given to MICE activities to be applied to luxury and lifestyle events, as currently MICE activities appear to have more leeway compared to leisure or lifestyle events.” For sure, it won’t be long before we can mingle confidently in larger numbers and attend our favourite shows and social events again."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/queen-elizabeth-returns-royal-duties-after-death-prince-philip-221016,Queen Elizabeth returns to royal duties after death of Prince Philip,"Queen Elizabeth II has returned to royal duties, four days after the death of her husband, Prince Philip, as preparations stepped up on Wednesday (Apr 14) for his ceremonial funeral on the weekend. The 94-year-old British monarch attended a retirement ceremony for a senior royal official on Tuesday, according to the Court Circular, the official record of royal engagements. The royal family is observing two weeks of mourning for Philip, who died Friday at the age of 99. The palace has said family members will “undertake engagements appropriate to the circumstances” during the mourning period. The family also released previously unseen photos as they shared memories of Philip. One photo shows the queen and Philip surrounded by seven of their great-grandchildren at a family gathering in 2018. The picture, which shows the queen holding a baby Prince Louis in her lap, is a rare image of the monarch holding one of her great-grandchildren. The queen attended a ceremony at Windsor Castle for Lord Chamberlain Earl Peel, who has retired as the royal household’s most senior official. He oversaw arrangements for the funeral of Philip, also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, until handing over to his successor days before the duke’s death. The queen and Philip’s daughter, Princess Anne, made a public appearance on Wednesday, visiting young sailors at the Royal Yacht Squadron sailing club on the Isle of Wight off England’s south coast. Prince Philip was a Royal Navy veteran and keen sailor. His funeral will take place Saturday at Windsor Castle, with attendance limited to 30 because of coronavirus restrictions. Although it is a scaled-down service because of the pandemic, hundreds of servicemen and women from the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, Army and Royal Air Force will take part in the funeral procession, and Philip’s coffin will be borne to St George’s Chapel at the castle on a specially adapted Land Rover, which he designed himself. Military personnel rehearsed for the event Wednesday at Army Training Centre Pirbright, near London. One of four Royal Marines buglers who will play The Last Post at the service said it was an “honour and privilege” to perform the role. “It’s incredibly important. We feel nervous,” said Sgt Bugler Jamie Ritchie. “We feel the pressure, but we’re channelling that and we’re using that and we’re going to deliver an outstanding performance.” Since Philip’s death his four children have all paid tribute to him, as have grandsons Prince William and Prince Harry. Another grandchild, Eugenie, shared memories on Instagram of “learning how to cook, how to paint, what to read” with her “dearest Grandpa”. “I remember laughing at your jokes and asking about your spectacular life and service in the navy,” wrote Eugenie, who is the younger daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York. “I remember incinerating the sausages and you swooping in to save the day. I remember your hands and your laugh and your favourite beer."" “I will remember you in your children, your grandchildren and great grandchildren,"" she wrote. “Thank you for your dedication and love for us all and especially Granny, who we will look after for you.” (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/royal-funeral-offers-chance-prince-william-harry-to-reconcile-217561,Royal funeral offers chance for Princes William and Harry to reconcile,"When Prince Philip’s funeral takes place on Saturday (Apr 17), it will be more than a focal point for national mourning. Many will also be watching for any signs of reconciliation between Prince Harry and the royal family, especially with his elder brother Prince William. It will be the first time that Harry comes face-to-face with the royal family since he and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, stepped away from royal duties in March last year and moved to California with their young son, Archie. While that departure caused a huge rift in the monarchy, family relations took a further dive last month when Harry and Meghan gave a candid interview with US talk show host Oprah Winfrey. Among other revelations, Harry confirmed rumours that he and his brother had been growing apart, saying “the relationship is ‘space’ at the moment” – though he added that “time heals all things, hopefully”. Harry also told Winfrey that his father, heir to the throne Prince Charles, was not accepting his calls for a time. And the couple threw a bombshell by revealing that an unnamed member of the royal family had expressed concern about “how dark” their child’s skin colour might be due to Meghan's biracial heritage. Days after the explosive racism accusations were aired, William shot back, telling reporters that his was “very much not a racist family”. In spite of the tensions, Saturday's funeral will almost certainly remind the brothers of their shared grief at another royal funeral more than two decades ago – when, as young boys, both walked behind their mother Princess Diana's coffin in 1997. On Saturday, Harry, 36, and William, 38, are both expected to join other senior royals and walk behind their grandfather’s coffin, as the funeral procession makes its way through Windsor Castle. Many observers believe that Philip's funeral will provide an ideal opportunity for “The Firm” to show a united front to the world and for the royal brothers to smooth over tensions. Philip, who had been married to Queen Elizabeth II for more than seven decades, died last week at 99. “They shared emotion. They share grief at the present time because of the death of their grandfather,” former Prime Minister John Major, who was appointed the princes’ guardian after Diana’s death, told the BBC this week. “I hope very much that it is possible to mend any rifts that may exist,” he added. But Angela Levin, Harry’s biographer, said it would be inappropriate for the royals to talk about their personal issues in the run-up to the funeral. It would take time to heal the hurt after the Winfrey interview – and that won’t happen if Harry rushes back to the US afterward, she added. “I absolutely think it would be wrong to be all about themselves before the funeral. And I think that it’s wrong to imagine that they’re going to pour out their hearts and give each other a hug, when so much has happened in the year and William has had to take on so much more responsibility,” she told the AP. Harry arrived in the UK on Monday and is in quarantine, but he can attend the funeral in line with government rules that make exceptions for such occasions. Meghan, who is pregnant with their second child, was advised by her doctor not to make the long trip, officials said. The brothers have had contrasting roles and personalities from birth, though in recent years those differences have increasingly come to the fore. As the younger brother to a future king –the so-called “spare” to the heir – Harry had far fewer responsibilities and a reputation as the party prince before serving in the army and settling down in his 30s. He found success and enjoyed popularity in Britain with the Invictus Games, the sporting event he founded for disabled and wounded members of the military. Yet his place in the monarchy became further diminished with the birth of William’s three children, who bumped him down to sixth in line to the throne. It was clear from at least 2019 that Harry wanted a break from the constraints of the monarchy to craft his own narrative. That year Harry and Meghan separated from the Royal Foundation, originally set up as the brothers’ joint charitable venture, so they could have their own platform. The princes’ separate statements this week in tribute to Philip reflected their personalities and differing styles. While William’s stated that he and his wife Kate will “continue to do what (Philip) would have wanted and will support The Queen in the years ahead,” Harry’s tone was much more informal and light-hearted. The younger brother praised Philip for being “authentically himself” and thanked him for his “dedication to Granny”. He also wrote: “While I could go on, I know that right now he would say to all of us, beer in hand, ‘Oh do get on with it’.” 
  Still, Levin said the brothers had enjoyed an incredibly close bond from childhood and she hoped the time would come for them to reconcile their differences. “Harry said to me when I was interviewing him for my biography, he said that William is the only person he can really trust,” she said. “He felt if he went and met people, he didn’t know if they were liking him for what he was rather than who he was. But they could discuss anything, he and William.” Historian Ed Owens, who wrote The Family Firm: Monarchy, Mass Media And The British Public 1932–1953, about the royal family’s public relations strategy in the last century, agreed that it was “still early days” for a royal reconciliation. “I don’t think there’s going to be any great sort of family get-together or a return to sort of normalcy, sort of pre-Megxit, anytime soon,” he said.

The 41-year-old Taiwanese singer shared the photo on Instagram Stories with the caption, “I’m ready”. The photo shows Elva with a scar from her right cheek to the corner of her mouth. This is the first time she’s shown the full extent of her injury as recent photos always showed her face partially covered. Apple Daily reported that both she and her boyfriend Justin Huang were spotted at a hospital on Feb 17 for treatment. She was reportedly discharged on Mar 23.  She mentioned in a previous interview that some days were harder than others to get through as she “could only lie down and couldn’t move” and even talking and laughing would hurt. She clarified that she was not bitten by her Labrador, Di Di, as was speculated, but by another dog that she adopted. She said she does not blame the dog as it was abused by its previous owner and the incident was unintentional. Elva has five dogs.  The singer is still on medication as the incident resulted in skin necrosis, which means the tissue on her skin is dead."

Azaria recently appeared on the podcast Armchair Expert, hosted by actor Dax Shepard and Monica Padman, where he spoke about what he’s learned from the backlash that came after people called out the character’s stereotypical representation of South Asians. In the Monday (Apr 12) episode, Azaria said that part of him “feels like I need to go around to every single Indian person in this country and personally apologise”. He added that he sometimes does. Azaria shared that he had spoken at his son’s school and had talked to some Indian students there because he wanted some input. ""A 17-year-old … he's never even seen The Simpsons but knows what Apu means. It's practically a slur at this point. All he knows is that is how his people are thought of and represented to many people in this country,"" Azaria said. He added: “I really do apologise. It’s important. I apologise for my part in creating that and participating in that.” Azaria, who is white, voiced the character of Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, the Indian American Kwik-E-Mart manager with a thick accent, since the show started in 1989 before stepping away in January last year. He still voices the character of bar owner Moe on the show but now encourages the casting of actors of colour to voice characters of colour. Azaria used to voice Carl Carlson, a black character in the series, but that role was taken over by black actor Alex Desert last year. The character of Apu was the subject of the 2017 documentary called The Problem With Apu, which studied its negative and stereotypical representation of South Asians. Documentary filmmaker Hari Kondabolu tweeted on Apr 13 that he had nothing but respect for Azaria after the latter’s appearance on the podcast. The tweet read: “Hank Azaria is a kind & thoughtful person that proved that people are not simply ‘products of their time,’ but have the ability to learn & grow.”"

Well, not only is Macaulay Culkin 40 years old now, he’s also just become a dad. The actor’s rep confirmed on Tuesday (Apr 13) that Culkin and Brenda Song have welcomed a baby boy named Dakota Song Culkin. Baby Dakota was born in Los Angeles on Apr 5 and is named after Culkin’s late sister who died at age 29 in 2008 after she was hit by a car. In a statement, the couple said that they were “overjoyed” and that mum, dad and baby are “happy and healthy”. The news came as a surprise as the couple did not announce Song’s pregnancy. After news of the baby was reported, Culkin was called out online after netizens unearthed an interview he did with People magazine in 2018 where he talked about wanting “tiny little Asian babies”. In the interview, he shared that he was excited to have babies with Song. “I’m going to have some pretty babies. She’s Asian, so I’m gonna have tiny little Asian babies. It’s going to be adorable – a bunch of Sean Lennons running around the house, that’s what I’m looking for,” he told People, referring to John Lennon and Yoko Ono’s son. Taiwanese-American culture writer Jeff Yang tweeted, “Congrats I guess”, while another Twitter user said, “We all look like Sean Lennon I guess”. Culkin, who’s currently filming American Horror Story season 10, met 33-year-old Song – who was a Disney Channel star – in 2017 when they both worked on the set of the film Changeland."

West's attorneys filed his response on Friday (Apr 9) in Los Angeles Superior Court to Kardashian West's divorce filing seven weeks earlier, which began the process of ending their six and a half years of marriage. West's filing was virtually identical to Kardashian West's original petition, agreeing that the marriage should end over irreconcilable differences, and that the two should share custody of their children: North, age seven; Saint, age five; Chicago, age three; and Psalm, who turns two next month. And like Kardashian West's filing, West's asks that the court's right to award spousal support to either person be terminated. According to Kardashian West's Feb 19 petition, the two have a pre-nuptial agreement, and under it they kept their property separate throughout their marriage. The divorce filings bring an impending end to one of the most followed celebrity unions in recent decades, between the 40-year-old reality TV superstar Kardashian West, and the 43-year-old rap and fashion mogul West. It was the first marriage for West and the third for Kardashian West, who has not asked the court to change her name back to just Kardashian, though she may still do so during the divorce process.

More talent will be announced in the coming weeks. Mediacorp will air the 93rd Oscars live via meWATCH and Channel 5 on Apr 26 at 6.30am, starting with red carpet arrivals. The three-hour main show is at 8am. (Source: AP/CNA)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/the-met-gala-is-returning-twice-216331,"The Met Gala is returning – with 'more intimate' version this year, larger one next year","The Met Gala is coming back. Actually, twice. The Metropolitan Museum of Art announced on Monday (Apr 12) that the annual high-wattage celebration of both fashion and celebrity – cancelled last year because of the pandemic – will return in person, first in September, then again in 2022 in its usual slot of the first Monday in May. The galas – a “more intimate” version on Sep 13 of this year and a larger one on May 2, 2022 – will launch a two-part exhibition, a survey of American fashion to be on view for almost a year. “In America: A Lexicon of Fashion,” opening Sep 18, will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the museum’s Costume Institute and “explore a modern vocabulary of American fashion”, the museum said. Part two, “In America: An Anthology of Fashion,” will open in the museum’s popular American Wing period rooms on May 5, 2022, and will explore American fashion, with collaborations with film directors, by “presenting narratives that relate to the complex and layered histories of those spaces.” Both parts will close on Sep 5, 2022. Filmmaker Melina Matsoukas (Queen & Slim) has been commissioned to create an open-ended film to project in the galleries, with content changing during the course of the exhibition. There was no immediate word on who the celebrity hosts, or chairs, would be for the galas, traditionally a heady mix of luminaries from fashion, music, film, TV, sports and other arenas. The first gala in September will be smaller, and held in accordance with government coronavirus guidelines. The second next May is intended to be larger, in line with previous galas which typically hold about 550 guests. The gala is a major fundraiser, providing the Costume Institute with its primary source of funding. In 2020, the gala was cancelled but fans were invited to engage in a social media challenge to recreate favourite red-carpet looks. “Fashion is both a harbinger of cultural shifts and a record of the forces, beliefs, and events that shape our lives,” said Max Hollein, director of the Met, in a statement. “This two-part exhibition will consider how fashion reflects evolving notions of identity in America and will explore a multitude of perspectives through presentations that speak to some of the complexities of history with powerful immediacy."" As always, the exhibits will be the work of star curator Andrew Bolton. “Over the past year, because of the pandemic, the connections to our homes have become more emotional, as have those to our clothes,” he said in his own statement. “For American fashion, this has meant an increased emphasis on sentiment over practicality.” He said that in accordance with this shift, Part One of the exhibition will establish “a modern vocabulary of American fashion based on the expressive qualities of clothing as well as deeper associations with issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion”. As for Part Two, it will “further investigate the evolving language of American fashion through a series of collaborations with American film directors who will visualise the unfinished stories inherent in The Met’s period rooms”. In addition to Matsoukas, other confirmed collaborators from the film world include cinematographer Bradford Young, whose projects have included Selma and When They See Us; production designers Nathan Crowley and Shane Valentino; and Franklin Leonard, film executive and founder of The Black List, a listing of top unproduced screenplays.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/style/costume-designers-guild-honour-tv-producers-shonda-rhimes-212276,"Costume Designers Guild to honour TV producers Shonda Rhimes, Betsy Beers","From Grey’s Anatomy to Bridgerton, television producers Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers have strived to work with costume designers to visually create appealing wardrobes to help tell their character's story. Now, both women will be recognised for their successful collaborative efforts at the Costume Designers Guild Awards. The guild announced on Monday (Apr 12) that Rhimes and Beers will be honoured with the Distinguished Collaborator Award. The award will be presented by Bridgerton actor Nicola Coughlan during the 23rd annual ceremony, which will take place on Tuesday on Twitter. Rhimes and Beers both gave credit to the costume designers who have worked with them. The award honours individuals who demonstrate support of costume design and creative partnerships with designers. “This feels more like a giant compliment to the costume designers that we’ve gotten to work with over the years,” said Rhimes, founder of television production company, Shondaland. She said several costume designers helped her understand the different nuances of fashion. “I was somebody who started off my career at Grey’s Anatomy wearing pyjama paints, sweats and the same red T-shirt to work every day,” she continued. “I had no fashion sense whatsoever. I find it fascinating that I knew nothing about clothes, but costumes designers taught me about fashion and how the details can tell a story.” Beers said costume design has been a huge focus on their projects, because she says a character's wardrobe draws the most scrutiny. “Costume design is one of the few areas in our business that everybody has an opinion about,” said Beers, who has worked alongside Rhimes on other hits shows including Scandal, How To Get Away With Murder and Private Practice. The women have been longtime producing partners since 2002. “It’s the ability to take into consideration so many points of view while at the same time finding ways to innovate and create trends and create looks,” she said. “It’s getting the world to get onboard with a different style of dressing.” Past award recipients include Meryl Streep, Quentin Tarantino, Judd Apatow, Clint Eastwood and Guillermo Del Toro. Guild president Salvador Perez said the Rhimes-Beers duo has created “cultural-defining TV moments” with the support of their collaborators and costume designers. “They are originals; fierce, brilliant women who create rich worlds, characters and stories that enhance our lives,” said Emmy-winning costume designer Ellen Mirojnick, who worked as a costume designer on Bridgerton. “It’s truly been a gift collaborating with them.” Lyn Paolo, an Emmy-winning costume designer, called both women innovative collaborators. “Every new world that they present is a lush landscape in which I have room to create beautiful pictures, a world where the clothes can help to tell a small part of the story,” said Paolo, who worked with them on Scandal and How To Get Away With Murder.” “I love that those landscapes include diversity, challenge norms, and allow for strong female leads.” Rhimes and Beers said they feel humbled and encouraged by the praise to better themselves. “We’re constantly trying to improve,” Beers said. “I don’t think we ever take it for granted and that we can do better in every step of the way. That’s what keeps us going. And that’s what keeps making it fun. It keeps your creative mind working.” (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/prince-philip-vs-philip-of-netflix-the-crown-fact-and-fiction-212861,Prince Philip vs Philip of Netflix's The Crown: Fact and fiction,"In The Crown, a dishy naval officer captures the heart of a future queen. But he chafes at playing royal second fiddle and crosses the boundaries of decorum and, maybe, fidelity. He eventually finds his way as a trusted partner and family patriarch. How does the Netflix drama’s portrayal of Prince Philip, who died at age 99 on Friday (Apr 9), compare with the man himself and the life he lived with Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II? Prince Philip dwelled in his wife's shadow, and the same goes for Philip in The Crown, as the title makes plain. But some episodes take a fuller measure of the man, or at least the character (played in succession by Matt Smith and Tobias Menzies, with Jonathan Pryce in the wings). Peter Morgan, creator of the series that's in a lull before its fifth and penultimate season arrives in 2022, has said The Crown is the product of historical research and imagination, and includes scenes not to be taken as fact. Barring a tell-all from the parties involved, for instance, we don't know if Philip was as rigid in his approach to parenting son Charles as he was sensitive with daughter Anne, as The Crown has it. Or what to make of the drama's dainty hints of marital infidelity by Philip. The series thus far has brought Philip to middle age, covering only half of the real royal's nearly 100 years. Also absent from The Crown is Philip's unapologetic fondness for demeaning one-liners about women and people of colour. But there are aspects of the Greek-born prince's life that warrant comparison to the fictional version, whom The Crown depicts in a mostly flattering light: A bold and restless spirit, one bound to the end by duty and devotion to queen and country. DOMESTIC STRIFE The Crown: Reluctant to surrender traditional male privilege, Philip wants their children to carry his last name (Mountbatten), not hers (Windsor). The answer is no. When the death of Elizabeth’s father, King George VI, brings her to the throne, Philip leaves military service for the role of consort. Quarrels with Elizabeth follow, including over his reluctance to kneel to her during her coronation. They find a balance, with Philip a worthy half of an affectionate marriage. In reality: When Philip lost his bid to use Mountbatten as the family name, according to Gyles Brandreth's Philip And Elizabeth: Portrait Of A Royal Marriage, he complained, “I am nothing but a bloody amoeba"", a man barred from giving his children his name. Eight years later, it was decided the couple's descendants would use a hyphenated surname – as in Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, the son of Harry and Meghan. Under protest or not, Philip knelt before the newly crowned queen in 1952 and pledged to become her “liege man of life and limb, and of earthly worship”. On their 50th wedding anniversary, Elizabeth called him ""my strength and stay"". MAN OF ACTION The Crown: In 1969, Philip is immersed in TV coverage of the first moon landing and faults his life in comparison. After prosaic royal engagements at dental and textile facilities, the trained flier has the opportunity to take the controls of a private jet. He pushes the plane toward the edge of space and, as the pilot protests that the trembling aircraft is at its limit, Philip responds: “Perhaps. But look, we've also lived. Just for a minute.” Meeting with the US astronauts when they visit England as part of a victory lap, Philip tells them his position and marriage kept him from “the things I would've liked to, as a man, as an adventurer”. In reality: During World War II, Philip saw action while serving on battleships and destroyers, was decorated and, at age 21, achieved the rank of first lieutenant in the Royal Navy. While he carried out a full schedule of royal duties and headed hundreds of charities, he learned to fly in the 1950s and was an avid polo player and yachtsman, as well as painter and art collector. Still driving at 97, he flipped his Land Rover in a crash. MAN OF FAITH The Crown: Philip is asked to allow a spiritual retreat to be created on Windsor Castle's grounds for clergy in need of midlife inspiration. He ridicules the plan as “hot air” but agrees to it, and ends up finding solace in its version of a men's therapy group. ""'How's your faith?'"" he recalls his mother asking him with concern, then tells the gathering and its dean, ""I'm here to admit to you I've lost it ... I come to say, ‘Help.'” In reality: Robin Woods, the then-dean of Windsor, proposed the founding of St George’s House in 1966 and Philip became its co-founder and an enthusiastic fundraiser, according to a companion book to The Crown by historian Robert Lacey. The centre fosters discussion of contemporary issues, its website says. Woods and Philip were lifelong friends, and the prince would critique his sermons at Windsor's St George's Chapel. Philip's funeral will be held there on Apr 17. Christened in the Greek Orthodox Church – though a practising Anglican, married to the supreme governor of the Church of England – Philip was a visitor to Mount Athos, a monastic community and religious sanctuary in Greece. Leaders of several faiths in Britain say he took a deep interest in spiritual matters. His coat of arms bears the motto, “God is my help”. ON TEAM DIANA The Crown: When Diana Spencer is introduced at a family gathering at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, she and Philip bond over a day of stag hunting and he supports her marriage to Charles. The relationship turns bitter, and Diana tells Philip she's considering splitting with Charles and the royal family she finds uncaring. Philip cautions her against the step and faults her perspective: Everyone is an outsider apart from the queen, the “one person, the only person, who matters,” he says. In reality: In letters between Diana and Philip said to have been leaked, Philip is supportive of Diana and critical of his son's extramarital affair with now-wife Camilla. But after Diana's candid TV interview and a revealing biography, Philip's tone allegedly turned sterner and he wrote that she must “fit in” or exit the family. (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/elvin-ng-bullied-on-set-gets-response-from-patrick-lee-1922951,Elvin Ng’s story of being bullied on-set gets a response from Taiwanese actor,"Taiwanese actor Patrick Lee has responded via Instagram to allegations of him “bullying” Elvin Ng on-set years ago. Local actor Elvin Ng went on the Mediacorp talk show The Inner Circle last week and spilled some tea on how he was mistreated by his co-star back in 2018 when they were shooting in KL. He recounted that the actor would mock him, distract him while shooting to make him forget his lines, and rudely put his chair over his bag. While Elvin didn’t name names, he did say that the person is a veteran Taiwanese actor who played his older brother. It didn’t take long for netizens to play detective and conclude that it has to be Patrick Lee as they played brothers in Mediacorp’s 2018 drama, Gifted. 
   A post shared by 李沛旭 Patrick Lee (@patricklee_proudtobe) Patrick’s management team was quick to respond that the actor is “polite” and they find it “hard to believe” that this would happen between Patrick and Elvin. “The truth will speak for itself. The other staff who were also on set can confirm what really happened. Our side does not wish to cause any more dispute, so we will not be responding further to this matter.” Then on Saturday (Apr 10), Patrick personally took to Instagram to address the matter. He did not directly mention Elvin’s name or the incident but he wrote: “A Taiwanese person who is all ‘alone’ in a place that is ‘full’ of Singaporeans… bullying a Singaporean?! Where is the logic? If you were the Taiwanese person, would you do that? Congratulations, you have become a little more famous!” Elvin posted a picture of a tree on his Instagram a day later in what appears to be a response. The caption read: “It doesn't matter, it just came out in casual chatter; and if it mattered, it wouldn't have taken a couple of years. Not a thing, just some straight-speaking-say-it-as-it-is picked up by the wind, gained some speed, and then also gone with the wind. Live and let live, there are bigger things.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/malaysian-celebrity-neelofa-apologises-covid-19-breach-wedding-1922956,"Malaysian celebrity Neelofa apologises for COVID-19 breach during wedding, trip","Malaysian actress-turned-entrepreneur Neelofa has publicly apologised for the breach of COVID-19 safety measures during her Mar 27 wedding to Muhammad Haris Muhammad Ismail, a former contestant on an Islamic reality series. She also apologised for going to Langkawi for a trip with her husband after the wedding even though there was an interstate travel ban.  Neelofa, whose real name is Noor Neelofah Mohamad Noor, sent a video statement to Malaysian media on Friday (Apr 9). She explained that she recorded the video after she and her family had gone to the police station to give their statements. She said, “I sincerely apologise for violating the SOP, within and beyond my knowledge on these two matters. My husband and I admit and accept any actions or decision from the authorities.” Neelofa also apologised for being insensitive towards the issue. “There are a lot of things I might have overlooked and I should have set a better example,” she added. The 32-year-old incurred the public’s ire after photos of her wedding showed that guests were not wearing masks and were not following safe distancing rules by sitting shoulder to shoulder. She and her 26-year-old husband, better known as PU Riz, also faced backlash for travelling to Langkawi after the wedding in what they described as a work trip but which many people speculated was their honeymoon after videos emerged of them going on a cable car ride and jet-skiing. Soon after that, she was criticised for launching a line of “Muslim friendly” slippers with Malaysian brand Flipper, leading people to accuse her of exploiting religion."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/nomadland-wins-4-baftas-including-best-picture-director-213556,"Nomadland wins 4 BAFTAs including best picture, director, actress","Gig-economy Western Nomadland won four prizes including best picture on Sunday (Apr 11) at the British Academy Film Awards, which were handed out during a pandemic-curbed ceremony that recognised a diverse array of screen talent. Nomadland filmmaker Chloe Zhao became only the second woman, and the first woman of colour, to win the BAFTA for best director, and star Frances McDormand was named best actress. Nomadland also took the cinematography prize. Emerald Fennell’s revenge comedy Promising Young Woman was named best British film, while the best actor trophy went to 83-year-old Anthony Hopkins for playing a man grappling with dementia in The Father. An event that was criticised in the recent past with the label #BAFTAsSoWhite rewarded a diverse group of talents, including black British star Daniel Kaluuya, newcomer Bukky Bakray – who shone as a London teenager in Rocks – and veteran Korean actress Youn Yuh-Jung. The fact that Britain remains under coronavirus lockdown measures, with its movie theatres still closed, gave the evening a poignant tone, as did the death on Friday of Prince Philip, husband of Queen Elizabeth II, a long-time patron of the British film academy. Prince William, who had been due to attend and make a speech in his role as president of Britain’s film academy, was absent following the death of his grandfather. The ceremony opened with a tribute to Philip, who was the academy's first president in 1959. Presenters including Hugh Grant, Tom Hiddleston, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Priyanka Chopra Jonas announced the winners from the stage of London’s Royal Albert Hall, but recipients accepted their honours remotely, and there was no black-tie audience to cheer them on. Director Remi Weekes, who won the British debut prize for his first feature, His House, noted the surreal sensation of accepting the award while sitting in his living room in a tuxedo. Nomadland stars McDormand as a middle-aged woman who travels the American West while living out of her van and picking up short-term work. Zhao, who lived among real American travellers for the film, thanked “the nomadic community who so generously welcomed us into their lives”. “How we treat our elders says a lot about who we are as a society, and we need to do better,” she said. The only previous female directing winner was Kathryn Bigelow in 2010 for The Hurt Locker. The British film academy expanded its voting membership and shook up its rules last year in an attempt to address a glaring lack of diversity in the nominations. In 2020, no women were nominated as best director for a seventh consecutive year, and all 20 nominees in the lead and supporting performer categories were white. Under new rules that, among other things, made watching all longlisted films compulsory for academy voters, this year’s slate of acting nominees was strikingly more diverse, and four of the six filmmakers nominated for best director were women: Zhao, Sarah Gavron (Rocks), Shannon Murphy (Babyteeth) and Jasmila Zbanic (Quo Vadis, Aida?). Asked what her directing prize meant for Asian women in film, Zhao said: “If this means more people like me get to live their dreams, then I feel very grateful.” BAFTA chief executive Amanda Berry said the academy was “determined to make change”. “We are not there yet, this is definitely still a work in progress, but I am really pleased with how far we have come,” she said. Kaluuya was named best supporting actor for playing Black Panther leader Fred Hampton in Judas And The Black Messiah. Youn appeared astonished to win the best-actress prize for Korean-American family drama Minari. The Korean performer said she had always thought of the British as “very snobbish people”. But, she later clarified, “not in a bad way”. Bakray, 19, won the Rising Star award, whose previous winners include Kaluuya, Kristin Stewart, Tom Hardy and John Boyega. “I don’t know how to feel,” she said. “When we filmed Rocks, I thought 100 people would watch this film, max.” Danish director Thomas Vinterberg’s Another Round was named best film not in the English language. Vinterberg paid tribute to his daughter Ida, who had been due to appear in the film and died in a car crash at the start of the shoot. “We made this movie for her, so the honour granted by you, BAFTA voters, means more to us than you could ever imagine,” he said. The British awards are usually held a week or two before the Academy Awards and have become an important awards-season staging post. This year, both the BAFTAs and the Oscars were postponed from their usual February berths because of the coronavirus pandemic. BAFTAs in craft and backstage categories were handed out in a separate ceremony on Saturday, when Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom won two prizes, for costume design and hair and makeup. Other double winners included The Father (best actor and adapted screenplay), Sound Of Metal (editing and sound), Promising Young Woman (British film and original screenplay) and Soul (animated film and musical score). Director Ang Lee was awarded the academy’s top honour, the BAFTA Fellowship. Actor, writer and director Noel Clarke received the outstanding British contribution to cinema award, dedicating it to “my young black boys and girls out there that never believed it could happen to them"".

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/actress-fann-wong-avid-baker-but-son-zed-doesnt-have-sweet-tooth-1975311,Actress Fann Wong is an avid baker but her son doesn't have a sweet tooth,"No matter how successful or popular one may be, their kids will always keep them in check. Fann Wong knows that for sure as she recounted during a recent interview about having to chase her six-year-old son to get him to taste the cakes that she baked. The 50-year-old star became quite the 'circuit baker' last year; she often posts her delicious bakes on Instagram and shares her recipes. While many people would definitely love to get their hands on these fresh-out-of-the-oven goodies, it seems her son, Zed, is not a fan. Fann told Lianhe Wanbao in a recent interview that her son does not have a sweet tooth. “My son doesn’t like desserts. Ever since he was young, he didn't eat candies or cakes ... he will not be tempted by sweet treats,” she said. Quite unlike his mum, apparently. Fann admits she loves sweet treats and even jokes that she has a second stomach for desserts. “I always tell my husband that I am full and unable to take another bite, but I end up having dessert before we leave the restaurant.” Husband, actor Christopher Lee, is not a big fan of sweet treats either but has been trained by her to appreciate it once in a while. The actress is not ruling out the possibility of turning her hobby into a business. She told Lianhe Wanbao: “If I do sell my bakes, it is in the spirit of fun. I like to mix work and play together, where I can play seriously, just like being a judge in a contest.” She's referring to the upcoming Channel 8 baking competition, Creme De La Creme, where she's one of the judges, alongside fellow actress Jeanette Aw and pastry chef Janice Wong. Fann said she’s thrilled to see so many young and talented bakers on the show. Creme De La Creme premieres on Channel 8 on Apr 28 at 8pm."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/crash-landing-on-you-seo-ji-hye-kim-jung-hyun-deny-dating-1922966,K-drama Crash Landing On You couple deny that they’re dating in real life,"Sorry, Crash Landing On You fans – romance didn't blossom twice on the set of the romantic K-drama. Fans were overjoyed to hear that stars Seo Ji-hye and Kim Jung-hyun, who played a couple in the K-drama, had got together in real life. This came after the show’s main stars – Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin – confirmed their relationship earlier this year. However, the joy was short-lived as Seo and Kim’s respective management agencies quickly shot down the rumours. Korean news outlet Sports Chosun first broke the story of Seo and Kim dating on Thursday (Apr 8), reporting that they had fallen for each other while filming the series and that they had been dating for a year. Entertainment news portal Dispatch soon ran photos of the two stars purportedly arriving at a carpark of one of their homes for a date. The site also said that they spent a lot of time together this past year. Seo’s agency Culture Depot, however, denied the rumours, saying, “Seo Ji-hye and Kim Jung-hyun’s dating rumours are completely false. We checked with the actress for confirmation, and her response was that the rumours are absurd”. The agency explained that Kim, who is 31, was looking for a new agency so he met with Seo, 36, to discuss that, and they had met at home because of COVID-19. 
  Kim’s agency issued a similar response, saying that the two actors are only close because they worked on the show together. Crash Landing On You ran for 16 episodes in 2019–2020. Seo played an heiress called Seo Dan while Kim played a South Korean fugitive called Koo Seung-joon."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/mortal-kombat-chin-han-shang-tsung-1883846,‘I felt possessed’: Singapore’s Chin Han on being Mortal Kombat villain Shang Tsung,"How does a first-time feature filmmaker convince Singapore’s only bona fide Hollywood blockbuster star to play one of the most iconic villains in video game franchise history in a film reboot? If you’re Mortal Kombat director Simon McQuoid, you entice Singaporean actor Chin Han with a sneak peek at the costume design of soul-stealing sorcerer Shang Tsung. “I don't know if you realise this, but Shang Tsung’s breastplate and his shoulder armour – they all have faces of the souls he has taken on the actual armour!” Chin Han shared. “And so when I saw that, that was the thing that sealed the deal for me.” Chin Han, whose Hollywood credits include strong supporting roles in massive films like The Dark Knight, 2012, Contagion, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Independence Day: Resurgence, Ghost In The Shell and Skyscraper, told CNA Lifestyle that he “didn’t think that (he) would be doing Mortal Kombat”. “And then Simon McQuoid wanted to speak to me. He basically came to the conversation armed with all this concept design, artwork and stuff that was so amazing!” he gushed. “He’s one smart director. He knew that if he showed me all that stuff, I mean, it was just impossible to say ‘No’!” It was such an elaborate costume, according to Chin Han, that it required a team “that is the village to put it on”. “It had to be (done) piece-by-piece because only (doing it) piece-by-piece are we going to be able to move in the way that was necessary. And to be able to fight it in it as well,” he explained. He added: “On the first day, when we put that on and we did some test shoots and stuff, I felt possessed basically. It was completely emotional for me, in terms of character, because it is so heavy. But you feel so fierce and you feel so powerful.” Indeed, taking on the beloved franchise’s much celebrated baddie Shang Tsung is no small feat – especially since the fan favourite demonic shapeshifter who absorbs the living souls of those he defeats to maintain his youth and power is one of the original Mortal Kombat characters in the first arcade game, and helped cement its notoriety throughout the franchise’s history. Other actors who have taken on the mantle include Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa in Paul WS Anderson's 1995 film of the same name and Bruce Locke in the TV series Mortal Kombat: Conquest 1998-1999. But it was McQuoid’s quest to cast the entire Mortal Kombat cast appropriately that was most important for Chin Han. Compared to 1995’s controversial version that had white actor Christopher Lambert playing Japanese thunder god Raiden, this reboot boasts a diverse Asian cast, hailing from all corners of the world including international stars like Indonesian Joe Taslim as Sub-Zero and Chinese-Canadian Ludi Lin as Liu Kang. “It is such a warm feeling when you go on set and you see Asia represented in such a diverse way. I think a lot of people say ‘Asia’, yet missing the nuances of what that means,” shared Chin Han. “Asia is a big place… it's a diaspora of cultures. And so, stepping on set, it felt wow. We are like this contingent from the southern hemisphere, arriving on this giant Hollywood movie. And there is a great sense of community. I mean it felt like the Olympic Village really, when we were there,” he said. “And so, it was very important. There was a feeling that was very important in putting this movie together. Because that's what the movie is about right? I mean, Mortal Kombat is all about groups of champions from different realms, fighting each other, but none of them can do it alone, right? They all have to do it in a group. And so I think the group of us as cast and crew kind of reflected that.” Mortal Kombat is screening in Singapore cinemas now."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/elvin-ng-the-inner-circle-1922971,No more Mr Nice Guy: Elvin Ng shares how he pushed back when bullied by a co-star,"With his youthful good looks, actor Elvin Ng does come across as Mr Nice Guy but judging from an incident he spoke about during his recent appearance on the talk show The Inner Circle, you may not want to test that by pushing him too hard. Elvin told host Guo Liang that he had an incident with a co-star while filming a show in KL. Elvin didn’t name names but he did say that the other actor was a Taiwanese star who was apparently more established but who had a smaller role in the series. Among the things that the other actor did was to distract Elvin so he would forget his lines and then he would mock Elvin for doing so. The final straw was when the Taiwanese actor was deliberately distracting and also making disparaging remarks on the last day of production. Elvin yelled at him and also decided to speak to the producer about the bullying. “I asked to see the producer, and I was furious but also shedding tears because I had been bullied the whole time,” he said.  Although he was upset at himself for not hanging in there until production ended, he decided that he would have felt sorry for himself if he hadn't spoken up.  It seems the Mister Flower star does have a bit of a rebellious streak in him. He opened up about his growing up years and how he went from a model student to someone who played truant. He was a good student who started skipping classes when he got to junior college. He recalled an incident where even though he completed his homework, the teacher accused him of copying it from someone else. “I was furious and told the teacher I did it myself. Then I walked out of the classroom,"" he said. From then, he became more rebellious and ended up having to repeat his second year of junior college. 
  He worked hard, though, and later graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in English Literature from National University of Singapore. In fact, he would have become an English Literature professor if show business hadn’t come knocking. Later in the interview, the 40-year-old actor was surprised by his two close actor friends, Romeo Tan and Sheila Sim. They spilled the tea on his temper and how he used to have very high expectations of others as he does for himself. Now, he is much more relaxed and takes things easily, which makes him a happier person."

The period drama was taken off the air after just two episodes after viewers complained of historical inaccuracies. It seems like the actors of the show can’t catch a break just yet. Not only have they endured bad press over the whole episode, it appears they may not be paid for the work they’ve already put in. According to AllKPop, which quoted a report from Ilgan Sports News, the actors had already completed filming 14 of the 16 episodes that were supposed to air. However, the production company is looking to only compensate them for two episodes. An unnamed source from one of the actors’ agencies called it “a frustrating situation”. The person said: “We’re in a difficult situation because we can’t ask the drama production team to pay us for the work that our actors have done. However, our agency will be in a more difficult situation if we do not get back the investment we put in every episode”. The show's main actors included Jang Dong-yoon, Park Sung-hoon and Kam Woo-sung. 
  The series was set in ancient Korea and centred on the Joseon era's royal family as they battled evil spirits. It faced backlash after it first aired on Mar 22 over scenes that showed Chinese cultural influences as well as claims of historical distortions. Controversial scenes include its depiction of the third king of the Joseon dynasty killing innocent people, and the fourth king receiving a guest in a room with Chinese foods such as mooncakes. Sponsors pulled commercials from the series and it was soon cancelled."

Williams made the call in an Instagram post on Monday (Apr 5) after attending his cousin's funeral in Virginia Beach, where Williams grew up. “I had to speak at my cousin’s funeral, and was choked up with emotions,” he wrote on the social media post. “Too many unanswered City and State questions. Respectfully, I am calling for a Federal investigation. I also humbly ask that you all keep the family in prayer."" An email to the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia was not immediately returned. Donovon Lynch, 25, was killed in the early morning hours of Mar 27 along the city’s popular oceanfront strip of hotels and restaurants shortly after two other nearby shootings unleashed chaos. Police said Lynch, a black man, had a handgun and that it was recovered from the scene. But the officer’s body camera had not been activated. The officer who killed Lynch is also black. The city’s police department recently turned over the investigation into Lynch’s death to the Virginia State Police. Lynch lived in Virginia Beach. He was an offensive lineman for the University of Virginia’s College at Wise during the 2017 and 2018 seasons and a 2019 graduate of the school. (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/thomas-ong-funny-exchange-young-guy-didnt-recognise-him-1922981,'Are you famous?': Thomas Ong recounts funny exchange with young guy in same course,"Thomas Ong may be a household name for many, especially those who grew up watching local dramas on television. However, the younger generation may be unaware of his fame. On Tuesday (Apr 6), the actor-turned-durian-seller posted a hilarious story on Instagram that began with him sharing that he had completed a food safety course that allows him to “legally” open the fruits for his customers. He wrote that throughout the course, he was relieved that he had his mask on so no one would recognise him. It turned out that may not have been necessary. Thomas went on to talk about two course mates who he jokingly called “little rascals” as they are only in their 20s. The star of Channel 8’s Super Dad said that he decided to give the two guys a lift home as they lived near him. They even stopped by a coffee shop to have a meal before heading back, during which time a woman approached Thomas for a picture and he happily obliged. “Are you famous?” asked one of the youngsters, who is 23 years old. “I am an influencer,” Thomas replied. He went on to ask the young man if he had heard of Wang Lei, referring to the 60-year local veteran actor. Thomas’ new friend then asked him what sort of influencer he was, and also if he was as old as Wang Lei. The former actor, who is 52, jokingly asked if he looked very old, to which the young guy replied, “You look older than my parents. Sorry, I am very blunt”. We then find out that the guy’s parents are 43 years old. 
  Thomas found the whole exchange so funny that he had to share it with his more than 100,000 Instagram followers, with the hashtag #generationgap. He ended the post with multiple laughing emojis, saying that he figured he does not need to wear a mask at all as no one will recognise him in the first place."

He was 54 and had been suffering from a brain tumour. A familiar face to British television viewers and theatregoers, Ritter played Martin Goodman, the eccentric father of a London Jewish family, in the acerbic but warm Channel 4 sitcom Friday Night Dinner. He also played ill-fated nuclear engineer Anatoly Dyatlov in the Emmy-winning HBO drama Chernobyl; the wizard Eldred Worple in Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince; and a devious political operative in the James Bond film Quantum Of Solace. Those who worked with Ritter in his most famous roles rated him highly. Robert Popper, the creator of Friday Night Dinner, said Ritter ""was a lovely, wonderful human being. Kind, funny, super caring and the greatest actor I ever worked with”. Chernobyl screenwriter Craig Mazin said on Twitter that Ritter was “one of the most gentle, gracious and brilliant people I’ve ever known, much less worked with. We lost him today, and far too soon. I wish his family and loved ones peace and comfort as they mourn the passing of this beautiful man”. Ritter was a compelling stage actor, a frequent and memorable cast member in productions at Britain’s National Theatre, including All My Sons, Coram Boy and The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-Time. He also appeared in Art at London’s Old Vic and on a West End stage as Prime Minister John Major, performing opposite Helen Mirren's Queen Elizabeth II in the royal drama The Audience. The actor was nominated for a Tony Award in 2009 for his performance in Alan Ayckbourn’s farce The Norman Conquests on Broadway. Actor Russell Tovey said Ritter was “one of the nicest and best actors you’ll ever meet"". Actor-comedian Rob Delaney tweeted that Ritter had ""knocked it out of the PARK in Chernobyl. Watching it I consciously thought, ‘Oh, we have a new movie star.’ Between that & how funny he was in Friday Night Dinner... just unreal talent”. Agency Markham, Froggatt & Irwin said Ritter died Monday night “peacefully at home with his wife Polly and sons Frank and Noah by his side”. “Paul was an exceptionally talented actor playing an enormous variety of roles on stage and screen with extraordinary skill,” the agency said. “He was fiercely intelligent, kind and very funny. We will miss him greatly.” (Source: AP)"

The 20-year-old actress is dating her The Teenage Textbook The Series co-star Gavin Teo. They became Instagram official in early March when Gavin posted a photo of them together with the caption, “missing this one”.

He even joked that he used to be the number one man in his daughter’s heart, but his spot has been taken over by her new beau. Yixin previously revealed that she didn’t date while in school because her family was very protective over her and her dad confirmed that he did tell her when she was around 16 years old that “she can't date too early"".

The 43-year-old star told host Ellen DeGeneres during her talk show on Monday (Apr 5) that the BTS ARMY “was brave enough to support my vulnerable moment”, which led to him writing two motivational books – Do Your Best Every Day To Do Your Best Every Day and Be A Work In Progress: And Other Things I'd Like To Tell My Younger Self – out on Apr 6. Cena said he was going through “a pretty down period” in his life about four years ago when he decided to have “a vulnerable moment and put one of those thought-provoking entries out on Twitter”. He added that many of his posts were about self-love at the time because he was going through a period where he didn’t consider himself enough.   He went on to say that he was inspired by BTS because that was also the time they released their third album, Love Yourself: Answers, in 2018. ""So I put out all these messages about self-love and I'm thinking, 'This is not going to be a good idea because this big, larger-than life, 16-time WWE champion is now talking about vulnerability and the fact that you are enough and you shouldn't be ashamed of who you are,' but it caught fire because of the BTS ARMY,"" Cena said. Cena explained that he was essentially sending a similar message as the band, hence “these books exist because the BTS army was brave enough to support my vulnerable moment. And now it's become a part of my daily routine"". He added: ""I really gotta thank K-pop. I gotta thank BTS for supporting me in a moment of weakness and turning it into a passion of mine"". Cena has shown his love for BTS before. In 2018, he joked that he would be willing to act as the group’s bodyguard after fans called for protection for the band when their arrival at a Korean airport caused a frenzy. He also gushed about the band in 2020 to Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon, saying, “One, they are great performers. But it's the message they send, it resonates with the people”. Cena will next appear in the ninth instalment of the Fast & Furious franchise, due out in May."

She was 95. Hashida had been treated for the illness since earlier this year. She died on Sunday (Apr 4) at her home in Atami, west of Tokyo, according to Pinko Izumi, an actress who appeared in many of the dramas Hashida wrote, including Oshin. Born in Korea in 1925 during the Japanese colonisation of the Korean Peninsula, Hashida moved to Japan in the late 1930s and grew up in Osaka. She joined the Shochiku film studio in 1949 before becoming a freelance scriptwriter for television dramas, including the hugely popular morning drama series Oshin broadcast in 1983 to 1984 on NHK public television. The fictionalised drama is based on the biography of a Japanese woman who co-founded supermarket chain Yaohan and her multiple hardships from her childhood until her final days in the 1980s. Oshin was broadcast in more than 60 countries around the world and gained high acclaim. Her other popular dramas include the long-running series Wataru Seken wa Oni Bakari, or Making It Through, a family drama which started in 1990 and aired more than 500 episodes. Actress Izumi, who was in both Oshin and Wataru Seken wa Oni Bakari, said she was at Hashida's bedside when she died. “I said to her ‘mama’, then she briefly opened her eyes, then it was as if she went back to sleep,"" Izumi said in an interview with Japanese media. Hashida wrote a book asking for the right to die in dignity. According to her request, there will be no funeral. Hashida received the Japan Order of Culture last year. (Source: AP)"

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/netflix-trial-of-chicago-7-takes-top-honours-screen-actors-guild-196746,Netflix's The Trial Of The Chicago 7 takes top honours at Screen Actors Guild Awards,"The starry cast of Aaron Sorkin’s 1960s courtroom drama The Trial Of The Chicago 7 took the top prize on Sunday (Apr 4) at a virtual Screen Actors Guild Awards where actors of colour, for the first time, swept the individual film awards. The 27th SAG Awards, presented by the Hollywood actors’ guild SAG-Aftra, were a muted affair – and not just because the red carpet-less ceremony was condensed to a pre-recorded, Zoom-heavy, one-hour broadcast on TBS and TNT. The perceived Academy Awards frontrunner – Chloe Zhao’s Nomadland – wasn’t nominated for best ensemble, making this year’s postponed SAG Awards less of an Oscar preview than it is most years. Still, the win for Netflix's The Trial Of The Chicago 7 marked the first time a film from any streaming service won the guild’s ensemble award. Written and directed by Sorkin, The Trial Of The Chicago 7 had been set for theatrical release by Paramount Pictures before the pandemic hit, leading to its sale to Netflix. The streamer is still after its first best-picture win at the Oscars. Frank Langella, who plays the judge who presided over the 1969 prosecution of activists arrested during the 1968 Democratic National Convention, drew parallels between that era’s unrest and today’s while accepting the award on behalf of the cast. “‘God give us leaders,’ said the Rev Martin Luther King before he was shot down in cold blood on this very date in 1968 – a profound injustice,” said Langella, citing events leading up to those dramatised in The Trial Of The Chicago 7. “The Rev King was right. We need leaders to guide us toward hating each other less.” The win came over two other Netflix releases – Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom and Da 5 Bloods – as well as Amazon’s One Night In Miami and A24’s Minari. Had Lee Isaac Chung’s Korean-American family drama Minari won, it would have been the second straight year a film largely not in English won SAG’s top award. Last year, the cast of Parasite triumphed, becoming the first cast from a non-English language film to do so. The SAG Awards are a closely watched Oscar harbinger. Actors make up the largest branch of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, and SAG winners often line up with Oscar ones. Last year, Parasite went on to win best picture at the Academy Awards, and all of the individual SAG winners – Renee Zellweger, Brad Pitt, Laura Dern, Joaquin Phoenix – won at the Oscars, too. Those awards this year went to a group entirely of actors of colour, potentially setting the stage for a historically diverse slate of Oscar winners: Chadwick Boseman, best male actor for Ma Rainey's Black Bottom; Viola Davis, best female actor for Ma Rainey's Black Bottom; Youn Yuh-Jung, best female supporting actor for Minari; and Daniel Kaluuya, best male supporting actor for Judas And The Black Messiah. Of those, Davis' win was the most surprising in a category that has often belonged to Carey Mulligan (Promising Young Woman) or Frances McDormand (Nomadland). It's Davis' fifth individual SAG award. “Thank you, August, for leaving a legacy for actors of colour that we can relish the rest of our lives,” said Davis, referring to playwright August Wilson. As it has throughout the awards season, best male actor again belonged to Boseman for his final performance. Boseman, who died last August at age 43, had already set a record for most SAG film nominations – four – in a single year. He was also posthumously nominated for his supporting role in Da 5 Bloods and shared in the ensemble nominations for both Spike Lee’s film and Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom. It was the SAG Awards where Boseman gave one of his most memorable speeches. At the guild’s 2019 awards, Boseman spoke on behalf of the Black Panther cast when the film won the top award. “We all know what it’s like to be told that there is not a place for you to be featured,” Boseman said then. “Yet you are young, gifted and black.” The Academy Awards frontrunner, Nomadland missed out on a best-ensemble nomination possibly because its cast is composed of largely non-professional actors. Zhao's film previously won at the highly predictive Producers Guild Awards, as well as at the Golden Globes. The Trial Of The Chicago 7, up for best picture at the Oscars and four other awards, could pose a challenge to the frontrunner. In an interview following the pre-taping of the award for The Trial Of The Chicago 7, Langella called the virtual experience much more civilised. “I’m in my bedroom slippers,” he said from New York’s Hudson Valley. “I have no pants on,” added his co-star Michael Keaton. Eddie Redmayne, who plays Tom Hayden in the film, credited Sorkin and casting director Francine Maisler for assembling such a disparate group of actors – including Sacha Baron Cohen, Mark Rylance, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Jeremy Strong – into an ensemble. “It was like a clash of different types of music, whether it was jazz or rock or classical - but all of that coming together under Aaron. He was the conductor, almost,” said Redmayne. “It was a joy day and day out to watch these great and different and varied actors slugging it out.” In television categories, the ensembles of Schitt’s Creek (for comedy series) and The Crown (for drama series) added to their string of awards. Other winners included Anya Taylor-Joy (The Queen’s Gambit), Gillian Anderson (The Crown), Jason Sudeikis (Ted Lasso), Jason Bateman (Ozark) and Mark Ruffalo (I Know This Much Is True). The awards are typically the highest profile event for the Screen Actors Guild, though the union’s faceoff earlier this year with former President Donald Trump may have drawn more headlines. After the guild prepared to expel Trump (credits include The Apprentice, Home Alone 2) for his role in the Capitol riot, Trump resigned from SAG-Aftra. (Source: AP)"

On Tuesday (Mar 30), Rui En’s official fanclub, RBKD, shared an update from the actress regarding her dad’s hospitalisation following a heart attack earlier this week. In the Instagram post, Rui En shared that she got a text from her dad, who lives in New Zealand, on Mar 28 at around 7pm while she was on set doing a night scene. “He calmly explained his symptoms and informed me that he was having a heart attack. That he had 3 or 4 similar attacks in the past few days but he didn't inform anyone. Ambulance was on the way. He asked me to begin praying,” she wrote. Her father was hospitalised and went through an angioplasty to restore blood flow in his artery. He will also be going through a triple bypass next week, she said. Rui En added that the doctor who looked after her father said that it was a good thing he went to the hospital when he did, or “he would have had a major life-threatening event in as little as 6 months”. The 40-year-old local actress shared her feelings about the incident, saying that being so far away from a loved one who is having a health crisis during the pandemic “is an incredibly helpless and frustrating experience”. “My heart goes out to all who are in similar situations. Yet I also realized that even if he were right here in SG, I would be equally helpless. It absolutely isn't in my hands,” she said. Her retiree father lives a rural and “off-the-grid” life in New Zealand, she once revealed to entertainment site 8 DAYS. Rui En went on to thank her friends and church members who had been praying for her father’s recovery despite not knowing him personally. ""Please keep me and my family in prayer”, she said."

The 27-year-old star, whose real name is Lee Ji-eun, made the revelation during her appearance on the Korean variety show You Quiz On The Block on Wednesday (Mar 31). She shared, “When I was young, I had a lot of self-hatred. Even if I achieved good results, it was hard for me to love myself when I was in my early twenties”. IU added that things changed when she turned 25 years old and wrote the song Palette, which has the lyrics “I think I know myself now”. She explained that she wrote those words because she no longer had any lingering disappointment in herself, and that there were no more surprising or new things about herself. “I just learned to accept myself as I am, including my shortcomings and strengths.” When the show’s host asked her why she often sings about her age, IU replied that since she writes her own songs, she realised that that’s not much to write about, other than the fact that your age changes every year. “Every year, I found myself changing. Eighteen-year-old me and 23-year-old me compared to the IU I was last year are all different.” IU recently released her fifth album, Lilac, and to commemorate the occasion, she made a 100 million won (US$88,500) donation to two non-profit organisations under the name IUAENA, a combination of her name and her official fan club (UAENA). Despite her huge popularity and success as both a singer and an actress, it seems IU has also remained very humble. When asked how she felt about being the icon of this generation, she insisted that she was just lucky. “I’m able to do the music I want to do because the public listens to it. I’m not trying to be humble, but honestly, how lucky am I? I’m very grateful.”"

The streaming company said on Wednesday (Mar 31) it has reached a deal for two sequels to Rian Johnson's acclaimed 2019 whodunit, Knives Out. Netflix declined to say how much it was paying for the films, which Johnson will direct with Daniel Craig returning as inspector Benoit Blanc. But Deadline, which first reported the deal, said the price would approach US$450 million – making it one of Netflix's largest – and most sweater-clad – acquisitions. It also lands Netflix something it has dearly sought: The kind of major film franchises that traditional studios have long depended on. Production on the second Knives Out, written by Johnson and produced by him and Ram Bergman, is to begin this summer. Netflix outbid several other streaming services to land Knives Out, something that was even possible because the 2019 film was produced by Media Rights Cable and distributed by Lionsgate on a single-picture deal.

This comes after online chatter that the name is similar to that of Chun Young Cho, a real-life prominent figure during South Korea's 1987 student protests. Jisoo’s character was initially named Young Cho. South Korean broadcast company JTBC released a statement saying that although the character’s name is not related to the activist, they will change it since it’s been pointed out that it’s similar. Snowdrop, which is scheduled to air in the second half of this year, began facing criticism after the series synopsis was circulated online recently. There were concerns about a possible distortion of historical facts as the drama was said to be set during the pro-democracy movement and the male lead was a spy who infiltrated the movement while another male character was described as a team leader in the intelligence service. 
  South Korean viewers have been sensitive about issues surrounding Korean history following the cancellation of K-drama Joseon Exorcist after just two episodes. Viewers were upset over the historical distortions in the show, which included its depiction of the third king of the Joseon dynasty killing innocent people and the fourth, King Sejong, receiving a guest in a room with Chinese foods such as mooncakes. The backlash for Joseon Exorcist was swift and its lead actor Jang Dong-yoon has issued an apology for his role in the controversy. He said, ""I’m incredibly sorry. I failed to fully recognise that this drama would become so problematic ... I only looked at the drama from the perspective of an actor acting out a creative work. I neglected my responsibility to look carefully (at the drama) from a societal perspective"". JTBC responded to criticisms of Snowdrop, clarifying that the controversy comes from incomplete synopsis and character descriptions, as well as speculations and false information. They explained that the drama will not deal with the pro-democracy movement and that the leads of the show do not participate in the movement.  They also clarified that the background of the show is the 1987 presidential election and not the pro-democracy movement. The company also asked people to refrain from misleading the public with false information."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/world-last-blockbuster-video-rental-store-more-popular-netflix-294791,World's last Blockbuster video rental store more popular after Netflix documentary,"The Blockbuster video rental store in Bend, Oregon, soared to international fame when it became the last such franchise on Earth two years ago. Now, a new Netflix documentary called The Last Blockbuster brought even more interest in the form of visitors, mail and online orders to the unassuming location in a central Oregon strip mall 170 miles (270 kilometres) east of Portland. Since the documentary aired on Mar 15, people from all over the world have sent flowers and called the store just to say “thank you” for staying open. In the backroom, staff members have been busy packaging thousands of online orders for Blockbuster T-shirts, hats and face masks, which are all made by Bend businesses. The movie focuses on the manager’s day-to-day work running the store, which became the last in the world when the Blockbuster in Perth, Australia, closed two years ago. It was made by two local filmmakers who saw history and nostalgia in the store's perseverance. “It’s a little bit crazy, but it’s a very good thing,” store manager Sandi Harding told The Bulletin in Bend. “We’ll take a little crazy if it means keeping the store open.” Harding is the star of the movie, which peaked as high as the No 4 movie in the United States since it appeared on Netflix on Mar 15. The Blockbuster video rental store in Bend was already popular when it became the last location on Earth. It drew visitors from across the United States and as far as Taiwan and London. “It’s good for the store. It’s good for the community,” said Harding, who has been stopped in the grocery store by fans who want to take her picture. “And I can learn to live with my newfound fame as long as it doesn’t mess with what we are doing every day.” The two Bend filmmakers behind the documentary, Taylor Morden and Zeke Kamm, had no idea if the store would stay open when they started filming in 2017. Morden said he has heard from people who call Harding a national treasure and say the store must remain open at all costs. He is pleased to know the film’s attention on Netflix may be what keeps the store open. “For us to have some small part in helping the store stay open is amazing,” Morden said. “Not a lot of documentaries actually accomplish the goal of their story.” The Bend Blockbuster has no plans to close. It has a steady lease agreement, and the local owners, Ken and Debbie Tisher, have leased the property since 1992, when it was a Pacific Video store. The store was franchised in 2000 and became a Blockbuster. In its heyday, Blockbuster Video had 9,000 stores around the world. But in-store video rental stores began struggling with the rise in on-demand streaming services such as Netflix – the very streaming service now offering the Blockbuster documentary. In 2010, Blockbuster declared bankruptcy, and by 2014, all corporate-owned stores had shuttered. That left locally owned franchises like the one in Bend to fend for themselves, and one by one, they closed. When stores in Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska, shut down in 2018 – barely outlasting a Redmond, Oregon, store – Bend’s Blockbuster was the only US location left. Then, in 2019, the only other Blockbuster in Perth, Australia, shut its doors, leaving Bend as the last store. The movie also reveals that Blockbuster had an option to buy Netflix years ago, when the company was still a mail-order DVD service and hadn't transformed into the dominant streaming service it is now. The video empire's leadership, however, saw Netflix as a niche market with limited potential and declined to buy it, according to the documentary and previous news reports. But beyond the business details, the movie taps into the nostalgia felt by people of a certain age as the world speeds up and personal interactions become less frequent, the filmmakers said. Many watching it recall working in Blockbuster stores themselves or renting from them often in their younger years. “It’s affected people emotionally,” Kamm said. “I think it reminded people that we had this thing that was such an important part of our lives. Hopefully it reminds people to appreciate the things they have now.” Both filmmakers feel connected with the Bend Blockbuster, even though they are done filming their movie. They contact Harding regularly to find out if she needs more DVDs of their movies or movie posters to sell at the store. “I’m sure I’ll be involved with the folks at the last Blockbuster until they ever close,” Morden said. “There is no way we are not going to be connected.” (Source: AP)"

He posted pictures on Instagram of him and his friends in a casual setting with a huge “Happy Birthday’ sign at the back, and captioned the post, “My Birthday Bash part 1!”. 
   A post shared by JJ Lin (@jjlin) On Saturday, he cranked it up and threw a bigger party where the birthday boy and his pals dressed up in suits for a 007-themed bash. JJ posted multiple pictures on Instagram with more famous friends like actress Ouyang Nini and singer and racecar driver, Jimmy Lin, with the party background draped in black and gold. He wrote, “They say a picture says a thousand words, but this time the pictures aren’t enough to express the love and gratitude I have for all my friends and family who have been with me all these years! My big 40, we celebrated it with a bang, in style!” 
   A post shared by JJ Lin (@jjlin) However, the post that got everyone’s attention was his special dedication to singer Jay Chou, complete with a photo of the both of them looking dapper in their dark suits. Lin gave an Instagram shout-out to his buddy, writing in Chinese: “Very happy that Jay Chou could spend my birthday with me this year! And he even stayed till the very last second! (I’m) touched”. 
  The celebration continued as the birthday boy dropped his eight-track English EP, Like You Do, at midnight. The release is the second half of his double EP Drifter/Like You Do. The first part was released in October last year and featured six Mandarin songs. JJ also teased an epic collaboration with a female singer who will be revealed next month. It didn’t stop there – JJ also thrilled fans by announcing his upcoming virtual concert on Jun 6 which will be the grand finale to his Sanctuary World Tour.  JJ is obviously not slowing things down now that he's hit 40. "

Korean entertainment news portals reported on Monday (Mar 29) that production company Pop Music will be adapting the popular TV series into a musical by 2022. According to Soompi, Pop Music has signed global publication rights with Studio Dragon and that performances will start in Seoul in mid-2022. The company’s CEO Kim Jin-seok revealed that they’ve received lots of interest about the project from actors and foreign production companies because of the series’ popularity. Crash Landing On You, which aired on tvN in South Korea, is about a South Korean heiress (played by actress Son Ye-jin) who is forced to make an emergency landing in North Korea when she has a paragliding mishap. She meets a North Korean officer (played by Hyun Bin) who ends up helping her and despite unpleasant initial encounters, the two fall in love.

The 48-year-old actor captioned his Instagram post: ""A disruptive and unstoppable global force of a message from the man in black himself”. 
   A post shared by therock (@therock) Johnson’s Black Adam character is one of the main antagonists who goes up against superhero Shazam. The film debuts a year before Shazam! Fury Of The Gods, making it likely that DCEU is setting up Black Adam to be the big villain in the 2023 movie. The first Shazam! film was released in 2019 and starred Zachary Levi of TV series Chuck fame. Black Adam will feature other Justice Society of America characters. Noah Centineo from Netflix’s To All The Boys plays Atom Smasher, Aldis Hodge is Hawkman, Quintessa Swindell is Cyclone and Pierce Brosnan stars as Doctor Fate. The film was originally set for release this December but was postponed because of the pandemic. Fans can now look forward to Jul 22 next year for the blockbuster directed by Jaume Collet-Serra to hit theatres."

He was 66. The actor, affectionately known as Uncle Chi, had been battling stomach cancer in recent months. His management company L&P Entertainment released a statement on Sunday saying that his family had been at his side when he died and that he had “returned to the arms of his heavenly father”. The statement also said that he died at Hong Kong’s Prince of Wales Hospital at 8.32pm. Liu’s wife, former TVB actress Barbara Chan, told Hong Kong media earlier this month that he had been diagnosed with stomach cancer in December. Last week, the late actor’s management company announced that he had stopped working due to health problems. Liu had acted in more than 90 dramas and 70 movies in his long career. He won best supporting actor awards for Cageman in 1993 and The Beast Stalker in 2009 at the Hong Kong Film Awards. He was nominated another six times, with the most recent one in 2019 for Project Gutenberg.  He also acted in Toggle and ViuTV’s co-produced drama, Bluetick, as well as the film Imperfect, which was produced by and starred Singapore actor Li Nanxing.  The statement from the agency also said that the family thanked medical staff for their care in the past few months, as well as the public and media for their concern and blessings. Liu’s death comes a month after another veteran Hong Kong actor, Ng Man-tat, died. Ng died on Feb 27 at the age of 70 after being diagnosed with cancer last year."

One of them shows dozens of people – all dressed in white – sitting close to each other with many not wearing masks.

One commenter said he got married last month but the mosque only allowed three people from his family to witness the ceremony. 
  Neelofa told Malaysian media that she and her now-husband first met in 2017 and worked on a project together in 2018 but did not contact each other again until a year after that, which was when they got to know each other better.

K-drama Joseon Exorcist has officially been cancelled after just two episodes and less than a week after it premiered. The series, which is set in ancient Korea with historical figures as characters, faced backlash after it first aired on Monday (Mar 22) over scenes that showed Chinese cultural influences as well as claims of historical distortions. On Friday, Korean network SBS, which airs the show, issued a statement saying they were cancelling the drama, reported entertainment portal Koreaboo.  The statement read: “SBS has decided to cancel the contract for the broadcasting rights of Joseon Exorcist and cancel the broadcast, after recognising the severity of the previous incidents"". The network added that they had paid most of the fees for the broadcast rights for the show and the production company had completed almost 80 per cent of filming. And although they were concerned about the financial losses as well as the gap in programming after the show is pulled off the air, they feel “a heavy responsibility as a public broadcast network” and thus have decided to cancel the programme. 
  Among the many issues that upset viewers was the use of Chinese-style props and food, such as Chinese mooncakes and century eggs. SBS initially apologised and announced that they would take a one-week break to revise the show. However, more than 20 South Korean companies soon pulled out of running commercials on the show and as of Thursday, more than 160,000 people had signed a petition to the presidential Blue House to ask for the show to be removed.  "

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/falcon-winter-soldier-anthony-mackie-sebastian-stan-chilli-crab-1883851,Singapore chilli crab with Tiger beer? Anthony Mackie wants that in Falcon And The Winter Soldier,"It’s pretty obvious that Singapore boasts more than our fair share of die-hard Marvel and Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) devotees. Which explains why the Internet was abuzz when Singapore’s very own Tiger Beer was spotted as Bucky “Winter Soldier” Barnes’ beverage of choice while on a date during the first episode of The Falcon And The Winter Soldier on Disney+. It was the perfect ""something extra"" for local fans to feel just that bit closer to their beloved Marvel universe. “Well, we got to get more in there then!” Sebastian Stan, who plays the Winter Soldier, told CNA Lifestyle with a smile. But if his co-star Anthony Mackie had his way, it’ll be Singapore’s chilli crab that will next make an appearance on the much-buzzed six-episode Disney+ series. “Chilli crab! Always chilli crab!” Mackie, who plays Sam “Falcon” Wilson, shouted out enthusiastically during the interview. And as responses to two separate topics no less. Perhaps he’s a fan?   Not only does the 42-year–old actor think that the iconic Singapore dish should find its way onto the show, it’s also the very thing that he remembers and misses the most since his last trip here in 2016 when the cast of Captain America: Civil War were in town to promote the movie. For Stan, being on top of the Marina Bay Sands rooftop with “that view” was a big trip highlight. But it was you, the Singapore fans, that really blew him away.    “Just being at that mall! That was maybe the loudest place I've ever been inside of, you know?” he recalled. “The (Singapore) fans there! The reception was absolutely crazy!” And that very crazy fan reception continues with flourish, what with the long-awaited The Falcon And The Winter Soldier finally streaming worldwide on Disney+. The series is what fans and critics alike believe to be the much deserved vehicle to showcase the inimitable chemistry between Mackie and Stan; the opportunity to dive deeper into their popular characters and the perfect platform for the pair to shine as leading men. And what makes The Falcon And The Winter Soldier stand apart from the other Marvel shows on Disney+ is how the story is steeped in realism, and unafraid of delving into real-world problems like mental illness, PTSD and racism. “I always felt the Captain America storyline was always the most familiar in a lot of ways,” shared Stan. “They're both regular guys in a sense, right? Nobody here is a God with tremendous superpowers. They have a past that's grounded – their experience with war, soldiers, veterans and all the work that they've done. So yes, there's a lot of real human issues here, you know, but that's what's good about it.  I think that's what sets us apart.” What also hasn’t changed is the obvious on- and off-screen connection between the characters and the actors who play them. The secret sauce, Mackie tells CNA Lifestyle, lies in the “patience and trust” between him and Stan, nurtured over years of working together.   “I think we're in a position now where we respect and admire so much that I can look to Sebastian for ideas, notes and direction,” revealed Mackie. “Even at times when I try something, I can ask him if it works, and I know he'll give me an honest opinion. So I think the patience and the trust of it all is what makes the bromance work so well. Because we'll let each other go as far as we want to go.” Stan agrees. ""Trust is a big thing, you know? And balance. I mean it felt like we needed to approach every scene that we had like that,” he shared. “And to be able to have that kind of freedom on the level of this kind of a project? It was very different and very special.” With the bromance clearly still operating at the highest possible level both on-screen and off, the transition from movie to a six-episode series seems incredibly smooth. That said, if perennially cheeky Mackie is to be believed, there is one thing that has changed: Stan’s ego has now “100 per cent” reached diva status. “He’s taken Tom Holland’s place,” quipped Mackie, who can never resist taking a playful dig at the actor who plays Spider-Man. “The biggest difference (from the movies) is that Sebastian now has to have have a bigger trailer. And he's always late to set! And he has his own makeup person that can only do his makeup in his trailer,” joked Mackie. “He even has his own catering! That's the biggest problem! Other than that, everything's okay.” But Stan wasn't going to go down without a comeback. ""I was going to say that I think you're confused!"" he retorted with a grin. ""You're either on the movie set of Doctor Strange or on Spider-Man. Because that's not my world. Or if so, it's someone doing a really good job impersonating me!"" And therein lies another mark of a good bromance – the ability to poke fun at each other.  The Falcon And The Winter Soldier is currently streaming on Disney+."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/godzilla-vs-kong-a-heavyweight-bout-with-a-light-touch-285386,Monster showdown: Godzilla Vs Kong is a heavyweight bout with a light touch,"The original 1950s Godzilla movies stomped into theatres carrying a metaphor about nuclear destruction. Two years ago, Godzilla: King Of The Monsters sounded alarms about climate change. But don’t fret about finding a message amid the mayhem as the towering radioactive lizard clashes with that instantly-recognisable giant ape in Godzilla Vs Kong, which debuted on Wednesday Mar 25). ""It’s about two big guys bashing each other around,"" laughed actor Rebecca Hall, who plays a researcher studying King Kong. ""There is a sense that the less that humans meddle with stuff, the better, is a general theme. “But yeah, it’s mostly a big fight,"" she said. Director Adam Wingard’s clash of the titans caps Legendary Entertainment’s “Monsterverse” series, which includes 2014′s Godzilla and 2017′s Kong: Skull Island. While not all were winners with critics, they’ve grabbed plenty of cash at the box office – more than US$1.4 billion (S$1.89 billion) worldwide. All four films take their central creatures seriously – both within the stories and by pouring money into nuanced special effects – while often winking at audiences with self-aware references. The films have featured performances from top-caliber actors enjoying the silliness of it all: Bryan Cranston, Ken Watanabe, Tom Hiddleston, John C Reilly, Sally Hawkins, Vera Farmiga. In the newest entry, the returning Millie Bobby Brown and Kyle Chandler are joined by Hall, Alexander Skarsgård, Brian Tyree Henry and Eiza González, among others. No matter the scene, the actors always knew who was filling the top spots on call sheets during production – Godzilla and King Kong. “They’re divas, that’s what’s so difficult. You go on to set, they don’t look at you in the eye. It is in their contracts. Whatever. I found it really difficult to work with specifically Kong, just because he thought he ruled the roost,” cracked Brown. “You just want your close-up. And Zilla is like ‘rawr’ and you’re like, ‘Bro, calm down.’” Wingard said he focused on keeping the humans “as close together as possible” with the monsters throughout his film, including an ET-evoking moment with deaf actor Kaylee Hottle. But when the titular showdowns start, “it was really important to me to do what the original films did. Like if you look at all the Showa-era films, when the monster battles happened, it just stays with the monsters. ... We wanted to make sure the monsters were able to do their thing and just get into it”. That includes a fight on and underneath an aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean, with Kong struggling and Godzilla moving smoothly and realistically through water. Later, shattering neon highlights an eye-popping clash among and through the skyscrapers of a heavily-stylized Hong Kong. Skarsgard, whose character leads a human team following Kong to the film’s most fantastical location, said Wingard’s approach was to “really lean into the craziness of it. And his take on it was, well, if you’re going to go big, go really big. Go crazy, let’s have fun with it, we haven’t seen these titans go toe-to-toe in 50 years, 60 years. So let’s really enjoy this.” Godzilla’s atomic breath and Kong’s chest-thumping were crafted for maximum sensory impact, but viewers can also see it on the small screen. A pandemic-disrupted rollout has the film debuting Wednesday both at theatres and on US streaming service HBO Max. The film’s stars say they’re just happy to share the spectacle, whether it’s on an IMAX or iPhone screen. “These are extraordinary times that demand extraordinary measures,” said Demián Bichir, who plays an overreaching tech mogul. “This is one of those films that will be seen in every corner of the planet. And that alone makes me very, very happy.” Henry, the Atlanta series star who plays a conspiracy-theorising podcast host, said the film’s extravagance feels right for this moment in the pandemic. “People need something to just like celebrate and cheer and have fun and see millions of dollars of special effects,” he said. “It’s like we shifted what we do in summer blockbusters to the spring because it’s like we just need something to break out, something to have fun with.” Legendary and distributor Warner Bros haven’t announced any future ""Monsterverse"" installments after Godzilla Vs Kong. Wingard said he’d be happy to return to a “phase two” of the franchise, envisioning a “nearly silent film where we just watch the monsters do their thing"". “There are enough characters that are well-enough defined where we can imprint whatever we want on them,” he said. “I think audiences are ready. And I think the special effects world is up-to-date to be able to handle that."" (Source: AP)"

However, fans have not been privy to the story of how the actor proposed – until now, that is. Joanne revealed all in her recent appearance on the Mediacorp talk show The Inner Circle. The actress told host Guo Liang that Yuwu proposed during the Qixi Festival, which is known as Chinese Valentine’s Day. “He flew from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur to visit me at work,” Joanne shared. “When we were outside the hotel room, I noticed that he looked a bit nervous and was behaving differently. He was breathing very hard.” She added: “Suddenly, he took out an enormous bouquet of roses from his suitcase, and I immediately knew what was going on” The 36-year-old star said that her memory got a bit fuzzy at that point but she does remember that there were tears and that Yuwu had knelt on the floor to propose. Her husband, who came on to the show later as a special guest, explained that he was breathing so hard because he was excited. He said, “We were together for only about a year before we got married, but the feeling was right, so I thought I should do it”. Joanne concurred: “Sometimes, when you find the right person, they will bring out certain things from you. With him by my side, I feel a lot more at ease”. The actress also opened up about her backlash she faced after winning her first Star Awards for Best Actress in 2009 for The Little Nyonya. At the time, she was criticised as some people felt she didn’t deserve to beat Jeanette Aw, Fann Wong or Zoe Tay. “The first time I won, people had something to say. The second time I won, people also had something to say. Even when I was nominated for Best Supporting Actress, people still had something to say!” she said, while dabbing her tears. “But I’m also grateful for experiences like that ’cos they helped me to grow, and today I can say that awards are not my main goal.” Joanne recently picked up the award for Best Leading Female Performance – Digital at the Asian Television Awards in January for her role in the Mediacorp production, Last Madame. "

This no longer serves me as positively as it serves me negatively, and I think that's the right time to call something."" Teigen's account was popular for its mix of jokes about her husband John Legend and their children, their playful banter on the site, funny observations about assorted topics and fierce retorts for those she disagreed with or who criticised her. That reputation is at odds with who she really is, the model and cookbook author wrote. “My life goal is to make people happy,” she wrote. “The pain I feel when I don't is too much for me. I've always been portrayed as the strong clap back girl but I'm just not.” Last year, Teigen shared the heartbreak of a miscarriage on the site, posting an anguished picture of her in the hospital. Another image showed her and Legend grieving over a bundle cradled in her arms. While her candour about the loss of their son won praise, some criticised her for putting such painful moments on social media. 
  She wrote on Wednesday that she’s experienced so many attacks from low-follower accounts that she’s “deeply bruised”. In one of her final posts, she told her followers to “never forget that your words matter” Teigen’s Instagram account, with more than 34 million followers, remains active as does Legend's Twitter account, with 14 million followers.

Not only was she dropped as a brand ambassador for luxury label Prada almost immediately, now it seems she may also be digitally removed from a drama series. According to entertainment portal JayneStars, which cited Hong Kong news portal HK01, Zheng’s face in the upcoming drama A Chinese Ghost Story will be digitally replaced with that of actress Peng Xiaoran. This is in the hopes that the series can be approved for release. It appears it’s not the first time such measures have been taken. JayneStars also reported that Zheng’s face was blurred out in a brief scene in Dt. Appledog's Time. Zheng was said to have been paid 160 million yuan (S$33 million) for her role in Ghost Story and now that the production is losing money, investors want to take legal action to recover their money. Zheng’s ex-boyfriend Zhang Heng accused the 29-year-old actress of abandoning their two children born to US-based surrogate mothers after the couple split up. He said she abandoned them before they were born. Audio recordings surfaced of Zheng, Zhang and their parents discussing what to do with the unborn children. Zheng was heard expressing annoyance that the children couldn’t be aborted because the surrogate mothers were seven months pregnant at the time.  Soon after the scandal broke, China released a new list of moral guidelines for actors and other performers. They face a permanent ban if they fail to comply. Performers who break the rules will only be allowed to work again after obtaining the approval of an ethics unit. The actress still has two other dramas that have not aired: Secret Keepers and Jade Lovers."

The ONE Campaign announced on Wednesday (Mar 24) the new series called Pandemica, which will launch on Thursday. The series was created to bring attention to global vaccine access in an effort to end the COVID-19 pandemic. The seven-episode series will feature characters voiced by Kumail Nanjiani, Danai Gurira, Michael Sheen, Phoebe Robinson and Wanda Sykes. The first episode will include Nanjiani, Robinson and Meg Donnelly. “Pandemica’s animated world animates a simple truth – that where you live shouldn’t determine whether you get these life-saving shots,” said Bono, U2's lead singer and co-founder of ONE, an organisation focused on global health and anti-poverty. The series is part of ONE's ONE World Campaign, which calls for a global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. “Even while many of us still wait our turn, we need to commit to making sure that billions of people around the world aren’t left at the back of the line,"" he continued. “It’s the right thing to do, obviously, but it’s also the only way out of this pandemic for all of us. If the vaccine isn’t everywhere, this pandemic isn’t going anywhere.” Cruz said she wants everyone who watches the animated series to “use their voice and take action” to ensure that no one gets left behind. “Pandemica is a compelling illustration of the inequality around the world,” Cruz said. All episodes will be available on Thursday at ONE’s website and the campaign’s YouTube channel. The episodes will be released in several countries including the United States, Canada, Nigeria, South Africa, Senegal, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands. “We’re all trapped in Pandemica, but only some can get out,” Oyelowo said about the series. “This virus thrives on inequality, and right now billions of people around the world are seeing the promise of a vaccine, but not the opportunity to receive it. We must step up and do what it takes to end this pandemic for everyone, everywhere.” (Source: AP)"

In an autopsy report released on Monday, the Los Angeles County coroner said 28-year-old Brown Jr died Nov 18 from the combined effects of cocaine, alcohol and the opioid fentanyl. In a statement to The Associated Press, Brown Jr's parents and their attorney emphasised the fatal dose of fentanyl in his system, and its frequent unexpected presence in the street versions of other drugs. “My family continues to mourn my son’s death,"" Bobby Brown said in the statement. “This epidemic is out of control and those supplying this lethal drug should be held responsible for the death and destruction that it causes.” Brown Jr's mother Kim Ward said he “associated himself with the wrong people"". ""My son is gone and those who contributed to his senseless death should be held accountable,” Ward said in the statement. 
  Police have presented prosecutors with a case related to the death and it is under review for possible charges, Los Angeles County district attorney's spokesman Greg Risling said Tuesday. He gave no further details on the suspects or the circumstances. According to interviews with police at the scene included in the autopsy report, Brown Jr had drank tequila, snorted cocaine and used what he believed was oxycodone before his girlfriend found him unconscious on the bedroom floor of his Los Angeles home hours later. In many recent cases, prosecutors have charged drug dealers directly in the deaths of those they provided drugs to, not simply with selling illegal drugs. In the 2018 accidental overdose death of rapper Mac Miller in a home just a few kilometres from the one where Brown Jr died, federal prosecutors have charged three men with providing the drugs that caused his death, including pills that appeared to be oxycodone but contained fentanyl.

It’s unclear how much screen time the child actor will get, although it has been reported that he was paid US$1,005 a day. The ninth installment of the franchise began production in June 2019 in England and was set to be released in theatres last summer. However, the US$200 million blockbuster was pushed back to Jun 25 this year due to COVID-19. It turns out that another of Diesel’s kids was involved in the show in a behind-the-scenes manner. In 2020, the actor, whose real name is Mark Sinclair, told talk show host Jimmy Kimmel that his six-year-old daughter, Pauline, had requested for Cardi B to be in the film. So he made it happen. The upcoming ninth instalment of the franchise picks up after the events of 2017’s The Fate Of The Furious. This time, Dom Toretto has to face his younger brother, Jakob, who has a personal vendetta against him. Newcomer to the franchise John Cena plays Jakob.

There was barely a moment in the early 2000s where you could turn on the radio and not hear one of her songs. Prepare to be transported back to those times as Spears recently shared a throwback video on Instagram of herself performing as a teen with an added bonus – it appears she was in Singapore for the show. The 39-year-old Spears shared the clip on Saturday (Mar 20) of herself singing You’ve Got It All by The Jets, explaining that her mum had initially sent her the video to remind her that she could sing. 
   A post shared by Britney Spears (@britneyspears) The caption read: “Geez … My mom sent this to me and reminded me that I can sing!!!! She said ‘You never sing anymore … you need to again!!!!’” Spears then said the video was “definitely from a while ago” and that it was one of the first trips she took alone. She added: “Mostly I just remember saying ‘WOW Singapore’”. According to Buzzfeed, the video was likely from the time Spears was 17, in 1998, before her debut album had even come out. The portal referenced pop music blog MuuMuse that unveiled the full video in 2016 of that showcase performance. Spears last performed in Singapore in June 2017, where she also visited Universal Studios with her two young sons. 
  She experienced several meltdowns in 2007, including one where she shaved her head and another where she attacked a paparazzi's car with an umbrella. At the time, the then 25-year-old had just divorced her husband Kevin Federline. Her father, Jamie Spears, was appointed her conservator in 2008 and in control of her finances and several other important life decisions. She’s currently battling her father in court to oppose him remaining as the sole conservator of her affairs and to regain some autonomy. Fans have also started the FreeBritney movement to help her win back her freedom."

In 2012, Bobby Brown's ex-wife, Whitney Houston, was found dead after drowning in a Beverly Hills hotel room bathtub. Coroner’s officials said heart disease and cocaine were contributing factors. She was 48. In 2015, their daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, was found face-down in a bathtub at her suburban Atlanta home. She was in a coma for six months before dying at age 22 of causes investigators couldn't pinpoint. An autopsy showed that she had morphine, cocaine, alcohol and prescription drugs in her body.

The protest is in response to a recent increase in crimes against Asians in the country, including last week’s shooting in Atlanta. CBS Pittsburgh recorded a video of Oh speaking to the community. “I am so happy and proud to be here with you, and thank you to all the organisers for organising this just to give us an opportunity to be together and to stand together and to feel each other,” she said. Cheers from the crowd could be heard on the video as she continued, “For many of us in our community, this is the first time we are even able to voice our fear and our anger, and I really am so grateful to everyone willing to listen.” Oh has been vocal about her support for the movement on her social media platforms and has encouraged people to donate to organisations supporting the cause. The Canadian-born actress of Korean descent is now an American citizen. “I know that many of us in the community are very scared, and I understand that,” Oh said while pointing towards the crowd. “One way to get through our fear is to reach out to our communities.” She urged the crowd to support one another and yelled out a series of questions. “If you see something, would you help me?” she asked. A resounding “Yes!” echoed back. “If you see one of our sisters or brothers in need, would you help us?” The crowd cheered and unanimously said, “Yes!” 
  Her powerful speech ended with a chant of “I am proud to be Asian!” and “I belong here!”. Oh joins other celebrities who have spoken out against these hate crimes, including Daniel Dae Kim, Olivia Munn and Awkwafina.  On Sunday, Oh’s former Grey’s Anatomy co-star Ellen Pompeo shared Oh’s rally video on Twitter with the caption, “You belong here, love her”."

She also said that she’s planning to take a break from acting and to “focus on my own personal challenges so I hopefully can reach the paradigm shift I’m hoping for”. The post included a video of Sakinah’s interview with talk show host Aznil Nawawi on the Malaysian TV programme Hard To Heart, which aired that same night. In the clip, Sakinah could be seen crying and saying that she planned to leave the country. “I’m sorry, I need you to understand that my mental health is really bad right now, that’s why I’m planning not to stay in Malaysia – I’m moving,” she said. The 31-year-old, who is also a fitness influencer on social media, went into more detail in her caption about her state of mind. “My anxiety and depression has (sic) sometimes been so bad that I’ve been afraid of my own actions, or actions I might take if I didn’t pop my pills. I’ve been my own greatest danger...,” she wrote. The Aku Yang Kau Gelar Isteri actress said she was grateful for the people around her who have supported her and stopped her from doing something she would regret. 
  She added that she had prayed to God and that her fitness and workout had also helped her release a lot of stress.

Well, you and the Winter Soldier have something in common. In the premiere episode of Disney+’s The Falcon And The Winter Soldier that launched on Friday (Mar 19), Bucky Barnes – aka the Winter Soldier – could be seen drinking the Singapore-made beer in a pub scene. Several bottles of it, in fact. Barnes, played by actor Sebastian Stan, had three bottles of Tiger on the table in front of him at one point when he was at a Japanese bar while on a date. So, he really likes it then. There were close-up shots of him drinking the beer, which makes this likely a product placement. Even if confirmed to be so, it’s always nice to see a slice of Singapore turn up on international TV shows when you least expect it. 
  Interestingly, that’s not the only Singapore connection in the show. There have been hints that parts of the series will take place in the fictional country of Madripoor and it’s been suggested that Madripoor was inspired by Singapore. We do share similar-looking flags, with the former's being red and bearing a crescent moon, a star and a lion’s head. Stay tuned to see if the flag’s creator insists that he designed Madripoor’s flag three years earlier than Singapore's but lost all proof of that in a flood (wink). And in another Singapore connection – in real life, this time – Captain America’s iconic shield was projected onto the Singapore Flyer on Friday to celebrate the launch of the Disney+ series. We were one of several cities around the world where this happened, including Melbourne and London. The huge observation wheel transformed into the red, white and blue shield through the use of projection mapping. The Falcon And The Winter Soldier also stars Anthony Mackie and will run for six episodes."

Charles Polevich, 70, is accused of striking Robert Maraj, 64, on Long Island on Feb 12 and then driving off without calling 911. Maraj died at a hospital the next day. Polevich was arrested on Feb. 17 on charges of leaving the scene of an incident and tampering with physical evidence. He pleaded not guilty and was freed on bail and ordered not to leave New York state. Newsday reports that Carol Maraj's lawsuit, filed in Nassau County state Supreme Court earlier this month, claims that Polevich was negligent, reckless and careless when he hit Maraj with his car and allegedly left him at the scene. “He was not only irresponsible and negligent, but more concerned about running away and hiding than seeking help,” Benjamin Crump, one of the attorneys representing Carol Maraj, said in an Instagram post on Friday (Mar 19). A telephone message was left on Sunday with Polevich’s attorney, listed in online court records as Marc Gann of Mineola. Nicki Minaj, who was born Onika Tanya Maraj, has not made any public statement on her father's death.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/daniel-dae-kim-awkwafina-olivia-munn-celebs-asian-hate-crimes-1923071,"Daniel Dae Kim, Awkwafina among celebs speaking up against Asian-targeted hate crimes","Asian American celebrities have joined a chorus of voices of people who are speaking up against the increasing number of crimes against the Asian community in the United States. The sentiment is especially heightened after the recent shooting in Atlanta, where six out of the eight victims killed were Asian. In recent days, hashtags such as #StopAAPIHate and #StopAsianHate have been trending online. AAPI stands for Asian American Pacific Islanders. Actor Daniel Dae Kim, known for his roles in Hawaii Five-O and Lost, expressed his frustration on Twitter regarding the shooting. He wrote: “The race of the person committing the crime matters less than the simple fact that if you act with hate in your heart, you are part of the problem. And to those with the power to help and yet sit idly by, your silence is complicity. #StopAsianHate”. Kim has been outspoken in his advocacy and – together with actor Daniel Wu – has even offered rewards for information on crimes that have taken place in San Francisco in recent months, especially those targeting the elderly. 
  Actress Olivia Munn is another active advocate in the #StopAAPIHate and #StopAsianHate movement. Her Twitter feed has numerous posts regarding the issue and in response to the shooting, she wrote: “The violent attacks and murders against Asians are still happening. Please help us. We need help to be safe in our country. #StopAsianHate. Please”. Meanwhile, To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before star Lana Condor urged her Twitter followers to stand together and support Asian Americans. “Wake up... your Asian friends and family are deeply scared, horrified, sick to their stomachs and wildly angry,” she wrote. “Please please please check in on us, please please please stand with us. Please. Your Asian friend needs you, even if they aren’t publicly grieving on social media. X”  A visibly emotional Ashley Park posted a video almost six minutes long on Instagram to talk about the toll caused by the increasing violence against the community. The Emily in Paris star said in the video, ""The amount of times in my life that I've been asked where I'm from before what my name is …  I'm okay but you don't understand – or you do understand – the undervaluing that does"".  English actress Gemma Chan also condemned the hate crimes. The Crazy Rich Asians and The Eternals star wrote on Instagram: “We need to stop the dehumanization of Asians. We need to stop the scapegoating of Asians for COVID. We need to unite against all forms of hate. Please spread awareness, check in on your Asian friends because we are not ok.. educate yourself and others on the model minority myth and the long history of anti-Asian racism…Please don’t be silent”. Numerous Asian American celebrities have been trying to bring attention to the issue in recent months. Many were unhappy that attacks against the Asian American community hadn't been widely covered in the media.  In February, Raya And The Last Dragon star Awkwafina showed her support for organisations fighting for the cause. “I am saddened, disturbed and devastated at the recent string of attacks against the Asian American community, and against our elders,” the 32-year-old actress wrote in her Instagram caption. “So for the YEAR OF THE OX, I’m giving the proverbial red envelope (only numbers with 8s) to some organizations that have done amazing work for social and racial justice.”  Actor-comedian Ken Jeong also spoke in a video by Brave New Films that is part in the #StopAsianHate movement. “We must stop the xenophobia, we must stop the racism, we must stop the hate,” the judge of The Masked Singer said.  And it’s not just those in the entertainment industry who are expressing support. NBA player Jeremy Lin also shared an encouraging message on his Twitter account: “To my Asian American family, please take time to grieve but know you're loved, seen and IMPORTANT. We have to keep standing up, speaking out, rallying together and fighting for change. We cannot lose hope!!"" "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/marvel-falcon-winter-soldier-disney-plus-268701,"Marvel's Falcon And The Winter Soldier promises action, explores race, patriotism","When Steve Rogers handed Sam Wilson his Captain America shield at the end of Marvel's massive 2019 event Avengers: Endgame, Wilson tried it on for a beat. “How does it feel?"" the wrinkled Rogers asked. “Like it's someone else's,” Wilson responded. That reluctance and scepticism is front-and-centre as Wilson's story continues in The Falcon And The Winter Solder, a new six-episode Disney+ series that promises an exploration of patriotism and race alongside its shootouts and soaring chase scenes. The series launches on Friday (Mar 19).  While Endgame appeared to promise a quick transition for Anthony Mackie's Falcon to take up the Captain America mantle, as he has in the comics, the creator of Falcon promises only complications. Malcolm Spellman said the series will explore “the conflict for a black man confronting those stars and stripes"". He said the Wilson/Falcon character is set to “emerge from this story as a hero of the times and a hero of the people today. And that journey of whether it’s even appropriate to deal with the symbol, the Stars and Stripes, to me, felt super, super relevant and timely"". So will there be a black Captain America by the time the final credits roll in April? Mackie, steeped in Marvel's renowned secret-keeping after playing Falcon since 2014's Captain America: The Winter Soldier, will only say this: ""I’m very happy with the end of Falcon, and I feel like I have one of the most unique, coolest characters in all of comic book movies”. Unlike the mostly insular WandaVision, the first Marvel series launched after Endgame, Falcon promises a larger scope of globe-trotting adventure with implications for multiple characters in upcoming series and films. Spellman drew inspiration from race-conscious “buddy two-handers” like Lethal Weapon, 48 Hours and The Defiant Ones, highlighting the warm chemistry between Mackie and Sebastian Stan, who joined Marvel movies as Bucky Barnes in 2011's Captain America: The First Avenger. In comics, Barnes has also taken up Cap's shield, lending an inherent tension to the series titular pairing. Stan says Falcon allowed the two actors to find new shadings to their roles, even after so many film appearances, by “honouring the things that we have understood about them so far in the movies and then also staying open to taking them down a new path and finding the middle ground between those things. Of course, the more time you have, the more interesting they can get”. Spellman, who was a producer and writer on the hit series Empire, says he's looking to deal with potentially hot-button subjects honestly without alienating the audience. The story, featuring the return of Daniel Bruhl as Zemo and Emily VanCamp as Sharon Carter, also introduces a character named John Walker, played by Wyatt Russell. In the comics, Walker becomes US Agent, a sometime antagonist to Captain America who twists American patriotism to darker ends. Mackie teases a plot that's “very timely and very important”. And Spellman says he's looking to upend expectations. “I’ll just promise everyone this: What you think is happening after Endgame is not what’s happening in this series,"" he said. (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/korean-drama-vincenzo-angers-viewers-bibimbap-chinese-brand-1923086,K-drama Vincenzo angers Korean netizens by using Chinese brand of bibimbap in show,"Korean actors in a Korean drama eating a popular Korean dish made by a Chinese manufacturer – what could go wrong?  Korean viewers watched on episode eight of the TV drama Vincenzo as lead actors Song Joong-ki (who plays the titular character) and Jeon Yeo-been tucked into bowls of instant bibimbap made by Chinese brand Zihaiguo. There was even a close-up of the product. The obvious product placement on the episode that aired on Sunday (Mar 14) angered netizens who went online to air their displeasure at broadcaster tvN for using a Chinese brand for the Korean dish.   One person wrote, “How can the production company accept a Chinese bibimbap product when bibimbap is Korean? Are they crazy?"" Another person was concerned that international audiences – Vincenzo also airs on streaming service Netflix – will mistake bibimbap for a Chinese dish.  The viewer commented, ""If the network just sells placement to Chinese companies for quick money, wouldn't (foreign) people who watch this series think bibimbap's Chinese food? This is a serious issue … I know money is important but this is taking it too far"". There were viewers who tried to be the voice of reason by saying that the network needed to cover the 20 billion won (S$23.8 million) budget of the show. According to entertainment portal AllKPop, the instant bibimbap depicted in the show was created in collaboration with popular Korean food company, Chungjungone, and the company’s logo is on the pack. But that didn't seem to matter to the outraged viewers. This isn’t the first time the two countries are clashing over food, though – China’s Global Times recently claimed that kimchi is a variation of paocai, a pickled vegetable dish."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/elliot-page-interview-cover-time-magazine-transgender-issues-1923091,Actor Elliot Page opens up about struggles in 1st interview after coming out as transgender,"Actor Elliot Page is the first transgender man to appear on the cover of Time magazine. Page, formerly Ellen Page, came out as transgender in December and uses the he/they pronoun. In his first interview since then, Page has opened up about his journey and struggles to embrace his true self especially in the media’s spotlight. On the cover, Page is seen with short hair and wearing jeans and a black sweater, with the quote: “I’m fully who I am”. 
   A post shared by @elliotpage He shared a photo of the cover on his Instagram page on Tuesday (Mar 16), with the caption: “With deep respect for those who came before me, gratitude for those who have supported me and great concern for the generation of trans youth we must all protect, please join me and decry anti-trans legislation, hate and discrimination in all its forms.”. He said that was inspired by iconic trans figures in the industry like Janet Mock and Laverne Cox, who found success in their careers and stayed true to themselves at the same time. Actress Cox was the first trans woman to appear on the cover of Time magazine in 2014. Page told Time that he felt like a boy growing up. ""I wanted to be a boy. I would ask my mom if I could be someday."" He came out as gay in 2014 but his struggle with his personal gender identity never left. “The difference in how I felt before coming out as gay to after was massive,” said Page. “But did the discomfort in my body ever go away? No, no, no, no.” The 34-year-old star of such shows as The Umbrella Academy, Inception and Juno also spoke about how the endless primping for red carpets and magazines became a painful reminder of the disconnect between how the world saw him and how he saw himself. ""I just never recognised myself,"" Page said. ""For a long time I could not even look at a photo of myself."" 
  The pandemic in 2020 gave Page time to focus on himself. After much struggling, “I was finally able to embrace being transgender and letting myself fully become who I am”. He’s now looking forward to his future as an actor. “I’m really excited to act, now that I’m fully who I am, in this body. No matter the challenges and difficult moments of this, nothing amounts to getting to feel how I feel now.”"

The 28-year-old Kimchi Untuk Awak star shared a photo of her domestic helper on Instagram on Monday (Mar 15) with her 5 million followers, along with a lengthy caption explaining what happened. She asked her followers to let her know if anyone has seen her maid. Emma went on to say that the intention of her post wasn’t to embarrass anyone but to urge everyone to be careful and not too trusting of their domestic helper, even someone who has worked for them for a long time. “They may be pretending to be good in front of you,” she wrote. She shared that her maid suddenly left the house with the access card and two big garbage bags, saying that she was going to throw the trash away. She even left Emma’s baby in the living room.

The actress, whose real name is Fatima Rohani Ismail, and her husband have a four-month-old son named Shariq Gabriel. Commenters expressed shock at the incident, but many were also thankful that nothing happened to Emma’s baby."

Singapore-based Clover Films announced the tie-up on Monday (Mar 15). In a statement, the company said: “This collaboration between Clover Films and iQiyi seeks to merge talents between the two countries and create stories told by Singaporean filmmakers that cater to the wider Chinese language audience across Asia”. Clover Films will distribute the four Mandarin-language movies internationally while iQiyi will distribute them in China. The films will be shot over two years and will comprise a comedy, a drama, a romance and a horror-thriller. Up first will be the comedy Reunion Dinner, written and directed by Ong. According to Screen Daily, it’s about a couple who encounter a series of mishaps with their eccentric parents while planning their wedding. Ong’s most recent film was the comedy Number 1, which starred Mark Lee in a performance that earned him a Golden Horse Award nomination last year. The second project is a horror-thriller by Tong, who's best known for The Maid and The Faith Of Anna Waters. Mak will helm the romance drama, while Tay will turn in a medical drama.   Tay has been working in China recently, starring in series such as The Condor Heroes and Handsome Siblings. He’s also starring in The Ferryman, together with Qi Yuwu and Lawrence Wong, which will debut on iQiyi later this year. 
  Screen Daily reported that Clover will be working on the creative aspects with the filmmakers while the iQiyi team in Beijing will work on the story, casting, packaging and marketing. Said Lim Teck, Clover Films' managing director: “We are excited to be partnering with iQiyi on this excellent slate of movies by four sterling Singapore filmmakers. We have always believed in our local talent pool and are glad that our partners at iQiyi are as invested as we are in promoting Singaporean talent. We aim to produce movies that would connect to audiences in the China and Southeast Asian markets and this requires great support from iQiyi and our four directors.”"

Joanne, who is 36, told U-Weekly magazine in a recent interview that Yuwu was resistant to the idea of them acting together after they got married. Yuwu has his reasons, though, as he explained to Shin Min Daily News. The 44-year-old told the paper that he doesn’t want them acting together to be used for gossip. He said: “Although I am used to it after so many years, I still have concerns. I don’t want couples who film together to become a selling point and used for gossip. It feels a bit weird”. He added that he also doesn’t want the audience to think that he’s just transferring his real life to the big screen, nor does he want to act with Joanne in irrelevant plots for the sake of working together. However, he added, he’s not as closed off to the idea as he was in the beginning. “If we were to act together, both of us must feel that it is a great opportunity. The script and characters have to be very good.” The couple last starred together in the Mediacorp Channel 8 series CLIF 3 in 2014, which is also the year they got married. They have two children – a son and a daughter."

With the pandemic prompting Hollywood to hold back most of its major motion pictures in 2020, pulling big stars from the competition, newbies became the norm in the four acting categories. First-timers include Amanda Seyfried for Mank, Andra Day for The United States Vs Billie Holiday and Paul Raci for Sound Of Metal. The best director category has even fresher faces, with only one repeat nominee, David Fincher, among the five up for the coveted Oscar.  10:  Nominations for Mank, the most of any film this year, with nods for best picture, best director for Fincher, best actor for Gary Oldman and best supporting actress for Seyfried.  9: Actors of colour nominated, a record. They include Steven Yeun, whose nod for Minari makes him the first Asian American to be nominated for best actor, and Riz Ahmed, who became the first person of Pakistani descent to be nominated in an acting category with his own best actor nod for Sound Of Metal. 8: Career nominations for Glenn Close, who is up for best supporting actress this year for Hillbilly Elegy. Her first was for The World According To Garp in 1983. She has never won an Oscar.  7: Actors who have been nominated for Oscars after their deaths, now that Chadwick Boseman has received a posthumous nomination for best actor for Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. The tragic honour puts him in elite company that includes James Dean, Spencer Tracy, Massimo Troisi and Peter Finch, who became the only man to win best actor posthumously, for Network in 1977. In the best supporting actor category, Heath Ledger and Ralph Richardson were nominated, with Ledger winning for The Dark Knight in 2009. Boseman died in August after a long and largely secret battle with colon cancer.  6: Black actors nominated, Boseman, Day, Viola Davis, Daniel Kaluuya, Leslie Odom Jr and LaKeith Stanfield, after only one, Cynthia Erivo, was nominated last year.  5: African nations that have received nominations for best international feature, now that Tunisia has its first nominee, The Man Who Sold His Skin. Those five nations have combined for 10 nominated films. Along with Tunisia's one, Algeria has had five, South Africa has had two, and Ivory Coast and Mauritania have had one apiece. 4: Nominations received by Nomadland director Chloe Zhao, a record for a woman in a record year for women. An unprecedented 70 women received 76 nominations, led by Zhao, who was nominated for director, adapted screenplay, editing, and best picture as a producer. That tops Sofia Coppola and Fran Walsh, who each got three nominations in 2003. Zhao, who is also the first woman of colour to be nominated for best director, is joined by Promising Young Woman director Emerald Fennel in the category, making it the first time two women have been nominated.  
  3: Career nominations for Sacha Baron Cohen, thanks to Abbie Hoffman and Borat. Baron Cohen is nominated for best supporting actor for playing Hoffman in The Trial Of The Chicago 7. And just as he was for the first Borat film in 2007, he is nominated for best adapted screenplay this year for Borat Subsequent Moviefilm. 2: Career nominations for Olivia Colman, whose nod for The Father follows 2019's for The Favourite. She is one-for-one after winning best actress, and is nominated for best supporting actress this year.  1: Man nominated for both best actor and best original song. Odom, who came to fame singing and acting in Hamilton, has become the first man nominated for both in the same year for One Night In Miami, in which he plays singer Sam Cooke. Three women have done it, all very recently: Mary J Blige for Mudbound in 2018, Lady Gaga for A Star Is Born in 2019, and Cynthia Erivo for Harriet in 2020. Barbra Streisand was the first to be nominated for both, but for different films in different years.  0: Nominations for director Spike Lee or actor Delroy Lindo, whose Da 5 Bloods was among Monday's biggest snubs. The film received just one nomination, for best score.  (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/mank-chloe-zhao-minari-oscar-nomination-diversity-1923111,"Diverse slate of Oscar nominees includes women filmmakers, actors of Asian descent","After a pandemic year that shuttered movie theatres and upended the movie business, Academy Awards nominations on Monday (Mar 15) went to two female filmmakers for the first time, to a historically diverse slate of actors and to David Fincher's lead-nominee Mank, a traditional kind of Oscar contender – an old Hollywood homage – in very untraditional year. Fincher's Mank, a black-and-white, period drama about Citizen Kane screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz, easily topped nominations for the 93rd Academy Awards – delayed two months by the coronavirus pandemic – with 10 nominations, including best picture, best director, acting nods for Gary Oldman and Amanda Seyfried, and a host of others for its lavish craft.  Nominations were spread among a wide variety of contenders. Six films, all of them also up for best picture, score six nods: Judas And The Black Messiah, Nomadland, Minari, Sound Of Metal, The Trial Of The Chicago 7 and The Father. Also nominated for best picture was Emerald Fennell's Promising Young Woman. History was made in the best director category. Only five women have ever been nominated before. For the first time, two were this year. Chloe Zhao got a nod for her elegiac road-trip drama Nomadland alongside first-time feature filmmaker Fennell for her pitch black #MeToo revenge comedy. ""Never going to stop crying,"" Fennell, also nominated for best screenplay, said on Twitter. Zhao, the first woman of colour nominated for best director, is the most nominated woman in a single year in Oscar history. She was also tipped for the film's adapted screenplay, editing and as a producer in the best picture category. The other directing nominees were Lee Isaac Chung for the tender family drama Minari, Fincher for Mank and Thomas Vinterberg for his heavy-drinking Danish tragicomedy Another Round. For performers, it's the most diverse group of nominees ever – and a far cry from the all-white acting nods that spawned the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag five years ago. Nine of the 20 acting nominees are people of colour, including a posthumous best-actor nomination  for Chadwick Boseman (Ma Rainey's Black Bottom), as well as nods for Riz Ahmed (Sound Of Metal), Steven Yeun (Minari), Viola Davis (Ma Rainey's Black Bottom) and Andra Day (The People Vs Billie Holiday) and supporting nominations for Daniel Kaluuya and Lakeith Stanfield (Judas And The Black Messiah), Leslie Odom Jr (One Night In Miami) and Youn Yuh-Jung (Minari). ""We have to recognise how hard these people have worked,"" said Day, nominated for her performance as Billie Holiday. ""We have to recognise their talent."" ""When you hear your own name it's a weird feeling,"" said Ahmed, the first Muslim nominated for best actor. ""I just quietly gave thanks and felt some gratitude."" He is of Pakistani descent.  Davis, who won for her performance in 2016's Fences, landed her fourth Oscar nomination, making her the most nominated black actress ever. Yeun is the first Asian American ever nominated for best actor. Judas And The Black Messiah, Shaka King's powerful Black Panther drama, is the first best-picture nominee with an all-black producing team (King along with Ryan Coogler and Charles D King). Overall, a record 70 women were nominated for 76 Oscars, the academy said. The other nominees for best actress are: Carey Mulligan (Promising Young Woman); Frances McDormand (Nomadland); Vanessa Kirby (Pieces Of A Woman). The remaining nominee for best actor is Anthony Hopkins for the dementia drama The Father. With moviegoing nearly snuffed out by the coronavirus, the best-picture nominees had hardly any box office to speak of: US$14.1 million in US and Canada ticket sales. For the first time, Hollywood's biggest and most sough-after awards belong to movies that were almost entirely seen at home. ""We learned a lot of hard lessons last year, but a nice one was that people will find a way to go to the movies, even if they can only go as far as their living rooms,"" said Aaron Sorkin, writer-director of The Trial Of The Chicago 7, in a statement. Netflix, as expected, led all studios with 35 nominations. The streaming service is still hunting its first best-picture winner, and this year has two shots in Mank and The Trial Of The Chicago 7 – a movie Paramount Pictures sold off during the pandemic. Netflix led last year, too, with 24 nominations, but came away with just two wins.  Other streamers were in the mix. Amazon Studios, in particular, was well represented with Sound Of Metal, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm and One Night In Miami – leading to 12 nominations overall. Both Apple TV+ (Wolfwalkers, Greyhound) and Disney+ (Soul, Onward) landed their first nominations. The film that tried to lead a box-office revival – Christopher Nolan's Tenet – walked away with nominations for production design and visual effects.  The nominations were announced from London by presenters Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra Jonas. The Academy Awards would typically have happened by now but this year will be telecast Apr 25. The film academy said Monday that the show will be held at both its usual home, the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, and the city's railway hub, Union Station. This year's awards season – typically a monthslong circuit of screenings, cocktail parties and schmoozing – has been entirely virtual, taking much of the buzz and predictability out of the Oscars. Eligibility was extended to early 2021 releases and to movies that bypassed theatres.  ""In our industry there is nothing more traditional than the Academy Awards, which hopefully sends a sign of hope that we will get out of this,"" said Oldman in a statement. ""The Oscars are such a sign that normalcy still exists."" Among the films that had hoped for a better result Monday was Spike Lee's Da 5 Bloods – which was nominated only for its score. Just eight out of a possible 10 movies were nominated for best picture, leaving out Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, Regina King's One Night In Miami and Golden Globe winner Borat Subsequent Moviefilm. Despite the best-picture snub for Borat, Sacha Baron Cohen, who created the title character, was still a nominee for his supporting role as activist Abbie Hoffman in The Trial Of The Chicago 7, and Borat star Maria Bakalova was nominated for best supporting actress. Also nominated in the category: Glenn Close for Hillbilly Elegy and Olivia Colman for The Father. 
  The most competitive category might have been documentary, where Collective, Crip Camp: A Disability Revolution, The Mole Agent, My Octopus Teacher and Time ultimately landed nominations. Collective, the Romanian documentary about investigative journalism and government corruption, became just the second film nominated for both best documentary and best international film. The other international film nominees were Quo Vadis, Aida?, Bosnia and Herzegovina; Another Round, Denmark; Better Days, Hong Kong; and The Man Who Sold His Skin, Tunisia. The nominees for best animated feature: Onward; Over The Moon; A Shaun The Sheep Movie: Farmageddon; Soul; Wolfwalkers.  The film academy and ABC will hope that the nominees can drum up more excitement than they have elsewhere. Interest in little golden statuettes has nosedived during the pandemic. Ratings for a largely virtual Golden Globes plunged to 6.9 million viewers – a 64 per cent drop from 2020 – last month. Though on Sunday the Grammys managed to break through the Zoom trap. With the notable exception of fuelling streaming subscriber growth, the pandemic has been punishing for the movie industry. Production slowed to a crawl, blockbusters were postponed or detoured to streaming and thousands have been laid off or furloughed. But the outlook for Hollywood has recently brightened as coronavirus cases have slid and vaccines have ramped up. Movie theatres are reopening in the US's two largest markets, New York and Los Angeles. And several larger movies – including the Walt Disney Co's Black Widow (May 7) – are scheduled for May and beyond. (Source: AP)"

She will star alongside other big names such as Tyler Perry, Dax Shepard and Jimmy Kimmel. They will join the recurring characters of the show, which is about a group of search and rescue dogs that protect the community. “We had such a great time working on this movie. My kids can barely believe it when I said I was going to be in it,” Kardashian said during the show, referring to North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm. They are her kids with estranged husband, Kanye West.  The new animated movie directed by Cal Brunker is set to debut in August 2021.

Megan Thee Stallion, who won three honours, also made history and became the first female rapper to win best rap song. She's also the fifth rap-based act to win best new artist. Beyonce was the night’s top contender with nine nominations. She didn't perform but Swift did. She sang Cardigan and August from Folklore, as well as Willow from Evermore, and was joined by the collaborators who helped her make the albums, Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner, who both won album of the year with Swift. Silk Sonic, aka Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak, also performed, bringing a throwback R&B vibe to the show with their smooth new single, Leave The Door Open. Dua Lipa, who won best pop vocal album, proved her pop star status with a performance of her hits Don’t Start Now and Levitating, where she was joined by the DaBaby, who was an all-star during his own performance of his guitar-tinged rap hit Rockstar, flipping the song for an exceptional live rendition featuring R&B singer Anthony Hamilton, a skilled violinist and background singers.  And country singer Mickey Guyton – the first black female nominated for best country solo performance – gave an impressive performance of her song Black Like Me. Black Parade joined a list of songs honouring the black experience that won on Sunday, including HER's protest anthem I Can't Breathe and Anderson Paak's Lockdown, which was released on Juneteenth like Black Parade. Other performers included Billie Eilish, Cardi B, Bad Bunny, Miranda Lambert, Maren Morris and Harry Styles, who won best pop solo performance for the hit Watermelon Sugar. “To everyone who made this record with me, thank you so much,” said Styles, the first member of One Direction to win a Grammy. Host Trevor Noah kicked off the show telling jokes about the coronavirus pandemic and the year that was 2020. He was live from downtown Los Angeles, with attendees wearing masks and sitting, socially distanced, at small round tables. Double winners include HER, Fiona Apple, Kaytranada and late performers John Prine and Chick Corea. (Source: AP)"

This year, the bumper list consists of 60 names – 30 men and 30 women. Missing from that list, though, is Thomas Ong. He last won in the category in 2018. On Mar 11, he took to Instagram to explain why he wasn't nominated. The 52-year-old said in his post that some friends had privately message him to ask why he wasn’t nominated. He went on to explain that he was on the list, but had asked to withdraw his name. Thomas wrote: “Last week, the production team did call me to let me know that I made it into the Top 30, or something like that. But this year, I wish to watch the competition quietly as an ordinary audience member, so I withdrew from the competition. Thank you for your generosity and love. Here’s wishing that the Star Awards will be a success, (and that) my former colleagues will be happy and receive their awards well, and that us audience members will have a great time watching (the ceremony)”. He added: ""As for me… I’ll continue to eat and eat”. 
   A post shared by Toto Ong (@thomasong17) Several local artistes showed their support for Thomas’ note, with Terence Cao, Joey Swee and Zhu Houren commenting on the post. Thomas was contacted by a local reporter regarding his post but he declined to be interviewed, saying that he had retired from showbusiness. He first mentioned in 2018 that he would be retiring from acting, but returned in 2020 for another series called Super Dad. However, he told 8 DAYS in early 2020 that Super Dad would be his last show as he had found something else he enjoyed doing and he would like to move on. "

The singer, who just released her solo album R on Friday (Mar 12), appeared on Korean variety show My Ugly Duckling on Sunday where she dished on that, as well as other aspects of her solo work. Rose shared that she always has to eat rice in order to have enough energy to perform an entire concert. She said, “I always need to eat a traditional Korean meal that includes rice before I go onstage. It’s really strange, but if I don’t eat rice, I won’t be able to make it until the end of the concert. My arms will get all limp like seaweed”. When asked by the host if other cuisines worked, Rose replied that they don't. “I’ve tried other things, like eating bread. Nothing else worked”. Rose also shared that despite having to deal with some cons while promoting her solo album – namely, not having her Blackpink friends to rely on – there are some pros, too. “Now that I’m getting ready on my own, it takes less time to get ready. So I can wake up a little later,” she said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/minari-actress-youn-yuh-jung-south-korea-1975391,Minari actress Youn Yuh-jung nonchalant about new fame outside South Korea,"When Youn Yuh-jung was asked how she felt about being called the ""Meryl Streep of South Korea"" in a recent interview, she said she's flattered by the comparison. But she had her own introduction.  ""I am just a Korean actress in Korea,"" the 73-year-old actress said. ""My name is Yuh-jung Youn. So I like to be myself."" Youn needs no introduction in South Korea, with a film career spanning over five decades. But she's just being discovered by audiences outside the country through Minari, a semi-autobiographical film based on the childhood of Korean-American director Lee Isaac Chung about a family moving to rural Arkansas to start a small farm.  Youn plays Soonja, who moves from Korea to join her daughter and step-son and develops a tender yet comical relationship with her grandson David (Alan Kim), the only member in the family born in the United States. The film wowed at Sundance and has been a top contender during Hollywood's awards season, winning best foreign language film at the Golden Globes and scooping up six nominations at the British Film Academy Awards. When Oscar nominees are announced on Monday (Mar 15), Youn is likely to be included in the supporting actress category. She's said she hasn't given much thought about scoring an award, saying it ""would be something I can't and won't imagine, so I don't know... For me, an award means getting next work"".  Born in 1947, she shot to fame in South Korea with her 1971 debut Fire Woman. While at the peak of her career, she married popular singer Cho Young-nam, who convinced her to move to the US together so he could perform at pastor Billy Graham's church.  Youn said she was offered a role in a Christian film and stayed with a director in Florida for eight months to try to learn English. It didn't work out.  ""The project disappeared because I couldn't speak English,"" she said, laughing.  Youn lived in the US for nearly a decade, not performing, before returning to South Korea, where she split from Cho and returned to acting.  She said the US was considered a ""dream land"" by Asian American immigrants in the 1970s and '80s, when Minari is set. But she said it's difficult for her to ""fully understand"" and identify with their struggles including dealing with identity crises and anti-Asian racism.  
  ""Second-generation Asian Americans think they are Americans but in the eyes of Americans, they don't look American,"" Youn said. ""There must be a dilemma like that.""  Youn said she was impressed by the ""realistic and genuine"" script from Chung, who gave her the freedom to tweak her character and dialogue, including an impromptu scene where Soonja steals a US$100 donation made by her daughter from a church's honorarium plate.  Youn said when she suggested the scene, Chung was slightly hesitant because he's a ""very devout Christian"", but ended up filming it: ""I really appreciated Isaac for accepting all of my suggestions"".

Leung said she started seeing racist messages from fans online after she was cast in Harry Potter And The Goblets Of Fire, which ran in 2005. She said: “I was Googling myself at one point, and I was on this website, which was kind of dedicated to the Harry Potter fandom. I remember reading all the comments. And, yeah, it was a lot of racist shit”. However, she was told by publicists to deny that these attacks were taking place. On top of that, Leung, who was 16 at the time, was not given media training before doing interviews. “I remember them saying to me, ‘Oh, look Katie, we haven’t seen these, these websites that people are talking about. And you know, if you get asked that, just say it’s not true. Say it’s not happening’”. The actress, who is now 33, said: “And I just nodded my head. I was like, ‘Okay, okay,’ even though I had seen it myself with my own eyes. I was like, ‘Okay, yeah, I’ll just say everything’s great’”. Leung added that she was “grateful” for being in the position she was in but “I keep saying, ‘Oh I wish I’d maybe said something’. But you can’t do that”. She was in five Harry Potter films, namely, Goblet Of Fire, Order Of The Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and 2."

The 38-year-old fell into a drain because she was briefly distracted by her phone – and ended up in the hospital with a gory-looking injury on her leg. She shared news of the accident – along with several photos, including one of the horrific wound – on Instagram on Wednesday (Mar 10). Another image showed blood on the ground. Word of warning: Don't swipe right to view the photo if you're queasy.

In another post, she explained that she needed surgery as the wound needed three layers of stitches because it was so deep, you could see the bone. “Additionally, there’s a chunk of dead flesh inside as well, and it’s a diagonal cut, so it’s more complicated,” Kate added. As if that doesn't sound bad enough, the whole incident happened around her birthday. She fell into the drain the day before she turned 38 and spent her actual birthday on Mar 11 in the hospital. Another bummer: Kate’s husband Andie Chen is not in the country. The actor is currently in Taiwan for work, together with the couple's six-year-old son. Andie wrote on Instagram: “My wife’s injured, but I’m not there. Many people asked if I was worried. Actually, my heart hurts a little (for her), but I’m not worried. My wife usually treats people very well, and she has loads of friends who love her. To our family and friends, thank you for caring for this woman. It’s really a relief that you guys are here”. Kate has since been discharged from the hospital and to mark the occasion, the kind staff gave her a birthday cake and a bouquet of fruits and flowers."

For one thing, there were animated videos posted on the account that veered from the normal BTS-related content and the account was also renamed “team alpha”. Another clue that something was amiss was the fact that the group was suddenly following two other users, when they didn’t follow anyone before. One was o2m and the other was 3mk_mosab, both of which appeared to be bots. The compromised account was secured fairly quickly and things look back to normal with the rogue videos removed. However, concerned fans had already taken to social media to share news of the breach, as well as clips of what the hackers posted. Many of them also urged the group’s label, Big Hit Entertainment, to investigate what happened and to take legal action if needed as they felt this was a violation of the group’s privacy. A user tweeted: “this is really scary and creepy please please take it down and it’s also a serious violation of their privacy”. Another wrote: “Excuse me, @BigHitEnt. It has been brought to my attention that the BTS official TikTok account was hacked. Please go forward in solving the problem and taking legal action, thank you”.

The couple separated in August of 2019, and Adele filed for divorce the following month. A Los Angeles judge finalised the divorce last week. According to the documents, the 32-year-old Adele and the 46-year-old Konecki used mediation to amicably reach the terms of the split. Both waived the right to seek spousal support, and both agreed to joint legal and physical custody of son Angelo, who was born in 2012. The papers say they will seek to resolve any issues without litigation. Adele kept her original legal name, Adele Adkins, during her marriage. The British singing superstar married Konecki, co-founder of Life Water, an eco-friendly brand of bottled water, in May of 2018, according to court documents.

She added, ""Lose You To Love Me I felt was the best song I've ever released, and for some people it still wasn't enough.

She told Vogue that she wants to spend more time producing and to give herself “a real shot at acting”. “I haven’t even touched the surface of what I want to do. The parts that I want are the ones I need help with. I can’t wait for the moment when a director can see that I’m capable of doing something that no one’s ever seen,” she said."

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/piers-morgan-quits-good-morning-britain-comments-about-meghan-319096,Complaints over Meghan comments: UK TV host Piers Morgan quits morning show,"British television host Piers Morgan on Tuesday (Mar 9)  quit the Good Morning Britain programme after making contentious comments about Meghan following her bombshell interview about the royal family. The UK’s media watchdog said earlier Tuesday that it was launching an investigation into the show under its harm and offense rules after receiving more than 41,000 complaints over Morgan’s comments about the Duchess of Sussex. Morgan's departure was announced shortly after Buckingham Palace issued a statement saying allegations of racism made by Prince Harry and Meghan during an interview with Oprah Winfrey were “concerning."" In the interview, which aired in the US on Sunday night and then in the UK on Monday evening, Meghan spoke about how she “didn’t want to be alive anymore” as she struggled to fit in with the monarchy. She also alleged that she faced racist attitudes from Buckingham Palace and British media, and that her requests for help with her mental health were rejected. Morgan, 55, said on Monday on Good Morning Britain during a discussion about Meghan's revelations that ""I’m sorry, I don’t believe a word she says. “I wouldn’t believe her if she read me a weather report,"" he said, adding the duchess had sparked an “onslaught” against the royal family. That drew criticism from many, including the mental health charity Mind, which said it was disappointed and concerned by Morgan’s comments on not believing Meghan’s experiences about having suicidal thoughts. “It’s vital that when people reach out for support or share their experiences of ill mental health that they are treated with dignity, respect and empathy,"" the charity said. 
  In Tuesday's episode, Morgan addressed his own comments the day before, stressing that he believed mental illness and suicide are topics that should be “taken extremely seriously.” But he maintained he had “serious concerns about the veracity of a lot of what (Meghan) said”. He then stormed off the set of the program as weather presenter Alex Beresford was criticising his attitude toward Meghan. As Morgan walked away, he said “I'm done”. ITV, which produces Good Morning Britain, said Tuesday: “Following discussions with ITV, Piers Morgan has decided now is the time to leave Good Morning Britain. ITV has accepted this decision and has nothing further to add”. Morgan was a former judge on America's Got Talent, and in 2011 he replaced Larry King's primetime slot on CNN with his own talk show, which was cancelled in 2014 after poor ratings. A former tabloid newspaper editor, he joined Good Morning Britain in 2015."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/why-harry-meghan-son-archie-not-a-prince-explainer-319286,Why is Harry and Meghan's son Archie not a prince? Here's an explainer,"One of the most dramatic claims in Prince Harry and Meghan's interview with Oprah Winfrey was the allegation that their son was denied a royal title, possibly because of his skin colour. Harry and Meghan’s son, seventh in line to the British throne, is Archie Mountbatten-Windsor. In contrast, the children of Harry’s older brother, Prince William, are Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. Meghan said that while she was pregnant “they” – presumably the palace – “were saying they didn’t want him to be a prince … which would be different from protocol”. She implied it might be a case of “the first member of colour in this family not being titled in the same way that other grandchildren would be”. WAS ARCHIE SNUBBED? Queen Elizabeth II has nine great-grandchildren, including Archie. They are not princes and princesses, apart from the three children of Prince William, who is second in line to the throne and destined to be king one day. A decree issued by King George V in 1917 limits the titles of prince and princess to the children of the monarch, children of the monarch’s sons and “the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales” – that’s William’s son Prince George. Bob Morris from the Constitution Unit at University College London, said the rule was drawn up to trim the increasingly unwieldy number of princely titles. “Queen Victoria had nine children who were all princes and princesses, and then they had children and so forth, and George V took the view ... that something needed to be done to tidy up the situation,” he said. The queen has the power to amend the rules, and in 2012 she decreed that all the children of Prince William and his wife, Catherine, not just the eldest, would be princes and princesses. Under the George V convention, Archie is not a prince, but will become one as the grandchild of a monarch once current heir to the throne Prince Charles is king. In her interview, Meghan said she was told that “they want to change the convention for Archie”. It is unclear what she was referring to, but Morris said Prince Charles has let it be known “that he favours a smaller royal family"" when he takes the throne. Archie was eligible for a ""courtesy title"" at birth, such as Lord Archie Mountbatten-Windsor. At the time, it was reported that Harry and Meghan had chosen not to give him a title. But Meghan told Winfrey that “it was not our decision to make”. 
  DOES THE TITLE AFFECT ARCHIE’S SECURITY? Meghan expressed concern that without a title, Archie “wasn’t going to receive security”. But a royal title such as prince or princess does not automatically bring security protection. Full-time working royals – including Meghan and Harry before they moved to North America last year – receive taxpayer-funded police bodyguards. Senior royals who have jobs outside the family, such as Prince Andrew’s daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, do not. 
  WHAT DOES THE PALACE SAY? Buckingham Palace has not responded to specific allegations in the interview. In a statement, it said “the issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning. While some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately”. (Source: AP) "

This was reported by TVB Entertainment News. His son carried his memorial portrait and Ng’s second wife was also in attendance. A private service was held earlier in the day for family and friends at Hung Hom Universal Funeral. The actor’s ashes will be brought back to Malaysia, where he was living for many years with his wife and children, according to his wishes. His younger brother was quoted by China Times as saying that the actor “wanted his ashes to be placed at Malaysia so that he can accompany his wife and children”. A memorial service was held a day earlier at the Universal Funeral Parlour where high-profile guests such as Stephen Chow, Andy Lau and Sandra Ng came to pay their respects. Chow and Lau declined to speak to the press but Ng shared a memory with the journalists about a collaboration where she and the late Ng had played father and daughter. She said, “I’ve been thinking of Man-tat every day for the past 10 days. I’m so sad. It was so sudden. I never expected it to be so fast”. Ng died on Feb 27 in hospital, surrounded by his family. He was diagnosed with cancer last year and had been undergoing treatment in Macau. He was best known for his roles in movies with comedian Stephen Chow, including The Final Combat, The Justice of Life and Shaolin Soccer. A new movie, The Legend of Shaolin Temple, was released earlier this year."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/oprah-winfrey-interview-prince-harry-meghan-316521,"Oprah’s deft royal interview with Prince Harry, Meghan shows why she’s still the queen","There were royal victims and villains in Harry and Meghan’s tell-all – or tell enough – interview with Oprah Winfrey that aired in the US on Sunday (Mar 7) night. But there was only one immediate and clear winner: The American media queen. While the couple drew both strong support and rebukes for detailing why they fled Britain and their royal roles, Winfrey burnished her stature as a master interviewer with Sunday’s special that rivalled The Crown for drama and heartache. She was in her element, breaking news and making entertainment. In past big “gets”, Winfrey had grilled Lance Armstrong about doping, Whitney Houston about her troubled life and Michael Jackson on whether he'd lightened his skin to deny his blackness. In those encounters, Winfrey played prosecutor or mother confessor. This time, she asked the couple holding hands in a manicured California garden to reveal the sins of a monarchy with 1,200 years of history. The answers, including claims of palace bigotry and callousness that Meghan said put her on the brink of suicide, reverberated with US viewers and in the UK even before the special's planned airing there Monday night.  Hugh Jackman recommended the “courageous interview” for its candour about mental health, and Serena Williams praised her friend Meghan for being “so brave”. The British tabloids that Meghan also blamed for her emotional pain feasted on the interview while labelling it self-serving. Winfrey carefully framed the interview’s legitimacy at the outset, asking Meghan to confirm that questions hadn’t been provided in advance, no subject was off limits and the couple wasn’t compensated. US broadcaster CBS reportedly paid Winfrey’s production company, Harpo, up to US$9 million (S$12.16 million) to air it and, according to early Nielsen estimates, was rewarded with 17 million viewers, an unusually large audience amid multiplying choices. “The thing that struck me first and I think will stay with me the longest is that she began the interview” with ethics-related disclosures, said Kathleen Bartzen Culver, director of the Center for Journalism Ethics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “That was such a fantastic way to be transparent about what we were going to see in that interview last night, and how we as viewers can judge its credibility.” Winfrey also pointedly noted that she had attended the couple's wedding – thanking Meghan for the invite – and that they were neighbours in the posh Montecito area of Southern California. The veteran interviewer, actor and media mogul, whose talk show aired for more than two decades, had a willing partner in Meghan. Looking movie-star glamorous yet vulnerable in her visible pregnancy, the former Suits actor came prepared to “speak your truth today"", as Winfrey put it at one point. When Meghan revealed the depth of her emotional distress, however, she stopped short of confirming that she considered suicide. Winfrey guided her toward that bleak revelation with a deftness honed by long experience. Her questions were short and direct, including this memorable query to Meghan: “Were you silent, or silenced?” A careful listener, she let nothing escape her notice, including when Harry almost offhandedly mentioned that his father, Prince Charles, stopped taking his calls at some point. Winfrey coaxed Harry to explore the rift. 
  Other intimate details poured out, including what Meghan and Harry called a lack of palace support over Meghan’s harsh treatment by UK tabloids and dismaying accounts of how their son, Archie, was perceived as lesser than other royal offspring. That included one of the interview’s bombshells from Meghan: That someone in the palace, whom the couple refused to identify, had speculated on how dark Meghan and Harry’s then-unborn son, Archie, would be. “What? Hold up,” a shocked Winfrey replied, a potent exchange made more so because it involved two African American women with a shared perspective. Bartzen Culver saw another value in Winfrey and her skilful performance. “She is just so tremendously talented that it just sort of, in an unspoken way, undercut the racism” directed at Meghan, she said. With the special fixed firmly on Harry and Meghan’s comments, there was scant room for context or clarification. That included the unanswered question of who had commented on Archie, a void that created a frenzy of speculation. It wasn’t until Monday morning, when Winfrey appeared on CBS This Morning, that viewers learned that Harry had disclosed that his grandparents, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, were in the clear. In an almost defensive tone, Winfrey said she had pressed Harry for the person's name during the edited interview that in all spanned more than three hours. She also explained the palace bureaucracy that dictates aspects of royal lives, aside from the wishes of the queen, something that US viewers may be unfamiliar with. John Doyle, television critic for Canada's the Globe and Mail newspaper, said Winfrey was “the best kind of person” for the job. While she is ""a media superstar, incredibly rich and successful"", Doyle said, she's able to view the British monarchy as a representative American who's fascinated by it but “cannot quite understand all of the nuances and subtleties involved"". ""I think she played that role and did it very well,” he said. (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/5-key-points-prince-harry-meghan-tv-interview-317206,5 key points from Prince Harry and Meghan's explosive TV interview,"Oprah Winfrey’s two-hour prime-time interview with Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, contained revelations and allegations that have left Britain’s royal family reeling, painting a picture of racism, insensitivity and deep-rooted dysfunction. The palace has not responded to the interview, broadcast in the US on Sunday (Mar 7) night, which has made headlines and sparked debate around the world. Here are five key points from the broadcast: MEGHAN SAYS SHE FACED RACISM Meghan, who is biracial, said before the couple had their son Archie, there had been “concerns and conversations” between Harry and the family “about how dark his skin might be when he’s born”. Harry confirmed there was a conversation about “what will the kids look like”. He said he would never reveal who was involved, but Winfrey said he told her it was not his grandparents, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. Meghan also said she was treated differently by the British media compared to Prince William’s wife Catherine, who was also followed closely by the press and even dubbed “Waity Katie” on account of the couple’s long courtship. “While I imagine that was really hard – and I do, I can’t picture what that felt like – this is not the same,” Meghan said. “And if a member of his family would comfortably say ‘We’ve all had to deal with things that are rude’ – rude and racist are not the same.” MEGHAN SAYS SHE HAD SUICIDAL THOUGHTS Meghan said her isolation and unhappiness inside the royal family grew so bad that “I just didn’t want to be alive anymore”. “And that was a very clear, and real, and frightening, constant thought,” she said. So she said she sought help from the palace's human resources department, but did not receive it. “I went to the institution and I said that I needed to go somewhere to get help. I said that I’ve never felt this way before and I need to go somewhere,” she said. “And I was told that I couldn’t, that it wouldn’t be good for the institution.” HARRY SAYS HE WAS TRAPPED Harry said that, through his relationship with Meghan, he realised that he and his family were all trapped inside an oppressive system. “I was trapped but I didn’t know I was trapped,” he said. “My father and my brother, they are trapped. They don’t get to leave.” He also claimed there was a toxic relationship between the royals and the media and that Britain's royal family was afraid of the tabloid press “turning on them”. “There is a level of control by fear that has existed for generations,” he said. HARRY HAS A FRACTURED RELATIONSIP WITH HIS FATHER AND BROTHER Harry revealed a breakdown in his relations with his father Prince Charles, who is heir to the British throne, and elder brother Prince William, the second in line. He said at one point Charles stopped taking his calls, and there was still “a lot to work through” in their relationship. “I will always love him. But there’s a lot of hurt that’s happened and I will continue to make it one of my priorities to try and heal that relationship,” Harry said. He said he and William had “been through hell together, we have a shared experience, but we were on different paths”. 
  HARRY AND MEGHAN HAD TWO WEDDING CEREMONIES The couple’s lavish May 2018 wedding at Windsor Castle was a grand ceremonial affair, watched by millions around the world. But Meghan revealed she and Harry had already exchanged vows in private three days earlier in the presence of Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, head of the Anglican church. “We called the archbishop and we just said, look, this thing, this spectacle is for the world, but we want our union between us,” she said. ""So the vows that we have framed in our room are just the two of us in our backyard with the archbishop of Canterbury.” “Just the three of us,” Harry added. They also revealed that their second child, due in the summer, will be a girl. Their son Archie was born in May 2019. (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/chloe-zhao-director-nomadland-faces-controversy-china-313771,"Chloe Zhao, Chinese director of Nomadland, faces controversy at home","Chloe Zhao's success – she's the first Asian woman and the second woman ever to win a Golden Globe for best director for her film Nomadland – has not been met with universal applause in her country of birth. The Beijing-born filmmaker, now a leading Oscar contender, instead finds the news of her success overshadowed by a nationalist backlash regarding her citizenship and her identity. Censors have removed some social media posts about the film, which has raised questions about whether it will still be released in China. Over the past week, Chinese web users questioned whether Zhao, who was educated in the UK and the US, was still a Chinese citizen and if she could be counted as Chinese given a critical comment she made about the country in 2013. Even as some celebrated her win, others dug up two interviews where Zhao said things that they considered an “insult to China”. Now publicity about the film has been removed from social media, and at least two hashtags related to it have been disabled. Searching for the hashtags “Nomadland has a release date” and “No land to rely on” (the film's Chinese title) on popular microblog platform Weibo results in a message: “According to the relevant laws, regulations and policies, the page is not found”. A post on Weibo from the government-backed National Arthouse Alliance of Cinemas that had featured a poster for the film no longer displays the poster. On Douban, a popular app where many urban Chinese users discuss books, films and TV shows, the official Chinese poster for the movie as well as a release date in China were deleted on Friday (Mar 5), according to Variety. The app's landing page for the movie, with comments and its English-language poster, remain visible. At the heart of the controversy are two quotes from previous interviews done by Zhao. Online users circulated screenshots from a 2013 interview with Filmmaker magazine where Zhao said, “It goes back to when I was a teenager in China, being in a place where there are lies everywhere”. The interview no longer shows the quote, but archived versions of the webpage showed the original. The second quote came from an interview Zhao did with an Australian website, news.com.au, in December last year where she said “the US is now my country”. Although the news site updated the story on Mar 3 to say they had misquoted Zhao, and that the article “has been updated to reflect she said (the US is) 'not' her country"", the uncorrected version of the story was the one circulating widely on the Chinese internet. It is unclear if the film will still be released in China. It was slated to be released on Apr 23, according to Chinese media. The China Film Administration did not immediately respond to phone calls seeking comment. The online debate has been split. Nationalist commentators say Zhao betrayed her country, calling her “two-faced” and saying she left the country based on her father's wealth as a former CEO of a state-owned enterprise. Other observers called for the debate to remain focused on her movie, which follows the story of a woman who lives in a van after the company that was the economic engine of her town in Nevada shut its doors. A popular film critic, Chu Mufeng, praised Zhao and her film on his Weibo where he has 3 million followers, noting that “not only was she the first ethnically Chinese female director to win best director, she was also the first Asian woman”. However, one of the top comments underneath his post said: “An American female film director, thanks, don't praise her too much”. Chu responded to the comment, saying, “If an ethnically Chinese chef was great at cooking, would you ask him where he was from? Treat a good movie as if it's a feast, all you need to do is enjoy”.

Harry said “to have a boy and then a girl, what more can you ask for? But now we’ve got our family. We’ve got the four of us and our two dogs.”  The couple also shared that they had secretly tied the knot three days before their May 19, 2018 wedding ceremony that was telecast to the world.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/k-pop-group-bts-big-hit-universal-music-korea-blackpink-idol-fan-373946,"Commentary: As Big Hit searches for the next big thing, are there too many K-pop groups?","SEOUL: Big Hit Entertainment, the label behind K-pop phenomenon BTS, is both riding a stunning wave of success and looking for the next big thing. Over the past year, BTS, which delivered Big Hit most of its earnings, has achieved feats unprecedented for K-pop, including topping the Billboard Hot 100, performing at the Grammys and being named entertainer of the year by Time magazine.  Alongside the accolades have come impressive earnings. Despite the music industry coming under strain since the coronavirus outbreak, when big concerts and live events cannot be held, Big Hit is now valued at around US$7.6 billion, with its stock price doubling since its initial public offering in October 2020. The company brought in US$716 million in revenues and US$77 million in profits in 2020, up 36 per cent and nearly 20 per cent respectively from the previous year. 
  With the entertainment giant looking to move from strength-to-strength, Big Hit announced a project with Universal Music Group earlier this month. The two companies will collaborate to assemble and train a new K-pop group to carry on the momentum created by BTS.  Big Hit knows the members of BTS must undergo compulsory South Korea military service at some point and they will need to fill that temporary absence. That national service sabbatical could be career-ending in an industry of short attention spans and insatiable fan appetite. And for all of BTS’ huge successes, like all pop acts, they will not be cool forever. 
  HOW BTS REDEFINED K-POP In announcing the venture, Big Hit CEO Bang Si-hyuk said this combining of forces will “create a synergy that rewrites global music history”, while Universal Music Group CEO Sir Lucian Grange said the companies’ goal is to “further accelerate K-pop as a global cultural phenomenon”. The thing is, BTS has rewritten the international conversation about K-pop and set a high bar for the next group. No longer do labels, fans or observers wonder what it might take for the genre to find sustained success in the West. With a message of “self-love” and active engagement with fans, BTS has reached global prominence that no one could have predicted. 
  BTS absorbed the lessons of their predecessors and learned from acts that came before them what didn’t work. In the US, they entered a marketplace familiarised with Korea through exposure to acts like Psy, the WonderGirls and Girls’ Generation, all of whom had scored some degree of stateside success. It’s not just the music industry. The South Korean government too is committed to seeing K-pop remain a global force, in part due to the national pride the country gleans from seeing homegrown acts succeed abroad. Well aware of the commercial and soft-power potential of the industry, the government is pledging continued support, such as tax breaks and subsidies. 
  K-POP’S STAYING POWER The task now is to leverage that into something long-lasting. Big Hit hopes to create “synergy” in combining Universal’s expertise in the global music industry with its hit-making prowess. The group will be formed in the US through K-pop’s customary boot-camp style competition, where hopefuls will be drilled in singing and dancing as the group’s architects select members through rounds of elimination. BTS may sit at the top of the K-pop pile but are far from alone. Blackpink, Twice, Exo and TVXQ are heavy hitters with distinct identities.  Their own passionate fan bases follow their every move with dedication more typically associated with fans of sports franchises. As BTS and other big companies look toward the future, and the countless competitors mull how to get their own slice of the pop music pie, the question becomes, how sustainable is all this?  While the industry is growing, it will surely eventually hit a point of saturation, with diminishing opportunities for each newly launched act. And there already are literally hundreds of idol groups. The top notch of the industry are entertainment industry kingpins who rake in millions as they (in normal times) hold concerts in stadiums. Further down the totem pole are middling acts who travel around South Korea in minivans making local appearances for meagre pay or indie bands that put out music on SoundCloud and other channels. 
  KOREAN ENTERTAINMENT GOES GLOBAL The abundance of choice can also have the effect of diluting the whole.  With so many new groups that come across as similar in sound and appearance, alongside countless new K-dramas on the ever-expanding number of streaming platforms, the Korean cultural machine could be undermining its own longevity by presenting audiences with a mind-numbing abundance of choice. Having a global audience could change the game. The management brass of Korean entertainment titans know they must target overseas markets to grow the pie instead of relying solely on domestic fans, in a rapidly ageing society. With this in mind, K-pop management agencies have been shrewd in broadening the appeal of their acts, deliberately recruiting members of different nationalities with fluency in languages, in Chinese, English and Thai, to boost groups’ ability to operate overseas.  Just look at Blackpink’s members. This way, when one audience group turns away from K-pop, as when South Korean-Chinese relations soured in 2017, they can count on fandoms in other parts of the world. But this lean, mean K-pop machinery may have corrosive effects on performers. International media regularly report on the dark side to the high-stakes lottery of glamorous K-pop stardom. Untold numbers of young people labour for years with the hope of striking a deal with one of the big management agencies. Many of them endure gruelling conditions, with some cases of physical and sexual abuse. Even for the chosen few who hit it big, fame can be unpleasant. Recent years have seen a number of high-profile entertainers take their lives while struggling with the pressures of fame. Korean netizens can be harsh with idols they feel have behaved inappropriately, as was the case with Goo Hara and Sulli. 
  CONSOLIDATION IN THE K-POP INDUSTRY Another recent move by Big Hit that drew somewhat less attention than the venture with Universal is the company’s decision to buy a US$63 million stake in YG Entertainment, an older K-pop management giant that has in recent years suffered from a series of scandals. Big Hit is also partnering with Naver, South Korea’s main web portal and a growing IT giant, to develop an online fan community.  As with so much of online commerce nowadays, the key is to keep fans tuned in, always having a reason to refresh the page and keeping paying attention. That Big Hit is now publicly traded means the company will face pressure from shareholders to remain profitable and grow consistently. These power moves will mean that even as the K-pop market keeps getting more crowded, and even if the agency’s next acts don’t hit big, the company will still have revenue streams and a built-in audience. Perhaps K-pop has gotten too big to be dismissed as a fad. Perhaps despite saturation, K-pop will always have its big players. Big Hit's recent moves herald a more unequal business landscape, where a few companies exercise ever-growing influence and the uphill climb for countless aspirants will only get more daunting.

She said: ""Some students thought I had priority, or received special treatment and benefits, when in fact, I didn't.

The elusive artist confirmed the picture was his when he posted a video of him creating it on his Instagram account. The monochrome picture shows a man escaping using a rope made of paper from a typewriter. It appeared on Monday outside Reading Prison, famous as the location where writer Oscar Wilde served two years for “gross indecency” in the 1890s. 
   A post shared by Banksy (@banksy) The prison closed in 2013, and campaigners want it turned into an arts venue. Britain’s Ministry of Justice, which owns the building, is due to decide mid-March on its future. In his Instagram video, Banksy is shown stealthily stenciling and spraying paint to create the artwork, titled “Create Escape”. The footage is juxtaposed with an episode of a traditional art instruction video called “The Joy of Painting with Bob Ross”. The campaign to turn the former prison into an arts venue has won the backing of actors including Judi Dench, Stephen Fry and Kenneth Branagh. A spokesman for Reading Borough Council said it was “thrilled that Banksy appears to have thrown his support behind the council’s desire to transform the vacant Reading Gaol into a beacon of arts, heritage and culture with this piece of artwork he has aptly called ‘Create Escape’”. “The Council is pushing the Ministry of Justice, who own the site, to make suitable arrangements to protect the image,” the authority said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/disney-raya-and-the-last-dragon-awkwafina-1923151,Raya And The Last Dragon is a dazzling adventure suitable for the whole family,"Contrary to what Game Of Thrones might have you believe, not all dragons are agents of destruction. In the newest offering from Walt Disney Animation, Raya And The Last Dragon, they are kind, full of magic and, when needed, the saviours of humanity. Five hundred years ago, we're told in a prologue, dragons sacrificed themselves for humans when a mystical evil called the Druun passed through the lands of Kumandra and turned many to stone. The kingdom splintered into factions – Tail, Talon, Heart, Fang and Spine – who perpetually teeter on the edge of war. Sisu, the only remaining dragon, hasn't been seen in five centuries. Raya (voiced by Star Wars' Kelly Marie Tran) is the young Princess of Heart. Her father (voiced by Daniel Dae Kim) is the Chief who hopes to unite all the territories. It doesn't go as planned, he's turned to stone, and Raya is set on a dangerous quest to track down the dragon who she believes is their last hope.  The film comes from the odd but inspired pairing of co-directors Carlos Lopez Estrada (who made the Sundance breakout Blindspotting) and Disney veteran Don Hall (Big Hero 6) and was co-written by Vietnamese playwright Qui Nguyen and Crazy Rich Asians co-writer Adele Lim. The result is a sweet-natured and wonderfully imaginative fantasy adventure that has shades of Indiana Jones and is suitable for the whole family. Raya gets off to a bit of a slow start but stick with it. Once she sets out on her mission, things pick up considerably thanks in no small part to the introduction of Sisu, played by Awkwafina, who doesn't try to disguise her wonderfully distinctive voice. Raya discovers Sisu is not quite the hero she is looking for, but that's just part of the journey. Along the way their brood grows with others displaced and orphaned by the Druun and Raya must confront her main foe, a Princess from another land, Namaari (Gemma Chan) who is part of the reason things went awry in the first place.  The animation is both stunning and very computer generated. Sometimes extended shots of the humans talking can start to feel like the uncanny valley and it makes you miss the hand drawn elements of the form. But hand drawn animation also wouldn't be able to create the stunning vistas and astoundingly lifelike water. It's a compromise and Raya is undoubtedly a visual feast.  
  It's also the best kind of feminist film in that it's one that doesn't clobber you with the message. Raya is allowed to be awesome without the script shouting about it all the time and it's better for it. It does however hammer home a message about trust, which, you know, is fair enough. And it has chosen to have yet another middle-aged semi-dystopian female leader bedecked in all white with a severe gray haircut (Namaari's mum, voiced by Sandra Oh). It's not that it's inherently bad, it's just a lazy choice for a film that is otherwise so inventive.  Raya is also notable for the simple fact that it features predominately Asian American voice actors – a first for Disney Animation. The animated Mulan had a fair amount too, but a lot were white actors voicing Chinese roles. Will that make a difference to the kids watching? Probably not at the moment, but down the line the authenticity will be appreciated. Disney’s Raya And The Last Dragon opens in cinemas on Friday (Mar 5), with sneaks on Mar 4. Also available on Disney+ Premier Access on Mar 5. (Source: AP)"

When another person came over to help, Croissant didn’t immediately recognise it was Mehmet Oz, the cardiac surgeon and longtime host of TV’s Dr Oz Show, who happened to be nearby. “The gentleman had face-planted, and there was a pool of blood like a murder scene,” Oz told The Associated Press. Oz said he tried to rouse him, but the man had no pulse and his face had begun to turn purple. Croissant performed CPR on the man while Oz worked to clear his airway with a face pack and a tongue-depressing oral airway device. Three other officers brought oxygen and a defibrillator for the man, who eventually regained a pulse and was taken to a hospital for evaluation. “What better help than to have a cardiac surgeon?"" Croissant said afterward. Oz said that he first became aware of the man's distress while waiting for baggage at the luggage carousel and his daughter started yelling “Daddy, daddy, daddy!” Oz said his fatherly alarm bells went off thinking she was in trouble, then switched into emergency gear when he saw the man. The defibrillator “diagnosed that his heart had stopped, as I had thought was the case when I couldn’t get a pulse,” Oz said. ""It told us to step away. And you’ve seen those movies where the patient gets shocked and they jerk off the ground? That’s exactly what happened. Usually, the heart doesn’t start again ... in this case, like the movies, his heart started.” Oz said the man's face began regaining its colour, and he awakened. “The spectators, you could feel the prayers and energy change,” he said. “Instead of watching a trainwreck it was a miracle.” Oz has come to the aid of injured people on numerous occasions. In 2015, emergency responders arriving at the scene of a crash on the New Jersey Turnpike found Oz was already treating two injured people. And two years earlier, he helped a British tourist whose foot was severed when a cabbie jumped the curb at Rockefeller Center in midtown Manhattan. Oz praised the Port Authority officers, and credited the man’s life with their quick response. “The officers stepped up perfectly,” he said. (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/hello-kitty-live-action-animated-hybrid-movie-directors-1923156,We’re one step closer to a Hello Kitty live-action and animated hybrid movie,"Hello Kitty fans, you’re now one step closer to watching your favourite character in an animated/live-action hybrid film on the big screen. Deadline reported that animation veterans Jennifer Coyle and Leo Matsuda have been chosen to direct the flick. This is the first collaboration and the first studio film for both.   Coyle is known for her producing and directing work on animated series such as Harley Quinn and Bob’s Burgers. She said that this provided a “rare chance to bring a beloved character to life” and to “spread the message of love, friendship and inclusivity that Hello Kitty stands for”. Matsuda has worked on titles like Big Hero 6, Zootopia, Ralph Breaks The Internet and Abominable. He made his directorial debut on the short, Inner Workings, which premiered before Disney’s Moana, and also has an original animated feature titled Yokai Samba in development at Nickelodeon. 
  Said Matsuda: “Growing up in Brazil with a Japanese family, I was surrounded by the whimsy of Hello Kitty and it served as a reminder that it’s okay to be different”. Added Coyle: “The world so needs her brand of joy and happiness.” New Line studio, which is part of Warner Bros, acquired the rights to make the Hello Kitty movie in 2019. This is the only time Sanrio has granted film rights to Hello Kitty and other characters – Gudetama, My Melody and Little Twin Stars – to a major studio."

The Welsh actors were born in cities about an hour apart and moved in similar circles during their youth without ever knowing each other. She was born in Swansea and Sheen was born in Newport seven months apart. “We have all these mutual friends, but we’ve never crossed. My mum and dad know his dad,” she said on Tuesday (Mar 2) in a virtual Television Critics Association panel. “It’s bizarre. That was, of course, a huge pull for me.” Zeta-Jones joins Prodigal Son in a new episode that aired on Tuesday in the US, directed by co-star Lou Diamond Phillips. Previously, the Oscar winner had done guest episodes and appeared in TV movies and miniseries, but never a regular series role. She plays Dr Vivian Capshaw and Alan Cumming appears in two episodes as a cocky Europol agent. “It’s a family drama with a twist of danger and it’s a dark family,” Zeta-Jones said. “I gravitate to kind of dark material.” Sheen’s presence increased the comfort level for Zeta-Jones to come onto a set where the cast and crew had already been together for a season. He plays an incarcerated serial killer surgeon. “As soon as Lou shouted, ‘Cut,’ Michael and I went into inside jokes, Tommy Cooper impressions,” she said, referring to the British comedian. Phillips said, “She came like a team player, she came to play. It was seamless.” Zeta-Jones told her agent she wanted to join the show on the same day she was watching The View talk show. “Whoopi Goldberg just randomly gives it this incredible kind of thumbs up and I’m like, ‘Yes, that’s what I’m talking about,’” she said. “That was like a stamp of approval that came from nowhere.” (Source: AP)"

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/eddie-murphy-arsenio-hall-coming-2-america-amazon-prime-256131,"Eddie Murphy, Arsenio Hall return to Zamunda for Coming 2 America","When Eddie Murphy made the original Coming To America, he was, almost indisputably, the funniest man in America. Murphy was at the very height of his fame, coming off Beverly Hills Cop II and the stand-up special Raw. They were heady times. Arsenio Hall, Murphy’s longtime friend and co-star in Coming To America, remembers them sneaking out during the shoot to a Hollywood nightclub while still dressed as Prince Akeem and his loyal aide Semmi. “We were insane,” says Hall. The ’80s, Murphy says, are “all a blur”. “I was so young, all this stuff was happening. You take everything for granted when you’re young, how successful I was,” Murphy says, speaking by Zoom with a shelf of award statuettes behind him. “Now I take nothing for granted and appreciate everything.” Thirty-three years after Coming To America, Murphy and Hall have returned to Zamunda. The sequel, originally planned to hit theatres last year, was sold due of the pandemic by Paramount Pictures to Amazon, where it will begin streaming on Friday (Mar 5). It’s an unlikely coda to a blockbuster comedy, one that belongs so completely to the late ’80s that even the sequel tries to keep some of that era’s spirit. (A few notable R&B and hip-hop groups make cameos.) Coming 2 America, directed by Craig Brewer, reverses the fish-out-water plot to bring Queens to Zamunda after Akeem learns he fathered a son (Jermaine Fowler) on his first visit to New York. Some elements have been updated. There’s a plot of female empowerment; KiKi Layne plays Akeem’s daughter. At the barbershop, where Murphy and Hall also reprise their characters, the conversation bounces from Teslas to transgender people. “We had a draft where they had on MAGA hats and they were Republicans,” says Murphy. “It was funny but it was like, eh, let’s not even go there.” Instead, Murphy and his collaborators — including writers Barry W Blaustein, David Sheffield and Kenya Barris — felt the core appeal of Coming To America lies in its fairy tale premise. “This is the only movie I’ve ever done that had a cult following,” says Murphy. “We had totally forgot about Coming To America. Then this movie took on this life in the culture. It became like a cult movie. Lines from the movie became catchphrases. People do the mic drop now. The very first mic drop is Randy Watson from Coming To America.” Coming To America has indeed played a unique role in culture since 1988. Real-life McDowell's fast-food restaurants – the McDonald's knockoff from the movie – have briefly popped up in Los Angeles and Chicago. Beyoncé and Jay-Z once dressed up as characters from the film for Halloween. But the John Landis-directed movie was also a massive success on release. It was the second-highest grossing film in the US in 1988 with US$128.2 million in tickets sold – nearly double what Die Hard made that year. Globally, it grossed US$288.8 million, or more than US$630 million adjusted for inflation. To Murphy, that’s the movie’s legacy. “Coming To America is the first movie in the history of the movies that had an all-black cast that travelled all around the world,” says Murphy. “They don’t give a shit about Selma and Martin Luther King and civil injustice, whatever our story is in America. They don’t give a shit about that around the world. “It’s not about being black. It’s about love and family and tradition and doing the right thing,” Murphy adds. “If Black Panther was about the hood, people wouldn’t have seen Black Panther all around the world.” The connections between Coming To America and Black Panther – both rare depictions of black royalty and a mythic Africa – are many. Before making Black Panther, Murphy has said Ryan Coogler approached him about a Coming To America sequel. During production on Black Panther, Lupita Nyong’o (once not a fan of Coming To America for its cliched depiction of Africans) and other cast members threw a Coming To America birthday party. Ruth E Carter designed the costumes of both Black Panther and Coming 2 America. Both were shot in Atlanta. “I’ve had people say, ‘Now Zamunda isn’t a real place, right?’” says Brewer. “And I say, ‘No, it’s definitely a real place. I believe it’s just northeast of Wakanda.’” The script for Coming 2 America was worked on for four years but shooting started quickly. Murphy first suggested Brewer direct Coming 2 America during a dinner with John Singleton after a test screening of My Name Is Dolemite, the Rudy Ray Moore biopic that helped spur a revival for the 59-year-old Murphy. “Coming To America was one of my favourite movies as a teenager,” says Brewer, speaking from his home in Memphis, Tennessee. “I couldn't help but just say ‘Yes!’ immediately. Then it became clear to me that this is going to go, like, now.” Coming 2 America also rekindles the great comedic chemistry between Murphy and Hall. Murphy estimates the close friends have seen each other two or three times a week for 40 years. But they went decades before talking about a sequel. “All of a sudden I’m reading this script that I love and I realise this movie that we thought we never were going to do a sequel to, we’re about to head to Atlanta – which is America’s Africa,” says Hall. The shoot took place on the Tyler Perry Studio sound stages, with Rick Ross’ nearby mansion serving as the Zamunda palace. The movie reunites most of the original cast – including James Earl Jones, John Amos and Shari Headley – and brings in many others, too, including Wesley Snipes, Leslie Jones and Tracy Morgan. Hall, who had been doing stand-up with Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle, sensed everyone wanted in. “One day in the dressing room, Dave is like, ‘I heard ya’ll are doing Coming To America 2. I said, ‘Yeah, man.’ He said, ‘I want to be in that,’” recalls Hall. (A scheduling conflict interfered and the versatile Hall, who has four roles in the movie, ended up playing the witch doctor part Chappelle might have.) Some things have changed with time. This Coming To America is rated PG-13. Murphy was just 27 when he made Coming To America. Now, he has 10 children and a grandchild. His daughter, Bella, has a small role in the film. “He joked about it on Saturday Night Live, about him versus Cosby and who’s America’s favourite dad now. But there’s something to that,” says Brewer. “If you’re ever around Eddie and his kids – and now his grandchild – you see that he’s truly a man who loves his family and does not need the public’s constant validation and appreciation to know who he is.” Family life figures prominently in Murphy’s newer stand-up material. A long-awaited return to performing in 2020 had been his intention before the pandemic hit. Those plans haven’t been cancelled; when live performance returns, Murphy says, “then we’ll do stand-up”. Until then, Murphy, a proud homebody, has found himself back where he started. “I had gotten off the couch to go to work. I said, ‘OK, let me get off this couch I’ve been on for eight years. Let me go do some work,’” Murphy says. “And we were rolling. We did everything we set out to do. The big thing was going back to Saturday Night Live. We was on a high. Coming 2 America was in the can. Then the whole world fell apart.” “I was all ready to go,” Murphy says, grinning, “and then I had to go sit back on the couch.” (Source: AP)"

Ryan Fischer’s posts included pictures taken from his hospital bed, where he says “(a) lot of healing still needs to happen” but he looks forward to reuniting with the dogs. Fischer was shot once as he walked three of Lady Gaga's dogs on Wednesday night on a street just off the famed Sunset Boulevard. Video captured by the doorbell camera of a nearby home captured Fischer's screams of “Oh my God! I’ve been shot!” and “Help me!” and “I’m bleeding out from my chest!”

The singer is currently in Rome to film a movie. Fischer thanked Lady Gaga for her support during the ordeal, writing “your babies are back and the family is whole ... we did it!"" in Instagram posts. A third dog, named Asia, escaped the assailants and lied down next to Fischer “while a car sped away and blood poured from my gun shot (sic) wound,” he wrote.

The night's top award, best picture drama, went to Chloe Zhao's elegiac road movie Nomadland, a Western set across economic upheaval and personal grief. Zhao, the China-born filmmaker of, became the first woman of Asian descent to win best director. She's only the second woman in the history of the Globes to win, and the first since Barbra Streisand won for Yentl in 1984.  ""Nomadland at its core for me is a pilgrimage through grief and healing,"" said Zhao, accepting the awards remotely. ""For everyone who has gone through this difficult and beautiful journey at some point in their lives. We don't say goodbye. We say: See you down the road.""  With a cancelled red carpet and stars giving speeches from the couch, Sunday's (Feb 28) Globes had little of their typically frothy flavor.  Facing scant traditional studio competition, streaming services dominated the Globes like never before – even if the top award went to a familiar if renamed source: Searchlight Pictures, formerly the Fox specialty label of 12 Years A Slave and The Shape Of Water now owned by the Walt Disney Co.  Amazon's Borat Subsequent Moviefilm – one of the few nominated films shot partly during the pandemic – won best film, comedy or musical. Its star guerilla comedian, Sacha Baron Cohen, won best actor in a comedy. Referring to Rudy Giuliani's infamous cameo, Cohen thanked ""a fresh new talent who came from nowhere and turned out to be a comedy genius"". ""I mean, who could get more laughs from one unzipping,"" said Cohen.  Netflix, which came in with a commanding 42 nominations, won the top TV awards. The Crown, as expected, took best drama series, along with acting wins for Josh O'Connor (Prince Charles), Emma Corrin (Princess Diana) and Gillian Anderson (Margaret Thatcher). The Queen's Gambit won best limited series, and best actress in the category for Anya Taylor-Joy. Schitt's Creek, the Pop TV series that found a wider audience on Netflix, won best comedy series for its final season. Catherine O'Hara also took best actress in a comedy series.  Chadwick Boseman, as expected, posthumously won best actor in a drama film for his final performance, in the August Wilson adaptation ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom"" – a Netflix release. Boseman's wife, Taylor Simone Ledward, tearfully, emotionally accepted the award.  ""He would thank God. He would thank his parents. He would thank his ancestors for their guidance and their sacrifices,"" said Ledward. ""He would say something beautiful, something inspiring.""  
  Apple TV+ scored its first major award when a sweatshirt-clad Jason Sudeikis won best actor in a comedy series for the streamer's Ted Lasso. Fey took the stage at New York's Rainbow Room while Poehler remained at the Globes' usual home at the Beverly Hilton. In their opening remarks, they managed their typically well-timed back-and-forth despite being almost 5,000 kilometres from each other.  ""I always knew my career would end with me wandering around the Rainbow Room pretending to talk to Amy,"" said Fey. ""I just thought it would be later."" They appeared before masked attendees but no stars. Instead, the sparse tables – where Hollywood royalty are usually crammed together and plied with alcohol during the show – were occupied by ""smoking-hot first responders and essential workers"", as Fey said.  In a production nightmare but one that's become familiar during the pandemic, the night's first winner accepted his award while muted. Only after presenter Laura Dern apologised for the technical difficulties did Daniel Kaluuya, who won best supporting actor for his performance as Black Panther leader Fred Hampton in Judas And The Black Messiah, get his speech in. When he finally came through, he waged his finger at the camera and said, ""You're doing me dirty!""  Pandemic improvising was only part of the damage control for the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which puts on the Globes. After The Los Angeles Times revealed that there are no black members in the 87-person voting body of the HFPA, the press association came under mounting pressure to overhaul itself and better reflect the industry it holds sway in. This year, none of the most acclaimed Black-led films – Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, One Night In Miami, Judas And The Black Messiah, Da 5 Bloods – were nominated for the Globes' best picture award. With the HFPA potentially fighting for its Hollywood life, Sunday's Globes were part apology tour. Fey and Poehler started in quickly on the issue.  ""Look, a lot of flashy garbage got nominated but that happens,"" said Poehler. ""That's like their thing. But a number of black actors and black-led projects were overlooked."" Within the first half hour of the telecast, members of the press association also appeared on stage to pledge change. ""We recognise we have our own work to do,"" said vice president Helen Hoehne. ""We must have black journalists in our organisation."" When attendees would normally be streaming down the red carpet on Sunday evening, many stars were instead posing virtually. Regina King, resplendent in a dazzling dress, stood before her yawning dog. Carey Mulligan, nominated for Promising Young Woman, said from a London hotel room that she was wearing heels for the first time in more than a year. The circumstances led to some award-show anomalies. Mark Ruffalo, appearing remotely, won best actor in a limited series for I Know This Much Is True with his kids celebrating behind him and his wife, Sunrise Coigney, sitting alongside.  Lee Isaac Chung, writer-director of the tender Korean-American family drama Minari (a movie the HFPA was criticised for ruling ineligible for its top award because of its non-English dialogue), accepted the award for best foreign language film while his young daughter embraced him. ""She's the reason I made this film,"" said Chung.  ""Minari is about a family. It's a family trying to learn a language of its own. It goes deeper than any American language and any foreign language. It's a language of the heart,"" said Chung. ""I'm trying to learn it myself and to pass it on.""  John Boyega, supporting actor winner for his performance in Steve McQueen's Small Axe anthology, raised his leg to show he was wearing track pants below his more elegant white jacket. Jodie Foster (The Mauritanian) won one of the biggest surprise Globes, for best supporting actress in a film, while, sitting on the couch next to her wife, Alexandra Hedison, and with her dog, Ziggy, on her lap. Some speeches were pre-taped. The previously recorded speeches by Jon Batiste, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for the wining Soul score went without hiccup even though presenter Tracy Morgan first announced Sal as the winner.  Even if speeches sometimes lacked drama without Hollywood gathered in one place, representation was a common refrain. Pointedly referring to the diversity of the HFPA, presenter and previous winner Sterling K Brown began, ""Thank you. It is great to be black at the Golden Globes,"" he said. ""Back.""  Jane Fonda, the Cecil B DeMille Award honoree, spoke passionately about expanding the big tent of entertainment for all. ""Art has always been not just in step in history but has lead the way,"" said Fonda. ""So let's be leaders.""  Other awards included Pixar's Soul for best animated film; Rosumund Pike took best actress in a comedy or musical film for I Care a Lot; and Aaron Sorkin (Trial Of The Chicago 7) for best screenplay. The film, a favourite to win best drama film at the Globes, was sold to Netflix by Paramount Pictures last summer due to the pandemic. ""Netflix saved our lives,"" said Sorkin. As showtime neared, the backlash over the HFPA threatened to overwhelm the Globes. Yet the Globes have persisted because of their popularity (the show ranks as the third most-watched award show, after the Oscars and Grammys), their profitability (NBC paid US$60 million for broadcast rights in 2018) and because they serve as important marketing material for contending films and Oscar hopefuls. The Globes took place on the original date of the Academy Awards. Those will instead be held Apr 25. (Source: AP)"

The song has more than 880 million (!) views on YouTube the last time we checked. So for something completely different – how about listening to a rendition of Dynamite as read by A-list actor and director, George Clooney? Clooney did the reading as part of a virtual celebration of W magazine’s Best Performances issue. In true Clooney style, the known jokester began his reading with: “Hello, I’m Brad Pitt. And I’m going to read Dynamite by BTS”. He went on to give a dramatic reading of the lyrics and only seemed to stumble at a couple of parts, namely when he mistook the word “morn” in the line “get up in the morn” as mom. Another part was when he had to steady himself with an “Oh, Jesus” before powering through: “Dy-na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na”. No word yet, though, on whether Clooney is now a member of ARMY.  In other BTS-related news, a German radio station recently had to apologise – twice – after its DJ likened the K-pop band to a “virus”, for which he hoped a vaccine would be available soon. Matthias Matuschik made his initial comment in response to BTS’ rendition of the Coldplay classic, Fix You. The remarks were called out for being racist, especially during a time when there’s been an increase in hate crimes against Asians. The radio station, Bayern3, apologised saying that it wasn’t Matuschik’s intention to “hurt the feelings of BTS fans”. The station said the DJ had “overshot the mark in his choice of words in an attempt to present his opinion in an ironically exaggerated manner and with exaggeratedly feigned excitement”. However, the apology itself was called out for not being sincere and they were forced to apologise a second time. “The words he used to talk about the band BTS is not acceptable. And both he and we at Bayern 3 know that it is not enough if you actually mean things differently. If statements are seen as offensive or racist by many people, then they are too.” British band Coldplay had praised BTS’ cover, calling it “beautiful”"

In an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Harry invoked the memory of his late mother, Princess Diana, who had to find her way alone after she and Prince Charles divorced. “I’m just really relieved and happy to be sitting here talking to you with my wife by my side, because I can’t begin to imagine what it must have been like for her going through this process by herself all those years ago,” Harry said, adding, “because it’s been unbelievably tough for the two of us.” “But at least we have each other,” Harry said, in a clip from the interview special, which is scheduled to air on Sunday (Mar 7) on US network CBS and the following day in Britain. Diana was shown in a photo holding toddler Harry as he made the comments. His mother died in 1997 of injuries suffered in a car crash. Harry and Meghan sat opposite Winfrey and side-by-side, holding hands during the interview that was conducted in a lush garden setting. The couple lives in Montecito, California, where they are neighbours of Winfrey. Meghan, who recently announced she is pregnant with the couple’s second child, wore an empire-style black dress with embroidery. Harry wore a light grey suit and white dress shirt, minus a tie. As Meghan Markle, the actor starred in the TV legal drama Suits. She married Queen Elizabeth II’s grandson at Windsor Castle in May 2018, and their son, Archie, was born a year later. The brief promotional clip was one of two of that aired on Sunday during CBS’ news magazine 60 Minutes. Winfrey’s questions and comment were predominant in the other clip, including her statement that, “You said some pretty shocking things here,” without an indication of what she was referring to. Meghan was not heard from in the clips. Harry and Meghan stepped away from full-time royal life in March 2020, unhappy at media scrutiny and the strictures of their roles. They cited what they described as the intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media toward the duchess, who is African American. It was agreed the situation would be reviewed after a year. On Friday, Buckingham Palace confirmed that the couple will not be returning to royal duties and Harry will give up his honorary military titles – a decision that makes formal, and final, the couple’s split from the royal family. The pair, also known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, verified “they will not be returning as working members of the Royal Family"". A spokesperson for the couple hit back at suggestions that Meghan and Harry were not devoted to duty. “As evidenced by their work over the past year, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex remain committed to their duty and service to the UK and around the world, and have offered their continued support to the organisations they have represented regardless of official role,” the spokesperson said in a statement.

The controversy started in mid-February when it was revealed in an Instagram post on the Janna Nick Studios account that the antagonist in the TV film, Delen, was named Lisa Blackpig. The character was described as attention-seeking.  “LISA BLACKPIG. In every school, there’s an extremely cute and flirty girls group. And this is the representative,” read the caption to the post, which introduced the actress playing the role, Annie Mosha. Delen, Janna’s directorial debut, premiered on Malaysian TV on Feb 13. Angry Blinks took offense at the name as they deemed it disrespectful to Blackpink member Lisa, and began an online campaign to cancel Janna, causing the hashtag #JannaNickGoingToJailParty and #JannaNickIsGoingToJail to top the Malaysian Twitter trends list earlier in the week. During the press conference, Janna’s lawyer Ben Syazmin said that the Lisa Blackpig character is a “tribute” to Blackpink’s Lisa and “does not represent Lisa from Blackpink in any way”. Janna has made a police report against those whom she said have slandered her and tweeted that she had given the authorities the relevant screenshots for them to take action. The actress also briefly quit all her social media platforms at the start of the controversy."

Wu, also known as Ng Man-tat, died in hospital surrounded by his family, reported Hong Kong English daily The Standard. A close friend of the actor said Wu was diagnosed with cancer last year and had been receiving treatment in Macau. He was recently admitted to hospital in Hong Kong, where he had surgery and was undergoing chemotherapy, according to an 8 Days report. The actor battled serious heart issues in 2014 and had been in poor health in recent years, it was reported. During a recent appearance on a Chinese variety show, Wu reportedly said he had not ""fully recovered"" from his health scare in 2014, adding that he thought he was about ""to die” at one point, 8 Days reported last week. A video of him clutching his chest on the set of a shoot earlier last month went viral, sparking concerns among fans about the actor’s health. Wu moved to Hong Kong from Fujian when he was seven years old and started his acting career in 1973 at 22 years old. He was best known for his roles in movies with comedian Stephen Chow, including The Final Combat, The Justice of Life and Shaolin Soccer.

  A woman brought the dogs to the LAPD's Olympic Community Police Station, just northwest of downtown, around 6pm, said Capt Jonathan Tippett, commanding officer of the elite Robbery-Homicide Division. Lady Gaga’s representative and detectives went to the station and confirmed that they were the dogs. The singer is currently in Rome to film a movie. The woman who dropped off the dogs appears to be “uninvolved and unassociated"" with Wednesday night's attack, Tippett said. It wasn't immediately clear how she obtained the dogs. The dog walker, Ryan Fischer, was shot once as he walked three of the singer's dogs in Hollywood. Video showed a white sedan pulling up and two men jumping out. They struggled with the dog walker before one pulled a gun and fired a single shot before fleeing with two of the dogs. The dog walker can be heard on the video saying he had been shot in the chest. Tippett said he is expected to survive his injuries. Lady Gaga on Friday repeated her offer of a US$500,000 (S$666,200) reward for the return of her dogs – whose names are Koji and Gustav – with no questions asked. “I continue to love you Ryan Fischer, you risked your life to fight for our family. You’re forever a hero,"" she said in an Instagram post."

According to entertainment portal 8days, the actress has confirmed that she’ll be opening her very own patisserie around “April or May” as she has secured a shop space for it. She won’t say for now where the shop is located in order to ensure the renovations run smoothly but 8days reported that it will offer a revolving menu of desserts, cakes and pastries – whatever strikes her fancy. Aw, who completed patisserie courses from culinary school Le Cordon Bleu in Bangkok and Tokyo, told the site: “I would like to constantly change the menu, so there will always be something new to look forward to. I won’t be able to tell you right now what I will be offering, it’s more about what inspires me then. I’d like to keep it exciting for the customers as well as myself.” Don’t expect to see her popular WTF What The Fudge Brownies on the menu though. Aw is apparently still clearing the waitlist of around 1,000 people and will take a break from that particular dessert after that. One thing that may make the cut is her pineapple financiers, which she created for Chinese New Year in 2019. Aw also shared that the upcoming shop will focus mainly on delivery and takeaways with a “strong component of taking online preorders and reservations”. She first hinted at the shop opening in an Instagram post on Feb 18, writing that she had received the keys to her dream. When a commenter guessed that she was talking about her own shop, Aw responded: ""That's a smart guess.""  The 41-year-old Aw has another project taking place soon. She's going to be judging a new baking competition show called Creme De La Creme, which will premiere on Channel 8 on Apr 28. Local celeb Fann Wong and award-winning pastry chef Janice Wong will join her as fellow judges. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/marvel-wanda-has-future-wandavision-fate-unclear-kevin-feige-1923181,"Wanda has a future but WandaVision fate unclear, says Marvel Studios chief","When WandaVision wraps its initial run next month on the Disney+ streaming service, Elizabeth Olsen's Wanda will make her next appearance in the big-screen Doctor Strange sequel. It's storytelling that determines how and when characters from the Marvel Comics universe hopscotch between TV and movies, Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige said on  Wednesday (Feb 24). ""All of the crossover between series, between films, will always vary based on the story,"" Feige said. ""Sometimes (a series) will go into a season two, sometimes it'll go into a feature and then back into a series."" Wanda Maximoff, aka Scarlet Witch, plays opposite Benedict Cumberbatch's title character in Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness, planned for a 2022 release. Feige wouldn't say whether WandaVision, Marvel Studios' first original series for Disney+, has a future after its Mar 5 season finale. The riff on generations of TV sitcoms – with the added superhero twist – brought Wanda and Paul Bettany's character, Vision, to the fore from the Avengers movie franchise. ""I've been at Marvel for too long to say a definite no or definite yes to anything,"" Feige replied when asked about the show's future during a virtual panel discussion held by the Television Critics Association. But second seasons are being considered and planned for series, he said, without giving away details. 
  There's a flurry of potential new Disney+ candidates, including The Falcon And The Winter Soldier, debuting Mar 19 with Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan reprising their roles from Avengers: Endgame. Loki, starring Tom Hiddleston revisiting his character following the events of Endgame, debuts Jun 11. After Ms. Marvel arrives on the streaming service (with the date yet to be announced), the character will move to the next Captain Marvel movie, Feige said. He was asked if shifting Marvel stories and characters between film and TV might end up cutting into the potential audience. ""I always say when the lights go down and and a movie starts, it's a clean slate – forget everything that's come before and be able to enjoy something that's its own self-contained story line,"" Feige said. He acknowledged that as the studio makes more shows and films and introduces new characters, it ""becomes harder and harder"" to meet that goal. ""But it is something that all of our writers and filmmakers pay great attention to, to make sure that fans can follow"" the latest chapter and that newcomers can enjoy it too, he said. When the Walt Disney Co acquired Marvel Entertainment for about US$4 billion (S$5.27 billion)  in 2009, prior deals left some of its properties with other studios. Asked if Marvel Studios might be able to regain them, Feige said he believes it could happen, but added that ""rumours online about things reverting"" to Marvel aren't always true. (Source: AP)"

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/hillary-clinton-co-writing-mystery-novel-louise-penny-372761,Hillary Clinton co-writing mystery novel with plot involving a secretary of state,"One of the world's better known fans of mystery novels, Hillary Rodham Clinton, is now writing one. Clinton is teaming up with her friend, the novelist Louise Penny, on State Of Terror, which has a plot that might occur to someone of Clinton's background: A “novice” secretary of state, working in the administration of a rival politician, tries to solve a wave of terrorist attacks. The novel comes out Oct 12, and will be jointly released by Clinton's publisher, Simon & Schuster, and Penny's, St Martin's Press. “Writing a thriller with Louise is a dream come true,"" Clinton, who has expressed admiration for Penny and other mystery writers in the past, said in a statement on  Tuesday (Feb 22). ""I’ve relished every one of her books and their characters as well as her friendship. Now we’re joining our experiences to explore the complex world of high stakes diplomacy and treachery. All is not as it first appears.” Penny, an award-winning author from Canada whose novels include The Cruelest Month and The Brutal Telling, said in a statement that she could not “say yes fast enough” to the chance of working with Clinton. “What an incredible experience, to get inside the State Department. Inside the White House. Inside the mind of the Secretary of State as high stake crises explode,"" she said. ""Before we started, we talked about her time as Secretary of State. What was her worst nightmare? State Of Terror is the answer.” Fiction writing and worst-case scenarios have become a favourite pastime for Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton. He collaborated with James Patterson on the million-selling cyber thriller The President Is Missing, and on a new novel, The President's Daughter, which comes out in June. Hillary Clinton, secretary of state during Barack Obama's first term, has written a handful of nonfiction works. They include the memoir Living History; Hard Choices, which covered her time with Obama, who defeated her in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary; and What Happened, which focuses on her stunning loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 election. State Of Terror appears to draw not just on her years as secretary of state, but on her thoughts about the Trump administration's “America First” foreign policy. According to Simon & Schuster and St Martin's, the main character is “tasked with assembling a team to unravel the deadly conspiracy, a scheme carefully designed to take advantage of an American government dangerously out of touch and out of power in the places where it counts the most”. Financial terms were not disclosed. Clinton was represented by the Washington attorney Robert Barnett, whose other clients include Obama and Bill Clinton. Penny was represented by David Gernert, whose New York-based Gernert Company has worked with, among others, John Grisham, Stewart O'Nan and Chasten Buttigieg, husband of Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg.

Terms of the deal, which was announced on Monday (Feb 22), weren’t released. Armand de Brignac, known familiarly as Ace of Spades because of its distinctive label, is produced in France's Champagne region by a father and son who are 12th and 13th generation wine growers. Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, gave the brand a boost in 2006 when he featured one of their bottles in a music video after a public fallout with Cristal, a rival brand. Carter accused Cristal of racism after an executive for the brand mused in an interview about whether partnering with a rapper would harm its image. In 2014, Carter bought Armand de Brignac for an undisclosed sum. The brand sold more than 500,000 bottles worldwide in 2019. Moet Hennessy President and CEO Philippe Schaus said Armand de Brignac breaks barriers and reflects contemporary ideas of luxury, even as it supports historic Champagne-making traditions. “We are incredibly proud to be partnering with them,” Schaus said. Carter said the partnership will help Armand de Brignac grow and flourish, noting Moet Hennessy’s track record of developing luxury brands like Dom Perignon and Veuve Clicquot. Moet Hennessy is the wine and spirits division of luxury goods company LVMH. “It is a partnership that has felt familiar the entire time,” Carter said. Carter is one of several celebrities to profit from a partnership with an alcohol brand. Actor George Clooney co-founded Casamigos, a tequila brand, in 2013. It was purchased by beverage giant Diageo in 2017 for US$700 million. Last year, Diageo also scooped up Aviation American Gin, a brand co-owned by actor Ryan Reynolds, for US$610 million.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/john-travolta-selling-mansion-20-bedrooms-5-million-dollars-365196,Actor John Travolta selling oceanic mansion with 20 bedrooms for US$5m,"The Maine mansion that actor John Travolta shared with his late wife, actor Kelly Preston, has been put up for sale. The 67-year-old star of Grease and Saturday Night Fever recently listed the home on Islesboro, an island off the coast of Maine, for US$5 million (S$6.62 million), according to the Portland Press Herald. The couple bought the home in 1991 as newlyweds and turned it from a “very dark and somber” house into a bright family home for their soon-to-be-born son, Jett, according to a 1999 feature in Architectural Digest. Built in 1903, the 10,830 sq ft home has 20 bedrooms and sits on a 48-acre estate along the ocean. Travolta told Architectural Digest that he and Preston bought the home after visiting actor Kirstie Alley at her home on the island. The couple said they had always wanted a home big enough to entertain their dozens of family members. Preston, who had roles alongside Tom Cruise in Jerry Maguire and Arnold Schwarzenegger in Twins, died last year after a two-year battle with breast cancer. She was 57. Their first son, Jett, died in 2009 after suffering a seizure at the family's vacation home in the Bahamas. Travolta became a Hollywood star in the 1970s and was nominated for an acting Oscar for his 1977 performance in Saturday Night Fever. He was nominated again for his role in 1994's Pulp Fiction.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/will-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-divorce-remain-amicable-365856,"As power couple 'Kimye' becomes Kim and Kanye, will the split stay peaceful?","Initial signs suggest a smooth and amicable split between Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West. As “Kimye” becomes just Kim and Kanye with Kardashian filing for divorce on Friday (Feb 19) in Los Angeles Superior Court, they do so with a prenuptial agreement in place, independent fortunes and a desire to share time with their four young children. The presence of the prenup means the couple likely kept much of their property – hers earned through reality TV and channelling her celebrity into several lucrative business ventures, his earned through music and fashion – separate during their six and a half years of marriage. “Where rich, productive people are getting married, the prenup will usually say that ‘My income stays mine and your income stays yours,'"" said attorney Daniel Jaffe, a major player in Southern California's celebrity divorces for decades. ""So if, in fact, that’s the case, there won’t be any major property issues.” For the four children ranging in age from seven-year-old North to 21-month-old Psalm, Kardashian seeks joint custody in her divorce documents. That doesn't necessarily mean equal time or decision making for the nearly 16 years until all the kids are adults. “There's a lot of wiggle room in the space between joint custody,"" divorce attorney Reid Aronson said. “I know that I have cases where they say it’s joint custody, but that’s really just because the party that doesn’t really have custody doesn’t want to feel like they’re being excluded.” But Jaffe says in the vast majority of cases, at least legally, “each party is involved in making major decisions involving kids’ education, kids’ travel, kids’ religious upbringing”. Neither Jaffe nor Aronson is involved in this divorce. It will take at least six months by law for the couple to be declared divorced, but is likely to take longer to finalise given the finances and properties involved, even with an amicable split and a prenup. Custody of minor children is never final. It’s always changeable by the court, and the details are often worked out in separate legal processes long after the couple is declared divorced. Despite the signs of peace, divorces often turn sour as they progress. “I hear an amicable divorce when these things start all the time, and it just seems that for some reason something happens and it blows up,” Jaffe said. “The amicability has just been shattered by somebody doing something normally stupid and or their lawyers doing something totally stupid, which turns an amicable divorce into a crazy divorce.” Any sign of strife will be seized on by a media hungry for details in what was among the most followed unions of the 21st century, and the couple will have to fight to keep the split from playing out publicly, as much of the final year of their marriage did. Judges usually agree to keep details of finances and children's lives sealed from public scrutiny. And high-profile couples, including Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, have increasingly paid for private judges, keeping unpleasant details from becoming public. Kardashian's lawyer Laura Wasser, the most sought-after attorney for divorcing celebrities with a constant stream of A-list clients, has used private judges often. Yet strategic leaks can happen any time a client or their lawyer wants them, as has happened in the Pitt-Jolie divorce, which also got off to an amicable start but has dragged on with custody and child-support disputes. Such leaks are a key way for divorces to be derailed. “I would advise my clients to stay away from trying the case in the press, because that’s where it really gets complicated, because if somebody says something that they don’t like then the other person has to get back and respond,"" Jaffe said. ""So instead of doing this between lawyers or in a courtroom, what we have is an on Page Six where all the litigation is going to occur. And that’s not helpful to amicably resolve these cases.” (Source: AP) "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-lifestyle/attorneys-spar-over-powers-held-britney-spears-father-jamie-347416,"Attorneys spar over powers held by Britney Spears' father, Jamie","Attorneys for Britney Spears and her father sparred on Thursday (Feb 11) over how he should share power with a financial company newly appointed as his partner in the conservatorship that controls her money. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Brenda Penny overruled an objection of Jamie Spears' attorney, Vivian Lee Thoreen, who argued that he should not yield previously granted rights and powers while working with his new co-conservator, The Bessemer Trust. Thoreen had argued that the proposed order Britney Spears' court-appointed attorney Samuel Ingham III drafted to appoint the new co-conservator was “unclear and ambiguous by design” as he seeks to take authority away from Jamie Spears. Others of her objections to the order were sustained. In a statement to The Associated Press after the hearing, Thoreen said “the rulings show the court's confidence in our client Jamie Spears and Bessemer Trust to manage the conservatorship of Ms Spears estate together,” and said Jamie Spears “looks forward to working with Bessemer ... in the best interests of his daughter"". While the judge's decision can be seen as a minor victory for Britney Spears and Ingham, appointed by the court to speak directly for her in the conservatorship’s decisions, Ingham repeated that her goal is to have her father out entirely. “It is no secret that my client does not want her father as co-conservator,” Ingham said. “But we recognise that removal is a separate issue.” The judge declined Ingham's request to suspend Jamie Spears as conservator at a dramatic and contentious hearing in November, at which Ingham said that Britney Spears feared her father and refused to resume her career so long as he had power over it. Thoreen said the statements were inadmissible hearsay that did not reflect the reality of the situation. Penny instead appointed the Bessemer Trust as a co-conservator, leading to the current fight over power-sharing. Thursday's hearing was more technical and less emotional than November's hearing. The hearing came in the wake of the release of the FX and Hulu documentary The New York Times Presents: Framing Britney. The documentary has few new revelations. But its historical look at the circumstances that led to the establishment of the conservatorship in 2008 have spurred sympathy for Britney Spears and brought greater attention to the case and the so-called #FreeBritney movement of fans who want to see her released and given control of her life. Those fans increasingly include celebrities. Many including Bette Midler tweeted the #FreeBritney hashtag after the documentary aired. Miley Cyrus shouted “We love Britney!” during her pre-Super Bowl performance Sunday. Pitbull, at a Hollywood news conference on Thursday, said, “as far as what’s going on with Britney, that’s been going on for many, many, many years. Hopefully, they can break this cycle. And hopefully she gets a chance to control her own destiny.” The #FreeBritney protesters, some of whom were interviewed in the documentary, were chanting and holding signs at the downtown LA courthouse on Thursday. Thoreen defended the work of the conservatorship. “From the beginning, the court has closely monitored Britney's situation,"" her statement to the AP said, ""including annual accountings and in-depth reviews from a highly experienced and dedicated court investigator.” At Thursday’s hearing, Thoreen emphasised that Britney Spears asked for and approved of her father’s role as recently as 2019. “Ms Spears reflected in court papers that she wanted her father to be the sole conservator of her estate,” Thoreen said. Jamie Spears has repeatedly emphasised the need for the conservatorship in order to protect his daughter from those who would, or already have, preyed on her. “My client Jamie Spears has diligently and professionally carried out his duties as one of Britney's conservators,” Thoreen's statement said, “and his love for his daughter and dedication to protecting her is clearly apparent to the court”. Britney Spears did not take part in part in the hearing. She rarely appears in court. Now 39 and the mother of two sons, she has not performed, recorded music or made media appearances since declaring a career hiatus early in 2019. On her Twitter and Instagram accounts Tuesday, she shared a video of a performance from three years earlier with the caption, “I’ll always love being on stage …. But I am taking the time to learn and be a normal person ….. I love simply enjoying the basics of every day life !!!!” (Source: AP) "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/chick-corea-jazz-great-dies-at-79-347691,"Chick Corea, jazz great with 23 Grammy Awards, dies of cancer at 79","Chick Corea, a towering jazz pianist with a staggering 23 Grammy Awards who pushed the boundaries of the genre and worked alongside Miles Davis and Herbie Hancock, has died. He was 79. Corea died on Tuesday (Feb 9) of a rare form of cancer, his team posted on his website. His death was confirmed by Corea's web and marketing manager, Dan Muse. On his Facebook page, Corea left a message to his fans: “I want to thank all of those along my journey who have helped keep the music fires burning bright. It is my hope that those who have an inkling to play, write, perform or otherwise, do so. If not for yourself then for the rest of us. It’s not only that the world needs more artists, it’s also just a lot of fun.” A prolific artiste with dozens of albums, Corea in 1968 replaced Herbie Hancock in Miles Davis’ group, playing on the landmark albums In A Silent Way and Bitches Brew. He formed his own avant-garde group, Circle, and then founded Return to Forever. He’s worked on many other projects, including duos with Hancock and vibraphonist Gary Burton. He recorded and performed classical music, standards, solo originals, Latin jazz and tributes to great jazz pianists. He was named a National Endowment of the Arts Jazz Master in 2006. He was a member of the Church of Scientology and lived in Clearwater, Florida. In addition to his Grammy wins, Corea also had four Latin Grammy wins. In a tweet, the Latin Recording Academy called him “a virtuosic pianist and one of the most prominent Latin jazz musicians of all times”. The Blue Note jazz club simply called him “irreplaceable”. Drummer Sheila E took to Twitter to mourn. “This man changed my life thru his music and we were able to play together many times. I was very fortunate to call him my family,” she wrote “Chick, you are missed dearly, your music and brilliant light will live on forever.” Hip-hop star Q-Tip called Corea “one of the coldest pianist/keyboardist/songwriters of all time” and rapper Biz Markie celebrated Corea's 1972 jazz fusion group Return to Forever, calling it “fossil fuel for an eternity of rap samples”. Last year, Corea released the double album Plays, which captured him solo at various concerts armed simply with his piano. “Like a runner loves to run because it just feels good, I like to play the piano just because it feels good,” he told The Associated Press at the time. “I can just switch gears and go to another direction or go to another song or whatever I want to do. So it’s a constant experiment.” The double album was a peek into Corea’s musical heart, containing songs he wrote about the innocence of children decades ago as well as tunes by Mozart, Thelonious Monk and Stevie Wonder, among others. Corea is the artiste with the most jazz Grammys in the show’s 63-year history, and he has a chance to posthumously win at the Mar 14 show, where he’s nominated for best improvised jazz solo for All Blues and best jazz instrumental album for Trilogy 2. Cores was born in Massachusetts and began piano lessons at four. But he bristled at formal education and dropped out of both Columbia University and the Juilliard School. He began his career as a sideman. Corea liked inviting volunteers onto the stage during solo concerts, sitting them down near his piano and creating spontaneous, entirely subjective tone poems about the person. “It starts as a game – to try to capture something I see in music,” he told the AP. “While I play, I look at them a couple of times like a painter would. I try to see if, while I’m playing, are they agreeing with what I’m playing? Do they think that this is really a portrait of them? And usually they do.” Late last year, Corea was working two commissions: A trombone concerto for the New York Philharmonic and a percussion concerto for the Philadelphia Orchestra. “I get interested in something and then I follow that interest. And that’s how my music comes out,” he said then. “I’ve always followed my interest. It’s been my successful way of living.” He’s also started teaching online, creating the Chick Corea Academy to offer his views on music and share the opinions of others, take questions and chat with guests. He hopes his students will explore their freedom of expression and think for themselves. “Does everyone have to like what I like? No. And it’s what makes the world go around that we all have different likes,” he told the AP. “We come together and we collaborate.” Corea is survived by his wife, Gayle Moran, and a son Thaddeus. Béla Fleck, a virtuoso on the banjo, who recorded and toured with Corea, called him “my hero, mentor and friend,” adding “The world has lost one of the great ones. I’m so honoured to have known him.” (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/joss-whedon-faces-abuse-claims-buffy-charisma-carpenter-345016,"Film, TV maker Joss Whedon faces abuse claims from Buffy The Vampire Slayer stars","Prominent film and TV creator Joss Whedon, who faced a claim of abusive behaviour on the set of Justice League, drew criticism on Wednesday (Feb 10) from actors who worked with him on Buffy The Vampire Slayer. The first and most direct allegations came from Charisma Carpenter, who said in a social media post that Whedon has a “history of creating toxic and hostile work environments”, including the one she experienced on Buffy and while she was pregnant. Sarah Michelle Gellar, who starred as the title character on the 1997 to 2003 series, responded to Carpenter’s post with a supportive if opaque online message of her own. “While I am proud to have my name associated with Buffy Summers, I don’t want to be forever associated with the name Joss Whedon,” Gellar wrote. She is focused on her family and the pandemic and planned no further statements at this time, she said, adding, “I stand with all survivors of abuse and am proud of them for speaking out”. Representatives for Whedon didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from the writer, director and producer. Among Carpenter’s allegations: During her pregnancy, Whedon called her “fat”, joked about firing her and, at one point, called her into a meeting during which he allegedly asked if she was “going to keep it”, apparently a reference to her pregnancy, and attacked her character and religion. She said she was “unceremoniously fired” from the role of Cordelia the following season. Michelle Trachtenberg, who played Gellar’s sister, went on social media to thank Gellar. “I am brave enough now as a 35 year old woman….To repost this,” she wrote, and alluded to “his not appropriate behavior” she experienced as a teenage actor. Amber Benson, who appeared as Tara on Buffy The Vampire Slayer, also responded to the allegations, saying in a post that the show had a “toxic environment” that started “from the top”. In her post, Carpenter said she was prompted to come forward after actor Ray Fisher, who was in 2017’s Justice League as the character Cyborg, alleged last July that Whedon’s behaviour toward the cast and crew was “abusive, unprofessional and unacceptable”. Whedon, known for his writing and directing on the first two Marvel Avengers movies, was brought in during post-production on Justice League. He oversaw extensive reshoots, editing and visual effects on the film for director Zack Snyder, who had stepped aside after the death of his daughter. Fisher said Whedon’s behaviour was enabled by Geoff Johns and Jon Berg, two producers on the film who were executives running DC Films for Warner Bros at the time. Berg left the studio in 2017. Parent company WarnerMedia launched investigations into the accusations, which concluded in December. The company said then that “remedial action” had been taken, but did not go into specifics. Fisher has continued tweeting about the matter, turning his focus to DC Films President Walter Hamada, who he accused of undermining the investigation and not taking his claims seriously. Last month his character Cyborg was removed from appearing in the upcoming Flash film, which Carpenter said was the last straw for her. In its January statement, WarnerMedia said Fisher was offered the chance to return as Cyborg, but given his statement “that he will not participate in any film associated with Mr. Hamada, our production is now moving on”.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/gina-carano-mandalorian-cara-dune-fired-344586,Actress Gina Carano fired from Star Wars series Mandalorian after social media post,"Lucasfilm says Gina Carano is no longer a part of The Mandalorian cast after many online called for her firing over a social media post that likened the experience of Jews during the Holocaust to the US political climate. A spokesperson with the production company said in a statement on Wednesday (Feb 11) that Carano is not currently employed by Lucasfilm with “no plans for her to be in the future"". “Nevertheless, her social media posts denigrating people based on their cultural and religious identities are abhorrent and unacceptable,"" the statement read. Carano fell under heavy criticism after she posted that “Jews were beaten in the streets, not by Nazi soldiers but by their neighbors.... even by children"". The actor continued to say, “Because history is edited, most people today don’t realize that to get to the point where Nazi soldiers could easily round up thousands of Jews, the government first made their own neighbors hate them simply for being Jews. How is that any different from hating someone for their political views?” Carano, who played the recurring character Cara Dune on the Star Wars series, deleted the post but it was widely shared online and spurred the #FireGinaCarano hashtag to trend. Her character appeared in several episodes of the second season of The Mandalorian, a series about a bounty hunter and his quest to unite a powerful, young user of the Force with a Jedi Knight. Dune, who in the second season is a lawperson on a frontier planet, frequently teams up with the title character to fight an old nemesis: remnants of the evil Galactic Empire. Carano, a former mixed martial artist whose Dune character used a mix of heavy weapons and her fists to best opponents, had been criticised for social media posts that mocked mask wearing during the pandemic and voter fraud during the 2020 presidential election. She also mocked the use of gender pronouns, listing “beep/bop/boop"" in her social media bio. (Source: AP) "

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/wizard-of-oz-remake-planned-watchmen-director-nicole-kassell-342491,'Profoundly iconic shoes to fill': Wizard Of Oz remake planned with Watchmen director,"Are we off to see the wizard, the Wonderful Wizard of Oz – again? New Line Cinema is making a new adaptation of The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz, L Frank Baum children’s novel, with Nicole Kassell, the visual architect of Watchmen, set to direct.  Baum's 1900 novel, now in the public domain, has spawned many adaptations over the years – most famously, of course, the 1939 MGM musical by Victor Fleming and starring Judy Garland. Kassell's version will not be a musical. New Line said it will be a “fresh take” and a “reimagining” of The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz. It will have some advantages, too, since Warner Bros owns New Line and the 1939 film. That means it can use some trademarked elements like the ruby slippers. “While the 1939 musical is part of my DNA, I am exhilarated and humbled by the responsibility of re-imagining such a legendary tale,"" said Kassell in a statement. ""The opportunity to examine the original themes – the quest for courage, love, wisdom and home – feels more timely and urgent than ever. These are profoundly iconic shoes to fill, and I am eager to dance alongside these heroes of my childhood as we pave a newly minted yellow brick road!” Kassell is an executive producer of HBO's Watchmen and directed three of its nine episodes, including the pilot. She has worked primarily in television but directed the feature films The Woodsman (2014) and A Little Bit Of Heaven (2004). The most recent Wizard Of Oz film came from the Walt Disney Co's Oz The Great And Powerful in 2013. Directed by Sam Raimi and starring James Franco, it was set 20 years before the events of the 1939 classic. (Source: AP) "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/k-pop-stars-eric-nam-jae-day6-promote-mental-health-awareness-338191,"Korean American K-pop stars Eric Nam, Jae from Day6 promote mental health awareness","K-pop star Eric Nam was having a meeting in New York when he suddenly felt a pain in his chest. “I thought I was going to have to call 911,” he said, recounting the experience from 2019. But instead he remained sitting and “had to quietly breathe my way” through the meeting, he said. Similarly, Jae-hyung Park, better known as Jae from K-pop band Day6, was in a cab returning from a music video shoot in Seoul last year when he experienced what felt like a heart attack. At first, he put it down to stress, saying that for years he had dealt with “out of place” and “weird"" feelings. But he realised he couldn't ignore the symptoms, and in the “calmest voice” asked the driver to take him to a nearby hospital. “I’m ... feeling like I am going to die, I am going to die, I am going to die,” he recounted. Park and Nam said they later found out they had suffered panic attacks. Many recording artistes struggle to cope with the trappings of fame. In South Korea, as in many cultures, talking about mental health issues is seen as taboo, causing K-pop stars to grapple with depression and mental illness on their own. Nam and Park have joined other Korean American K-pop artistes in raising awareness about mental health beyond the K-pop community by publicly sharing their personal journeys. Nam moved from his hometown, Atlanta, to Seoul in 2011 and launched his music career after competing on a Korean music television show. A Boston College graduate, Nam said the racism he endured growing up in suburban Georgia left deep scars on him. He explains he was bullied and even spat on by a classmate. “It was one of the most degrading, embarrassing, infuriating moments of my life up until that point,” Nam recounts on the first episode of MINDSET, a paid podcast series he's just launched to promote conversations about mental health and wellness. “And I think still to this day that is a topic that I never feel comfortable speaking out about.” Nam said he also struggled with an identity crisis as a Korean American, being treated as an outsider in both South Korea and the US. “It felt like I didn’t belong anywhere,” he told The Associated Press. Park, born and raised in California, said he had difficulty navigating between two vastly different cultures. And the intense competition in the industry also affected his mental health. “It’s a dog-eat-dog world,” Park said of K-pop. Park was offered counselling from his record label, JYP Entertainment, but said he found it difficult to connect with his therapist and eventually took a break from his career last year, when his band went on a hiatus. He took part in Nam's podcast series as a celebrity speaker. Nam is hoping the shows can address stereotypes and stigmas surrounding mental illness. “I never thought that I would need, I would want to talk to somebody about my mental health,"" Nam said. ""But once you’re in that position, I just didn’t know really how to deal with it. And so I remember those very isolating kinds of moments that I had had earlier on in my career.” (Source: AP)"

The assault case is one of three recent ones that targeted seniors in the Chinatown district. Kim posted a video of the assault on Instagram on Friday (Feb 5) that showed the man suddenly being pushed to the ground while he was walking, by a suspect wearing a black hoodie and mask. The caption read: “The number of hate crimes against Asian Americans continues to skyrocket, despite our repeated pleas for help. The crimes are too often ignored and even excused”. The Korean-American actor known for his roles in TV shows Lost and Hawaii Five-O added that he and Chinese-American actor Daniel Wu are offering the reward “for information leading to the arrest and conviction of this man and his accomplices” as well as for the two other assault cases. “We must do more to help the literally thousands of Americans who have suffered at the hands of this absolutely senseless violence.” He included hashtags with the names of past victims – #VincentChin and #VichaRatanapakdee. The latter, who was 84, died late last month in San Francisco after being attacked during a walk. According to NBC Bay Area, a person of interest in the three recent assaults has been identified and had been in custody on unrelated charges since Feb 1. The outlet also reported earlier that more than 20 attacks against the Asian community have taken place recently. This isn’t the first time that Wu has offered a reward in order to catch a criminal. The Tomb Raider star offered US$15,000 in August last year for information on an assault on a 90-year-old woman. Two teenagers were later arrested for the crime."

Apparently he and his love interest, Kim (played by Winona Ryder), had a son together – and he’s played by none other than Timothée Chalamet. At least, that’s the premise of a new advertisement that ran during the Super Bowl on Sunday (Feb 7). Ryder narrates at the start of the clip: ""This is the story of a boy with scissors for hands. No, not that one”. Edgar Scissorhands is finding it hard to fit in the world that’s not made for people with scissors for hands – not unlike his father’s own struggles in the Tim Burton-directed movie. Among other mishaps, he gets snagged in a fence and punctures a football during a game with friends. However, he’s very good at making fancy, off-menu sandwiches in a deli. There is another thing that he doesn’t have trouble doing – driving a Cadillac because the car comes equipped with driver-assistance technology. As you can already guess by now, this is a car ad. Director Burton himself approved the concept for the ad. ""It’s rare when a work you’re proud of continues to live on and evolve with the times, even after 30 years.

Corden’s popular segment, a part of his late night talk show, sees famous guests sitting in a car with him as they sing along to songs on the radio. However, this being pandemic times, the two were spotted filming in an open-top double-decker bus on Friday (Feb 5). A source told People magazine that the pair, who are longtime friends, “had a great time”. 
  ""They taped a COVID(-19) appropriate segment of Carpool Karaoke on the double decker. They have been friends for years and had a great time. A lot of joking around and laughter.""  ""They toured Hollywood and James showed Harry some special landmarks. They also chatted about Harry's life in the US and his focus now,"" added the source. Harry’s wife, Meghan Markle, was not present at the shoot. The couple now live in Montecito, California. Previous Carpool Karaoke guests have included K-pop super group BTS and singer Justin Bieber."

The 40-year-old Hong Kong actress, who is a participant in the Chinese variety show Sisters Who Make Waves 2, told her fellow contestants during a recent episode that she feels “very happy” when she reads comments about her being old or out of date. She explained: “You say I’m passé, that means I was once in demand. So I think people should work hard. Be yourself when the time is wrong, and seize opportunities when the time is right”. Her attitude seems to come from her strong sense of self. Cheung said that she doesn’t doubt herself. “In this line of work, without confidence, it doesn’t matter how hard you work, or how brilliant and beautiful you are, it’s no use.” The second season of the popular reality TV competition sees veteran female artistes competing for a spot in a new girl group. Cheung’s fellow contestants this season include singer Na Ying and actresses Jin Qiaoqiao, Cheng Lisa and Dong Xuan. The first season saw the seven winners forming girl group X-Sister, which has since disbanded after one of the members, actress Ning Jing, pulled out as she didn’t have to energy to keep up."

A representative from Sublime Artist Agency confirmed on Friday (Feb 8) that the 38-year-old singer-actor is in talks to appear in a TV drama and things are looking “favourable”, as reported by Soompi. The show in question is Ghost Doctor, which will mix medical drama with, um, ghosts. Boo Sung-chul, who is known for hit TV shows Heirs and Jang Ok Jung, Lives In Love, will be the producing director, with Kim Eun-hee (Live Up To Your Name) writing the script. Once Rain, whose real name is Jung Ji-hoon, firms up the deal, it will be his first starring role in a TV series since 2019’s Welcome 2 Life. He’s appeared in many other hits throughout his long career, including Full House in 2004, A Love To Kill in 2005 and My Lovely Girl in 2014. Ghost Doctor, which is a literal translation, is scheduled to air in the second half of this year."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/donald-trump-resigns-from-screen-actors-guild-322876,'You have done nothing for me': Donald Trump resigns from Screen Actors Guild,"Donald Trump has resigned from the Screen Actors Guild after the union threatened to expel him for his role in the Capitol riot in January. In a letter dated Thursday (Feb 4) and addressed to SAG-AFTRA president Gabrielle Carteris, Trump said he was resigning from the union that he had been a member of since 1989. “I no longer wish to be associated with your union,” wrote Trump in a letter shared by the actors guild. “As such, this letter is to inform you of my immediate resignation from SAG-AFTRA. You have done nothing for me."" The guild responded with a short statement: “Thank you"". Last month, the SAG-AFTRA board voted that there was probable cause that Trump violated its guidelines for membership by his role in the Jan 6 Capitol siege. Trump, the guild said, had sustained ""a reckless campaign of misinformation aimed at discrediting and ultimately threatening the safety of journalists, many of whom are SAG-AFTRA members”. Trump's case was to be weighed by a disciplinary committee. In his letter, the former president said he had no interest in such a hearing. “Who cares!” he wrote. “While I’m not familiar with your work, I’m very proud of my work on movies such as Home Alone 2, Zoolander and Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps; and television shows including The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air, Saturday Night Live, and of course, one of the most successful shows in television history, The Apprentice – to name just a few!” wrote Trump. “I’ve also greatly helped the cable news television business (said to be a dying platform with not much time left until I got involved in politics), and created thousands of jobs at networks such as MSDNC and Fake News CNN, among many others,"" Trump continued. On Thursday, the Screen Actors Guild announced nominees to its annual awards. Losing guild membership doesn’t disqualify anyone from performing. But most major productions abide by union contracts and hire only union actors. (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/snoopy-shines-in-apple-tv-series-that-s-true-to-its-roots-303441,Who's a good boy? Snoopy shines in Apple TV+ series that's true to its roots,"Peanuts star Snoopy is famous for being a highly imaginative dog, liable to go off on loony flights of fancy. But, it turns out, his world has some strict rules. No adults can be heard there, just trombones. No technology past the 1970s can be used. And under no circumstances may the inside of Snoopy's doghouse ever be shown. Creators of the new animated series The Snoopy Show had to learn and respect all the rules as they crafted stories for Apple TV+ that were true to the original strips and various previous shows. ""I think the rules have actually made the story so much stronger, to go, 'How do we play in the sandbox?'"" says Stephanie Betts, an executive vice president at media company WildBrain. ""And actually, we realised it was so much wider than you can even imagine.""  The series, which debuts Friday (Feb 5), consists of three seven-minute vignettes per 23-minute episode. They are mined from the almost 18,000 strips cartoonist Charles M Schulz left behind.  It's an enchanting and endearing show; we see Charlie Brown overcoming his nerves at speaking in front of his class, and an epic game of tag between Snoopy and Rerun that leads to mild injuries and laughter. Adults will recognise the classic visual style and the world they read as kids: Kites still get eaten by trees, Lucy's psychiatric booth still costs 5 cents and Snoopy keeps flying missions on his doghouse. ""There's something to the timelessness of Charles Schulz's drawings,"" said Mark Evestaff, showrunner and an executive producer. ""I feel like this is the kind of show that we need now."" The series' writers were each given a large red volume – nicknamed ""the Snoopy Bible"" – that contained Snoopy-centric strips, and were told to use them for inspiration. ""It was like, 'How do you build on what he was trying to tell the audience in four strips?' We get seven minutes,"" said Betts.  If the writers were intimidated, so were the artists, many of whom revere Peanuts. ""One of our storyboard artists would get nervous every time they had to draw Lucy's psychiatry booth, just because it was this heritage thing and there's so much weight. Everyone's a little bit terrified,"" said Evestaff. One obstacle was that Woodstock and Snoopy in the strip communicate their feelings through thought bubbles, something that doesn't work in a show.  That meant the artists had to rely on sounds, pantomime and a variety of expressions for the two characters, who yelp, cry, titter and gulp with powerful emotion. They're aided by a jazzy score by Jeff Morrow. The Snoopy Show is a refreshing addition to a children's TV landscape that is full of superheroes and cute shows where resolutions are predetermined. The world of Peanuts, on the other hand, explores failure and frustration. ""We do have these characters that have real problems and things don't always work out. And they deal with issues of rejection and failure. Those are things that our kids deal with, too,"" said Evestaff. ""I think if you were to pitch a show like this today, it would be a very difficult sell.""  The show still allows Snoopy to have his heroic flights of fancy – becoming the famed arm-wrestler Masked Marvel, hipster Joe Cool or the dogged World War I Flying Ace behind enemy lines. ""Charles Schulz always said he felt most like Charlie Brown – he couldn't always kick the football, he wasn't always the winner. So Snoopy gave that outlet to dream a little bigger,"" said Betts.  Peanuts made its debut Oct 2, 1950. The travails of the ""little round-headed kid"" Charlie Brown and his pals eventually ran in more than 2,600 newspapers, reaching millions of readers in 75 countries.  Other Peanuts projects that have been launched by Apple TV+ include Snoopy In Space and Peanuts In Space: Secrets Of Apollo 10, both of which were nominated for Daytime Emmy Awards, with the latter winning. One of the more intriguing aspects of The Snoopy Show is that it shows the first time Charlie Brown met Snoopy, as well as the first time the beagle ever encountered Woodstock.  Snoopy is shown as a lonely puppy inside a barn – the last of the litter to be adopted – when Charlie Brown walks in and hands him a bone, telling him they're going to be best friends.  But the Snoopy-Woodstock introduction is anything but meet-cute. The original strip showed the bird falling onto Snoopy's lap; the series shows a tense and competitive meeting that eventually ends in friendship. The rules of the show – no cellphones, computers or adult human voices – keeps the kids in their hermetic world and forces them to make their own decisions.  As for the inside of Snoopy's doghouse – from which he drags out a pool table, a Vincent van Gogh painting and a swimming pool, among other massive items – leaving it unseen keeps imaginations wild. ""It makes the writers, the directors and all the artists have to be a little bit more clever in terms of how they approach a scene,"" said Evestaff. ""I think it makes for a stronger show.""

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/country-singer-morgan-wallen-racial-slur-apologise-304881,Country singer Morgan Wallen's music pulled from streaming services after racial slur,"Country star Morgan Wallen has been suspended indefinitely from his label and seen his music pulled by radio stations and streaming services on Wednesday (Feb 3) after video surfaced of him shouting a racial slur. Big Loud Records said in a statement that Wallen's contract has been suspended indefinitely. Republic Records, which he is co-signed to, said it agreed with Big Loud's decision and said “such behaviour will not be tolerated.” The video, which was first published by TMZ on Tuesday night, showed Wallen outside a home in Nashville, Tennessee, yelling profanities and a racial slur. Wallen said in a statement to TMZ that he is embarrassed and sorry. “I used an unacceptable and inappropriate racial slur that I wish I could take back. There are no excuses to use this type of language, ever. I want to sincerely apologise for using the word. I promise to do better,” his statement said. He’s one of the genre’s biggest young stars. His sophomore album, Dangerous: The Double Album, is spending its third week atop the Billboard 200 chart and it has set several streaming records, even besting the recent release from country star Luke Combs. Wallen is also one of the few country acts to score a Top 10 hit on the pop charts, thanks to the success of 7 Summers and Wasted On You. But the fall from the top has been swift. “In light of Morgan Wallen’s recent actions involving the use of a racial slur, we have made the decision to remove his music and content from our stations effective immediately,” according to a statement from iHeartMedia, which has hundreds of radio stations across the country. The Academy of Country Music, which is currently taking nominations for their annual awards show in April, said in a statement they would “halt” Wallen's eligibility for this year's show and will also be reviewing the awards eligibility and submission process. “The Academy does not condone or support intolerance or behaviour that does not align with our commitment and dedication to diversity and inclusion,” the ACM statement said. As of Wednesday morning, streaming apps like Spotify and Apple Music don't have his songs in their most popular country music playlists, where normally Wallen had multiple songs from his new album. SiriusXM and Pandora also removed his music from their playlists, according to a spokesman for SiriusXM. The music television channel CMT said it was removing his appearances from all its platforms. The Tennessee-born singer who has hits with songs like Whiskey Glasses and Up Down featuring Florida Georgia Line, has done a lot of public apologizing lately. Wallen was arrested for public intoxication and disorderly conduct in May 2020 after getting kicked out of a downtown Nashville bar. In October, Saturday Night Live dropped him from a scheduled performance on their show after he violated COVID-19 protocols when videos appeared on social media of him partying with fans in Alabama. He was later invited back on the show in December, where he appeared in a skit making fun of himself. Other country stars criticised his actions publicly. “It actually IS representative of our town because this isn’t his first ‘scuffle’ and he just demolished a huge streaming record last month regardless,” tweeted country star Maren Morris. “We all know it wasn’t his first time using that word. We keep them rich and protected at all costs with no recourse.” Other music stars have faced backlash for using racial slurs or derogatory language. Justin Bieber apologised in 2014 for using a racial slur joke in a video from when he was a teenager. In the past, country radio has sometimes ignored offensive behaviour by male stars, even as female artistes like the Chicks, formerly known as the Dixie Chicks, were removed from radio for criticising the US president. Country star Jason Aldean wore blackface for a Halloween costume in 2015, but never issued an apology, and he remains one of the top selling country artists. Marcus K Dowling, a music journalist who has written about Wallen, said the country music industry has experienced a reckoning in the last eight months prompted by the Black Lives Matter movement that has had an effect on the industry's reaction to Wallen's words. “I feel like it set a trip cord that never existed in country music for racial behaviour,” said Dowling. “It was inarguably the black people who work and occupy space in the genre who set that boundary. And any artist, even an artist who has sold well and has over 500 million streams in three weeks, if they cross that line, they were going to be impacted."" (Source: AP)"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/angelica-lee-twin-sons-read-waldorf-education-method-1975531,Actress Angelica Lee thinks her sons don’t need to learn to read until they’re 7,"Actress Angelica Lee caused quite a stir recently when she told Taiwanese media that her twin four-year-old boys will only be taught how to read when they’re seven years old. Given that many parents want their children to be able to read as early as possible, this came as a surprise to netizens, some of whom think the children will face a huge culture shock when they eventually start school. 
   A post shared by SinJe Lee 李心洁 (@sinjelee1234) Lee and her husband, Hong Kong director Oxide Pang, adopt the Waldorf Education method when it comes to teaching their children. The nature-based curriculum prioritises outdoor play and learning. Lee, who is 45, also doesn’t allow her kids to use electronic devices. She shared her thoughts on parenting during the interview with Apple Daily Taiwan. She said that she doesn’t believe in controlling or disciplining her children. “The role of parents is to guide our children while they grow up, and their happiness is the most important,” she said. The Waldorf method doesn’t require kids to read before they turn seven. Instead, kids are encouraged to draw, paint and learn music, as well as practical tasks such as cleaning and gardening. Lee added: ""Play time is very important for children. While I was growing up, I was a happy child because I had enough time to play. My home was surrounded by rice fields and my days were spent climbing trees and catching fish. Being surrounded by nature gave me a lot of positive energy”."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/emma-maembong-hateful-comments-photo-breast-milk-pump-1975536,Malaysian actress Emma Maembong slammed for photo of breast pump in public,"Keyboard warriors were out in full force when Malaysian actress Emma Maembong posted a photo of herself on Instagram on Friday (Jan 29) out and about with a hands-free breast pump attached to her jeans.  Some commenters were unhappy with the new mum's choice of accessories and made their thoughts known. So much so that she had to turn off the comments section on the post. According to Malay Mail, many of the comments were positive although there were some unkind ones. One commenter said Emma should be ""ashamed"" of pumping her breast milk in public while another said she was being a “bad influence”. Elsewhere online, other commenters have said that she needn’t have done that in public and that it was “disrespectful”. The 29-year-old actress, whose real name is Fatimah Rohani Ismail, hasn’t addressed the controversy although her sister, Beby Maembong, has spoken up. Beby shared her thoughts on the matter on IG stories, calling the naysayers “dirty-minded”. She said: “There are dirty-minded people in Emma’s comments calling her shameless and saying that she’s showing off how she pumps her breast milk. The people leaving these comments must be childless or false religious teachers”. Beby also pointed out that there was nothing wrong with Emma’s photo as she wasn’t revealing her body. Emma and her husband, Muhammad Shazli Azhar, made the news last month after they tested positive for COVID-19. The actress said she showed no symptoms at all. The couple have a three-month-old son, Shariq Gabriel.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/dolly-parton-super-bowl-covid-19-vaccination-donation-301991,Singer Dolly Parton on why she hasn't got her COVID-19 vaccination yet,"Dolly Parton has been singing about everyday office employees working 9 To 5 for over 40 years, but now the country icon is singing about entrepreneurs working “5 to 9” to pursue their dreams after hours. The Grammy-winning legend's 1980s hit has been flipped by Squarespace – a company that helps users build and host their own websites – for a Super Bowl commercial debuting on Tuesday (Feb 2). Oscar winner Damien Chazelle of La La Land fame directed the spot. “A lot of people through the years have wanted to change the lyrics to fit certain things they’re doing. I really thought that was a wonderful thing, especially for Squarespace. They’re so into people, new entrepreneurs working after hours to start their own businesses,” Parton said. “‘5 to 9’ seemed to be a perfect thing when they pitched it.” Parton is using Squarespace to create a website for her new perfume, DollyFragrance.com. The singer, who is also an actor, producer, humanitarian and more, said she can relate to businesspeople working around the clock to fulfill their goals. “Well I work 365 (days a year). I’m always working 5 to 9, 9 to 5. I work all hours of the night and day,” she said. “Whatever you need to do, you gotta get it done, however many hours it takes.” In an interview with The Associated Press, Parton talked about flipping 9 to 5, being a part of this year’s Super Bowl, donating US$1 million to coronavirus research and remembering her brother Randy Parton, who died last month. Answers have been edited for length and clarity. ARE YOU EXCITED TO BE PART OF THIS YEAR'S SUPER BOWL?  Parton: I’ve been asked several times to be part of that. It’s always such a big commitment. I’ve always kind of chickened out. I know it’s just a big commitment. If you do good, you do great. If you do bad, you do bad in front of all those people. This seemed like the perfect kind of way to do it. WHAT WAS IT LIKE WRITING 9 TO 5 OVER 40 YEARS AGO?  That song just stays so true to people that get out – you get up in the morning, you wobble into the kitchen, you pour your coffee, you try to get your butt going, you try to get up and get to work knowing that you’ve got to do it. I’m really happy. This is the 40th anniversary of 9 to 5 since the movie came out. We’re celebrating, so this could not have happened at a better time. YOU DONATED US$1 MILLION TO CORONAVIRUS RESEARCH – WHAT COMPELLED YOU TO DO THAT?  Well, I follow my heart. I’m a person of faith and I pray all the time that God will lead me into the right direction and let me know what to do. When the pandemic first hit, that was my first thought, “I need to do something to try to help find a vaccination."" I just did some research with the people at Vanderbilt (University) – they’re wonderful people, they’ve been so good through the years to my people in times of illness and all that. I just asked if I could donate a million dollars to the research for a vaccine. I get a lot more credit than I deserve I think, but I was just happy to be a part of any and all of that. HAVE YOU GOTTEN YOUR SHOT?  No. I’m not going to get mine until some more people get theirs. I don’t want it to look like I’m jumping the line just because I donated money. I’m very funny about that. I’m going to get mine though, but I’m going to wait. I’m at the age where I could have gotten mine legally last week. I turned 75. I was going to do it on my birthday, and I thought, “Nah, don’t do that.” You’ll look like you’re just doing a show. None of my work is really like that. I wasn’t doing it for a show. I’m going to get mine. I want it. I’m going to get it. When I get it, I’ll probably do it on camera so people will know and I’ll tell them the truth, if I have symptoms and all that. Hopefully it’ll encourage people. I’m not going to jump the line just because I could. HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE 75?  Well I plan to be around a lot longer. I don’t have no plans of slowing down because the number says I should. I don’t pay attention to that. I wake up with new dreams every day. I try to make the most of every year that I’ve lived. I’ve been doing that since I was little. I’ll be doing it until I keel over. Hopefully that won’t be anytime soon. YOUR BROTHER RANDY RECENTLY DIED FROM CANCER. HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?  Well, we’re heartbroken. We loved him so much. He fought really hard for the last year. Randy was a wonderful artist, entertainer. He was very dear to me. He was one of my younger brothers. I lost my baby brother last year, around the same time of the year. This was really a double whammy for all of us. There’s a certain kind of peace that comes from knowing that he is at peace, and he was suffering, and we didn’t like that. He is dearly loved. You just go around with a hole in your heart and a knot in your stomach. You just think of him, love him, try to keep your precious memories. You have to go on. We’re a close family, so we’re supporting each other. (Source: AP) "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/golden-globes-nominations-2021-netflix-301486,"Golden Globes nominations: Netflix films, TV shows could lead the pack again","Whether anyone will be attending the Golden Globes in person remains uncertain and improbable. But nominations to the 78th Globes will be announced on Wednesday (Feb 3), nevertheless. Hollywood's strange and largely virtual awards season lacks the usual kind of buzz and red-carpet glamour that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) annually feasts on. More than perhaps any other award show, the Globes depend on a cavalcade of stars – something that won't materialise when the awards are handed out Feb 28 in a ceremony hosted by Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. Nominations will be announced virtually at 8.35 am ET on Wednesday (9.35pm Singapore time) by presenters Sarah Jessica Parker and Taraji P Henson. They will reveal 12 categories on NBC's Today show, with full nominees announced live on E! digital channels and the Golden Globes' website. Without any in-person screenings or photo ops with stars, little is known about how the roughly 90 member press association – a notoriously unpredictable group, in normal times – is swaying this year. But one thing may be a lock: Netflix will land a whole lot of nominations. Several of the streaming service's films – including Spike Lee's Da 5 Bloods, David Fincher's Mank and Aaron Sorkin's The Trial Of The Chicago 7 – are considered frontrunners, as are Netflix TV series The Crown and Ozark. At last year's Globes, Netflix also led all studios with 34 nominations. Also widely expected to be nominated Wednesday are Chloe Zhao's Nomadland, with Frances McDormand; Regina King's directorial debut One Night In Miami; and George C Wolfe's August Wilson adaptation Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, with Viola Davis and the late Chadwick Boseman all but assured of nods. The Globes' splitting of nominees between drama and comedy/musical could also mean one wildcard of the season – Borat Subsequent Moviefilm – may emerge. The film could be nominated for best feature, comedy or musical, along with acting nods for Sacha Baron Cohen (also a contender for his supporting performance in The Trial Of The Chicago 7) and Maria Bakalova. Also of note in the category: the Hamilton film, ineligible for the Academy Awards, is a likely nominee at the Globes. In the television categories, expect The Mandalorian, The Queen's Gambit, The Flight Attendant, Ted Lasso and the final season of Schitt's Creek to be in the mix. The HFPA has yet to announce what form its awards ceremony – typically a bubby dinner gathering with flowing drinks – will take this year. In August, the group's president, Lorenzo Soria, died at age 68. He was replaced by Ali Sar. This year's Globes were postponed nearly two months because of the pandemic and to adjust to the delayed Oscars. Those are set for Apr 25. Last year's Golden Globes culminated in awards for 1917 and Once Upon A Time ... iI Hollywood. The telecast, hosted by Ricky Gervais, couldn't buck the overall ratings trend for awards shows, drawing an average of 18.3 million viewers, down 2 per cent from the previous year.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/evan-rachel-wood-accuses-marilyn-manson-of-abuse-1923241,Actress Evan Rachel Wood says rocker Marilyn Manson 'horrifically abused' her for years,"Rocker Marilyn Manson was dropped by his record label on Monday (Feb 1) after actress Evan Rachel Wood accused her ex-fiance of sexual and other physical abuse, alleging she was ""manipulated into submission"" during their relationship.  Manson called the allegations “horrible distortions of reality”. Wood, who stars on HBO's Westworld, had spoken frequently in recent years about being abused in a relationship but did not name the person until she posted on Monday on Instagram.  ""The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson,"" Wood said. ""He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years."" Manson's label, Loma Vista Recordings, said in a statement that after the ""disturbing allegations"", it will ""cease to further promote his current album"" and has ""also decided not to work with Marilyn Manson on any future projects"". Wood and Manson's relationship became public in 2007 when he was 38 and she was 19, and they were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up.  Wood, now 33, said in her post that Manson left her ""brainwashed and manipulated into submission"".  ""I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail. I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him, before he ruins any more lives,"" the post added. She concluded, ""I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silent"". Manson responded with his own Instagram post on Monday night. “Obviously my art and life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality,"" his post said. “My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how – and why – others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.” It was not immediately clear whether Wood has gone to authorities with any of her allegations, and a representative did not immediately respond when asked via email whether she had. In 2018, Los Angeles County prosecutors declined to file charges against Manson over allegations of assault, battery and sexual assault dating to 2011, saying they were limited by statutes of limitations and a lack of corroboration. The accuser in that case was identified only as a social acquaintance of Manson's.  He denied the allegations through his attorney at the time.  In 2017, Wood was one of thousands of women who identified themselves as victims of sexual harassment or assault amid the #MeToo movement. ""Being raped once made it easier to be raped again. I instinctually shut down. My body remembered, so it protected me. I disappeared. #metoo,"" Wood wrote at the time as part of a series of tweets on her experience.  In 2018, she testified about her abuse to a House Judiciary subcommittee as she sought to have a Sexual Assault Survivors' Bill of Rights passed in all 50 states. ""My experience with domestic violence was this: Toxic mental, physical and sexual abuse which started slow but escalated over time,"" she told the committee. Wood began acting as a child, gaining fame and a Golden Globe nomination for playing a troubled adolescent in 2003's Thirteen. For three seasons she has played Dolores Abernathy, a sentient android, on HBO's Westworld and has been nominated for a Golden Globe and an Emmy Award for the role.  Manson, 52, became a household name in the mid-1990s with a series of hit rock albums and used a stage persona designed to shock and stoke controversy.  (Source: AP)"

He was 44. ""Dustin did not suffer. He did not have to lie submerged in pain. For that, we are grateful,"" the actor's spokesman, Roger Paul, said in a statement.  Diamond, best known for playing the quirky, nerdy Screech on the hit '90s sitcom, was hospitalised last month in Florida and his team disclosed later that he had cancer. Diamond had carcinoma. Former co-star Mario Lopez took to Twitter to say farewell: ""Dustin, you will be missed, my man. The fragility of this life is something never to be taken for granted."" Another co-star, Mark-Paul Gosselaar, called Diamond ""a true comedic genius"", adding ""I will miss those raw, brilliant sparks that only he was able to produce"". Saved By The Bell aired from 1989 to 1993, and its related shows included Saved By The Bell: The College Years, Good Morning, Miss Bliss and Saved By The Bell: The New Class, which Diamond starred in. A sequel was launched on Peacock last fall featuring many from the original cast, including Gosselaar, Lopez, Elizabeth Berkley and Tiffani Thiessen. Diamond was not included.  ""God speed, Dustin,"" Thiessen wrote on Instagram. Josh Gad on Twitter said Diamond was ""a defining part of our collective pop cultural touchstones"". He starred in a handful of reality television series including the fifth season of Celebrity Fit Club, The Weakest Link and Celebrity Boxing 2. In December 2013, Diamond appeared on an episode of OWN's Where Are They Now? and became a house member in the 12th season of Celebrity Big Brother.

To celebrate the big occasion, Bryan booked a hotel suite for a birthday getaway, taking his family along with him. It wasn’t the birthday bash he’d been looking forward to for years, though. “My BFFs, all of the same age, were planning something extraordinary for ourselves more than a year ago, for when it was time for us to hit the big 5-0,” he wrote in an Instagram post. “But man proposes, God disposes.” He shared that the initial plan had been to “gallivant” in a wintry country, but thanks to COVID-19 travel restrictions, he’s spending his birthday in Singapore. In addition, there will be “no big bash”. Even so, “I am thankful that I am able to spend some quality time with my family and close friends,” he wrote. On Jan 29, Bryan posted a video of his hotel suite with words reading, “The last time my family bunked together was in Milan. Sharing a bathroom with two of them was a nightmare. But heng this bathroom very big.”

His caption read, “Today’s the day! I have always said in jest (actually seriously) that I want to do a shoot in my birthday suit when I hit the big 5-0. This is as close as it can be.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/andie-chen-15-min-decision-relocate-family-eelin-taiwan-contract-1882411,Andie Chen made 15-min decision to relocate family; signs Taiwan contract,"In the middle of last year, Singapore actor Andie Chen relocated to Taipei, taking his two young children with him. Son Aden, 6, started Primary One there, and Andie was the kids’ sole caregiver for a while as his wife, host and actress Kate Pang, had work in Singapore. The bold move has paid off – the 36-year-old recently inked a contract with Taiwan’s EeLin Entertainment, one of the island's largest entertainment companies, with models and actors like James Wen under their banner. 
  Back in Singapore with his family for a brief visit, Andie told CNA Lifestyle, “I think this is an expansion, not just in my career, but also in my whole outlook of life. Being in just one market – as comfortable as blessed as that is – you only see things from one perspective.” The important questions for him now, he said, are, “‘What are the kinds of projects that are really exciting? The kind of filmmakers who are pushing the envelope? How are investments coming into film and TV in Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the US markets? Where do I fit into this equation? Where do I have the most value?’” Underlying all that, “I do have a fear of being mediocre,” he admitted. “My endgame has always been to work with the most talented filmmakers in the world, on projects all over the world. If I can explore the world and really understand their culture by working on film projects in different places – I feel like that's my purpose, and I feel like that would be very aligned with my personality.” 
  Having an agency representing him in Taiwan is a major career move, but the journey hasn’t been smooth-sailing, especially on the personal front, he shared. “It has been very difficult, financially. Because of the COVID-19 situation, I took an 80 to 90 per cent pay cut last year,” he said. On top of that, there were the stresses of adapting to life abroad. “In Singapore, we had a house and a car… we had a domestic helper, which was a godsend. In Taiwan, we don’t have a helper. We don't have a car. And the wife and I were apart for longer than we were together for most of last year.” 
   A post shared by Chen Bangjun (@andiechen) He also stepped into the role of his children’s caregiver, juggling housework and meals, and even learning to braid daughter Avery’s hair. “I was really struggling, being the primary caretaker of my kids, and trying to work at the same time,” he said, adding, “Kudos to the single parents out there.”   Although wife Kate was supportive, family members and close friends thought the move was “reckless”. “Uprooting my family and making that decision in 15 minutes – that's what happened,” he said. “I talked to Kate, and then she was like, ‘Okay, lor.’ That was it – like, 15 minutes.” It may sound flippant, but the couple’s implicit trust in each other has been built up through seven years of marriage. “She knew that before I even asked her, I would have really thought through it multiple times, and about whether it would be good for her and good for the kids,” he said. It is difficult to explain this perceived recklessness to others. But Andie knows where his priorities lie. “I'm in an industry that is unstable, anyway. We should embrace it and work with it,” he said. “The anchor, for me, is my family. Whenever all four of us are together, there’s a sense that things are right. Things are okay. ""It doesn't matter if we’re in Singapore or Taiwan. We don't have to be rich; we don’t have to be eating great meals and going to fancy places. When the four of us are together, I just feel like, ‘I can do this. It is possible.’”"

Titled What Remains, the song about introspection is composed, produced and written by Sun. The last time she did this was 19 years ago with the song, Someone. The new track – available on digital platforms – came about after Sun found herself with time on her hands as she wasn’t able to fly overseas for work because of the pandemic. This gave her time to reflect on her memories and also reconnect with people whom she hadn’t seen in a while. In a press release statement, Sun said that the most significant line in the song for her is the one that roughly translates to, “I haven’t said how much I’ve missed you for fear that I'll miss you once I say it”. The 42-year-old also said that What Remains is not meant to be sad. “It’s more about self-discovery, tidying up one’s emotions, and then moving on and forward.” Sun took to Instagram to announce the song and also took the opportunity to wish her fans a happy Chinese New Year. This isn’t the first time Sun has treated fans to a welcome surprise. In June last year, she held an unexpected concert online to mark the 20th anniversary of her music career."

The film, directed by Pablo Larrain and written by Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight, sees Stewart in the role of the Princess of Wales as she spends a holiday weekend with the royal family and makes a decision to part ways with Prince Charles. The official synopsis from Neon studio reads: “December, 1991: The Prince and Princess of Wales' marriage has long since grown cold. Though rumours of affairs and a divorce abound, peace is ordained for the Christmas festivities at Sandringham Estate. There's eating and drinking, shooting and hunting. Diana knows the game. This year, things will be a whole lot different."" Stewart also shared a statement about the film, calling it ""a dive inside an emotional imagining of who Diana was at a pivotal turning point in her life"". She added: ""It is a physical assertion of the sum of her parts, which starts with her given name: Spencer. It is a harrowing effort for her to return to herself, as Diana strives to hold onto what the name Spencer means to her."" Other cast members have been announced – Timothy Spall, Sally Hawkins and Sean Harris, although it’s unclear which roles they will play. Filming is taking place in Germany and the UK and the film is expected to debut sometime at the end of this year."

He revealed that he had been on the receiving end of unwanted touches from a female co-worker. Hafreez wrote: “She liked grabbing my ass and chest. I was stunned when it first happened”. He added: “I know she meant it as a joke. But the problem was, it’s my body and I’m not comfortable with people touching me in those areas”. Hafreez started the conversation by conducting an informal poll on his Instagram stories, first asking how his followers would view an incident where a man patted a woman’s buttocks. Most said it would be sexual harassment. The 30-year-old actor then asked what if a woman were to do the same thing to a man? Most responses then said it would be inappropriate, but not sexual harassment. He shared screengrabs of the poll and responses in his Instagram post, and captioned it, “Educate yourself”. He also ended off his post by saying, “Don’t normalise this”. Hafreez said that the co-worker did it more than once, even though he had told her off about it. She even laughed as she told him that she doesn’t like men. He added that he thought it was his fault for not being more firm when saying no."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna-lifestyle/oscar-and-emmy-winning-actor-cloris-leachman-dies-94-438956,Oscar and Emmy-winning actor Cloris Leachman dies at 94,"Cloris Leachman, an Oscar-winner for her portrayal of a lonely housewife in The Last Picture Show and a comedic delight as the fearsome Frau Blücher in Young Frankenstein and self-absorbed neighbour Phyllis on The Mary Tyler Moore Show, has died. She was 94. Leachman died in her sleep of natural causes at her home in Encinitas, California, publicist Monique Moss said on Wednesday (Jan 27). Her daughter was at her side, Moss said. A character actor of extraordinary range, Leachman defied typecasting. In her early television career, she appeared as Timmy's mother on the Lassie series. She played a frontier prostitute in Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, a crime spree family member in Crazy Mama, and Blücher in Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein, in which the very mention of her name made horses whinny. ""There was no one like Cloris. With a single look she had the ability to break your heart or make you laugh 'till the tears ran down your face,"" Juliet Green, her longtime manager, said in a statement. In 1989 she toured in Grandma Moses, a play in which she aged from 45 to 101. For three years in the 1990s she appeared in major cities as the captain's wife in the revival of Show Boat. In the 1993 movie version of The Beverly Hillbillies, she assumed the Irene Ryan role as Granny Clampett. She also had an occasional role as Ida on Malcolm In The Middle, winning Emmys in 2002 and 2006 for that show. Her Emmy haul over the years totalled eight in all, including a trophy for Moore's sitcom. In 2008, she joined the ranks of contestants in Dancing With The Stars, not lasting long in the competition but pleasing the crowds with her sparkly dance costumes, sitting in judges' laps and cussing during the live broadcast. Although she started out as Miss Chicago in the Miss America Pageant, Leachman willingly accepted unglamorous screen roles. ""Basically I don't care how I look, ugly or beautiful,"" she told an interviewer in 1973. ""I don't think that's what beauty is. On a single day, any of us is ugly or beautiful. I'm heartbroken I can't be the witch in The Wizard Of Oz. But I'd also like to be the good witch. Phyllis combines them both. ""I'm kind of like that in life. I'm magic, and I believe in magic. There's supposed to be a point in life when you aren't supposed to stay believing that. I haven't reached it yet."" During the 1950s, Leachman became busy in live TV drama, demonstrating her versatility, including in roles that represented casting standards in that era.  ""One week I'd be on as a Chinese girl, the next as a blond cockney and weeks later as a dark-haired someone else,"" she recalled. In 1955, she made her film debut in a hard-boiled Mickey Spillane saga, Kiss Me Deadly — ""I was the naked blonde that Mike Hammer picked up on that dark highway."" She followed with Rod Serling's court-martial drama, The Rack and a season on Lassie. She continued in supporting roles on Broadway and in movies, then achieved her triumph with Peter Bogdanovich's The Last Picture Show, based on the Larry McMurtry novel. When Leachman received the Oscar as best supporting actress of 1971, she delivered a rambling speech in which she thanked her piano and dancing teachers and concluded: ""This is for Buck Leachman, who paid the bills."" Her father ran a lumber mill. Despite her photogenic looks, she continued to be cast in character parts. Her most indelible role was Phyllis Lindstrom on The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Phyllis often visited Mary's apartment, bringing laments about her husband Lars and caustic remarks about Mary and especially about her adversary, another tenant, Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper). Phyllis was so unexpectedly engaging that Leachman starred in a spinoff series of her own, Phyllis, which ran on CBS from 1975 to 1977. With Young Frankenstein, Leachman became a member of ""the Mel Brooks stock company"", also appearing in High Anxiety and History Of The World, Part I. Her other films included Bogdanovich's Daisy Miller, and Texasville, repeating her role in The Last Picture Show. In 2009, she released her autobiography, Cloris, which made tabloid headlines for her recounting of a ""wild"" one-night stand with Gene Hackman. Cloris Leachman grew up on the outskirts of Des Moines, Iowa, where she was born in 1926. The large family lived in an isolated wooden house with no running water, but the mother had ambitious ideas for her children. Cloris took piano lessons at the age of five; since the family could not afford a piano, she practised on a cardboard drawing of the keys. ""I'm going to be a concert pianist,"" the girl announced, and her mother encouraged her with bookings at churches and civic clubs. Her mother arranged for Cloris to ride on a coal truck to Des Moines for an audition for a Drake University student play. She was given the role and appeared in other plays at a local theatre. After high school, she won a scholarship to study drama at Northwestern University. Admittedly a poor student, Leachman lasted only a year. As a lark while in the Chicago area, she tried out for a Miss Chicago beauty contest and was chosen. She competed in the 1946 Miss America pageant in Atlantic City, qualifying as a finalist. Her consolation prize: a $1,000 talent scholarship. With new ambition, she went directly to New York, where she worked as an extra in a movie and understudied Nina Foch in the hit play John Loves Mary. More understudy jobs followed, and she enrolled at the Actors Studio to hone her craft. ""I finally quit because of the smoking,"" she said later. ""I couldn't stand that blue haze."" In 1953, Leachman married George Englund, later a film director and producer, and they had five children: Adam, Bryan, George, Morgan and Dinah. The couple divorced in 1979. Son Bryan Englund was founded dead in 1986 at age 30. (Source: AP) "

Cannes organisers announced on Wednesday (Jan 27) that this year's festival will now take place Jul 6–17, about two months after its typical period. The French Riviera festival, which had run for nearly 75 years with few interruptions, is currently hoping the coronavirus recedes enough by summertime. Cannes last year first looked at a postponement its 73rd festival to June or July  before ultimately cancelling altogether. The festival still went ahead with a selection announcement to celebrate the films it had planned to include in its prestigious lineup. This year, organisers are intent on having a festival, one way or another. No details were announced on Wednesday on what shape a 2021 edition might take. If Cannes were to go forward with attendees in theatres in July, it would be the first major film festival to do so since the Venice Film Festival mounted a festival in September, with masked moviegoers and social distancing on red carpets. On Thursday, the premier independent film festival, Sundance, launches with virtual screenings and drive-in events scattered around the US. The Berlin Film Festival, scheduled for March in Germany, is planning a virtual event.
