https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/new-initiatives-will-give-elderly-residents-in-beo-crescent-access-to-more-services,New initiatives will give elderly residents in Beo Crescent access to more services,"SINGAPORE - Senior citizens in the Beo Crescent area will have greater access to services such as counselling, job placement and befriending under two agreements signed on Friday (Aug 19). Under one of the agreements - signed between Thye Hua Kwan Moral Charities (THKMC) and the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) - residents of Beo Crescent, where a THK Active Ageing Centre is located, can access services such as tele-consultations and medication delivery. The collaboration will give the organisation a ""network of resources"" to help seniors in Bukit Merah and Tiong Bahru, said SGH population health and integrated care office director Low Lian Leng. Meanwhile, a separate agreement was signed between THKMC, the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), Sage Counselling Centre and Tsao Foundation. AIC will support the Beo Crescent centre via its Communities of Care initiative, which will give the centre resources needed to build partnerships with other organisations. The agency will also refer seniors to the active ageing centre for services such as befriending and case management. THKMC's collaboration with the Sage Counselling Centre will provide counselling to the elderly as well as their family members and caregivers, while Tsao Foundation will help seniors in areas such as job placements. Witnessing the ceremony was Health Minister Ong Ye Kung, who also toured the active ageing centre. The Beo Crescent centre - appointed by the Ministry of Health and AIC as an active ageing centre last year - was chosen for Friday's initiatives due to the large number of seniors living in the vicinity. THKMC chief operating officer Jason Lee said the collaborations were aimed at improving the experience of senior citizens in its centres. ""The seniors can look forward to ageing healthily and independently,"" he said. Speaking to reporters on Friday, THKMC divisional director for elderly services Andy Lee said the new initiatives would benefit up to 300 people in the area, adding that he hoped for similar initiatives to be extended to its other centres. ""At the end of the day, we have to be a society that takes care of everybody,"" he said."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/monkeypox-patients-can-recover-at-home-from-aug-22-moh,Monkeypox patients can recover at home from Aug 22,"SINGAPORE - People who have monkeypox can recover at home from next Monday (Aug 22). This is provided they are assessed to be clinically stable by a doctor, and their place of residence is suitable for home recovery, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Friday (Aug 19). Currently, all confirmed cases assessed by public hospitals to be clinically stable recover with telemedicine support at a monkeypox isolation facility. MOH said that those assessed to be at higher risk of complications will continue to be managed in hospitals. All confirmed cases will be issued an isolation order and are required under the Infectious Diseases Act to remain isolated until they are medically assessed to be non-infectious, MOH said. The ministry added that local and international data shows that monkeypox is typically a mild and self-limiting illness where the majority of patients recover within two to four weeks without requiring hospitalisation. ""As the transmission of monkeypox requires close physical or prolonged contact, including face-to-face and skin-to-skin contact such as sexual contact, the risk to the general public remains low,"" it said. MOH said patients recovering at home should have access to a bedroom with an attached bathroom. Other household members should use a second bathroom. The home should also not have a household member who is pregnant; children below 12 years old; seniors aged 80 and above; individuals who are undergoing dialysis, or who have weakened immune systems or are on immunosuppressants; or individuals at higher risk of being infected, such as those with caregiving needs. To avoid any animal-to-human transmission, there should be no pets at the patient’s home. The monkeypox virus can spread through bites and scratches or direct contact with skin, mucosa (mucous membrane), blood and bodily fluids. Patients may continue to recover in the monkeypox isolation facility if their homes are not suitable for home recovery. MOH said patients on home recovery will receive regular telemedical consultations to assess their state of recovery.  They may also be taken to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) if additional reviews are necessary. At the end of the isolation period, patients will have to undergo a review at the NCID to see if they are ready for discharge. MOH did not state the length of the isolation period. Those medically assessed to have fully recovered will be able to exit isolation, while those who have not will continue to be isolated until their next discharge review. MOH added: “In line with the shift to home recovery, suspect monkeypox cases who are assessed to be clinically well will no longer be required to isolate in the hospital while awaiting their test results.  “They may instead isolate themselves at home if they are able to do so.” Those unable to do so will be isolated at a facility while waiting for their test results. Suspected cases who are assessed to require clinical care will continue to be managed in hospitals, the ministry said. “MOH will continue to monitor the monkeypox situation closely and calibrate our preparedness and response measures as needed,” it said. “Members of the public are encouraged to exercise personal responsibility by monitoring their personal health, maintaining good hygiene, and avoiding high-risk sexual activity, such as having multiple sex partners or casual sex, especially during travel. “They should also avoid close contact with individuals known or suspected to have monkeypox infection.” As at Aug 13, there are 15 confirmed cases of monkeypox here."

In Singapore, deaths happen more in hospitals than in the patients' own homes, even though a Lien Foundation survey conducted back in 2014 had found that many people would prefer to die at home, surrounded by loved ones. Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said recently that the government wants to help more people fulfil this wish by boosting palliative care support. Conversations about death and dying are difficult but crucial to understanding a person's end-of-life wishes, as well as the fact that dying is a part of life. In this episode, ST senior health correspondent Joyce Teo speaks to Clinical Associate Professor Alethea Yee, a senior consultant from the Division of Supportive & Palliative Care at the National Cancer Centre Singapore. She was the head of the division before she was seconded to Assisi Hospice to be the Clinical Director in 2018. Dr Yee is also the Deputy Head of the SingHealth Duke-NUS Supportive & Palliative Care Centre as well as the Education Director of the Lien Centre for Palliative Care at Duke-NUS. She asks Dr Yee about what can be done to make it possible for more end-of-life patients to die at home if they want to do so. She and Dr Yee also talk about the role of day hospices as well as the challenges and some recent developments in the palliative care sector. This is part two of their conversation on palliative care. In the first episode, they discuss what palliative care is about and how it can help a person live well before leaving. In it, Dr Yee also shares a story of a patient who received the help she needed to fulfil her last wish.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/doctors-seeing-more-flu-cases-as-covid-19-restrictions-ease,Doctors in S'pore seeing more flu cases as Covid-19 restrictions ease,"SINGAPORE - The number of influenza cases in Singapore has risen in recent weeks, following the relaxation of rules aimed at containing the spread of Covid-19. Dr Edwin Chng, medical director at Parkway Shenton, which has 30 general practitioner clinics, said the group has seen the number of flu cases increase by about 25 per cent over the past month."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/pre-surgery-screening-saves-doctors-more-than-1400-consultation-hours,"Pre-surgery screening saves SingHealth doctors more than 1,400 consultation hours","SINGAPORE - An electronic system that screens and categorises patients before surgery has allowed anaesthesiologists at the Singapore General Hospital to devote more time to high-risk patients. The system saves them about 1,410 hours of consultation over almost a year. It categorises patients into high- and low-risk groups based on their existing co-morbidities, predicting their suitability for surgery and anaesthesia. High-risk patients save more than four minutes of consultation time as information from the assessment is available to the doctors beforehand, while low-risk patients need only do a remote screening with a nurse over the phone. This helped cut the number of consultations done by anaesthesiologists by almost 2,000 between August last year and June this year - equivalent to about 1,410 hours, or more than 58 days - said Manpower Minister Tan See Leng on Tuesday (Aug 16). ""Anaesthesiologists can now devote more time to pre-surgery counselling to ensure health optimisation of high-risk patients, and patients also save time at the pre-surgery assessment."" Associate Professor Hairil Abdullah, a senior consultant with the anaesthesiology department at SGH, said: ""It's significant because even though it's four to five minutes per patient, my clinic sees about 100 to 110 patients a day.""  The system was one of a number of innovations highlighted by Dr Tan during the Singapore Healthcare Management Congress held at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre on Tuesday. Another was a system which automates the documentation of ward procedures, such as the dressing of complex wounds, performed by nurses and allied health professionals. The initiative allows for billing to be done directly and accurately, saving more than 1,700 hours per month. SingHealth's group chief nurse, Adjunct Associate Professor Tracy Carol Ayre, said the system freed nurses up from performing rote tasks, allowing them to devote more time to direct patient care. It has been rolled out to all SingHealth institutions since last December, and is expected to include procedures performed by doctors by the end of next year. Technology and process innovation can optimise the ""precious manpower"" in the healthcare sector, said Dr Tan. Healthcare is one of the sectors that have been hard hit by a labour crunch, worsened by the Covid-19 pandemic. According to the Manpower Ministry's labour report in June, job vacancies in health and social services rose to 7,700 in March, up from 6,500 in December last year. And earlier this month, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Health Rahayu Mahzam said in Parliament that the attrition rate among public sector nurses had increased last year, with the attrition among foreign nurses more than doubling to 14.8 per cent."

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/askst-will-covid-19-antiviral-drug-paxlovid-be-less-effective-with-some-medication,Will Covid-19 drug Paxlovid be less effective if the patient is taking other medications?,"SINGAPORE - Doctors are prescribing two oral antiviral drugs here to help protect those infected with Covid-19 and at high risk of developing severe disease. The drugs Paxlovid and Lagevrio can help prevent hospitalisation and death, and are meant to be given within five days of the onset of symptoms. They are being prescribed at all polyclinics and more than 130 Public Health Preparedness Clinics here. But Paxlovid, which consists of nirmatrelvir tablets and ritonavir tablets, is not suitable for everyone, as there are many drugs that can affect the way it works. No drug interactions are known with molnupiravir, which is sold as Lagevrio. A: Yes, it depends on the significance of the potential drug interaction, as some drugs can cause adverse consequences, while others can be managed safely. Doctors could temporarily halt the medication that may interact with it, or adjust the dosage of that medication. (See HSA fact sheet for more information.) Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist at Rophi Clinic, said doctors will not prescribe Paxlovid if a patient is taking the anti-coagulant or blood thinner warfarin. They will also not prescribe the antiviral drug for patients on certain heart medications, anti-psychotic medications and immunosuppressants. Paxlovid could increase the levels of some of these drugs in the body, which leads to toxicity. Conversely, it could decrease the levels of the drugs, which would render them ineffective. Both scenarios could end up harming the patient, said Dr Leong. ""I am less bothered if the drug effect is lowered because it is only for five days (a course of Paxlovid). But if its drug effect is enhanced, this may lead to potential complications,"" he said. ""It would be like an overdose of the drug. Too much of a 'good thing' may be a bad thing."" A: It is common for doctors to ask patients to stop certain medications or use an alternative while receiving Paxlovid, said Raffles Medical family physician Aw Suet Chee. For example, a Covid-19 patient, Madam A, who is 72 and taking metformin for diabetes and simvastatin for high cholesterol, was prescribed Paxlovid, and her simvastatin was withheld for eight days during the course of treatment, Dr Aw said. If doctors do not prescribe Paxlovid due to drug interactions, they may then prescribe the alternative, which is molnupiravir, if this is suitable. A: Dr Leong said it is extremely rare for a patient to get a stroke simply because the medicine was stopped for five days. Many individuals do stop taking their blood thinners transiently just before and during surgery, or when there are complications such as bleeding, he noted. Dr Leong said Covid-19 has been known to cause blood clots to form in blood vessels - also known as thrombosis, which can lead to a stroke or heart attack. This may occur independently of previous heart diseases or strokes. A: There are a few theories. One is that a five-day course is too short. ""The hypothesis is that the body's immune system hasn't kicked in sufficiently to suppress the virus,"" said Dr Leong. ""The medicine just helps control viral replication but it doesn't wipe out the virus totally in the first five days. ""It depends on the immune system to do the second leg of the defence, but in some individuals, this kicks in later,"" he added. Some of these individuals may require a second course of treatment, but overwhelmingly, most do not require a second course, said Dr Leong. The Ministry of Health had previously said that viral rebound is uncommon and that generally, patients experiencing rebound showed mild symptoms that were resolved without any further treatment."

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/no-change-to-covid-19-rules-for-now-including-wearing-masks-indoors-moh,Indoor mask rule stays as Covid-19 cases remain high even though peak of current wave has passed,"SINGAPORE - There are no plans for now to relax Covid-19 rules, including the requirement that people wear a mask indoors, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). In response to queries, MOH on Thursday (Aug 11) said existing safe management measures will continue to stay in place, as the number of cases remain high. This is even as the latest wave of infections has passed its peak. An MOH spokesman said: ""Cases are falling but remain high and pose risks. The Ministry of Health will continue to calibrate measures depending on the situation."" On Thursday, 7,776 new Covid-19 cases were reported, down from a high of 16,870 on July 13, in cases largely fuelled by the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron variants. Last month, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said the current wave was ""near the peak, if not at the peak"". He said in Parliament last week that infection numbers had fallen and were likely to subside further. MOH was responding to queries on whether there were plans to relax existing Covid-19 rules, including the rule that people wear a mask indoors in places like shopping malls and on public transport. While most safe management measures have been eased, patrons of bars and nightlife establishments with dancing, for instance, are required to be fully vaccinated. Events with more than 500 participants, such as worship services and live performances, also require everyone who is attending to be fully vaccinated. Some experts in Singapore have recently suggested that there is no need to continue enforcing mandatory mask-wearing indoors. Associate Professor Alex Cook, who is the vice-dean of research at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, had questioned the benefits of this. ""With over 90 per cent of the population vaccinated and over half the population infected, there is little reason to contain the virus. There is no need to continue mandatory mask-wearing,"" he said. His colleague at the school, Associate Professor Natasha Howard, said the benefits of the continued requirement for indoor mask-wearing are ""minimal"". But Prof Cook said wearing masks reduced the risk of transmission among those who were infectious but asymptomatic, and that those infected by Covid-19 should continue to wear masks while interacting with others. Wearing masks in public spaces was made compulsory in April 2020, during Singapore's ""circuit breaker"" period aimed at stopping the spread of Covid-19. In March this year, wearing a mask outdoors was made optional as a raft of pandemic restrictions were lifted. But the rule on using masks indoors remained. Around the world, countries experiencing a spike in Covid-19 cases are once again encouraging people to wear masks. In Australia, the authorities in Victoria on Tuesday said free N95 masks will be give out over the next few weeks amid the current Omicron wave. In the south-east Australian state, mask wearing is required on public transport and in hospitals and aged care facilities, and is recommended in other indoor settings. In the Indian capital of New Delhi, the authorities on Thursday said masks would again be required in all public areas, including outdoor settings, after Covid-19 infections spiked in recent weeks."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/drinks-outlets-must-label-beverages-high-in-sugar-saturated-fat-on-their-menus-by-end-2023,"Drinks outlets must label beverages high in sugar, saturated fat ","SINGAPORE - Outlets selling freshly prepared drinks that have a very high level of sugar and saturated fat content must label them with a Nutri-Grade mark in their menus by the end of next year, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung on Thursday (Aug 11). Such beverages include freshly brewed coffee, freshly squeezed juices and bubble tea. This rule will come after the requirement for pre-packed beverages with higher sugar and saturated fat content to be labelled with a Nutri-Grade mark kicks in from Dec 30 this year. ""It is a neutral or even nice name, but the message to consumers is to avoid those with Nutri-Grade mark that indicates a high level of sugar,"" said Mr Ong. The outlets will also be prohibited from advertising freshly prepared beverages with the highest level of sugar and saturated fat content, he said. The Government is working towards publishing these measures in the middle of next year and have them come into effect by end of next year, Mr Ong added. This is part of the Government's efforts to influence consumers' diet and sugar intake in order to win the war on diabetes. It fits in with the preventive care emphasis in its new healthcare transformation strategy, called Healthier SG. Mr Ong said that six new patients are diagnosed with kidney failure in Singapore every day, up from about four per day in 2011, and this number is driven mainly by two factors – age and disease prevalence. Singapore is ageing and while diabetes prevalence has stayed quite consistent over the years, the prevalence of obesity -  a key risk factor for diabetes - is rising. He was speaking at the opening ceremony of the International Society of Peritoneal Dialysis Congress 2022, which is being held in Singapore for the first time. In his speech, he also said that the Ministry of Health is aiming to get 30 per cent of new dialysis patients to opt for a home-based form of treatment known as peritoneal dialysis (PD) by 2025, up from around 20 per cent now. The target is not new as the Government has been trying to encourage more kidney failure patients to do so over the years, but the uptake has yet to shoot up. Currently, most patients opt for haemodialysis, which is done with a machine at a dialysis centre. PD offers greater convenience and self-empowerment, Mr Ong said. ""To achieve this (target), we are developing with our stakeholders a set of pre-dialysis counselling, training and educational materials to help patients to perform PD independently at home,"" said Mr Ong. In April, MOH launched the National PD Home Support Programme to provide home visits and more specific counselling to patients, he said. Kidney patients go for dialysis regularly to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood as their kidneys can no longer do so. In PD, a dialysis solution is introduced into the body through a permanent catheter in the abdomen to do the job and then drained out. Mr Ong said that MOH has been working with public hospitals and social service organisations to recommend PD as the preferred dialysis option for patients with kidney failure, unless they are medically unsuitable. ""With a lot of hard work, the PD utilisation rate among new dialysis patients rose steadily from 18 per cent in 2015 to around 21 per cent in 2019,"" he said. ""However, the progress hit a snag after that due to Covid-19. Catheter insertions were delayed, training and home support services were also disrupted."" PD utilisation rate has therefore stagnated at around 20 per cent, he said. Mr Ong added that MOH will continue to deploy new tools - such as a wearable automated PD device developed by researchers and scientists in Singapore - to guide the treatment and care of patients with kidney failure. The number of patients with end-stage renal disease - those whose kidneys can no longer function on their own and must receive dialysis or kidney transplantation - who are on dialysis has risen over the years and is expected to rise, given Singapore's rapidly ageing population."

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/brands-suntory-beat-gut-issues-for-better-health,Eat well and manage stress: Some ways to beat gut issues for better health,"When your gut health is compromised, it can lead to more than just a bloated feeling or poor bowel movements. Your immune system can be affected too.  So don’t let common digestive issues – no matter how light – become the norm for you. Instead of bearing discomfort from indigestion and poor bowel movement till it goes away yet again, take preventive steps to keep your gut health in check. Product researcher at Suntory Wellness Research Centre, Mr Yu Ipponmatsu, shares some tips on how to boost your immunity and promote better digestion. Q: Why is it important to take care of our gut health? Actively caring for your gut health can alleviate the woes that come with ageing and unchecked lifestyle habits.  Here are five reasons to bear in mind: Q: Will a change in diet be enough to calm the gut and improve its health?  Making wise food choices is the first step to improving gut health because what you eat can influence gut bacteria. Examples include foods that are fermented and rich in fibre and contain less sugar.  However, as gut issues are complex, other non-dietary factors such as maintaining an active lifestyle can help improve gut bacteria too. Q: What else should we do to improve gut health?  Start by managing your stress levels as they can wreak havoc in your gut.  Exercise regularly and do not smoke because the ill effects of obesity and smoking can decrease beneficial bacteria and diversity of the intestinal microbiome. You can also consider taking probiotic supplements to improve gut health. Q: How should we choose probiotics to help support gut health? Look out for probiotic strains that can withstand the test of gastric acid and readily reach your intestines. They should be highly stable during storage and have high survivability in finished products until consumed. Pay attention to the sugar, fat, and calorie content of probiotic products, and whether they contain other ingredients like prebiotics to enhance the efficacy of the product. A health supplement like Suntory TADAS, which is made in Japan, has a mildly sweet and zero-fat “4-in-1 formula” comprising probiotic bifidobacterium longum, prebiotic lactulose, dietary fibre and lactoferrin.  Bifidobacterium longum, a Bifidobacterium species, has been extensively studied and is known to be able to withstand gastric acid.  Lactulose, which is also resistant to gastric acid, and dietary fibre are supporting nutrients – or food – for bifidobacterium longum to grow.  In fact, the combined intake of lactulose and bifidobacterium longum has been found to be superior in helping to improve bowel movement in healthy adults, compared to taking bifidobacterium longum alone. Lastly, lactoferrin is a nutrient found in breast milk (especially colostrum) and present in saliva and tears. Lactoferrin can support immunity and resistance to common maladies such as allergies and colds. Q: How should Suntory TADAS be consumed? The powder supplement is packed into 30 individual sachets, making it convenient to add to salads, liquid foods, as well as warm and cold beverages.  It would be ideal for people above 20 to take one sachet every day at any time of the day to support your efforts for stronger gut health.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/eisai-sleepless-nights-irritable-bowel-syndrome,Sleepless nights may just be the culprit for irritable bowel syndrome,"If you have unexplained bouts of abdominal pain, bloating, constipation or diarrhoea, you may have a condition known as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).  IBS affects about one in 10 people in Singapore. A study led by Professor Gwee, a gastroenterologist from Gleneagles Hospital and an adjunct associate professor of medicine at the National University of Singapore, found that people who suffer from it tend to be under 50, and are more educated and affluent.  The symptoms tend to occur repeatedly, usually over a few months or even years. Possible triggers for IBS include food poisoning, use of antibiotics, surgery in the abdomen, and major life events that may cause great stress to a person. Increasingly, studies have shown that IBS is linked to insomnia, with IBS patients reporting disturbed sleep or difficulty falling asleep. Prof Gwee explains how IBS and insomnia are related and shares coping strategies.  Q. How does one differentiate between IBS and other digestion problems? Diarrhoea in IBS patients is usually mild, occurring not more than three times a day and not severe enough to cause dehydration.  Conversely, when one has food poisoning, a person may experience abdominal pain and severe diarrhoea that lasts for one to three days.  Some IBS patients may also experience constipation in the form of hard or pellety stools, and an incomplete feeling of emptying the bowels. This is usually due to bloating.  IBS patients who experience mild constipation, are more bothered by their bloating, and may mistakenly attribute this to indigestion. Others may also mistake their pain for gastric, because the pain can occur in the stomach and may be worse after a meal.  Q. How should patients seek help if they have IBS? There is no test to confirm that one has IBS. The doctor will rule out other more serious conditions, as symptoms of IBS are similar to other diseases such as stomach ulcers, infections, colitis, and cancer, it is important to see a doctor for medical evaluation. Q. How is sleep affected in patients with IBS? Patients with IBS experience more sleep disturbances. They may have difficulty falling asleep, shorter time spent asleep, have frequent arousal and awakening during sleep, and feel less well-rested after sleeping. A lack of sleep affects us in many ways, including worsening IBS symptoms. The more waking episodes the patient experiences during their sleep, the worse their abdominal pain and bowel sensitivity the next day. They may also become more prone to constipation.  However, it is unusual for IBS symptoms to wake a patient from sleep. If a patient wakes up from abdominal pain, doctors consider this an alarm symptom, and will usually suspect a more serious condition such as stomach ulcer or gallstone disease.  Q. Can treatment for insomnia relieve IBS symptoms? There is indirect evidence that treatments which can improve sleep can relieve the symptoms of IBS. An example is that hypnotherapy, a form of psychological treatment to help patients reach deep relaxation, has been shown to relieve IBS symptoms. Anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medications which cause sleepiness can also help. However, these medications may cause constipation. Q. What are some management strategies for IBS patients who experience difficulty sleeping? Pay attention to your sleep hygiene. This means creating a clear separation of time and space between work or other stimulating activity near your bedtime.  Stop working at least an hour before you plan to go to bed. During this time, try to take your mind off work and do something relaxing like listening to gentle music or deep breathing exercises.   Make your bedroom environment as calming as possible. Try to avoid doing work in the bedroom.   Changing your diet may also help. Avoid caffeine after lunch and food high in FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols). These include foods such as yoghurt, ice cream, wheat-based food such as cereal and bread, beans and lentils, as well as fruits such as apples, apricots, pears and peaches. These foods contain certain types of sugars that worsen gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating, gas and diarrhoea.  Many patients with IBS also cannot tolerate high-fibre foods as these will cause more bloating and gas.  Try to regulate your bowels by having a routine. The most effective time for having a bowel movement is in the morning, and eating a hearty breakfast can help. Q. What is your advice for patients suffering from IBS? IBS can be overcome, but needs a strong effort by both patient and physician. The treatment approach has to be tailored to the patient’s own symptoms and life situation.  It is not helpful to tell IBS patients to stress less or be less anxious. Only a small minority of IBS patients have serious psychological problems.  For the majority of patients, IBS usually occurs due to a combination of disturbed physiological functions, low-grade inflammation, inappropriate diet, sleep disturbance, and mild degrees of stress.  It also does not help to simply tell IBS sufferers to eat a healthy diet. Many ‘healthy’ foods, especially foods such as high-fibre cereals like oats and fruits, will cause more bloating, gas and even diarrhoea.  For more information, visit www.eisai.com.sg"
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/what-are-the-mandatory-childhood-vaccinations-and-how-they-protect-children-against-serious-illnesses,What are the mandatory childhood vaccinations and how they protect children against serious illnesses ,"Childhood vaccination is one of the most effective ways to prevent serious illnesses and deaths in children, yet there are reports of parents delaying vaccinations or are deciding not to vaccinate their children altogether. It is understandable that some parents are wary of vaccinations and share concerns about the possible side effects and allergic reactions. This hesitancy is likely to stem from a lack of understanding about how different types of vaccines work.    “Some parents are overwhelmed by the number of vaccines and are concerned that their baby is too young or weak to receive multiple vaccines at the same time, as well as be able to cope with the side effects. This is a misconception and scientific data show that it is safe for babies to receive several vaccines together,” says Dr Shermela Appan, a consultant paediatrician at StarMed Specialist Centre. As advancements in medical science have brought about more vaccines against serious diseases, parents need to be well informed about the types of vaccinations available so they can make the right choices for their children to stay well and safe.  It starts with understanding how vaccines work. A vaccine is a type of biological substance that is designed to train the body’s immune system to fight off harmful viruses or bacteria.  It contains a tiny amount of the killed or greatly weakened part of the bacteria or virus that the person is being vaccinated against.  Dr Appan explains that upon receiving a vaccine, the body’s immune system will attack the harmless form of the virus or bacteria from the vaccine and will produce antibodies to destroy it. This exposure to the agent is then stored in the memory of the immune system.  When the child is exposed to the same virus or bacteria years later, the immune system can recognise it, and is prepared to fight it to prevent infection.  Babies are exposed to thousands of germs in the environment once they leave the protected environment of the womb. A baby’s immune system is immature and exposure to infectious diseases could pose a serious threat to the baby’s health.  Vaccines can be classified as inactivated or live attenuated (weakened).  Inactivated vaccines are made from a protein or part of the virus or bacteria, whereas a live attenuated vaccine uses the weakened form of the virus, explains Dr Appan. A live attenuated vaccine does not cause disease in healthy people but is able to stimulate a protective immune response. Examples of live attenuated vaccines include those for rotavirus, chickenpox and measles, mumps and rubella (MMR). Some vaccines like those for hepatitis B and measles are able to provide long lasting immunity upon completing the course. However, others like tetanus and influenza require booster shots for continued protection. Children in Singapore are vaccinated according to the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule that lists the recommended types of vaccines from birth till 17 years old.  Among them, two are required by the law – one to protect against diphtheria and the other measles. Both diseases are highly contagious and can be fatal.  Diphtheria is a bacterial infection which causes a fever and sore throat. A thick membrane forms rapidly that covers the tonsils and the nasal passage, leading to difficulty in breathing and swallowing. The toxin can also cause heart and kidney failure.  Measles, especially in the young, can cause severe lung and brain infection, which often results in permanent brain damage or death.  These vaccines are given as combinations with other vaccines. Diphtheria is given with the tetanus, pertussis, polio and haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine, while measles is given with the ones for mumps and rubella.  “Combination vaccines reduce the number of clinic visits, saving parents’ time and also help lessen the child’s distress as the number of shots is reduced” says Dr Appan. Although not compulsory, the rotavirus and hepatitis A vaccines are also recommended, as these diseases have harmful effects on the young.  Rotavirus is a common infection of the digestive tract in children under five. It is found in human faeces and spreads easily through contact with dirty surfaces. It causes severe vomiting and diarrhoea especially in infants, often requiring hospitalisation.  The Rotavirus vaccine is given orally in two or three doses, depending on the vaccine brand. The first dose should be given before the child turns 15 weeks old.  Hepatitis A virus can cause severe liver disease. As with most viral infections, no specific treatment is available, and the best recourse is prevention through vaccination, says Dr Appan.  While it is suitable for most infants and children to receive vaccines, there are occasions when a child may not be suitable for them.  Vaccination should be postponed if a child is suffering from moderate or severe acute illness. Once the child recovers, you can proceed with the vaccine in one to two weeks.  Vaccination is not suitable for children who have exhibited a serious allergic reaction to a previous dose of a vaccine, in children with poor immune system, or in those who have active cancer or are on medication that weakens the immune system. It is best to seek medical advice if you are unclear.  Taking vaccines may come with side effects, but these are often manageable.  Common side effects include fever, irritability, sleepiness, fatigue, pain or redness at the injection site, and loss of appetite.  These symptoms can be managed at home, for instance, by giving paracetamol syrup to bring down the fever and giving smaller but frequent feeds if they have poor appetite. Placing a cool wet towel on the injection site can also help soothe the baby.  Some may develop a small lump at the injection site or a mild rash, but these will subside after a few days. However, if rashes appear rapidly in the first half hour after vaccination, and the child also experiences swelling of eyes and lips, seek immediate medical attention as it could possibly be anaphylaxis, a severe allergy, which is a medical emergency. Mild vomiting and diarrhoea are common side effects after the rotavirus vaccine, but they usually subside after a few days.  However, if the child is crying excessively and vomiting within a week after the vaccine, seek medical consultation immediately.  Full subsidies for vaccinations under the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule (NCIS) and childhood developmental screening are available for Singaporean children at StarMed Specialist Centre. All recommended vaccines under NCIS and optional vaccines are available at StarMed and can be paid with funds in the Child Development Account.

A study in Britain has proven that, and now, Singapore's National Healthcare Group (NHG) hopes to show that it can also work for Asians. It is doing so through the Diabetes Reversal Programme, which is aimed at enabling at least some diabetics here to become free of a disease that can lead to severe consequences such as blindness, kidney failure and even death. The trigger to reversing diabetes is to significantly reduce the weight of people who are overweight or obese, the target being a 10 per cent cut or a 15kg reduction over a period of six months. Associate Professor Lim Su Chi, a senior consultant at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) and a principal investigator of the NHG programme, said: ""Weight loss is the strongest link to remission. More than half of diabetics here are overweight or obese."" The British study, called Direct, or Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial, had found that the majority who were able to achieve the target weight loss were no longer diabetic. Those who remained diabetic after losing more than 15kg had achieved better control of their sugar levels. The study, conducted between 2017 and 2018, involved putting 149 participants on a low-calorie diet. Its findings were published in The Lancet in 2018 and 2019. At the end of the first year of the study, 46 per cent were no longer diabetic. However, not all were able to maintain this, with only 36 per cent staying free of diabetes at the end of the second year. Associate Professor Tang Wern Ee, senior consultant at NHG Polyclinics (NHGP) and the programme's lead investigator, said that is still a very good outcome, as it means that more than one in three were free of the disease. Diabetes is a major problem in Singapore, with more than 400,000 people living with the disease. If nothing is done, the number of diabetics here is projected to surpass one million by 2050 and cost the country US$1.8 billion (S$2.5 billion). In 2016, the Ministry of Health (MOH) declared a war on diabetes to try to slow the increase in numbers. People with diabetes are unable to use up the sugar in their blood. This can damage blood vessels as well as reduce oxygen to the heart and brain. Two major contributory factors are obesity and insufficient exercise. Prof Tang said her team would like to see Singapore moving away from just treating the disease to getting more people reverting to a non-diabetic state. The programme will recruit 100 participants aged 21 to 60 with a body mass index (BMI) of between 27 and 45 who have had diabetes for less than six years and do not have complications caused by the disease. A normal BMI for Asians is 18.5 to 22.9. Half of the participants will be with the control group who will continue to be cared for by their doctor. The other half will stop their medication and be put on a very low-calorie liquid diet for three months, or less, should they achieve the target weight loss earlier. ""The first five days on the liquid diet can be very difficult. They will feel hungry and very tired,"" said Ms Pauline Xie, NHGP's principal dietitian who is part of the study team. By day six though, the body starts to burn the stored fat in the body, which will energise them, she added. After three months, even if they have yet to meet the weight loss target, they would move to phase two, where they will be reintroduced to food, starting with just one meal a day, while still maintaining a low-calorie intake. The study is funded by a $2.6 million grant from the Tanoto Foundation and $1 million from the NHG Fund. The money will be used to pay for the Optifast liquid diet, which retails at $5 per portion, wearables that will track how participants are doing, as well as manpower for the trial. Prof Tang said the study also aims to discover how to change behaviour so that it becomes something diabetics enjoy doing in the long term. The team will interact with participants throughout the programme, to find out what works for them, and what does not. Mr Hafiz Abdul Aziz, 36, is keen to be on the programme. The data engineer, who has a BMI of 32, found out he had diabetes in February this year.  “It was quite scary,” he said. He is now eating a lot less, having a banana and one slice of bread for breakfast instead of the large plate of nasi rawon - rice with black beef soup - he used to eat. He is keen to join the programme because he finds it difficult to lose weight on his own. He added: “Thinking long term, I don’t want to have my legs cut off or have my kidneys fail.” The study will take three years in all, and recruitment is in progress. Diabetics who fit the profile and wish to volunteer can find details at this website."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/1-in-8-adults-develop-long-covid-lancet-study-suggests,Vaccinated people who were infected this year less likely to have long Covid,"SINGAPORE - Vaccinated persons in Singapore who had Covid-19 during this recent Omicron wave or the one earlier in the year are much less likely to develop long Covid symptoms, said Dr Barnaby Young, head of the Singapore Infectious Disease Clinical Research Network at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). Long Covid is a condition where people experience symptoms such as chest pain, breathing difficulties and fatigue months after the initial infection has cleared. “From our experience at NCID, for those who do develop long Covid, the symptoms also tend to be less severe and do not persist so long among vaccinated patients with Covid-19 due to the Omicron variant,” he said. “While we do not have a diagnostic test or treatment specifically for long Covid, we do have some medication for symptom relief, and usually perform some blood or imaging tests to exclude other causes.” His comments come as a new Dutch study published in The Lancet medical journal suggests that one in eight adults with Covid-19 may experience long Covid. “About one in eight patients reporting long Covid is similar to what we have described in Singapore, early in the pandemic,” said Dr Young.  The new study was conducted in the Netherlands by researchers from the University of Groningen. They collected data from online questionnaires on 23 symptoms commonly associated with long Covid from April 2020 to August last year. The researchers compared the symptoms in people infected with Covid-19 with those who were not infected, which helps to ensure that the symptoms are not confused with non-Covid-19 ones. They also asked participants if the symptoms were already present before their infection, in order to identify the core symptoms. This method allows them to offer an improved working definition for long Covid and provide a reliable estimate of how likely it is to occur in the general population, said Professor Judith Rosmalen from the University of Groningen, the study's lead author. In the study, about 21.4 per cent of 1,782 participants who had Covid-19 experienced at least one new symptom or a symptom that was more severe than before, three to five months post-infection. This compares with 8.7 per cent of 4,130 uninfected people followed in the same time period, suggesting that one in eight Covid-19 patients (12.7 per cent) in the general population experiences long-term symptoms due to Covid-19, the researchers said. Around the world, experts are trying to determine who is at risk of long Covid, and what can be done about it. Researchers have said that long Covid is very challenging to study as it is not clearly defined, having been linked to more than 200 symptoms of varying severity and duration. There have been various estimates of its prevalence. In the United States, for instance, data collected in the first two weeks of June by its Centres for Disease Control and Prevention showed that nearly one in five adults still has long Covid symptoms lasting at least three months after their infection. Last week, a team of Singapore and international researchers published a paper in the British Medical Journal which found that about 5 per cent of the global population may develop long-term issues with their sense of smell or taste after coming down with Covid-19. In the Lancet study, the core symptoms recorded were chest pain, breathing difficulties, pain when breathing, painful muscles, loss of taste and/or smell, tingling hands or feet, a lump in the throat, alternately feeling hot and cold, heavy arms and/or legs and general tiredness. The severity of these symptoms plateaued three months after infection with no further decline. Other symptoms that did not significantly increase three to five months after a Covid-19 diagnosis included headache, itchy eyes, dizziness, back pain and nausea, the researchers said. The participants are from Lifelines, a large, multi-generational cohort study that includes mostly Caucasians above 18, from the northern part of the Netherlands. The study approach accounted for symptoms that may have been a result of non-infectious aspects of the pandemic, such as stress caused by restrictions and uncertainty, said first author Aranka Ballering in a release on the study. Prof Rosmalen said that future research on long Covid should include mental health symptoms such as depression and anxiety symptoms, along with additional post-infectious symptoms such as brain fog, insomnia and post-exertional malaise, which is the worsening of symptoms such as exhaustion, pain or cognitive dysfunction after minimal physical or mental activity. Commenting on the Dutch study, Dr Young said it is very well conducted and has good quality data, particularly longitudinal symptom data, collected before and after acute Covid-19, and symptom data from a control group who did not have Covid-19. ""The importance of this control group for interpreting symptom data is shown by the 40.7 per cent of individuals who had Covid-19 and reported symptoms of moderate severity, and yet so did 29.3 per cent of those who did not have Covid-19,"" Dr Young said. ""This control group makes it possible to estimate which symptoms can be attributed to long Covid, rather than something else."" In a linked comment to the Dutch study, Professor Christopher Brightling and Dr Rachael Evans of the Institute for Lung Health at the University of Leicester, England, who were not involved in the study, said that current evidence supports the view that long Covid is common and can persist for at least two years, although severe debilitating disease is present in a minority of patients."

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/monkeypox-not-life-threatening-no-need-to-admit-patients-to-hospital-say-experts,"Monkeypox not life-threatening, no need to admit patients to hospital, say experts","SINGAPORE - Monkeypox is not a life-threatening condition for many who get it, but it is still important for those affected to be isolated to minimise further transmissions in the community. Responding to the Health Ministry's decision to set up a separate facility for patients, health experts said this makes sense since there is no need for strict clinical monitoring for the vast majority of patients, and putting them in hospital would unnecessarily soak up precious hospital resources. On Monday (Aug 1), MOH announced that all monkeypox patients who are clinically stable will be transferred to a dedicated monkeypox isolation facility. MOH has not said where the facility is located. Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said the key difference why monkeypox patients do not need to be sent to the hospitals or the National Centre for Infectious Diseases is that monkeypox is not a life-threatening condition for the majority of cases. Hence, there is no real requirement for strict clinical monitoring, he added. ""What is important here is to differentiate between the need for isolation versus the need for clinical monitoring. Shifting the cases to a dedicated isolation facility is very much in the same spirit that we established the community isolation facilities for Covid-19 previously to isolate the infected people to minimise further transmissions in the community or family,"" Prof Teo said. He expects more monkeypox cases to surface over time, something that is consistent with the infectious nature of the disease. Admitting patients to the hospital is overkill, but sending them home, as what Britain is doing, would pose unnecessary risk to the household, said Associate Professor Alex Cook, vice-dean of research at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. MOH had previously said that monkeypox is typically a mild and self-limiting illness where the majority of patients recover within two to four weeks without requiring hospitalisation. There were 12 monkeypox cases in Singapore as at Monday, said MOH on Tuesday evening. The latest case, a 59-year-old man, is a local unlinked case with no recent travel history, MOH added. The quarantine period for close contacts has been cut from 21 days to 14 days, followed by seven days of monitoring for symptoms via phone calls. The current outbreak emerged in May and has infected more than 18,000 people in 78 countries, said the World Health Organisation on July 27. Nine people who contracted the virus in Africa, India, Brazil and Spain have died. Symptoms linked to the monkeypox virus include fever, headache, muscle pain, swollen lymph nodes, chills, lethargy and skin rash. MOH advised the public to exercise personal responsibility by monitoring their personal health, maintaining good hygiene and avoiding high-risk sexual activity, such as having multiple sex partners or casual sex, especially during travel. They should also avoid close contact with individuals known or suspected to be ill with monkeypox."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/tighter-covid-19-curbs-at-hospitals-and-care-homes-extended-till-aug-31,Tighter Covid-19 curbs at hospitals and care homes extended till Aug 31,"SINGAPORE - Safe management measures for visitors to hospital wards and residential care homes will be extended for another four weeks, till Aug 31. Although the daily number of local Covid-19 cases has fallen gradually over the past week, Singapore's hospitals continue to face a high volume of both Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a statement on Tuesday (Aug 2). More residents at the homes tested positive for the coronavirus as well, it added. In response, tighter safe management measures for visitors to both locations, which have been in place since July 7, will be extended, said the ministry. The curbs were slated to last till Wednesday (Aug 3). Hospitalised patients will be allowed only two visitors, designated beforehand, for the duration of their admission, and only one visitor may be allowed at the bedside at any one time. Critically ill patients will be allowed up to five pre-designated visitors, and two visitors may be allowed at the bedside at any one point in time. MOH said the visit duration will be limited to 30 minutes. But it added: ""In exceptional situations, such as for critically ill patients, paediatric patients, birthing or post-partum mothers, and for patients requiring additional care support, visitors may be allowed to stay beyond 30 minutes on a case-by-case basis at the hospitals' discretion."" It added: ""Visitors are reminded not to eat or drink in the hospital wards, or use the toilets designated for patients in the wards. ""They should also avoid sitting on patients' beds."" Meanwhile, all residents at the care homes are allowed four pre-designated visitors, with only one visitor allowed to visit at any one time for up to 30 minutes. Visitors should continue to schedule the visits with the home ahead of time, adhere to prevailing safe management measures in the homes and remain within the designated visitor areas, outside of the wards, said MOH. The ministry also said that visits may have to be suspended if a home is managing active Covid-19 cases, and sought the understanding of visitors. ""Next-of-kin of residents may approach the home for further details."" It also strongly encouraged all visitors to do an antigen rapid test on the day of the visit and don face masks ""with good filtration capability"" at all times. Added MOH: ""Hospitals and homes have the discretion to impose stricter visitor limits or testing requirements for visitors of vulnerable or unvaccinated patients. ""MOH will review and calibrate these measures regularly in line with the evolving situation. ""We seek the understanding and cooperation of patients, residents, their family members and loved ones as we work to reduce the risk of Covid-19 transmission in our healthcare institutions."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/resignation-rates-of-nurses-in-public-hospitals-at-a-five-year-high-in-2021-says-rahayu-mahzam,Resignation rates of nurses in public hospitals at a five-year high in 2021,"SINGAPORE - The proportion of nurses in public hospitals who resigned reached a five-year high last year, with 7.4 per cent of local nurses leaving their jobs. The increase was greater for foreign nurses in the public sector, 14.8 per cent of whom left their jobs last year. Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Health Rahayu Mahzam disclosed these figures in Parliament yesterday, in response to questions from Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC) on nurse welfare, workload, salary and resignation rates. The attrition rate for local nurses in the public sector was 6 per cent, 6.3 per cent, 7 per cent and 5.4 per cent in each of the years from 2017 to 2020. For foreign nurses, it was 8.2 per cent, 9.1 per cent, 9.4 per cent and 7 per cent in each of the years from 2017 to 2020. Addressing this, Ms Rahayu said: ""We're losing foreign nurses... now that the borders are open, (they) can go back. They are also being attracted by the prospects overseas."" Noting that this means there are fewer foreign nurses in Singapore, Ms Rahayu said: ""So while salaries and working conditions are important, and we're constantly looking at how we can improve these, we should not jump to the conclusion that they're always the root of the manpower problems."" Despite the attrition rates, the typical nurse-to-bed ratio in public acute hospitals - one nurse for every four or five beds in the general ward, and one or two nurses per intensive care unit patient depending on case complexity - has not changed significantly over the last five years, said Ms Rahayu. In response to Mr Ng's questions on nurse salaries, Ms Rahayu said she was ""reluctant to provide this so openly"" as the public and private sector hospitals compete for manpower, and she did not have data on private sector nurse salaries. But she did provide the salaries of staff nurses and senior staff nurses, who she said form the largest proportion of Singapore's nursing workforce. The median annual salaries for staff nurses ranged from $42,800 to $53,700 in 2017 and rose to $46,300 to $58,500 in 2021, while the median annual salaries for senior staff nurses ranged from $65,000 to $79,700 in 2017 and increased to $71,200 to $87,600 in 2021. Ms Rahayu said it takes a fresh graduate about four to six years to become a senior staff nurse, and so a staff nurse in 2017 may be drawing an annual salary in the senior staff nurse's range by 2021. ""The key issue is to retain the services of nurses,"" she said, adding that there are several parts to the Government's plan to stabilise the nursing workforce. First, reviewing nurses' scope of work. In order to reduce the administrative workload of nurses and let them focus on patient care, public healthcare institutions are streamlining care processes and deploying dedicated administrative and support care staff to assist nurses. Innovations in technology have also been introduced to ease the load of non-clinical tasks. She cited the example of the Nursing Software Suite, introduced by SingHealth in its hospitals to enable patients to check their test results, schedule tests, and indicate their requests to their care team. Second, Ms Rahayu said it is important to ensure remunerations are competitive both locally and internationally. ""We understand the importance of recognising nurses' contributions and the (Health Ministry) has worked on reviewing their salaries and allowances,"" she said, noting that over the last five years, the annual salaries of local nurses in public healthcare institutions have increased. Third, in order to deal with growing demands on healthcare manpower due to an ageing population, Ms Rahayu called on families and caregivers to be partners in the care journey of their loved ones, working together with the healthcare system to reduce the workload of healthcare staff. Ms Rahayu said that MOH is working to ensure there are sufficient nurses on the ground, and that the registered stock of nurses over the past few years has remained stable, with a slight increase from around 42,800 at the end of 2019, to 43,000 at the end of 2021. Local nursing intakes have also increased from around 1,500 in 2014 to around 2,100 in 2021 to ensure that there is a stable inflow of nursing manpower into the healthcare system, she said. ""MOH remains committed to provide support to the public healthcare clusters in our efforts to ensure that there is sufficient manpower on the ground, and look after the well-being of our nurses as they continue to face pressures from Covid-19 surge waves and an ageing population,"" said Ms Rahayu, adding that the ministry is looking at the issue holistically and adopting a multi-pronged approach to improve the situation."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/is-the-current-covid-19-wave-in-singapore-over-15-things-you-need-to-know,Is the current Covid-19 wave in S'pore over? 15 things you need to know,"SINGAPORE - Health Minister Ong Ye Kung gave a round-up of Singapore's latest Covid-19 situation in Parliament on Monday (Aug 1). Here are 15 things to know from his speech. Singapore is still in the middle of an infection wave driven by the Omicron variant BA.5. Over the last 10 days, infection numbers have been falling. The wave should subside further this week. Six in 10 people in Singapore are likely to have been infected with Covid-19. Singapore has about 1.7 million reported cases, and the number translates to about 30 per cent of the population. The Government monitors blood samples taken from polyclinic patients and other healthy volunteers for signs of previous infection. From these samples, it is estimated that about 60 per cent of local residents are likely to have been infected with Covid-19. There is no herd immunity. Scientists around the world do not think herd immunity is achievable because the virus will continue to mutate, get around the protection offered by vaccines and infect people. What is achievable is ""population protection against severe illness"" through vaccinations. This is what enables the healthcare system to weather through an infection wave because the incidence of severe illness will be kept low. In the current wave so far, about 1.9 per cent of infected people are in hospitals, compared with 2.4 per cent in the previous Omicron wave at the start of this year. The actual figure is lower in the current wave because not all cases are reported. The protection of vulnerable groups, especially seniors, remains a concern for the Government. Three mRNA shots are needed for good vaccine protection against severe illness from Omicron infections. However, there remains 40,000 eligible seniors aged 60 and above who have not received their booster shots. Another 40,000 seniors have not completed two doses yet. All of them are very vulnerable to severe illness if infected. The Government will continue to try to reach out to them through the Mobile Vaccination Teams. Empirical data shows that after 10 months, the protective effect of three doses of mRNA vaccines remains very strong in preventing severe illness. This is why those who are 80 years old and above should get a second booster or fourth shot to better protect them against severe disease. While the protection for this age group is not waning, it is generally lower than younger age groups. Experts here are studying the benefits of a fourth shot for the 60- to 79-year-olds in further reducing the likelihood of severe illness. The Government will announce their recommendations once they are ready. Younger individuals below 60 years old have the protection of both the third shot and age, and currently do not require a second booster if they are healthy. For those 50 to 79, although the protection level offered by three vaccine shots continues to be strong, this is also the age when chronic illnesses start to set in. So they will be offered the second booster if they want to take it because they are travelling, or worried about their health because of underlying illness. The Ministry of Health (MOH) will continue to study the emerging data on vaccines, including the benefits of newer vaccine formulations, weighed against the risk of new variants, and update its recommendations when necessary. As the protection offered by vaccines and prior infection wanes, the virus will circulate again and cases will rise. The most important precaution to take is to keep vaccinations up to date. ""At some point, just like flu vaccinations, we will have to stop counting the number of boosters or shots we take. Instead, we must ensure that we get a jab at a suitable interval - maybe nine months or a year,"" Mr Ong said. This is something MOH will try to determine in the coming months. MOH has been watching reinfection numbers very closely because they will inform the ministry of the likely timing of future waves. It has observed that the chances of reinfection for those who were infected over the last three months are very rare. Reinfections are taking place - albeit not so frequently - in Singapore, and are likely to increase as protection offered by prior infections wanes. MOH will start to include reinfection numbers in its daily reported case counts to better reflect the pandemic situation. Healthcare workers have been very busy. Polyclinics and general practitioner clinics have been handling higher patient volumes. The key is to ensure that hospitals are not overwhelmed and that those who need urgent care can be attended to promptly. Fortunately, this is generally the case. The Government planned to set aside up to about 1,000 hospital beds for Covid-19 patients, but so far, there has been no need to activate all of the beds. The workload of hospitals is being eased by transferring lower-risk patients to Covid-19 treatment facilities, and discharging patients staying long term to community care facilities such as nursing homes. Finally, hospitals have cut down on their ""business-as-usual"" workload by about 5 per cent, comprising mostly elective surgery. This number is far lower than the 15 per cent cut implemented in the previous Omicron wave at the start of the year. No. Absenteeism in hospitals due to Covid-19 has been lower this time, at around 2 per cent. There was some transmission within hospitals, but the overall hospital-acquired Covid-19 infection rate has been low, and very likely lower than community-acquired infections because of good infection control measures in hospitals. Bed crunches are mainly caused by high case numbers and how they translate into severe illness that needs hospitalisation. There are only two ways to minimise this - social restrictions and through good coverage of vaccination in the population. Singapore needs to rely on vaccinations, because no one wants to live with social restrictions as far as possible. Yes. MOH has previously shared that all polyclinics and more than 130 participating Public Health Preparedness Clinics can prescribe oral antivirals to eligible patients in the community. To date, more than 3,200 patients have been prescribed such therapeutics. This is a small percentage of all infections because the vast majority of infected cases are of low risk. Singapore is coping better with the Covid-19 wave, but it needs to be alert to the threat of a new variant that is more infectious, leads to more severe illnesses, or evades the protection of current vaccines. The hope is that it will not happen, but many countries in the northern hemisphere are wary of what may emerge in the coming winter. Social restrictions may be needed if such a variant surfaces here."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/clinically-stable-monkeypox-patients-to-transfer-to-dedicated-isolation-facility,Stable monkeypox patients to be transferred to dedicated isolation facility,"SINGAPORE - All monkeypox patients who are clinically stable will be transferred to a dedicated monkeypox isolation facility from Monday (Aug 1). The quarantine period for close contacts will now be cut to 14 days, followed by seven days of monitoring for symptoms via phone calls. Previously, the quarantine period was up to 21 days. The Ministry of Health (MOH) in a statement on Monday said: ""These updated public health measures are in line with the latest local and international data, including that from the World Health Organisation (WHO)."" Public hospitals will assess whether the monkeypox cases are clinically stable. Those deemed stable will be sent to the isolation facility with round the clock telemedicine support. The patients will recover in the monkeypox isolation facility until they are non-infectious and fit for discharge, said MOH. The MOH statement did not say where the dedicated isolation facility is located. The Straits Times has contacted MOH for details.  Monkeypox, MOH said, is typically a mild and self-limiting illness where the majority of patients recover within two to four weeks without requiring hospitalisation. ""Those particularly vulnerable to complications are young children, pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals,"" it added. Previously, all confirmed cases of monkeypox were isolated in hospitals until they are non-infectious. However, MOH said last Friday (July 29) that eight cases were sent to the isolation facility instead, as part of a pilot to transit monkeypox cases to recover in the community. These patients are all currently in stable condition with mild symptoms,. Meanwhile, patients assessed by the public hospitals to be at higher risk of complications will continue to be managed in hospitals. ""This allows hospitals to preserve their capacity for cases with more severe symptoms or complications."" As for the shortening of the quarantine period, MOH said monkeypox transmission requires close physical or prolonged contact, including face-to-face and skin-to-skin contact such as sexual contact, so ""the risk to the general public remains low"". ""Evidence also points to a mean incubation period of approximately eight to nine days, with most close contacts developing symptoms by Day 14 from their last exposure to a confirmed case."" MOH said those who are unable to complete their quarantine at home will be transferred to a government quarantine facility. ""MOH will continue to monitor the monkeypox situation closely and calibrate our preparedness and response measures as needed. ""Members of the public are encouraged to exercise personal responsibility by monitoring their personal health, maintaining good hygiene and avoiding high-risk sexual activity, such as having multiple sex partners or casual sex, especially during travel. They should also avoid close contact with individuals known or suspected to be ill with monkeypox infection."" There are 11 monkeypox cases in Singapore as at Sunday (July 31), with 45 close contacts identified, said Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary in Parliament on Monday. The current outbreak emerged in May, and has infected more than 18,000 people in 78 countries, said the WHO last Wednesday (July 27). Nine people who contracted the virus in Africa, India, Brazil and Spain have died. Some of the symptoms linked to the monkeypox virus include fever, headache, muscle pain, swollen lymph nodes, chills, lethargy and skin rash."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/moh-adds-18-deaths-to-official-covid-19-death-count-for-2021-bringing-total-to-821,MOH adds 18 deaths to official Covid-19 death count for 2021,"SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Health (MOH) has added 18 deaths to its official Covid-19 death count for last year, bringing the total from 803 to 821. In a statement on Monday (Aug 1), MOH said the adjustment comes after the Registry of Births and Deaths finalised its report for 2021. With the 18 deaths added, there is a 2.2 per cent increase from the previous count, MOH said.  It added that there is no change in the number of Covid-19 deaths for 2020. Doctors are required to notify MOH of Covid-19 deaths as soon as possible. Based on their submissions, MOH publishes the number of deaths on its website daily.  Doctors are also required to report the cause of death of their patients to the Registry of Births and Deaths. This is included in a Registration of Births and Deaths report that is made public in June each year.  The adjustments made to MOH’s 2021 Covid-19 death count are as follows: Eight deaths were added as they had not been reported to MOH - only the Registry of Births and Deaths was notified. Another 11 deaths were added as Covid-19 infection was not indicated as the underlying cause of death, given the available medical information at the time.  These deaths were later reported to the Registry with Covid-19 as its cause after further review.  One Covid-19 death was removed from the 2021 count and will be added to the 2022 count. This was due to differences in the date of its reporting to MOH and the Registry as the death occurred on Dec 31 last year. MOH said five deaths in the Registry’s report were people who had been diagnosed with Covid-19 while overseas and died after coming back to Singapore. “These deaths will not be included as MOH’s count only includes deaths from Covid-19 diagnosed in Singapore.” MOH said it expects to make annual adjustments to the Covid-19 death count each July, after the Registry’s report is published. As at noon on Monday, Singapore has reported a total of 1,718,765 cases of Covid-19 with 1,520 fatalities."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/incoming-director-of-biomedical-ethics-centre-aims-to-help-singaporeans-to-arrive-at-right-answers,Incoming director of biomedical ethics centre aims to help Singaporeans to arrive at right answers,"SINGAPORE - He does not see his job as telling Singaporeans what the right way forward is but to ""enable them to think more deeply for themselves about what they believe the right answer is"". This is the view of Professor Julian Savulescu, who will become director of the Centre for Biomedical Ethics (CBmE) at the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine on Aug 28. Biomedical ethics can seem highbrow, but Prof Savulescu tells The Straits Times that it plays an essential role in making decisions that directly impact people's lives. One salient example of a bioethical decision, he noted, is the implementation of vaccination differentiated measures. ""In the Covid-19 pandemic, some countries decided that the need to protect freedom and personal autonomy would be outweighed by the need to protect public interest,"" he said. This can be seen in countries that introduced penalties and restrictions. Italy and Greece, for example, imposed fines on the elderly if they were not vaccinated. While such curbs over the freedom to move could be seen as a form of coercive vaccination, Prof Savulescu said some countries consider them justifiable under some conditions. However, he stressed that though the science on Covid-19 is clear, not all countries will make the same ethical decisions because each has its own value systems. He said: ""Science can tell you how many people will die on this policy or that policy, but it can't tell you the value of freedom and the value of life."" Such questions on how much a person or a country should value freedom or life are another separate ethical endeavour, added Prof Savulescu. He has been the director of the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics at the University of Oxford since 2002, among other appointments he holds internationally. Trained in medicine, neuroscience and bioethics, the Australian hopes that he will be able to impress upon Singaporeans the importance of ethics in his new role. ""Every day, we make decisions about how much we should care about the climate or whether we should choose electric cars over petrol cars... all these questions are ethical questions,"" he noted. ""People like to hope that the world will be simple and black and white although it's often very grey,"" he said, adding that an ethical education will help people develop principles and reasons to believe the things that they do. CBmE, which was established in September 2006, studies issues of broad international significance with a particular interest in Singaporean and Asian developments. The centre's key goal is to promote ethical practice in the context of healthcare provision, biomedical science and health-related policy development."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/turning-study-results-into-better-parks-to-promote-a-healthier-population,Turning study results into better parks to promote a healthier population,"SINGAPORE - National Parks Board (NParks) is focusing on building and designing park features that will encourage visitors to stay longer or to increase their physical activities there, using findings from a series of studies as a guide. The studies, conducted primarily by researchers from National University of Singapore, found that the longer a person spends at parks, the greater the improvement to his physical and mental well-being. They also found that adding one aesthetic feature, such as a pond or unpaved trails, increased the time spent by visitors."

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/nurses-to-receive-retention-payment-to-keep-them-in-the-profession-ong-ye-kung,Nurses in S'pore to receive 'retention payment' to keep them in the profession,"SINGAPORE - Nurses will receive additional payments on top of their salaries in 2022 and 2023 in a move to keep them in the profession, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung on Friday (July 29). Mr Ong said the Covid-19 pandemic is still ongoing and a major burden on nurses here. “I think they are deserving of another payment, perhaps structured as a nurses’ retention payment,” he added.  Speaking at the 2022 Healthcare Scholarships Award Ceremony held at Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre, Mr Ong said more details on the enhanced payment package will be announced on Nurses' Day, which falls on Aug 1.  Mr Ong said remuneration must be addressed if Singapore is to keep building manpower in its healthcare sector - which it will need to do amid an ageing population and more international demand for qualified healthcare workers.  He said the Government had finished a review of the salaries of nurses and allied health professionals in 2021, and the second phase adjustment for nurses was completed this month. They are set to get increases of 5 per cent to 14 per cent on their monthly base salaries. Due to the stresses borne of the Covid-19 pandemic, nurses were awarded special bonuses in 2020 and 2021, and given a Covid-19 Healthcare Award in 2021. The healthcare award was given to staff of publicly funded healthcare organisations involved in the pandemic fight, and each individual received up to $4,000. This was on top of their base salaries, which the Ministry of Health (MOH) said was between $3,300 and $5,200 a month for entry-level registered nurses, depending on their qualifications and adding in allowances and bonuses as at 2020.  The strain on healthcare workers due to the pandemic caused many to leave the profession.  Around 1,500 resigned in the first half of 2021 compared with 2,000 annually pre-pandemic. Mr Ong said more must be done to support nurses, including streamlining unnecessary administrative work, introducing technology and improving IT systems. He added that Singapore must continue to recruit good foreign nurses, given its small population.  Foreign nurses currently make up about a third of the nursing workforce, he said. This group, in particular, was hit hard by border closures caused by Covid-19. In March, MOH said that the attrition rate for foreign nurses in 2021 was 14.8 per cent, compared with 7.4 per cent for local nurses.  Said Mr Ong: “We will continue to find ways to entrench the feeling amongst foreign nurses that they are an integral part of the Singapore healthcare family, and they can continue to develop their careers in Singapore.”  Good leadership is also crucial to building up manpower, he added, and healthcare scholarships are a key initiative to bring talent into the sector to groom as future leaders.  On Friday, 120 students received scholarships to study nursing, social work, physiotherapy, diagnostic radiography and pharmaceutical science, among others. Ms Zelda Chew, 21, will be pursuing a nursing degree at the National University of Singapore starting next week. Ms Chew, whose younger sister is also studying nursing, said she was heartened by Mr Ong’s announcement that nurses will receive a pay bump.  She said: “Covid-19 was really hard on nurses and they deserve to be recognised and they deserve a pay increment.”  Correction note: This article has been edited to reflect the correct surname of Ms Zelda Chew.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/coping-with-deaths-back-home-among-struggles-by-foreign-nurses-in-spore-detailed-in-new-book,Foreign nurses in Singapore detail their struggles in new book,"SINGAPORE - For palliative care nurse Myint Myint Than, her job is a daily reminder of two important people in her life. She was an oncology nurse, but decided to switch to palliative care to pick up the skills to help care for her ageing mother and mother-in-law. But it was not to be, as both the elders died in Myanmar two weeks apart last July due to Covid-19. Ms Myint Myint Than is one of 50 nurses featured in Alexandra Hospital's (AH) book titled Missy Reflections II. It is the second book launched by the hospital. Missy is a colloquial term for nurse. The first Missy Reflections was launched last year and highlighted AH nurses' milestones in their careers, including during the pandemic. The new book tackles the struggles faced by male nurses, the challenges foreign nurses experience as they are away from home and how nurses take care of their mental well-being. The 100-page book, launched on Wednesday (July 27), is available in digital format on AH's website. Hard copies will be distributed to the Singapore Nurses Association, libraries, 16 acute and community hospitals, nursing students and selected nursing homes. The book comes ahead of Singapore Nurses' Day, which falls on Aug 1. Ms Myint Myint Than, 53, who has been working in Singapore as a nurse since 2001, expressed appreciation for the support of her colleagues at AH after the deaths of her mother and mother-in-law. Her husband, who is from Myanmar, works here and they have one daughter, 29, who lives with them. She ended up specialising in palliative care, where she has had to deal with death on a regular basis. It has not been easy, but she has been able to maintain a positive spirit with support from her colleagues and family. ""I have learnt to think positively while missing them and remember them by the happy memories I have with them,"" she said. Ms Mya Thandar, another nurse at AH who is also from Myanmar, also struggled with not being able to care for her family during the worsening Covid-19 situation in Myanmar last year. Due to Covid-19 travel curbs then, the 32-year-old senior staff nurse at AH's Integrated Care Clinic was not able to visit her family there. But when she learnt that her parents tested positive for Covid-19, she immediately sent health supplements and flu medicine to them. AH nurses conceived of, wrote and edited the book while the photos in it were taken by the hospital's head of allied health Melvin Poon. Efforts to get Missy Reflections II out were led by AH chief nurse Margaret Lee. She said: ""By having this collection of reflections, the public can have a better insight on what nursing entails. It is also a testimony to our nurses that their stories mean a lot."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/nursing-their-passion-for-patient-care-and-recovery,Nursing their passion for patient care and recovery,"An oncology-trained nurse who has been working in KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) since 2004, Ms Teresa Ng has a heart for breast cancer patients. Ms Ng’s dedication to cancer patients began when she was just a teenager taking care of her father who had liver cancer. Her father’s illness drove her to pursue a career in nursing so she could make a difference in the lives of patients with cancer. Today, the biggest challenge for Ms Ng is getting patients to come to terms with their cancer diagnosis so that they receive timely treatment. When patients are in denial, she helps them understand the disease and treatment process, and supports them with evidence-based facts on how breast cancer is treatable and has high survival rates. In addition to seeing inpatients and running an outpatient clinic, Ms Ng chairs a breast cancer support group, KK Alpine Blossoms Breast Cancer Support Group, at KKH — a role she has embraced since 2009. “Patients need support and reassurance not just during diagnosis and treatment, but also after recovery, as there is always a fear of relapse. This is where the support group comes in handy and it is something I am passionate about,” she says.  The support group runs a Blossom Buddy programme, where volunteers, who are breast cancer survivors, share their experiences to help newly diagnosed patients come to terms with their condition. Ms Ng helps by addressing questions on treatment plans. The group also organises activities such as talks on nutrition and Traditional Chinese Medicine, exercise and dance classes, choir sessions, and initiatives in conjunction with the annual Breast Cancer Awareness Month.  For its outstanding work in providing invaluable support to patients and caregivers, the group won the Singapore Health Inspirational Patient Support Group Award in 2016. Her other ventures include a project titled ‘The Yarn Wonders’, which won the Singapore Patient Engagement Initiative Award at the Singapore Patient Conference in 2018. It aims to provide a hand-knitted bag to hold surgical drainage bottles attached to patients after breast cancer surgery, so they can move around with ease. Funds raised from the sale of these bags knitted by the volunteers are donated to the KKH Health Fund to help patients in need and promote early detection of breast cancer. Recently, her team also completed the ‘Knuckle Project’, where they tested the feasibility of knitted prosthetics that can be customised to fit patients better. The self-driven nurse prides herself in doing things differently and is often brimming with ideas for her patients. Winning awards is a great motivation for her team, but her real joy comes from a simple hello from patients who have recovered after treatment. Ms Linda Lim has been fascinated by how the brain works ever since her first encounter with neurosurgery during her first posting as a nurse at National University Hospital in 1997. She joined National Neuroscience Institute (NNI) in 2005 and was subsequently introduced to dementia as a possible area of specialisation just before she embarked on her Master of Nursing in 2010. Prior to this, Ms Lim, like most people, had the misconception that dementia is “all about the elderly population being forgetful and getting lost”. “I learnt that there is so much more to dementia that I didn’t know, especially at NNI where my focus is on young-onset dementia, which afflicts patients between the ages of 30 and 65,” she says. Unlike elderly patients with cognitive impairment who display symptoms of dementia, the investigation and treatment for young-onset dementia is less straightforward. This is because younger patients may initially exhibit bizarre behaviour or have difficulty reading, and they tend to seek out a psychologist or an eye professional, rather than a neurologist. It could take some time before a patient with young-onset dementia develops memory impairment, and by the time they are referred to a neurologist, the condition may have already deteriorated greatly. As the condition of each patient varies, Ms Lim can spend up to two hours addressing the needs, challenges and concerns of both the patient and the caregiver. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, she was involved in organising large-scale events, such as public memory screening and forums, to raise awareness of dementia and young-onset dementia. The comprehensive public memory screening was a free hour-long one-to-one session, and the results were assessed by a team of doctors, nurses and psychologists. Ms Lim hopes that these screenings, which were very well received, can make a comeback soon, as they are an effective platform for getting the public to come forward to receive a cognitive assessment.   Mr Mohammad Najib Ibrahim always knew that he wanted a meaningful job that can help people. Since completing his Advanced Diploma in Gerontology in 2019, he has done just that, as part of the multidisciplinary care team at the Dementia Ward (Ward 58) in Changi General Hospital. The team, comprising doctors, ward nurses and Allied Health Professionals, adopts a Person-Centred Care (PCC) model to care for dementia or elderly patients who are cognitively impaired. The individualised care plan aims to meet the patients’ needs based on their interests, remaining cognitive abilities, personal routines and preferences — an approach that focuses on the person with dementia, rather than the disease. The PCC model of care begins with ward nurses like Mr Najib getting to know the patient through an in-depth questionnaire with the family. This questionnaire sheds light on the patient’s lifestyle habits, preferences and hobbies, and aids the team in customising care for persons with dementia. “For instance, pre-morbid sleeping habits may surface similarly to symptoms of sleep-wake reversal, and the PCC model of care helps avoid unnecessary medical intervention,” he explains. Engagement is key for the patients’ well-being and reduction of behavioural issues. Through understanding the patients’ preferences and hobbies, activities such as music, art and gardening therapy can be customised to engage persons with dementia in a meaningful way as part of their care plans. For nurses and caregivers looking after persons with dementia, it can be challenging as there is no real recovery in sight. Mr Najib recounts an instance when he counselled a caregiver who was on the verge of burnout, as the patient regularly displayed behavioural issues. He encouraged her to see the patient’s behaviour as a result of the medical condition and care for him as the person he is, which helped her to view him from a different perspective. “I think that treating every patient as an individual with his or her own personality encourages me and the team to keep caring despite the challenges, and continue my passion as a nurse,” he says.  This story was adapted from Singapore Health Special Nursing Issue 2022 which was produced in conjunction with Nurses' Day 2022. "
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/askst-will-monkeypox-spread-through-households,Can you get monkeypox from infected household contacts?,"SINGAPORE - More monkeypox cases are expected to surface here in the weeks ahead as more than 18,000 cases have been reported in 78 countries, with the majority in Europe. Singapore saw its first monkeypox case on July 6 and now has six local and five imported cases. None of them is linked, but contact tracing is ongoing. The risk to the general public remains low, but more questions have surfaced as the outbreak - declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on July 23 - develops. The Straits Times answers some of them. A: ""While currently most cases globally are among MSM (men who have sex with men), there is no reason why it cannot spread into heterosexual networks, perhaps among commercial sex workers or the families of affected individuals,"" said Professor Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection. He said more cases are likely as Singapore has a highly mobile population with a large number of sexually active travellers. ""This has been shown through very detailed molecular work by clinician researchers at NCID (National Centre for Infectious Diseases), who demonstrated new strains of HIV (the virus that causes Aids) emerging in Singapore from combinations of strains from Malaysia and Thailand and then moving back across the region,"" he said, referring to a study published in 2011. ""That could well happen with monkeypox, although its mutation rate as a DNA virus is likely to be a lot slower than HIV."" As the size of the outbreak grows in other countries, more imported cases can be expected here, and there is a chance that they may spread monkeypox to their close contacts in Singapore, said Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, an infectious diseases expert and vice-dean of global health at National University of Singapore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. ""At the same time, because we are still seeing sporadic cases with no known links, it seems evident that local transmission of the virus is still occurring."" Currently, Europe accounts for more than 70 per cent of the monkeypox cases. A: ""One of the main modes of exposure for this particular illness is through direct contact... skin-to-skin contact, possibly even face-to-face contact exposure to droplets or virus that may be in the mouth. Many people have lesions in the mouth,"" said Dr Rosamund Lewis, the WHO technical lead on monkeypox. She added that household transmission may begin to occur now. ""In addition to transmission through sexual contact, monkeypox can be spread in households through close contact between people, such as hugging and kissing, and on contaminated towels or bedding,"" said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a press conference on Wednesday (July 27). At the same conference, Dr Lewis said some people have been exposed to monkeypox in a household setting, both in countries where this disease has long been known and now in newly affected countries. A: The United States confirmed two cases in children recently, while Dr Lewis has said that globally, some 81 children under the age of 17 were reported as having been infected. Not every child who contracts monkeypox will develop severe disease but there is a preponderance of children, pregnant women and immunocompromised people among those who do develop severe disease, she said. A: Most cases recover without treatment, but for many people, the disease can be very unpleasant. Dr Tedros said at the press conference that about 10 per cent of the cases are admitted to hospital to manage the pain caused by the disease. Prof Tambyah said almost all the cases have been mild. ""Hospitals are full right now and I think it would be most appropriate for monkeypox cases who need to be isolated to be looked after in some of the community care facilities - perhaps the old one at Pasir Ris could be reactivated,"" he said. A: Two doctors quoted in a July 24 WHO Europe release said they found that the cases they saw did not always have the rash that is considered the typical symptom of monkeypox. The first clinician has seen people with anal, genital and oral ulcers or with no visible ulcers, and swollen lymph nodes, while the other clinician said some patients had a fever, inflammation of their colon and rectum areas, while others had blister-like lesions on their chin, chest and stomach. WHO said symptoms include one of the following:"

But the number of people dying from the coronavirus has surged in recent months - with 168 deaths in the week ending July 25, up from 163 the previous week. Of the 2,093 deaths from Covid-19, more than 2,000 have occurred since March this year."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/new-initiatives-launched-to-help-ex-drug-offenders-get-tested-and-treated-for-hepatitis-c,New initiatives launched to help ex-drug offenders get tested and treated for hepatitis C,"SINGAPORE - Two programmes to help former drug offenders get tested and treated for hepatitis C were launched on Wednesday (July 27), ahead of World Hepatitis Day on Thursday. The Educate, Test, Treat! (ETT) programme aims to educate and provide testing for hepatitis C in high-risk groups such as former drug offenders. Those who test positive for hepatitis C will be referred to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) to receive subsidised treatment under the hospital's End-C programme, which runs concurrently with the ETT programme. Former drug offenders are deemed high risk because hepatitis C can be transmitted through the sharing of contaminated needles, said Dr Yew Kuo Chao, a senior consultant at TTSH. ""We also believe this group is more vulnerable because, over the past 10 years, we have seen around 30 per cent to 40 per cent of former drug users in halfway houses diagnosed with hepatitis C."" As a comparison, only about 0.2 per cent of people in Singapore have hepatitis C, according to the National University Hospital's website. The new initiatives involve 65 former drug offenders for a start, and will expand to cover more than 200 by mid-2023. The programmes are the first in Singapore to focus on high-risk groups to eliminate the transmission of hepatitis C. TTSH is studying the reliability of using a blood sample from a finger-prick and saliva to test the participants for hepatitis C. Current methods require blood to be drawn and tested at clinics or hospitals, explained Dr Yew, who heads the TTSH study. Hepatitis C is spread via blood and bodily fluids. When left untreated, the virus can cause damage to the liver, lead to liver cancer, or even death. It can be treated by taking a course of oral medication for eight to 12 weeks. The ETT programme is started by non-profit organisation HCSA Community Services, coordinated by HCSA Highpoint Halfway House - a residential shelter for recovering drug addicts and ex-offenders - and supported by biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences. It will run with the End-C programme for a year and, if successful, similar programmes will be rolled out nationally. Minister of State for Home Affairs Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, who was the guest of honour at the launch of the programmes at the HCSA Community Services headquarters in Geylang, said the initiatives can correct the misconception that hepatitis C is a virus that cannot be treated. Associate Professor Faishal said: ""Ultimately, the goal of the initiative is to provide participants from the various halfway houses with handy information on hepatitis C, accessible and affordable means to be tested and treated, as well as social support from the community to keep them going on their recovery journey."" Other halfway houses involved in the programmes include Pertapis Halfway House, Selarang Halfway House and The Helping Hand. Former drug offender Harrison Azahari, 50, said he was nervous when he was diagnosed with hepatitis C 10 years ago as there were many misconceptions about the disease then. He did not seek treatment for the disease but as one of the participants in the new programmes, he will soon receive treatment. Mr Azahari, who works in the automotive industry, said: ""There was a lot of stigma relating to hepatitis C. People thought the disease was like HIV (the human immuno-deficiency virus which causes Aids) and not many people knew what it was. But now with the programmes, we are educated on the disease and there is a clearer path to treatment."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/chances-of-a-shoulder-dislocation-are-higher-for-those-active-in-certain-sports-and-activities,Chances of a shoulder dislocation are higher for those active in certain sports and activities,"Among the new lifestyles established during the pandemic, picking up a new exercise habit or sport is probably one of them for many Singaporeans.  From spin classes to mixed martial arts, the choices are aplenty.  According to the Ministry of Health’s National Population Health Survey 2020, 33.4 per cent of Singaporeans aged 18 to 74 engaged in regular exercise, with those aged 18 to 29 exercising the most.  With more physical activity, there is naturally a greater risk of injury. One common injury is a dislocated shoulder, which is when the upper arm bone (known as the humerus) comes out of the shoulder socket.  As the most mobile joint in the body, the shoulder is more unstable and prone to dislocation. In fact, the shoulder is the most commonly dislocated joint in the body. Statistics from the National Library of Medicine show that shoulder dislocations comprise half of all major joint dislocations.  Dr Tay Eileen, a senior consultant and orthopaedic surgeon at StarMed Specialist Centre, observes that shoulder dislocations have become more commonplace in Singapore too. The one-stop private ambulatory care centre, which also offers other health screenings and services by general practitioners, comprises specialist clinics, operating theatres, endoscopy suites and radiology facilities. She attributes this upward trend is likely due to increased activity level among the young and old, and the growing popularity of sports such as bouldering and handball.  Those who are at higher risk of shoulder dislocations are people in their teens or 20s and more so for males as these two groups tend to be more active.   A shoulder usually gets dislocated from traumatic injuries such as breaking a fall on an outstretched hand, which is common among the elderly. People with hyper flexible or loose joints are also more prone to shoulder dislocation.  Direct impact to the shoulder from contact sports such as rugby or football may also cause the shoulder to be dislocated.  It can also occur from hyperextension of the shoulder during sports such as racquet or ball games, and activities such as rock climbing or bouldering. In both a shoulder dislocation and a strain, you may feel a severe or excruciating pain at the moment of injury. However, in a dislocated shoulder, you will not be able to move the shoulder or arm and there will be a visible deformity of the shoulder joint. There may also be numbness, tingling or weakness of the arm, hand or fingers. You may use ice packs or oral painkillers to temporarily alleviate the pain and swelling, and should head to the Emergency Department immediately. Try not to move the arm and support it in an arm sling if possible, advises Dr Tay. There, the doctor will ask you about your medical history and perform a physical examination. You will have to undergo an X-ray to confirm the dislocation and also to rule out other potentially severe complications such as a fracture.  The doctor will then manipulate the shoulder joint back into position while you are under sedation, after which you will take a second X-ray to confirm that the shoulder is back in position.  A person who has previously dislocated a shoulder is at a higher risk of dislocating it again, especially during the first six weeks after the injury. That’s because the soft tissues such as muscles, ligaments, tendons and labrum that help stabilise the joint have been damaged and are in the process of healing. Even after some time, you are still prone to dislocating the shoulder again as the tissues have been torn and become weak.  The younger you are at the time of your first dislocation, the higher the risk of a second dislocation. Dr Tay explains that this postulation is due to factors such as joint mobility, biomechanical properties of the ligaments and muscles that are involved in shoulder stability, as well as increased levels of sporting activity in younger patients which are more likely to be of a higher intensity.  Other complications that may occur with shoulder dislocations are fractures around the shoulder region and nerve injuries. The doctor will put you in an arm sling after returning the shoulder to its normal position. This immobilises the joint and allows it to rest, heal and prevent any movements that may hurt it again.  Icing the affected shoulder several times a day can help reduce the pain and swelling.  You should follow-up with an orthopaedic specialist once the pain and swelling subsides to check for any injuries to the ligaments, tendons, soft tissues and bone.  Physiotherapy is usually prescribed to restore mobility and strengthen the stabilising muscles of the shoulder. Such rehabilitation is important to regain good function of the shoulder and to prevent further dislocation.  Most people can resume normal activities within two weeks but they should avoid heavy lifting and contact sports for at least six weeks. Consult your physiotherapist on when you may return to contact sports.  Dr Tay advises doing regular exercises to stabilise the muscles in the shoulder. At the same time, avoid movements that place the shoulder in a vulnerable position, such as reaching up and behind you, or sleeping with your hand above your head. If such actions fail to prevent recurrent dislocations, the orthopaedic specialist may recommend surgery to restore stability to the shoulder. Visit StarMed for more information. Dr Tay Eileen is an orthopaedic surgeon with a special interest in shoulder and elbow surgery, and sports medicine. She was Head of Division of Shoulder and Elbow at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital. Dr Tay has contributed to national and international presentations such as the 30th Singapore Orthopaedic Association Annual Scientific Meeting in 2007 and the 18th European Federation of National Associations of Orthopaedics and Traumatology (EFFORT) Annual Congress in 2017. Formerly Head of Division of Shoulder and Elbow at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, she continues to teach regularly there, as well as provides on job teaching for registrars, medical officers, residents and house officers."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/nurse-who-helped-patients-adapt-to-life-outside-imh-among-6-presidents-award-winners,Nurse who helped patients adapt to life outside IMH among 6 President's Award winners,"SINGAPORE - At the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), senior nurse clinician Aziz Ab Hamed, 60, has been preparing a selected group of long-staying patients for life outside the hospital. The work started in 2015 when he and several colleagues spearheaded a rehabilitation programme to equip these patients with independent living and vocational skills, to show that it is possible to recover from mental illness. It has since led to the discharge of 120 such patients, whose stay at IMH lasted for about a year to as long as 18 years. They include a man in his 60s now living at a care home and others in their 20s and 30s. The majority have schizophrenia and have never worked. Mr Aziz is among six nursing leaders who are always looking to improve the way things are done, constantly learning and inspiring other nurses to do better. On Tuesday (July 26), they received the President's Award for Nurses, the highest accolade in Singapore's nursing profession, from President Halimah Yacob in a ceremony at the Istana. At IMH, the long-staying patients under rehabilitation had started on soil gardening, among other programmes. Mr Aziz later set up a hydroponics garden where patients grow vegetables, which are now sold at the IMH lobby twice a week. As motivation, the patients - Mr Aziz calls them clients so as not to treat them as patients - are paid a small hourly rate that corresponds with the difficulty level of the work, from seed sowing to transplanting, harvesting and so on. He also started a fund with the excess money, and set up a cafe in the long-stay wards to train selected patients in cooking local dishes and kitchen management skills, and is thinking up new projects to help his patients. ""In the past, we made sure they ate and slept well. Now, we embrace recovery,"" which meant teaching the patients the skills to survive on their own, said Mr Aziz. ""I believe I can do more to instil hope in my clients, to make their lives more meaningful."" Before joining nursing 30 years ago, Mr Aziz, who is divorced with two adult children, had worked as a birdkeeper, a production operator and forklift driver. ""I always dream big, and would advise them (new nurses) to take small steps to reach their dreams,"" said Ms Julia Eng Chui Lee, 47, deputy director of nursing at KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH). She studied to be an advanced practice nurse (APN) in Melbourne, Australia, in 2002, and has since groomed 34 APNs, who can diagnose and manage chronic illnesses as well as provide complex nursing care to patients. Ms Eng, who also leads KKH's nursing research and nursing education department, started several APN clinics, including one in 2015 where gynaecological cancer patients consult an APN to prepare for their surgery. This has helped to cut their post-surgery stay from seven to eight days to two to three days, she said. The nurses would check to see if the patients are malnourished and need nutritional tips, or are frail and need a referral to a physiotherapist, for instance. ""A lot of times, with bad news, they can't retain information very well and so when they come (to see us), they still have a lot of questions,"" said Ms Eng, whose work may also involve end-of-life care for patients. Married with two teenagers, Ms Eng also finds time to lecture at two schools. At Assisi Hospice, senior nurse educator Liu Fang, 42, played a major role in developing a workshop to help staff handle the challenging communication with patients and their families in a palliative care setting, which was made worse by the Covid-19 pandemic. ""The most important part of palliative care education is shaping the right attitude and mindset,"" said Ms Liu, adding that it is about getting nurses to truly understand the philosophy of palliative care, and not just help patients to die peacefully but to live well till the end. For Ms Zhang Di, 46, an APN and assistant director of nursing at Sengkang General Hospital (SKH), her contributions to community nursing are obvious, among her many achievements. She set up SingHealth's first Community Nurse Post in a senior activity centre and was instrumental in the development and delivery of geriatric-care training at SKH. Ms Png Gek Kheng, 50, became the chief nurse at Changi General Hospital (CGH), with more than 2,500 nurses under her in the middle of the pandemic in 2020. This saw her having to rally staff through innumerable workflow changes in order to continue caring for patients in the hospital and migrant worker dormitories, where swab operations and medical posts were set up. She is also an APN and co-director of the CGH Wound Healing Centre, the idea for which started a decade ago with a task force she set up to address the pressure injuries of the patients. Ms Png, who took up nursing in 1993, believes in challenging herself and her colleagues to re-imagine the role of nurses in a multi-disciplinary team. At Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Ms Nirmala Karmaroon, 56, deputy director of nursing, led the nursing team through the surges in Covid-19 cases. Among her achievements in a field that she entered as a teenager 40 years ago was managing manpower planning to ensure patient care could be maintained alongside a balance in nurses' work lives. Lifelong learning is a common thread among the awardees. If they are not pursuing a course, they are busy imparting knowledge to other nurses or nursing students, or contributing to the development of new nursing frameworks. Age is no barrier. For instance, Mr Aziz pursued a Masters of Nursing (Mental Health) at the National University of Singapore at the age of 48. He was the oldest student in the course. Ms Zhang is doing a doctorate in nursing practice at Duke University. The President's Award for Nurses started in 2000, and has since recognised 90 recipients, including the latest awardees, for sustained outstanding performance and contributions to patient care delivery, education, research and administration, said the Ministry of Health."

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/7th-and-8th-cases-of-monkeypox-confirmed-in-singapore,Singapore reports 7th and 8th cases of monkeypox ,"SINGAPORE - Two more cases of monkeypox were reported on Sunday (July 24), one a 46-year-old man from Estonia and the other a 26-year-old Singaporean man. This brings the total number of cases detected here to eight, comprising four local and four imported cases. None has been linked to another. In updates on monkeypox on its website, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said the Estonian man came to Singapore from London on July 21. He tested positive for the disease on Sunday after developing rashes in the groin area, and had fever and swollen lymph nodes.  The Singaporean man developed rashes in the groin area as well as other parts of his body, and also tested positive on Sunday. Both of them were taken to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases and are in stable condition. The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Saturday declared monkeypox a global health emergency, with more than 16,000 cases confirmed in 70 countries and territories worldwide.  It is the strongest call to action that the global organisation can make, signalling a new sense of urgency and scale of a disease that had previously been primarily found in western and central Africa. Covid-19 was given the same label back in 2020. In a statement to The Straits Times on whether Singapore will change domestic or border restrictions following WHO’s decision, MOH said the authorities have already put in place the majority of WHO-recommended monkeypox measures since May. These include protocols for isolating confirmed cases and quarantining close contacts for 21 days from the date of exposure. Lower-risk contacts are put on phone surveillance for 21 days, the maximum incubation period for the virus. MOH said the healthcare system has the expertise and capability to effectively test, diagnose and treat monkeypox infections. It has been engaging those who are more at risk, which studies have shown are mostly men who have sex with men. Professor Roy Chan, founder and president of non-profit organisation Action for Aids, said it is important to raise awareness of the infection in the gay and bisexual community without making moral judgment, so that those who are infected feel safe to seek treatment when symptoms surface.  He said: “We don’t want to stigmatise the disease, stigmatise the people who are potentially infected. Otherwise, it is driven underground and that is where the threat lies.” Comparing the wave of monkeypox infections with the Aids epidemic in the 1980s and 1990s, he said the two diseases, while affecting the same community, have notable differences. Prof Chan said: “HIV, in the early days, we didn’t know what it was until a few years later.” The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes Aids, or the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. “Monkeypox, we know exactly what it is. There was also no treatment for HIV and it was almost universally fatal. It had a much longer period of (being) asymptomatic when its spread was possible, unlike monkeypox, which is short and clears on its own,” he said. A study published in the New England Journal Of Medicine last week said 95 per cent of monkeypox cases were transmitted through sexual activity. It is, however, not a sexually transmitted infection in the traditional sense as it can also be passed via close physical contact. Professor Dale Fisher, who is on the WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, noted that the impact of monkeypox is unlikely to be on the same scale as that of Covid-19.  “With Covid-19, it was serious, unusual, impacted international trade. Much of those aren’t ticked for monkeypox. Most people don’t regard it as likely to impact international trade. There has been five deaths out of the 16,000 cases, so it is not overly lethal,” said Prof Fisher, a senior consultant at National University Hospital’s Division of Infectious Diseases. WHO’s decision to call it a global health emergency is primarily a call to action, shaking up countries that might have been underestimating monkeypox’s spread, he added. “The decision doesn’t create a whole lot of money or activity... But the longer you don’t call it a public health emergency, it may be interpreted by some countries as ‘Okay, it is not something we need to worry about’,” he said. Health Minister Ong Ye Kung on Monday said in a Facebook post that each monkeypox case so far typically generates three to four close contacts who require quarantine - unlike Covid-19, which may generate up to 20 quarantine orders. The ministry is closely monitoring developments, he said. “As of now, given the self-limiting nature of the disease, MOH does not recommend the mass vaccination of the whole population against monkeypox because the benefits do not outweigh the risk,” he added. Monkeypox symptoms include rashes, fever, muscle aches, chills and swollen lymph nodes. For most people, it is a mild infection that resolves itself within three weeks, although it is more of a concern among vulnerable people with weakened immune systems or women who are pregnant."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/large-scale-restrictions-here-unnecessary-despite-who-declaring-monkeypox-global-emergency-experts,"Monkeypox declared global emergency: Large-scale restrictions in S'pore unnecessary, say experts","SINGAPORE - Experts here have said there is currently no need for any widespread or major health restrictions to stem the spread of monkeypox. This comes after the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared monkeypox a global health emergency on Saturday (July 23). Over 16,000 cases have been detected in more than 75 countries, up from about 3,000 in end-June. Six cases have been reported in Singapore as of Sunday (July 24), all of which are men. Following the WHO's announcement, there was speculation online about whether Singapore may see the return of large-scale restrictions seen during the Covid-19 pandemic. On Sunday, Dr Khoo Yoong Khean, scientific officer at the Centre for Outbreak Preparedness in Duke-NUS Medical School, told The Straits Times that monkeypox is a ""very different"" disease from Covid-19. He pointed out that unlike Covid-19, which could be transmitted through droplets in the air, monkeypox is primarily transmitted through close, prolonged contact with an infected person. ""Therefore, there will unlikely be lockdowns or large-scale social or movement restrictions for now,"" he said. Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, vice-dean of global health at the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, agreed. ""I think the reason to have restrictive measures will be to control or slow down the spread of a contagious disease. However, such measures must be effective, and must do less harm than the disease... I can think of no really good restrictive measure that will effectively block the spread of monkeypox in Singapore,"" he said. Prof Hsu also highlighted that the vast majority of monkeypox cases thus far have been ""among networks of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men"" - a fact that WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Saturday. ""Transmission through close skin-to-skin contact has largely been attributed to the clustering of social and sexual networks in this population. ""Contact tracing has been challenging not just in Singapore but also elsewhere partly because of the discrimination faced by this group of people - they are less likely to seek help or healthcare earlier, or to name their sexual partners even when they are known,"" said Prof Hsu, adding that measures such as mask-wearing and physical distancing would not help prevent the spread of the disease. Instead, he said, there is a need for better surveillance and better education so that people can seek medical attention more quickly, take necessary precautions and refrain from high-risk activities. Dr Khoo said that for now, targeted measures such as early testing, isolation of people when infectious, and contact tracing among high-risk populations and close contacts will be the main measures to stop the spread. Those with a travel history from countries with high numbers of cases should also be encouraged to monitor themselves for any symptoms. Dr Rayner Tan, visiting research fellow at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said members of the public can protect themselves by limiting close contact with those who are symptomatic, and exercising caution in settings that are conducive for skin-to-skin or close face-to-face contact, such as venues with sex on premises or large gatherings like dance parties. He added that those experiencing symptoms of monkeypox, including fever, lesions and blisters, enlarged lymph nodes and exhaustion, should seek immediate medical help. Dr Tan, who is also vice-president of the Society of Behavioural Health, Singapore, said: ""It is important to note that anyone may be susceptible to monkeypox, and there have now been early reports of infections among children elsewhere. Stigmatising its transmission will undermine public health efforts to limit the further spread."" Dr Khoo added: ""It is (important) to ensure the communication is managed accurately so as to avoid any potential stigma and create trust between authorities, the public and the affected population. This is critical to stopping the spread."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/hsa-to-introduce-a-voluntary-database-for-approved-supplements-tcm,"HSA to introduce voluntary consumer database for supplements, traditional medicine","SINGAPORE - The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) will be introducing a voluntary notification initiative for companies that deal with health supplements and traditional medicines from Aug 1. The initiative, which will be rolled out in phases, aims to establish a database of safe and certified health products that consumers can refer to before buying. HSA said this will allow for better traceability and follow-up actions by the agency if there are safety or quality issues. The initiative will be the first publicly available database of its type by the agency, a HSA spokesman told The Straits Times. Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary said in a speech at the 31st Singapore Pharmacy Congress on Saturday (July 23): “We hope pharmacists will play an important role in supporting this initiative by advising patients and consumers to refer to this database when considering suitable health supplements and traditional medicines.” HSA will start with commonly bought products, such as vitamin and mineral supplements, and products at higher risk of adulteration, such as those for weight loss, pain relief and male vitality enhancement. The subsequent phases will gradually include other product categories.
HSA said it conducted industry consultations and received their support prior to launching the initiative. This comes after recent cases in which people suffered adverse effects after buying health supplements and products. For example, in June 2018, a woman in her 20s experienced rapid heartbeats, anxiety, dizziness and lethargy after consuming Nutriline Bluvelle - a slimming product that claimed to be “natural” and “safe”.  She had purchased the product from an online shop based in Malaysia. The product was then tested by HSA to have contained a banned ingredient, sibutramine, which has been withdrawn from Singapore since October 2010 due to an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes. The authority prohibits the addition of medicinal ingredients such as steroids and sets strict limits on toxic heavy metals in health supplements and traditional medicines. It is each individual company’s decision to submit a voluntary notification to be included in the database. Products on shelves at stores such as supermarkets, and Watsons and Guardian outlets, will remain available. To be included, companies need to be locally registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority. They must also provide HSA with the relevant documents to demonstrate that their products meet the necessary safety and quality standards. Only products that are compliant with the necessary regulatory standards will be included in the database. Companies may start submitting their documents from Aug 1 and a fee is not required to submit a product notification. Further information on the submission procedure and requirements is available on the authority’s website. The HSA will also be holding training sessions to assist companies and will share more details with the industry at a later date."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/covid-19-vaccination-appointments-required-at-polyclinics-for-those-under-80,Covid-19 vaccination appointments required at polyclinics for those under 80,"SINGAPORE - Individuals under 80 years old who want to get their Covid-19 vaccinations at polyclinics here will now have to book appointments to do so. This is to allow the 23 polyclinics here to better handle patients with pressing healthcare needs, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Friday (July 22). The past two weeks have seen a significant increase in the daily average number of patients with acute respiratory infection - from Covid-19 as well as other infections - at the polyclinics, the ministry noted. ""Only seniors aged 80 years and above can continue to walk in to receive their vaccinations,"" it added. Instead, members of the public are encouraged to go to any one of the 10 joint testing and vaccination centres (JTVCs) across the island for their vaccinations. No appointments are needed for these visits. Meanwhile, adult emergency departments at public hospitals handled an average of about 2,500 patients per day over the past two weeks, up from the usual average daily load of about 2,000, MOH said. The children's emergency departments at KK Women's and Children's Hospital and National University Hospital each saw an average of about 680 patients daily over the last two weeks, up from the usual average of around 450 per day. About 40 per cent of these cases did not require emergency care, MOH said, adding that such cases at emergency departments divert medical care away from those who genuinely require urgent medical attention. It urged the public to seek medical treatment at hospital emergency departments only for serious or life-threatening emergencies, such as chest pain, breathlessness and uncontrollable bleeding. ""This allows those with severe illness in need of emergency care to be attended to quickly and helps to preserve our hospital capacity for those who truly need acute hospital care,"" MOH said. National University Health System (NUHS), which operates four hospitals and seven polyclinics in the west of Singapore, told The Straits Times that patients who require care will continue to be attended to. However, it urged members of the public to visit general practitioners or 24-hour clinics for non-emergency cases.  “We seek the public’s understanding that longer waiting time is expected at our emergency departments and priority will be given to patients with more serious conditions and who require admission,” said an NUHS spokesman.  MOH added that while the greater attendance and longer wait times at emergency departments and polyclinics may frustrate some patients and their families, they should treat healthcare workers with respect, and not harass or abuse them. In addition, MOH said that the Jurong and Yishun polyclinics, which currently offer the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, will offer only the Novavax vaccine from Aug 12. The two polyclinics will continue to offer Pfizer-BioNTech jabs to those who wish to take the second dose of their primary vaccination series or booster shots until Aug 5. Those who wish to get the protein-based Novavax vaccine – which was approved for use among those aged 18 and above here in February – can also do so at the JTVC in Bishan as well as at the 20 Public Health Preparedness Clinics here, the ministry added. "
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/more-than-3200-covid-19-patients-have-been-prescribed-oral-antiviral-drugs-moh,"More than 3,200 Covid-19 patients have been prescribed oral antiviral drugs","SINGAPORE - More than 3,200 patients across all healthcare settings have been prescribed either Paxlovid or Lagevrio, which are oral antiviral drugs that are being used to prevent people from falling very ill with Covid-19, as at July 10, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Thursday (July 21). All polyclinics and 133 Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) can now prescribe the two antivirals for Covid-19 patients who are at risk of severe disease and who are assessed by their doctor to be clinically eligible to receive the treatment, said a spokesman for MOH. Singapore's Health Sciences Authority authorised the emergency use of Pfizer's Paxlovid on Jan 31 and MSD's Lagevrio, otherwise known as molnupiravir, on April 19. On July 5, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said that all polyclinics and more than 103 PHPCs can offer the oral tablets. The use of the drugs will help ensure that most people who contract Covid-19 can continue to be treated outside of hospitals, even as cases rise, he added. So far, the vast majority of Covid-19 cases in Singapore, especially those who have been vaccinated and have received their booster shots, have had mild symptoms and did not require oral antiviral drugs, said the MOH spokesman. These drugs must be given early, within five days of illness, and are available only via prescription. They can be considered for those who are assessed by their doctor to meet certain criteria. These include Covid-19-positive patients aged 18 and older, and are at risk of developing severe disease (such as those who are 60 years and older, regardless of their vaccination status; or have active cancer or serious heart, lung or kidney conditions) or are on ongoing immunosuppressive treatment. The decision to take Paxlovid or Lagevrio should be made after discussion with the doctor on the benefits and risks, the spokesman said. Paxlovid, for instance, is known to interact with a long list of drugs. MOH said it will continue to fully cover the cost of the use  of the drugs in primary care settings for now, regardless of a patient's vaccination status, as the drugs can reduce the likelihood of high-risk patients developing severe Covid-19 and requiring hospital admission. The spokesman added that the charging policy for Paxlovid and Lagevrio will be reviewed in due course. Meanwhile, elsewhere, some people, including United States President Joe Biden's top medical adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, have reported falling sick again shortly after their initial recovery, in what is sometimes called the Paxlovid rebound. Still, Dr Fauci said in late June that the drug did what it was supposed to do by keeping him out of hospital. When asked about this, the MOH spokesman said: ""Viral rebound is an uncommon phenomenon which has thus far been reported in international studies in a small percentage of patients after treatment with Paxlovid."" Generally, such patients show mild symptoms which were resolved without any further treatment, he said. Correction note: Health Sciences Authority authorised the emergency use of Pfizer's Paxlovid on Jan 31 and not Jan 21. We are sorry for the error."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/askst-how-long-is-the-isolation-period-for-monkeypox-patients,Can monkeypox be transmitted asymptomatically?,"SINGAPORE - With more than 14,000 monkeypox cases reported in more than 70 countries and territories mostly since May, the World Health Organisation (WHO) will hold an emergency meeting on Thursday (July 21) to decide whether the outbreak constitutes a global health emergency. WHO's emergency committee for the monkeypox outbreak met for the first time on June 23, and on June 25, the global health body said the outbreak did not constitute what it calls a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). There have been five deaths in this monkeypox outbreak, all in Africa. In Singapore, the authorities have registered six cases of monkeypox, three  of which are local cases. None of them is linked. Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, an infectious diseases expert at National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said the local cases are generally similar to the global ones, and are neither more nor less worrying in that regard. ""But the presence of unlinked cases means we will likely see more cases of local monkeypox cases in the near future, and that the outbreak in Singapore has not been controlled yet,"" he said. ""The silver lining is that the number of cases remains very small, with new cases popping up sporadically rather than in increasingly large numbers."" In the past, the disease would surface incidentally in humans, and usually sporadically in forested parts of Central and West Africa, where it is endemic. In the current outbreak, monkeypox started spreading quickly in Europe, which experts have linked to raves and the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer or questioning) Pride events there. It is almost certainly transmitted via close contact during sexual intercourse, said Prof Hsu. Most of the cases in the current outbreak are being spread in networks of men who have sex with men. Overseas, monkeypox cases were picked up at sexual health clinics when people sought help for what they thought was a sexually transmitted infection. In Singapore, the Department of Sexually Transmitted Infections Control (DSC) clinic, run by the National Skin Centre (NSC), has seen one confirmed monkeypox case, said Professor Roy Chan, a senior consultant and medical adviser at NSC. A: ""We don't know as yet, but asymptomatic cases of monkeypox have been described during this outbreak, which is novel in the sense that we had previously assumed that virtually all monkeypox cases would have symptoms and the rash,"" said Prof Hsu. The extent of asymptomatic cases and whether these can spread the virus are still unknown at this stage, he added. When asked the same question, Associate Professor Lim Poh Lian, the director of the high-level isolation unit at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), said: ""We never say never in medicine, but most monkeypox cases are spread by close skin-to-skin contact, and through contaminated bedding."" The question has a familiar ring to it, as in the early days of the Covid-19 outbreak, experts had expected that only symptomatic cases could spread the disease, but it turned out otherwise. However, there are very clear differences, including the current main transmission mode and the fact that monkeypox is not a new disease. ""With all diseases, there are major modes of transmission and minor modes,"" said Prof Lim from NCID. ""We should be aware of all the ways monkeypox can spread. But it is helpful to focus on what the current evidence shows us, which is (that it is) mainly spread by symptomatic cases through intimate contact."" A: ""We do not know for sure yet whether the current monkeypox virus spreading globally is truly more contagious. But human behaviour is fuelling this current rapid spread, coupled with the fact that many infections are... very mild,"" said Prof Hsu. While the current outbreak could lead to the emergence of variants that may be more transmissible or virulent, it would generally not be dramatically more transmissible or virulent, he said. A: Most monkeypox cases recover well. Prof Lim said the fever lasts two to three days usually, and is generally mild. New skin blisters will continue to develop over a week or so, then take two weeks to dry up, and for the scabs to fall off and for new healthy skin to form, she said. ""The scabs are infectious, so the infectious period, when the individual has to remain in isolation to prevent the spread of infection to others, is likely to be three weeks or more."" Young children, pregnant women and persons with weakened immune symptoms may experience more severe disease. There have been overseas reports of cases requiring ICU care but those remain very rare. A: Generally, no specific antiviral treatment is needed for mild cases, said Prof Lim. ""However, we do have antiviral medications, such as cidofovir, which can be used. Such medications have known risks, so we would use them only if the patient's clinical condition warrants it."" A: Monkeypox symptoms include fever, body ache and a rash. The rash may start out as a small pimple in parts of the body that don't usually get pimples, like the genital area, but over a few days, these develop into blisters. Some people also get swollen lymph glands in the groin along with the blisters, Prof Lim said. A: Monkeypox is usually considered mild, and most people recover without treatment. However, it is frequently uncomfortable or painful, said a July 15 release from the WHO office in Europe. In the United States, reports have mentioned painful lesions in the anus, genitals and mouth. In the WHO release, a monkeypox patient said he had first fallen ill with fever, and then his lymph nodes felt achy, really painful and swollen. Initially, one blister, the size of the tip of a pen, appeared on his nose, but it got bigger and more painful, he said. ""Due to the lesions in my throat, I couldn't swallow, eat or drink. That was painful,"" he said. He was put on heavy painkillers, on antibiotics because of a secondary bacterial infection, and fed through an intravenous drip. It was severe but he is better, he said in the release. A: Smallpox vaccines are being used as the monkeypox virus is closely related to the virus that causes smallpox. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration or FDA has licensed two vaccines – Jynneos and Acam2000 - for use against monkeypox."

Bone health is often not the first thing on a person’s mind when it comes to health. However, it is important to prevent weakened bones, particularly in old age, so that we can continue with our everyday activities. As we age, more bone is broken down than is replaced by new bone, and losing too much bone mass can lead to osteoporosis, a disease that causes brittle bones. When your bones are weak, a simple fall can lead to a serious fracture, which will affect quality of life. In this episode, ST senior health correspondent Joyce Teo hosts Dr Tan Li Feng, the deputy head of geriatric medicine at Alexandra Hospital, about the importance of screening for osteoporosis. They discuss her paper on the impact of frailty, falls and cognition on osteoporosis management in the oldest old, the treatment options for osteoporosis, as well as the foods that are good for your bones.  *Bone density mineral scans are available at various places, including some polyclinics. To do the scan at the polyclinic, a referral is needed. At Alexandra Hospital, for instance, this scan costs $50-$70 for subsidised patients or $150 for private patients, Dr Tan said.  Highlights (click/tap above): 1:18 How do age, frailty, and cognitive impairment link to the management of osteoporosis? 2:19 When should you get your bones screened and treated? 6:48 What can you do to prevent osteoporosis? 9:56 Treatment options for osteoporosis 12:29 Diet tips to prevent osteoporosis; vitamin D & calcium supplements recommended?

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/tablets-exercises-keep-needy-kidney-patients-engaged-at-new-sembawang-dialysis-centre,"Tablets, exercises keep needy kidney patients engaged at new Sembawang dialysis centre","SINGAPORE - A new dialysis centre in Sembawang offers kidney patients more than just a shorter trip to get their regular treatments. Under a trial, they get to use computer tablets and take part in exercises, all while seated in their chairs during their four-hour dialysis sessions. San Wang Wu Ti-KDF Dialysis Centre in Admiralty Link - which was sponsored by San Wang Wu Ti Religious Society - was opened by Kidney Dialysis Foundation (KDF) on Wednesday (July 20). It is equipped with 19 haemodiafiltration (HDF) machines, which can serve 114 patients at any one time. HDF, an advanced form of dialysis, is gentler on the patient's body and reduces side effects of treatment such as blood pressure fluctuations and muscle wasting. During their dialysis, patients will be provided with tablets packed with entertainment and educational resources such as digital health brochures, recipes and pre-recorded health webinars. Specialists from fitness company Retrofit will also lead them in exercises meant to strengthen patients' muscles and reduce their risk of falls. If the trial is successful, KDF may consider extending it to its other three centres in Bishan, Ghim Moh and Kreta Ayer. Meanwhile, the foundation will work with the nearby Canberra Community Club to engage residents, providing them with complimentary health talks and encouraging them to participate in KDF's community outreach programmes. Speaking at the centre's opening ceremony, KDF chairman Lim Cheok Peng said the location was chosen as KDF already has centres in the western and central regions, and there is a need to serve underprivileged kidney patients in the northern area of Singapore. Its patients are those who earn the lowest 10 per cent of income in Singapore, more than half of whom have a monthly per capita income of no more than $1,000. Dr Lim said: ""KDF will continue to dedicate resources and knowledge to breach awareness gaps in society, lift the spirits of the ill and make a difference in the lives of those in need."" Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary, who was guest of honour at the opening, called end-stage renal disease a ""growing nationwide concern"", with about six people here diagnosed with kidney failure every day, up from four in 2011. ""We have to deal with this trend. We cannot wish it away, it is there, it is worrying, it is serious,"" he said, calling for a multi-pronged approach to tackle the disease. Highlighting the importance of early intervention to prevent kidney failure, Dr Janil said that one of the key focuses of the Healthier SG strategy - unveiled earlier this year - is to enable primary care doctors to play a greater role in the management of chronic conditions. But, noting that they alone will not be enough, Dr Janil said community healthcare providers like KDF will play an important role in Healthier SG too, as it has built up close relationships with patients and their families, and is an established, trusted partner of many community organisations. One of the patients who will benefit from the new centre is 75-year-old housewife Zawiah Man, who first became a patient with KDF about 10 years ago. Previously, her daughter, Ms Azzurra Abba, a 39-year-old patient care officer, had to take her on a 30-minute taxi ride thrice a week to the nearest dialysis centre in Bishan. The new centre is just a 10-minute taxi ride from the family's home in Yishun. Ms Azzurra said: ""We can now leave home a little bit later. It's accessible and convenient... (And) we can help my mother manage her condition better with more support materials (provided)."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/four-year-old-girl-who-died-of-covid-19-initially-tested-negative-0,Four-year-old girl who died of Covid-19 initially tested negative,"SINGAPORE - Though Raisya Ufairah Mohammed Ashraff began showing symptoms such as fever and sore throat on July 15, the four-year-old tested negative on Covid-19 antigen rapid tests. This was two days after the family's domestic helper had tested positive and subsequently kept to her own room, said Raisya's mother, Ms Mardalina Mohamed Nossi. But Raisya's condition took a turn for the worse on July 17, and she died that night in hospital. She was the second child under 12 here to die of Covid-19. On June 27, a 1½-year-old boy died of encephalitis - inflammation of the brain - due to Covid-19 as well as the respiratory syncytial virus and enterovirus. The Ministry of Health (MOH) said Tuesday (July 19) that Raisya had no past medical history and was previously well. ""She developed symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection and fever on July 15, and tested positive for Covid-19 via an antigen rapid test on Sunday at a general practitioner clinic,"" said MOH. She was prescribed medications for her symptoms but remained unwell, and collapsed later that night, the ministry added. Ms Mardalina, a teacher who also has twin sons aged 10, told Berita Harian that her daughter had tested positive for the coronavirus at a clinic on Sunday afternoon.  Later that night, Raisya began vomiting and foaming at the mouth when she was giving her medicine, with the four-year-old later losing consciousness. Ms Mardalina rushed the girl to a nearby clinic, but along the way decided to call an ambulance.  She was advised over the phone to place her daughter on the ground next to the road.  A passer-by tried giving Raisya cardiopulmonary resuscitation before the ambulance arrived, Ms Mardalina said. Throughout the journey to the hospital, paramedics told her they were trying to find Raisya's pulse. But two hours after arriving at the hospital's accident and emergency department, her daughter died, she said. ""After the doctor confirmed she had died, I spoke to Raisya and told her, mummy accepts that you are gone forever. Go play in heaven,"" she said, her tears flowing."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/new-drug-promises-more-effective-treatments-for-eye-conditions,New drug promises more effective treatments for eye conditions,"SINGAPORE - About three years ago, Mr Jaya Pragas started seeing a black dot in his right eye, which obscured two-thirds of his vision in that eye. ""I thought I was going to be blind,"" said the now 61-year-old, an operations executive with the Singapore Prison Service. He initially thought he might need spectacles, but when he got his vision tested at an optical shop, the staff there realised he might have a problem with his vision and suggested he make an appointment with a specialist. In early 2020, the former prisons officer visited the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC) and found that he had neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) - a condition which affects the part of the eye that provides the sharp vision needed for activities such as reading and driving. He regained most of his vision in six months, after receiving treatment which involved having medication injected into his eye every month. He has to continue receiving these injections to maintain his eyesight. Now, a new drug aims to more effectively treat those suffering from nAMD and diabetic macular edema (DME) - or vision loss resulting from diabetes. Developed by the Singapore Eye Research Institute (Seri) and Swiss pharmaceutical firm Roche, Vabysmo was approved by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) last month. Vabysmo neutralises two proteins that destabilise blood vessels and cause them to leak, increasing inflammation of the eye that leads to vision loss. DME and nAMD are among the most common retinal conditions here, noted Professor Gemmy Cheung, who is head of retina research at Seri and head of the medical retina department at SNEC. Some 10 per cent of diabetic patients in Singapore may require treatment for DME, while 0.5 per cent of the population here may suffer from nAMD, she said. One advantage of the new treatment is the longer intervals between treatments, said Roche ophthalmology patient journey partner Resheeban Selvarajah. ""A large proportion of patients were able to go between three and four months, and there were at least 50 per cent of patients with DME who were able to go four months between the injections,"" said Dr Resheeban. He hoped this would reduce the burden on patients to go for treatments, and that the longer intervals between injections could translate into greater cost savings for patients. Roche declined to reveal the cost of the new drug. Mr Jaya - who started taking Vabysmo earlier this year and is expected to be on the treatment until next year - said he is grateful for the less frequent injections, which he credits with helping to maintain his eyesight. ""Now my eyes are perfect,"" he said."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/askst-what-do-we-know-about-the-oral-antiviral-drugs-used-to-treat-covid-19,askST: What do we know about the oral antiviral drugs used to treat Covid-19?,"SINGAPORE - Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said on July 5 that all polyclinics and more primary care clinics here can now prescribe oral antiviral drugs to eligible Covid-19 patients. This is to ensure that most people who have contracted Covid-19 can be treated outside of hospitals, even as coronavirus cases rise, driven by the latest Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5. These oral tablets are now available at all the polyclinics in Singapore as well as at more than 103 Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs). Elsewhere, Australia has just widened access to these oral antiviral drugs from July 11 so that more people, including all Australians aged over 70 who test positive for Covid-19, can access them. The Straits Times answers some questions you may have about these drugs: A: Singapore's Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has authorised the emergency use of two oral treatments for Covid-19. The first is Pfizer's Paxlovid, which is a combination of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir tablets. HSA approved it under the Pandemic Special Access Route on Jan 31 and by March 24, it was available at three polyclinics and 20 PHPCs. The second one is molnupiravir, which has the brand name Lagevrio and is developed by MSD - known as Merck in the United States. HSA gave the authorisation on April 19. Both oral antivirals help to reduce the risk of hospitalisation and death. A: The oral treatments are meant for those aged 18 and above who have tested positive for Covid-19, have mild to moderate symptoms and are at high risk of becoming very sick. These include people who are immunosuppressed, have risk factors such as heart failure or diabetes, or are fighting a cancer. These oral antiviral tablets are available only via prescription. Treatment must be started within five days of the onset of Covid-19 symptoms - the earlier, the better. Paxlovid is given as a course of three tablets (two tablets of nirmatrelvir and one tablet of ritonavir), to be taken twice a day for five days. Treatment with Lagevrio - or molnupiravir - requires that you take four tablets twice a day, for five days. A: Antivirals work by stopping the coronavirus from spreading in the body. Paxlovid contains nirmatrelvir, which targets the 3CL-like protease, a key enzyme the coronavirus needs to replicate, and ritonavir, which helps to keep nirmatrelvir active in the body for longer by inhibiting its breakdown. Molnupiravir works by inducing mutations in the viral RNA, stopping the virus from replicating. A: Both Paxlovid and Lagevrio have been shown to be effective in reducing hospitalisation and death from Covid-19, though the latter has a lower efficacy. Lagevrio has been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalisation and death among people at risk of developing severe Covid-19 by 30 per cent. In contrast, Paxlovid has been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalisation and death in high-risk patients by nearly 88 per cent when given within five days of symptom onset. Generally, Lagevrio may be considered as an alternative, if Paxlovid is not suitable for the patient. HSA has said that Lagevrio may be suitable for patients who are at risk of progressing to severe Covid-19 but not suited for the other available treatment options. Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases physician at Rophi Clinic, said that Paxlovid has been shown to be effective against coronaviruses, including variants of Sars-Cov-2, but a big worry is that it can interact with many drugs, including cholesterol medicine, anti-depressants and the blood thinning medication warfarin. Paxlovid is also not suitable for those with severe kidney disease. So, those who need the drug may not be able to use it, he said. Molnupiravir was not designed to treat Covid-19, but it can potentially attack all kinds of RNA viruses, regardless of their mutations, and does not have any known drug interactions, said Dr Leong. It is, however, not recommended for pregnant women, women who are breastfeeding, or those below 18 years of age. ""With molnupiravir, you do not have to worry about undiagnosed kidney issues or unknown drug interactions, but you have to contend with a lower efficacy,"" said Dr Leong. He said he prescribes oral antivirals to those who are showing symptoms and have at least one risk factor for severe Covid-19, such as a serious heart condition, chronic obstructive lung disease, obesity or cancer. People over the age of 60 are considered to be at risk of severe disease, even if they are fully vaccinated and boosted against Covid-19, but doctors would assess their health and symptoms before prescribing the drugs. A: Some people, including President Biden's top medical advisor Dr Anthony Fauci, had reported falling sick again between two and eight days after their initial recovery. Still, Dr Fauci said in late June that the drug did what it was supposed to do by keeping him out of hospital. In a late May advisory, the US' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that a brief return of symptoms may be part of the natural history of a Sars-CoV-2 infection, and had nothing to do with the Paxlovid treatment or one's vaccination status. It added that there was no evidence that additional treatment was needed. ""The hypothesis is that the body's immune system hasn't kicked in sufficiently to suppress the virus,"" said Dr Leong. ""The medicine just helps control the infection but it doesn't totally wipe out the virus in the first five days. It is up to the immune system to provide a second level of defence, but in some individuals, it kicks in later."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/nearly-800-students-receive-degrees-from-nus-medical-school-amid-covid-19-challenges,Nearly 800 students receive degrees from NUS medical school amid Covid-19 challenges,"SINGAPORE - Sexual health and challenges faced by the transgender community do not usually come to mind when people think of the medical profession, but they are among important issues Dr Ching Ann Hui and Dr Yuki Ong hope to spotlight. In 2019, they started health podcast Third Spacing, which takes its name from the medical term for the movement of fluid between cells and vessels. The series has since racked up nearly 50 episodes covering such topics, and features doctors who have taken unconventional career paths such as going from running a private practice in Singapore to working in Afghanistan. Dr Ching, 25, wants to improve marginalised populations' access to healthcare. ""As doctors, our work is focused on the body, and some of these topics will inevitably be messy. We have to be very cognisant of where our audience comes from, what their background is, and we work from there (to approach these issues),"" she added. She is one of more than 280 undergraduates from the National University of Singapore Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine who received their bachelor's degrees on Sunday (July 17). Some 500 students from the school were also conferred graduate degrees that day, bringing NUS' 28 commencement ceremonies this year to a close. They include medical practitioners, biomedical scientists and healthcare administrators. Manpower Minister Tan See Leng, an alumnus, said doctors should continually thirst for knowledge, explore new frontiers and stay true to the profession's values. ""Covid-19 was the crisis of your generation, but it will not be the last pandemic. Disease X will demand young people like you to be daring, imaginative and to pioneer breakthroughs in your respective fields,"" said Dr Tan, who was guest of honour at the postgraduate ceremony. New healthcare innovations and technologies were developed at an unprecedented pace during the pandemic, he said, adding that researchers around the globe raced against time to work on Covid-19 vaccines and artificial intelligence was harnessed to develop predictive technologies that saved numerous lives. Dr Tan reminded doctors about the importance of having strong principles. ""It may be tempting to fall back into the chase of the usual brass rings that society typically exhorts us to covet - fancy titles, bigger corner offices, more material possessions. This road may work for some, but it will come at huge costs and sacrifice, and it may also distract you from what is most important. ""Once you strip away the technological developments, healthcare is fundamentally a mortal enterprise. When you have a patient entrust their life to you, or when you see the labour of your work benefit countless others, then you will realise when medicine really becomes a fulfilling calling,"" he added. Second Minister for Health Masagos Zulkifli, who was guest of honour at the undergraduate ceremony, said the Class of 2022 has persevered and succeeded despite challenges brought on by the pandemic, such as less on-site clinical training in healthcare institutions and more campus-based learning. ""As we move towards normalcy, it is timely for us to rethink what healthcare should look like, post-pandemic,"" said Mr Masagos, who is also Minister for Social and Family Development. He added that doctors are at the heart of the Healthier SG movement, which aims to deliver more coordinated care. ""Many of you will be the first point of contact for Singaporeans. Beyond drug prescriptions and medical advice, you will have the responsibility of supporting patients in making healthier lifestyle choices,"" he said. Dr Teo Yao Hao, who received his bachelor's degree and is currently a house officer at Singapore General Hospital, also hopes to make an impact through research. The 25-year-old has had his research on topics such as sleep apnea published in more than 40 peer-reviewed journals. He said: ""When you treat a patient, you'll always be asking 'What else can I do for him? Is there anything better I can do to make sure he gets home earlier and doesn't come back to hospital so soon?' These are questions that we answer."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/askst-can-i-donate-blood-if-i-had-covid-19,askST: Can I donate blood if I had Covid-19?,"SINGAPORE - With blood stocks here running low, what should you know before donating blood? The Straits Times gets the answers from the Singapore Red Cross (SRC) and the Health Sciences Authority (HSA). A: Blood donors here should be between the ages of 16 and 60 and weigh at least 45kg. Those aged 17 and younger must get their parents' consent before donating blood. They will also need to have a haemoglobin level of at least 12.5g/dl for women and at least 13g/dl for men, with haemoglobin tests conducted at the donation site. Haemoglobin is a specialised protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the tissues and takes carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs. The HSA recommends that donors eat iron-rich foods in the weeks before donation to ensure a healthy level of haemoglobin. They should also not show symptoms of infection - such as sore throat, runny nose or diarrhoea - in the past week, and not had a fever in the last four weeks. Potential donors will need to fill in a questionnaire on their medical history before donating blood. A: Blood donations can be made at one of Singapore's four blood banks - at HSA in Outram, Dhoby Ghaut, Westgate Tower and the Woodlands Civic Centre. Potential donors can also visit this website to check for upcoming community drives in their area, or make an appointment. A: People with a prior Covid-19 infection can donate blood only at least 28 days after first testing positive to ensure that they have fully recovered. In addition, those who recently received a shot of a Covid-19 vaccine must wait before donating, said HSA. Those who have taken an mRNA vaccine such as those by Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, or either the Sinovac or Sinopharm vaccine, can donate blood a week after getting the shot if they do not show any side effects. But those who suffer muscle aches or pains at the site of the injection must wait a week after the pain vanishes. People who develop side effects such as fever or chills after any Covid-19 vaccine must wait at least four weeks after the side effects have been resolved before donating blood. Those who have taken virus-vector-based or live attenuated vaccines - such as those from AstraZeneca or Johnson & Johnson - or other types of vaccines must also wait at least four weeks after vaccination or after any side effects have been resolved, whichever is longer. Those who have dengue fever can donate blood only six months after a full recovery. If a member of your household has dengue fever, you should wait at least four weeks before donating. Those whose hypertension, or high blood pressure, is being treated by a single medication and have no other related complications can donate blood if their blood pressure is within the acceptable range on the date of donation. But people who take more than one type of medication for hypertension cannot donate blood. Similarly, people whose diabetes is controlled by diet or are on a single oral diabetes and have no other related complications may donate blood. Those on multiple oral diabetes drugs or insulin therapy cannot donate blood. Potential donors will have to answer questions on their travel history before donating blood. People who have travelled within the last four months may be subject to travel-related donation restrictions and should check their eligibility with HSA. Travelling to certain countries or regions may make you ineligible for blood donation for a period of time due to the higher risk of infection from blood-transmitted diseases such as malaria or the West Nile virus, said SRC. SRC recommends that people donate blood before travelling overseas to avoid any inconvenience."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/more-than-3000-people-turn-up-to-give-blood-after-red-cross-appeal-for-a-o-donors,"More than 3,000 people turn up to give blood after appeal for donors","SINGAPORE - An appeal to donate blood as supplies run low has drawn an overwhelming response, with more than 3,300 people coming forward over the past week. This represents a 43 per cent increase from a typical week's collection, said the Singapore Red Cross (SRC), which is the Republic's national blood donor recruiter. ""We hope that this momentum will continue next week to bring our blood stocks up to healthy levels,"" said the humanitarian organisation. Located at the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) building in Outram Road, the Bloodbank@HSA - one of four blood banks across the island - was packed when The Straits Times visited on Friday (July 15). Among the donors there was Mr Goh Chee Wee, who said it was his first time donating since 1996. Work and other commitments, which often require him to travel, left little time for him to donate blood in the years since then, said the 43-year-old army regular. He was there with about 40 others from his unit, which had made an informal request for servicemen to volunteer to donate blood that day. Mr Goh, whose blood type is A+, said he was inspired by recent social media posts put out by Health Minister Ong Ye Kung, who shared SRC's call for blood donors to come forward. He added that as a sergeant major, he felt it was important to lead by example. Full-time national serviceman Eldridge Surianto was a first-time blood donor. The 19-year-old, who has O+ blood, said his decision to donate blood was a personal one - he has relatives who required blood transfusions because of cancer treatments. ""I was quite nervous at first,"" he said, noting that he had heard that giving blood could cause dizziness. ""But after this experience, I don't think it's that scary,"" said Mr Surianto, adding that he would consider doing it again in future. On July 8, SRC had called for more blood donors, said a spokesman, as there was less than nine days' worth of A+ and O+ blood then. A healthy stockpile of at least 12 to 15 days worth of blood is needed, with at least a nine-day supply of blood for possible civil and medical emergencies, the spokesman added. ""If the trend continues and (stock) falls to critical level, elective surgical procedures will have to be postponed in order to conserve the blood supply for life-saving emergencies."" Among the factors affecting the Republic's blood supply is the current wave of Covid-19 infections, said SRC. ""Many regular donors whom we have reached out to are either down with Covid-19 or have had close contact with Covid-19-positive individuals,"" said the SRC spokesman. Those infected by Covid-19 need to wait at least 28 days after first testing positive before they can donate blood. This is to ensure that they have fully recovered. SRC said blood collection during the June school holidays also tends to be lower, adding that blood banks are closed during public holidays. It had also called for donors during Singapore's circuit breaker period in 2020, when blood stocks fell to critical levels amid movement restrictions aimed at stopping the spread of the coronavirus. Other countries have also experienced blood shortages as the pandemic continues. In January, the American Red Cross said it was facing what it described as its ""worst blood shortage in over a decade"", stating that it had been experiencing low blood donor numbers since August 2021, when the Delta variant began spreading. There had been a 10 per cent decline in the number of people donating blood since the beginning of the pandemic, the American Red Cross said then. SRC also called on those with rhesus (Rh) negative blood groups - namely those with O-, A-, B- and AB- blood types - to come forward to donate as the blood stocks for these groups are also low. Only about 1 per cent of people in Singapore are Rh-negative, with AB- being the rarest of the negative blood types, SRC said. The organisation urged those with negative blood groups to donate regularly, given the scarcity of their blood types."

Both individuals had recently travelled to India and had immediately self-isolated after testing positive for Covid-19, said the Ministry of Health on Saturday in response to queries by The Straits Times. They have since fully recovered. The emerging Omicron sub-variant was first detected in India in early May. The BA.2.75 variant, nicknamed ""Centaurus"", has been detected in other countries like the United States, Britain, Australia, Germany and Canada. Scientists have reportedly said the BA.2.75 variant may be able to spread rapidly and get around immunity from vaccines and previous infection. The BBC reported on Friday that it was not yet clear whether this sub-variant was one to worry about or not. MOH said there is currently no evidence to indicate the sub-variant has substantially different virulence or severity compared with its Omicron predecessors. The ministry noted that as at Thursday, the World Health Organisation has classified BA.2.75 as an Omicron sub-variant under monitoring. The Guardian reported that WHO's chief scientist, Dr Soumya Swaminathan, said there were not yet enough samples to assess its severity. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control designated the BA.2.75 variant as a variant under monitoring on July 7. This means there are indications it could be more transmissible or associated with more severe disease, but the evidence is weak or has not yet been assessed. In Singapore, as at Saturday noon, there were 9,153 new Covid-19 cases recorded, according to MOH's daily update. The week-on-week infection ratio is 1.03. There were 771 patients hospitalised, with 17 in intensive care and 98 requiring oxygen support. There were three deaths reported. Of the new local cases, 762 were detected through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Another 7,929 were detected through antigen rapid tests (ART), which means they had no symptoms or their symptoms were mild. There were 462 new imported cases, with 45 detected through PCR tests and 417 through ART. Singapore has recorded a total of 1,589,099 Covid-19 cases and 1,450 deaths.

The Singapore Red Cross (SRC) and Mr Ong had appealed last week for donations of A+ and O+ types, with at least 600 units of A+ blood and 1,200 units of O+ blood needed in the next two weeks, failing which major elective surgical procedures requiring the two blood types would have to be postponed. While Mr Ong did not state the number of units of each blood type donated since his post last week, he said the 45 per cent increase is ""a strong sign of unity and support from everyone."" However, he urged eligible donors to continue to come forward, as ""all our blood stocks are not at healthy levels yet. The blood stocks for the negative blood groups (A-, B-, O-, AB-) are also currently running low."" SRC said in a statement last week that the low A+ and O+ stocks were due to high usage of these blood types and lower-than-normal donor turnout. While the organisation activated donors of the two blood types on Thursday last week through SMS and social media platforms, many they called have contracted Covid-19. Singapore is currently experiencing a wave of Covid-19 infections, with the Ministry of Health attributing the increase to the spike that is normally seen after a long weekend.  "

In an update on its website on Thursday night, the ministry said the patient is a 41-year-old male Singaporean. The patient is not linked to any of the monkeypox cases announced by MOH earlier. He developed genital rashes on July 9 and sought medical care on Tuesday. He was subsequently admitted to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Wednesday and tested positive for monkeypox on Thursday. The patient remains warded in NCID and his condition is stable, the ministry said. Contact tracing is ongoing. This comes a day after Singapore reported its second local case - a 48-year-old British man residing in Singapore - who tested positive for monkeypox on Wednesday. None of the cases reported here so far are linked. Monkeypox is a rare viral disease, with those infected usually experiencing fever, headache, muscle ache, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills, lethargy and skin rash. Most patients recover within two to three weeks, MOH had said previously, though it noted that young children, pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals are among those at higher risk of severe illness. Some 9,200 cases of monkeypox have been reported across 63 countries this year, the World Health Organisation said on Tuesday. The United Nations agency said on Thursday that it will convene a second emergency meeting of its expert monkeypox committee on July 21 to decide whether the outbreak constitutes a global health emergency."

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/new-hospice-services-in-outram-mark-another-big-step-forward-in-end-of-life-care,New hospice services in Outram mark another big step forward in end-of-life care,"SINGAPORE - At day hospice centre Oasis@Outram, cancer patient Allan Wong, 82, is free to do anything he likes. On Wednesday (July 13), he approached Health Minister Ong Ye Kung and asked to have a wefie taken, promptly sending it to his 78-year-old wife. Mr Ong was there to officiate at the first-of-its-kind day hospice centre that offers patients the freedom to choose the activities and services they want, instead of a pre-decided programme. It also has a cafe and a bar, unlike conventional centres. Oasis@Outram, located at Outram Community Hospital, is HCA Hospice's (HCA's) third day hospice. The second, HCA Kang Le Day Hospice, opened officially in late 2014 at the void deck of a block of flats in Marsiling. The first was launched in 1995 and became known as HCA Day Hospice @Serangoon, after HCA moved its headquarters to Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital in that area. The HCA centres offer more than 60 per cent of the day hospice capacity in Singapore, said Mr Ong in his speech. While the awareness of day hospice services remains relatively low, it is growing. Such services started in 1993, with one centre. The second opened in 1995, and the remaining three sprang up in the past three years, Mr Ong said. These services play an essential role in end-of life care, an area that the Ministry of Health is prioritising. ""We aim to strengthen end-of-life care, to help people maintain quality of life even in their final days, and leave well,"" he said. In particular, the model of care at Oasis@Outram, which focuses on the personal growth of patients on the last leg of their life journey and aims to help reframe the thinking on dying, is one that signals a positive step forward in this area. It shows how end-of-life care can be brought into the community in a dignified and meaningful way. Mr Ong said the centre's co-location with Outram Community Hospital offers a continuum of care for palliative care patients transiting from the hospital to home. Oasis@Outram's day paediatric hospice services are also unique, though it can take in only three patients a day. The space for paediatric patients comes with a ceiling hoist to transport the children to the jacuzzi for a soak. For the adults, the activities at the new 900 sq m facility include art and craft, horticulture, manicures, movies in a mini-theatre and mahjong in a room that gives off a bit of a casino vibe with its heavy, dark curtains. These are all free for the terminally ill patients, who are referred there. While many are seniors, some are young people, like 27-year-old Benjamin Lim, who has a brain tumour. He said he was not used to socialising with so many seniors at the start, and would visit the centre twice a week, but now comes as often as five days a week. HCA's medical director Chong Poh Heng said: ""The message is that despite a very serious illness, you can still have a good time... We hope to debunk the myths and some of the fears associated with suffering from a serious illness."" Oasis@Outram, which opens five days a week with a current staff strength of 15, can take up to 48 palliative patients, though it now serves about 30 a day. HCA chief executive Karen Lee said there is demand for day hospice services generally, though it is not overwhelming. However, manpower constraints are a big challenge. She said there are plans to extend the opening hours to 7am to 7pm, from about 8.30am to 6pm currently, but that will require another 10 or more staff. Right now, its Kang Le Day Hospice is full, with up to 22 patients a day, but the Serangoon centre remains temporarily closed, after some patients were moved to Oasis@Outram while others have died. Mr Wong, who has stage four appendix cancer and lives with his wife, goes to the centre three days a week to socialise, play mahjong or do flower arrangement. He also teaches others how to use the centre's app to book the activities, and said he was halfway through teaching another patient when she stopped coming. ""She died,"" he added. Since Oasis@Outram started operations in July 2021, it has served 173 adult patients and 24 paediatric ones. They stay for an average of 95 days. The centre is funded and conceptualised by Lien Foundation in collaboration with HCA and other experts in the field. ""For the terminally ill, health may appear to be a futile goal. But that is actually when it matters most. Mental, emotional and spiritual health can provide what the body can't,"" said Mr Lee Poh Wah, chief executive of Lien Foundation. ""So while it is a hospice day centre, Oasis@Outram is a demonstration project for other eldercare services. Senior day centres and nursing homes should be reimagined as oases - flourishing, life-giving sanctuaries."" Mr Lee said if he has the chance, he would model a centre on the concept of a cruise ship, where there are casinos and lifestyle activities. ""Whether you're old or if you're dying, ultimately, I think we are all dying to be delighted,"" he added."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/falling-immunity-and-better-detection-behind-dengue-outbreak-expert,Falling immunity and better detection behind rise in dengue cases: Expert,"SINGAPORE - The spike in dengue cases this year can be attributed to lower immunity in the population from historical falls in infections and better detection of cases, said a public health expert. Better diagnostics have led to more infections being diagnosed, Associate Professor Alex Cook from the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health told The Straits Times. More than 19,000 cases of dengue have been reported so far in 2022, based on figures from the National Environment Agency (NEA) - nearly a fourfold increase from the 5,258 cases reported last year. Prof Cook said the soaring rate of dengue cases this year is mainly due to conducive weather conditions for mosquito breeding and the circulation of DenV-3 virus, to which the population has lower immunity. The dengue tally to date is also more than half of the 35,315 cases reported in 2020 - the worst dengue outbreak in Singapore's history, claiming 28 lives. There have been four deaths so far in 2022, said Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and the Environment Baey Yam Keng earlier this month. There are 343 dengue clusters still active, with 119 of these having 10 or more cases and designated as high risk. The largest, at the Toh Tuck estate along Upper Bukit Timah Road, has recorded 529 cases. At construction sites, 73 stop-work orders have been issued this year. Five are still active as of last Friday. The NEA has carried out around 389,000 inspections in the first half of this year, uncovering 10,800 mosquito breeding habitats. It noted that at least half of these breeding sites are found in homes. On their part, home owners can opt for devices like In2Care's mosquito traps, which utilise a fungal-based larvicide that kills mosquito larvae before they reach the pupal stage. The larvicide is also spread to other breeding sites via female mosquitoes. The product is not yet licensed for consumer use as the trap needs to be professionally maintained to ensure its efficacy, but Singaporeans who wish to deploy it in their homes can do so through pest control companies such as Rentokil, PestBusters or Anticimex. Prof Cook said Singaporeans could take precautions such as wearing long sleeves or applying mosquito repellent. Spraying store-bought insecticide indoors is another option, he added. ""There are places the mosquito likes to rest so spraying there can help reduce the density. Finally, you might consider installing anti-mosquito screens on windows like they do in Japan,"" Prof Cook said."

There were about 760 calls a day on average in the first week of July - with the highest being 810 - said the SCDF on Friday night (July 8). Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the average daily number of EMS calls was around 550. ""If EMS calls continue to climb, the public may experience delays in ambulance response, particularly for less critical medical incidents,"" the SCDF said in a Facebook post. It is monitoring the situation closely and has implemented various measures to manage the increase in calls. These measures include adjusting the deployment of ambulances to areas with a high rate of medical emergency calls, and prioritising its response to life-threatening cases. Patients assessed by paramedics to have non-emergency medical conditions will not be taken to hospital, said the SCDF. ""Our 995 call-takers, paramedics and front-liners are doing their best to provide swift conveyance to hospital for people with life-threatening and emergency medical conditions."" The public is encouraged to refrain from calling 995 if they are not suffering any life-threatening or emergency medical conditions. Critical emergencies include sudden onset of chest pain, breathlessness, drowsiness or confusion, sudden onset of limb or body weakness, speech difficulty or face drooping, severe bleeding from injury, loss of consciousness, and unexplained body jerking or fits. ""By doing so, SCDF can continue to provide swift conveyance to those who require our emergency medical services,"" it added. The Singapore Red Cross (SRC) is appealing for people with A+ and O+ blood types to donate blood, with stocks of both types running critically low, the organisation said on Friday. ""We need 600 units of A+ blood and 1,200 units O+ blood over the next two weeks,"" said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung on Facebook on Friday. Otherwise, major elective surgery requiring these two blood units will have to be postponed, he added. SRC said the low stock was due to high usage of these two blood types, and lower-than-normal donor turnout. While the organisation activated donors of the two blood types on Thursday through SMS and social media platforms, many they called have contracted Covid-19. Singapore is currently experiencing a wave of Covid-19 infections, which reached 12,784 new cases on Tuesday, the highest since March, when it was more than 13,000. There were 9,284 new cases on Friday, with 653 people in hospitals, 14 in the intensive care unit and one death. SRC has urged all healthy individuals with A+ and O+ blood types, between 18 and 60 years of age, and weighing at least 45kg, to help. Interested donors can visit giveblood.sg to check their eligibility and make an appointment, or walk into any blood bank or community blood drive to donate."

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/insured-patients-with-ip-riders-can-now-choose-from-potentially-more-than-1000-specialists,"Insured patients with IP riders can now choose from potentially more than 1,000 specialists","SINGAPORE - People with Integrated Shield Plan (IP) riders will have more doctors to choose from - potentially more than 1,000 specialists in the private sector - while still enjoying an annual payment cap of $3,000. As at the end of May, the seven IP insurers had fewer than 200 to around 750 doctors on their panels. While all the insurers have agreed to a new initiative by the Life Insurance Association Singapore (LIA) that will greatly expand the list of specialists patients can tap, the actual implementation may vary. Called the extended panel, it was a recommendation by the Multilateral Healthcare Insurance Committee appointed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) last year to look into health insurance issues raised by concerned parties. It is currently available to all rider policyholders, except for those with NTUC Income and Singlife with Aviva, for whom it becomes effective as their contract is renewed from April this year. About 2.9 million people here have IPs, which sit atop the basic national health insurance, MediShield Life, to pay for non-subsidised care. To prevent a ""buffet"" syndrome of excessive spending, MOH requires all IPs to have an annual deductible of $1,500 to $5,250 (based on ward class and age of patient) and a co-payment of 10 per cent of the rest of the bills. More than 1.7 million IP holders also bought riders to take care of the portion of medical bills they have to pay. Following studies showing that people who do not need to pay a cent of their medical bills tended to spend a lot more on treatments, MOH made it mandatory for patients who buy riders from March 8, 2018, to co-pay 5 per cent of their bill, with the rider picking up the rest. But it allowed insurers to cap the patient's share of their bills to $3,000 a year if the treatment has either been pre-approved, or is done by specialists on the insurer's panel. This led to complaints of limited choice by both patients and specialists in the private sector. IP insurers had promised to increase the number of doctors on their panels - to between 250 and more than 500 by the end of last year. Most have made good on the promise. A joint release on Friday (July 8) by LIA, the Singapore Medical Association and the Academy of Medicine Singapore said the new initiative will ""give policyholders certain key panel benefits, even when seeing specialists from other insurers' panels, as long as the specialists comply with the insurers' terms, including fees"". With the move, patients with riders can enjoy a wider choice of specialists for non-emergency treatments. A private specialist who is not on the patient's insurance panel but is on the panel of another insurance company can submit a standard pre-authorisation request to the patient's insurer. The release said: ""The insurer will assess medical necessity and fee appropriateness to decide on the IP coverage and provide an assurance of payment prior to the planned treatment."" Insurers pay doctors differently for treatments. The difference in fees they are willing to pay for a similar treatment could vary significantly. Doctors on an insurer's panel have agreed to those fees. If the request is approved, the patient's share of the bill will be capped at $3,000 a year should his total medical bill exceed $60,000. This will potentially give patients access to 84 per cent of the 1,287 private specialists - this number excludes back-end specialists, such as pathologists, who are already on an insurer's panel. The release said the scheme ""gives a specialist who is currently not on the patient's IP insurer main panel an opportunity to establish a working relationship with the insurer"". This initiative has no impact on the more than one million people with IPs but no riders."

A visit to a general practitioner seemed to confirm this, as an electrocardiogram and X-ray did not turn up any serious issues, and the Singapore permanent resident was prescribed painkillers. However, the pain and breathing difficulties worsened after Mr Zhao played soccer on June 25, with the back pain spreading to his chest as well. He was admitted to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital emergency department, where he was found to have suffered a heart attack. ""It was shocking,"" said business development manager Ginger Jiang, 34, of her husband's diagnosis. She noted he was a non-smoker, exercised regularly and had no family history of heart attacks. Every year, one in 10 heart attack patients here has no standard risk factors for the condition, a new study by the National University Heart Centre, Singapore (NUHCS) found. These patients have an 80 per cent increased risk of death following a heart attack compared to those with risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. They also have a 150 per cent greater chance of suffering a stroke following an attack, as well as 30 per cent increased chance of cardiogenic shock, which causes unstable blood pressure, the study found. The study - which examined 8,680 patients who had experienced heart attacks between January 2011 and March last year - found that 746, or about 8.6 per cent of cases, had no such risk factors. Of those without conventional risk factors, 87 died, making up 11.7 per cent of those without such factors. In comparison, only 5.5 per cent of those with conventional risk factors died after a heart attack. The average age of those without risk factors who died was 57, compared to 61 for those with risk factors. ""Often patients without risk factors come in and ask why me, 'why did I have a heart attack despite me taking care of my body (and) despite me being active with a good lifestyle?',"" said the study's principal investigator Nicholas Chew, a senior resident at the NUHCS cardiology department. Some possibilities are that these patients may be genetically predisposed to high-risk heart attacks, as well as have risk factors that are considered non-standard, such as fatty liver disease or blood clotting disorders, Dr Chew told reporters on Friday (July 8). The findings contradict the common perception that significant coronary artery disease is an unlikely health concern for those without conventional risk factors, said co-investigator Loh Poay Huan, a senior consultant with the NUHCS cardiology department. Clinicians should raise their guard when seeing patients without such risk factors but displaying symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular diseases, he said. ""The message to the general public is really to not ignore symptoms of chest pain, even in those without risk factors,"" said Dr Chew. Further studies are needed to assist clinicians to identify such at-risk people, he said, adding that he expects NUHCS to begin such a study in about a year. Though Mr Zhao is still uncertain about why he suffered a heart attack, he said he is faring well and the experience has only strengthened his resolve to live healthily. He told reporters he intends to give up alcohol as well as switch to less strenuous exercises such as swimming once he is able to resume exercising."

They include 30 pilgrims who were found to be Covid-19 positive, added Mr Masagos, who is leading this year's haj delegation. Saudi authorities allowed them to proceed as they had either recovered or had only mild symptoms, he said to Saudi media. Only one pilgrim is in a slightly more serious condition, added Mr Masagos, without providing further details. He noted that the Saudi authorities would accompany the pilgrim in question to perform the remaining rites to complete the haj. In a Facebook post, Shahidah Travel and Tours managing director Ayoob Angullia said that while some of the pilgrims travelling with the company had earlier contracted Covid-19, they have since recovered. All 192 pilgrims who registered with Shahidah arrived safely in Arafah as at Thursday, he said. The wukuf, or standing, in the plain of Arafah - located about 20km south-east of Mecca - is the most significant ritual of the annual pilgrimage, which is one of the five pillars of Islam. Muslims who are physically and financially able to do so are expected to perform the pilgrimage at least once in their lifetime. ""Thankfully, all the pilgrims have been taking care of themselves, putting on their masks (and) their interactions have been well controlled,"" said Mr Masagos, who is also Minister for Social and Family Development. This has controlled the spread of Covid-19 among pilgrims despite their close living conditions, he added. Mr Masagos said feedback from the various tour agencies leading the pilgrims indicated that they are satisfied with the service provided by the Saudi authorities and officials from the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore. This year marks the first time Singapore Muslims have been able to go for the haj since the Covid-19 pandemic began two years ago. In 2020, restrictions aimed at stopping the spread of the coronavirus barred foreigners from performing the haj, limiting it to just 10,000 Saudi residents. The following year, up to 60,000 fully vaccinated Saudi residents were allowed to perform the pilgrimage. Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Hajj and Umrah announced in April that one million pilgrims would be able to do so this year, of whom 850,000 would be from outside the country. Though Singapore was initially allocated 407 places, the number was later expanded to 900 - matching the Republic's quota prior to the pandemic."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/singapore-confirms-another-imported-case-of-monkeypox,Singapore confirms another imported case of monkeypox,"SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Thursday (July 7) confirmed another imported case of monkeypox in Singapore. The patient is a 36-year-old male Indian national who lives in Singapore and had recently returned from the United States, said MOH. He tested positive for monkeypox on Thursday and is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). The man is not linked to the earlier monkeypox cases, the ministry said. It added that contact tracing is ongoing. ""The case developed anal discomfort on June 28, and other symptoms, including rashes typical of monkeypox, progressively over the next few days,"" MOH said. On Wednesday, the man sought medical care and was taken to NCID on the same day. Last month, Singapore reported its first imported monkeypox case since 2019 - a 42-year-old British man who works as a flight attendant. The country reported its first local case of monkeypox on Wednesday - a 45-year-old male Malaysian national. He tested positive on Wednesday, and is currently hospitalised at NCID. His condition is stable. All three cases are not linked. MOH said that the risk of monkeypox transmission remains low given that it requires close physical or prolonged contact.  Monkeypox is typically a self-limiting illness where patients recover within two to four weeks, said MOH, although a small percentage of those infected can fall seriously ill or die. Those particularly vulnerable to complications are young children, pregnant women or those who are immunocompromised.  MOH added that the monkeypox situation would continue to be monitored closely and public health responses would be calibrated as necessary.  Returning travellers, especially those from areas affected by monkeypox, should seek immediate medical attention if they develop any disease symptoms within three weeks of their return, and inform their doctor of their recent travel history. These symptoms include sudden onset of high fever, swollen lymph nodes and rashes."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/askst-should-singaporeans-worry-about-monkeypox,Should S'poreans worry about monkeypox?,"SINGAPORE - Monkeypox cases continue to spring up in Europe and, on Wednesday (July 6), Singapore reported the first local case - a 45-year-old man who lives here. He is not linked to the country's first imported case, which was announced on June 21, and contact tracing is ongoing, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). Globally, there are now more than 6,000 cases recorded in 59 countries, with the epicentre currently in Europe. Experts are concerned because the virus is spreading from human to human, and cases are popping up in places that had not seen the virus previously. Monkeypox has been endemic in Central and West Africa. The World Health Organisation (WHO) had deemed the outbreak not a public health emergency of international concern in late June. However, on Wednesday, its director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he will hold a second meeting of the emergency committee on monkeypox during the week of July 18, or sooner if needed. A: Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said monkeypox is unlikely to become a global pandemic like Covid-19, as transmission requires close or prolonged physical contact with infectious persons or contaminated material. The WHO said the spread from person to person has been known in the past to generally require prolonged close contact, such as face-to-face contact in close proximity, or skin-to-skin physical contact. Mr Ong also said that monkeypox is typically a self-limiting illness where patients recover within two to four weeks. Some people can fall seriously ill or even die, and those particularly vulnerable to complications are young children, pregnant women or immuno-compromised individuals. So far, though, the data from Europe, where the majority of monkeypox cases were reported, show that 99 per cent are men, and many self-identified themselves as men who have sex with men. The WHO said the outbreak continues to primarily affect men who have sex with men who have reported recent sex with one or multiple male partners. This suggests that there is no signal of sustained transmission beyond these networks for now, it added. A: Sexual contact is an example of close physical contact, through which monkeypox is spreading. There is currently no evidence to show that the disease is sexually transmitted, but direct skin-to-skin contact with lesions during sexual activities can spread the virus, said the WHO. The risk of monkeypox is thus not limited to people who are sexually active or men who have sex with men, it added. The WHO also said that monkeypox rashes are sometimes found on genitals and in the mouth, which is likely to contribute to transmission during sexual contact. Furthermore, monkeypox rashes can resemble some sexually transmitted diseases, including herpes and syphilis. ""This may explain why several of the cases in the current outbreak have been identified among men seeking care in sexual health clinics,"" it said on its website. A: Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, an infectious diseases expert at National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said while monkeypox spreads via close contact, it does not spread as efficiently as chickenpox, Covid-19 or even the flu. ""So, we will have sporadic cases and clusters while the international outbreak is ongoing, but not a large uncontrollable epidemic in Singapore,"" he added. ""The current infections are also mild, compared to historical reports. Outside of Africa, there has hardly been any deaths."" Reports of severe illnesses have also been few, he noted. The WHO has confirmed three deaths, in Africa. A: Avoid close contact with people known or suspected to have monkeypox. MOH also advises the public to exercise personal responsibility by monitoring their personal health and maintaining good hygiene, especially when they are travelling. If you do need to have physical contact with someone who has monkeypox because you live together, for instance, you should encourage the infected person to self-isolate and cover any skin lesion if he or she can, according to advice from the WHO. ""When you are physically close to them, they should wear a medical mask, especially if they are coughing or have lesions in their mouth. You should wear one also,"" the WHO said. ""Avoid skin-to-skin contact whenever possible and use disposable gloves if you have any direct contact with lesions. Wear a mask when handling any clothes or bedding if the person cannot do it himself or herself."" A: MOH currently does not recommend mass vaccination against monkeypox because the risk to the general public is low. This is also in accordance with the global guidance from the WHO. Professor Dale Fisher, an infectious disease expert from National University Hospital,  told The Straits Times previously that the world does not have a large stock of smallpox vaccine - that is used now for monkeypox - because smallpox has been eradicated for decades now. He added that vaccination could be used as an early treatment in immuno-compromised patients to prevent their health from further deteriorating. A: This is because monkeypox is a cousin of smallpox, though a much milder one. Its virus is closely related to the virus that causes smallpox and past data has shown that the smallpox vaccine is about 85 per cent effective in preventing monkeypox. In Singapore, the authorities have said that the smallpox vaccine may be used for certain groups of people, such as those who will directly and frequently work with infectious monkeypox cases or specimens. MOH has said that it is evaluating this vaccination for protection before potential exposures on a case by case basis. A: MOH said cases will be isolated in hospital, and their close contacts will be quarantined for up to 21 days from the last date of exposure, for monitoring. These contacts are also offered smallpox vaccines to reduce their risk of infection or severe symptoms. A: Experts believe that vaccinating a person - particularly one who is at higher risk of severe disease - ideally within four days of exposure, may prevent the disease from taking hold in the person. This is known as post-exposure prophylaxis or PEP. The WHO said PEP may be given for up to within two weeks of exposure, particularly to those at risk of ongoing exposure. A: Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease, which means it spreads between animals and people. It was first identified in monkeys in 1958 but the source of the disease remains unknown, and it is most often transmitted by rodents. The first human case of monkeypox surfaced in 1970, in the Democratic Republic of Congo - a nine-month-old boy in a a region where smallpox had been eliminated in 1968. The disease was brought to international attention only in 2017, when large numbers of cases were reported in Nigeria at the end of that year, particularly as two cases were ""exported"" to Britain, said Prof Hsu. The number of human cases has fallen since. However, monkeypox is now being reported in previously unaffected regions, and spreading. A: The Republic reported one imported case - a Nigerian tourist - back in 2019. Prof Hsu said the cynomolgus monkeys or long-tailed macaques that led to the identification of monkeypox back in 1958 had either transited through Singapore or were caught locally. Two outbreaks occurred among the monkeys at Statens Serum Insititut in Denmark then. The researchers then identified the monkeypox. In the paper written on this, they said the monkeys came from Singapore. A: The WHO said people who have been vaccinated against smallpox are likely to have some protection against monkeypox. Younger people would not have been vaccinated against smallpox because smallpox vaccination stopped worldwide after the dreaded highly contagious disease became the first human disease to be eradicated in 1980. In Singapore, compulsory smallpox vaccination for children ended in March 1981. A: No, the viruses that cause chickenpox and monkeypox are vastly different, said Prof Hsu. A: The incubation period (interval from infection to onset of symptoms) is usually from six to 13 days but can range from five to 21 days, according to the WHO. The symptoms can include fever, intense headache, back pain, swollen lymph nodes, muscle aches, low energy and skin rash or lesions. However, the monkeypox cases in the current outbreak have been atypical. The WHO said many cases in newly affected areas are not presenting the classically described clinical picture for monkeypox (fever, swollen lymph nodes, followed by centrifugal rash). In past cases, the skin eruption typically started within one to three  days of the appearance of fever. Currently, among the cases who reported at least one symptom, 81 per cent had systemic rash (widespread rash on the body), 50 per cent had fever and 41 per cent had genital rash, said the WHO. Also, the atypical symptoms seen now include a localised rash with as little as one lesion. A: According to MOH, he first developed lower abdomen skin lesions on June 30, and experienced fatigue and swollen lymph nodes on July 2. On July 4, he developed fever and a sore throat and sought medical attention where initial tests for other possible medical conditions were done and turned out negative. He was sent to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases on July 6."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/ai-tool-being-tested-for-faster-more-accurate-diagnosis-of-diseases,"AI tool being tested for faster, more accurate diagnosis of diseases","SINGAPORE - Diagnosing leukaemia as well as diseases such as malaria may soon be faster and more accurate with the use of artificial intelligence (AI). An AI-powered software dubbed Blade - developed by Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) and Taiwanese tech firm Asus - can cut the time needed to analyse blood for these diseases by half, allowing for earlier clinical intervention for patients. The process currently requires a laboratory technologist to examine a patient's blood, which is placed on a piece of film under a microscope, and perform a manual cell count. Those blood films with abnormal features or unclear diagnosis are sent to a reference laboratory or a haematologist for review. This can leave the technologists fatigued, possibly leading to a greater chance of error, said TTSH haematology department consultant Eugene Fan. He told reporters on Wednesday (July 6) that the TTSH haematology lab - which operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week - handles between 300 and 400 such blood films a day. Blade allows for the procedure to be automated, enabling a technologist to load multiple blood films into a scanner that converts them into digital images. The AI analyses the films and flags critical ones, such as cases of leukaemia. Lab technologists need only review the scans and correct any misclassified cases, said Dr Fan, who is also a principal investigator in the eight-member team studying the use of Blade. He compares the identification of critical cases by Blade to tagging people on Facebook, noting this is made possible by lab technologists painstakingly labelling individual cells over the past three years. The software was developed using a data set of 337,700 digital images of peripheral blood cells from the National Healthcare Group (NHG), which oversees TTSH. Differential blood counts to check white blood cell levels - which indicate the presence of infection and disease - are currently 91.4 per cent accurate, Asus and TTSH said in a media release. Before the partnership with Asus, funding for the project came from various sources, including Enterprise Singapore and an award from the National Medical Research Council. Blade is currently being evaluated at TTSH and other sites, with plans for it to gain regulatory approval in the next few years. The team aims to test Blade in a community setting, with NHG's Hougang Polyclinic - which has its own laboratory where blood films are examined - expected to get the software this month. Asus and TTSH are also looking at developing similar AI-based solutions in the fields of pathology, cytology and microbiology. On Thursday, the two formalised their collaboration by signing a three-year memorandum of understanding. Other projects in the works include those targeting breast and colon cancer detection. ""We believe that computer science can help a lot to improve healthcare quality,"" said Asus chief technology officer and corporate vice-president Huang Tai-yi, noting that the company had already deployed its smart medical solutions at 20 hospitals in its native Taiwan. Associate Professor Tan Cher Heng, assistant chairman of the medical board for clinical research and innovation at TTSH, said the adoption of technology such as AI will allow the hospital to reinvent its practice and improve care for the community."

The patient is a 45-year-old male Malaysian national who resides in Singapore. He tested positive for monkeypox on Wednesday (July 6). He is currently hospitalised at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and his condition is stable. ""He is not linked to the imported case announced by MOH on June 21,"" said the ministry. MOH added that the man first developed lower abdomen skin lesions on June 30, and subsequently experienced fatigue and swollen lymph nodes on July 2. He developed a fever and a sore throat on July 4 and sought medical attention where initial tests for other possible medical conditions were done. When these tests returned negative, he was subsequently sent on July 6 to NCID, where he was isolated for further assessment. The ministry added that three close contacts have been identified as at Wednesday, including two housemates and one social contact. All close contacts will be placed on quarantine for 21 days from their last contact with the case. Contact tracing is ongoing. Said MOH: ""Monkeypox is typically a self-limiting illness where patients recover within two to four weeks. ""A small percentage of those infected can fall seriously ill or even die. ""Those particularly vulnerable to complications are young children, pregnant women or immunocompromised individuals.""

It encouraged the public to exercise personal responsibility by monitoring their personal health and maintaining good hygiene, especially during travel. The public should also avoid close contact with other individuals known or suspected to be ill with monkeypox infection, it said. The first local case detected in Singapore follows an announcement by World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Wednesday that it would reconvene its monkeypox experts to decide if the worsening outbreak now constitutes a global public health emergency. “Europe is the current epicentre of the outbreak, recording more than 80 per cent of monkeypox cases globally,” he said. Dr Tedros also said that he would reconvene the experts in the week of July 18, or sooner if needed. Most monkeypox infections so far have been observed in men who have sex with men, of young age and chiefly in urban areas, according to the WHO."

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/spore-records-12784-new-covid-19-cases-most-number-of-infections-since-march-22,"12,784 new Covid-19 cases in S'pore","SINGAPORE - There were 12,784 new Covid-19 cases recorded in Singapore on Tuesday (July 5), about double the 5,946 cases on Monday. It also exceeded the 11,504 cases recorded last Tuesday (June 28), which had been the highest daily number of infections since March 22, when it was over 13,000. Case numbers on Tuesdays tend to be higher compared with the rest of the week as they reflect the spike in infections after the weekend when more people are out in various social settings. The week-on-week infection ratio dropped to 1.34 on Tuesday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) reported in an update on its website, from 1.45 on Monday. Last Tuesday's ratio was 1.62. The rate refers to the ratio of community cases for the past week over that of the week before. A rate of more than 1 shows the number of new weekly Covid-19 cases is increasing. MOH said there were 683 patients hospitalised, with 16 in intensive care and 77 requiring oxygen support. There were two deaths reported. Of the new local cases, 802 were detected through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Another 11,446 were detected through antigen rapid tests (ART), which means they either had no symptoms or their symptoms were mild. There were 536 new imported cases, with 37 detected through PCR tests and 499 through ART. Singapore has recorded a total of 1,485,964 Covid-19 cases, and 1,421 deaths. Health Minister Ong Ye Kung told Parliament on Tuesday that Singapore is near, if not already at, the peak of the current wave of Covid-19 infections. He said the wave will not be as severe as the previous Omicron wave, as many people have gained stronger immunity through booster shots or recovery from infections, which will reduce transmission of the virus.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/dont-let-these-silent-killers-go-undetected-how-screening-for-pancreatic-colon-and-liver-cancers-can-save-lives,"Don't let these silent killers go undetected: How screening for pancreatic, colon and liver cancers can save lives","What do cancer of the pancreas, colon and liver have in common? Apart from the fact that they are cancers that affect the digestive system, they are also preventable if detected early. However, these cancers are difficult to detect at an early stage as symptoms appear only much later on. By then, it may already be too late as the cancer would have spread.  The only way to detect them is through screening, although most people are either not aware or see the need for it, says Dr Christopher Kong, senior consultant, Gastroenterology & Hepatology (Liver) at StarMed Specialist Centre. The one-stop private ambulatory care centre, which also offers other health screenings and services by general practitioners, comprises specialist clinics, operating theatres, endoscopy suites and radiology facilities. “People think that they will notice early warning signs and have the cancer diagnosed, or think that these cancers only happen to old people,” he says.  These cancers are actually more common than we think.  According to the National Cancer Centre Singapore, colorectal cancer – cancer of the colon and rectum – is the top most diagnosed cancer in men and second most diagnosed in women from 2015 to 2019.  Colon cancer may not have symptoms until it is at later stages of the disease. Symptoms may include diarrhoea, constipation, a constant need to have a bowel movement, bloody stools, or weakness and fatigue. Available data shows that the five-year survival rate of stage 4 colon cancer in the United States is just 12 per cent.  Cancers of the liver and pancreas may not be as frequent, but they are the second and third most common cause of death from the digestive organs in Singapore.  Symptoms of liver cancer are even less obvious, with patients experiencing loss of appetite and weight, jaundice, tiredness or a feeling of being generally unwell.  The five-year survival rate is 20 per cent for liver cancer. If you get a liver transplant at an early stage, the survival rate goes up to 60 to 70 per cent, according to the American Cancer Society.  However, Dr Kong notes that the number of liver transplants in Singapore is less than 40 per year – far fewer than the 3,800 people who are diagnosed with liver cancer per year in Singapore.  For pancreatic cancer, the five-year survival rate is a low 11 per cent and there is a 90 per cent chance of death if one is diagnosed with pancreatic cancer later than Stage 2. “Not many people have heard of the pancreas or even know where it is,” he says.  The pancreas plays an important role in digestion and has two parts – exocrine, which produces enzymes to digest food, and endocrine, which regulates blood sugar levels. Majority of pancreas cancers are from the exocrine part.  Dr Kong feels that there is a lack of awareness of the pancreas, and hence, of pancreas cancer. That is why screening, even the detection of any pre-cancerous cells will put people on the alert and prevent further deterioration, he adds.  Getting screened for these cancers is one way to detect them early and save on healthcare costs, prevent suffering and improve one’s chances of survival in the long run, says Dr Kong.   But when and who should go for screening? Certain groups of people who are more at risk for these cancers should make screening a priority. Here are the recommendations for the three cancers:  Those above age 50 are encouraged to get screened for colon cancer annually. The easiest and cheapest way is to take a stool test. The Singapore Cancer Society distributes free Faecal Immunochemical Test kits to eligible Singaporeans and permanent residents.  However, even with the free stool test, the uptake for colorectal screening is considerably less than 50 per cent. This is based on findings in Cancer Screening Knowledge and Behavior in a Multi-Ethnic Asian Population: The Singapore Community Health Study that was published on Frontiers in Oncology in 2021. Although the test of free and can be easily done, there are various reasons for its low uptake. Dr Kong feels that one reason could be that culturally, people may be reluctant to work with faecal material, even though it is a natural product of their own body. Also, some people prefer not to take the test after realising they may have to do it every year. However, a limitation of the test is that it can only detect polyps (growth) of a certain size.  Another option is to take a colonoscopy, the gold standard for detecting colon cancer. According to Dr Kong, a colonoscopy done in a well prepared colon with no faecal residue is valid for at least five years, with no need to repeat it during that period if no lesion is found. This gives people peace of mind and they do not need colon screening for five years or more. People with certain genetic conditions, hereditary polyposis syndrome or Lynch syndrome, those with multiple polyps in the colon, or those who suffer from inflammatory bowel disease for more than 10 years, require regular colonoscopy.  Those who have had their polyps removed require surveillance as a follow up to check for any new growths.  A family history of the disease and certain genetic syndromes put one at greater risk of pancreas cancer such as Lynch syndrome or Peutz-Jegher syndrome. These individuals should think about getting screened, advises Dr Kong.  Those who suffer from chronic pancreatitis (inflammation) should also seek medical advice about screening.  Surveillance is required for people who have pancreatic cysts, which may still be benign, but may turn cancerous at a later time. There are no obvious symptoms, except that the cyst may grow by a few millimetres over time.  According to medical research, people with pancreatic cysts of less than 1cm should have a CT or MRI scan in six months, then every two years if there is no change. More frequent surveillance is recommended for those with larger cysts.  There are several factors that lead to a higher risk of liver cancer. One is a Hepatits B infection, which causes inflammation of the liver and leads to liver cirrhosis. Liver cirrhosis is a progressive condition that causes scarring of the liver, and increases your chances of getting liver cancer.  Obese people are another at risk group. Obesity may lead to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, where there is a build-up of fat in the liver, which may further progress to liver cirrhosis. Globally, it is also recommended that people with certain metabolic syndromes such as Type 2 diabetes be screened for fatty liver disease.  While cost is a factor that may prevent people from going from screening, Dr Kong notes that the government has initiatives to help patients with healthcare costs.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/workplaces-not-reinstating-mandatory-regular-testing-yet-despite-covid-19-wave,Workplaces in S'pore not reinstating mandatory regular testing yet despite Covid-19 wave,"SINGAPORE - Companies here are not resuming mandatory regular Covid-19 testing yet, despite a new wave of coronavirus cases. Nevertheless, employers The Straits Times spoke to, including the Public Service Division (PSD) and Singapore's three healthcare clusters, said they are keeping a close eye on the situation and urging their staff to remain vigilant. The week on week infection ratio of cases here has remained above one since June 14, meaning that the number of new weekly Covid-19 cases has been increasing. Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said on June 28 that the next wave of Covid-19 infections has arrived sooner than previously expected. A PSD spokesman, highlighting that a multi-ministry task force tackling Covid-19 recently announced that there would be no changes to safe management measures in spite of the new wave, told ST that it will maintain existing measures, including regular cleaning of common spaces and encouraging telecommuting. ""The safety and health of the public and all public officers remain our utmost priority. We remain vigilant in ensuring that we resume work at the workplace in a safe manner,"" he said. On March 24, the Ministry of Health said rostered routine testing would cease across all sectors from March 29, with high vaccination and booster rates and strict compliance to safe management measures offering sufficient protection, given that the peak of the Covid-19 wave at the time had passed. Changi Airport Group said it is monitoring the current situation and is ready to reinstate any measures where necessary. Singapore's three national healthcare clusters said they are not reinstating mandatory testing before returning to the workplace for healthcare workers. Professor Fong Kok Yong, deputy group chief executive officer for medical and clinical services at SingHealth, said staff are regularly reminded to test themselves for Covid-19 if they are feeling unwell. Those working in high-risk areas who have just recovered from the coronavirus are required to take a polymerase chain reaction test before returning to work, added Prof Fong who is also co-chair of his cluster's disease outbreak task force. He noted that among other precautions, SingHealth's institutions have stringent infection control measures in place. Professor Lim Tock Han, National Healthcare Group's group chairman, medical board, said in the event of a surge in patients, his cluster is ready to optimise and adjust bed capacity, resources, protocols and manpower. Associate Professor Thomas Loh, group chairman, medical board, at the National University Health System, said his group is closely monitoring developments and will adjust its response accordingly. One of the measures currently in place is being flexible with manpower deployment, so as to reduce staff burnout while meeting operational and safety requirements. Companies in the private sector are also not reinstating rostered routine testing. DBS Bank said it will continue to adhere to the measures set by the Ministry of Manpower, and maintain hygiene and cleanliness at its offices. Emphasising that the health and safety of customers and staff is a top priority, Mr Patrick Chew, OCBC Bank's head of operational risk management, said it is closely keeping tabs on the situation and ready to adapt its measures if necessary. Prudential Singapore said there had not been a significant increase in the number of employees who caught Covid-19 in the past two months, adding that those who wish to work from office are encouraged to test themselves regularly. Ms Rivero Delgado, Marriott International's area vice-president for Singapore, Malaysia and Maldives, said her company is taking measures such as providing free hand sanitiser to guests and associates. Calling on businesses here to remain vigilant and employees to exercise personal responsibility, a spokesman for the Singapore Business Federation said vaccination is a key part of the defence against Covid-19, and businesses should grant staff paid time-off to get booster shots. Mr Kurt Wee, president of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (Asme), said companies should be prepared for short-term disruptions caused by workers getting infected. He noted that Singapore has experienced several Covid-19 surges in the past and companies have had practice implementing safe management measures. ""Companies should hold steadfast, maintain good safe management practices and not relax their measures, while at the same time remaining vigilant for any notices... from Asme or the (authorities),"" he added."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/giddiness-with-no-apparent-cause-understanding-chronic-subjective-dizziness,Giddiness with no apparent cause: Understanding chronic subjective dizziness,"SINGAPORE - At 3am one day in October 2018, website administrator Ernie Suryana was awakened by a sudden bout of dizziness - something she had not experienced before. Too dizzy to sit or walk, the then 39-year-old crawled to her bedroom door and banged on it to wake her family and get help. After a hospital stay and three months of physiotherapy, she felt better. But her symptoms later returned, with a series of tests unable to pick up any apparent cause. ""It was causing me a lot of anxiety, because I was feeling giddy and everything was spinning again,"" said Ms Ernie. Ms Ernie is not alone in her condition. She is one of some 650 patients who have been treated by the dizziness counselling service at Changi General Hospital (CGH) since October 2020, who experience giddiness with no apparent cause. Dr Kenneth Chua, senior audiologist at CGH who heads the service, explained that such patients have a condition that differs from vertigo, which is one of the more well-described conditions under the umbrella of dizziness. In the case of vertigo, patients often feel that the room is spinning or objects they are looking at are moving very quickly, and this is accompanied by observable signs in the eye. ""If someone were to look into your eyes at that moment, your eyeballs would be jumping around,"" explained Dr Chua. Vertigo can be detected through a variety of tests, including videonystagmography procedures, which is a test that measures a type of involuntary eye movement that causes one's eyes to move from side to side or up and down, or both. However, about 70 per cent of those sent for such tests at CGH's Department of Otorhinolaryngology - Head and and Neck Surgery come back with no abnormal results in their tests. Dr Chua explained that a majority of such patients, like Ms Ernie, have what is known in layman terms as chronic subjective dizziness. Patients' experiences of this condition tend to differ, but they often describe it as feeling like they are floating or as though their heads are ""swimming"". Ms Ernie said: ""I was really worried that I might faint in the middle of a crowded train or a mall, so I tried not to go out as often."" Dr Chua said that chronic subjective dizziness, also known as persistent postural perceptual dizziness, was only recently recognised as a condition, with diagnostic criteria for it being developed only in 2018. While it is not known how many people in Singapore suffer from it, studies in Britain have estimated that about 10 per cent to 20 per cent of the population there may have this condition. Chronic subjective dizziness is the result of a combination of psychological and physical factors, said Dr Chua. He explained that while in some cases there are no identifiable underlying medical issues causing the dizziness in patients, some of the patients will have had some history of underlying vestibular issues, although these would not be present at the time of their chronic subjective dizziness. The condition's exact causes are unknown as well, but people who tend to be more anxious about their health and have previously had a vestibular illness are more prone to developing it. Other factors such as stress and sensory overload may increase the chances of patients feeling giddy as well, said Dr Chua, adding that from April to September last year, CGH saw 200 such patients, up from 120 during the same period in 2020. Though the condition may never fully go away, patients can be taught to manage it through a series of techniques including educating them on the issue to reduce their anxiety, deep breathing exercises and cognitive behavioural therapy. They may also be given simple exercises to improve their sense of balance. Dr Chua said people who experience daily dizziness for three months and have already been told by doctors that there is no evidence of medical issues should seek help for chronic subjective dizziness. ""Treat dizziness seriously. It's quite hard to determine on your own if it's something urgent, so when in doubt, seek medical attention,"" he said. In Ms Ernie's case, seeking treatment has helped put her mind at ease and allowed her to resume her normal life once more. ""I can now go out with friends and take public transport regularly again - I don't feel anxious anymore,"" she said."

""We still keep seeing him running around,"" the 33-year-old technical account manager told The Straits Times on Thursday (June 30). Mr Basharath described Zaheer Raees Ali as a cheerful, active child who would often run around the house. On Monday, the 18-month-old became the first child under the age of 12 in Singapore to die after contracting the virus. The Ministry of Health (MOH) said the toddler died of encephalitis - inflammation of the brain - due to Covid-19 and two other viruses. Older brother Zayan Fawaz Ali, who is three, has not been himself since. The once-boisterous little boy has lost his appetite and often sits quietly by himself, said his father. Mr Basharath believes that Zayan understands his brother is no longer around, but has difficulty processing his emotions because of his young age. The two were close and supposed to enrol in the same childcare centre at the foot of their Housing Board block in Bukit Panjang next year. Mr Basharath agreed to be interviewed to share his experience with other parents who may find their children in such life-threatening situations. It was just hours after Zaheer Raees tested positive that his condition became critical. He first came down with a fever at about 4am on June 21, Mr Basharath said. The family of four took antigen rapid tests to see if they had caught Covid-19 - a precaution they adopted during the pandemic whenever anyone fell sick. His mother, housewife Septian Suci Rahayu Sartini, 31, self-isolated with Zaheer Raees after both tested positive for the virus. While Zaheer Raees was still active later that morning, his condition deteriorated rapidly by night-time, with his temperature rising to 41 deg C. ""My wife and I, we were in panic mode,"" said Mr Basharath. Leaving Zayan in the care of his grandmother, the couple called a cab and took Zaheer Raees from their Segar Road home to KK Women's and Children's Hospital. While waiting to be admitted at the hospital, the toddler blacked out, Mr Basharath said. When they were allowed to see him, the boy was conscious but unresponsive, only mumbling to himself. ""After a while, he started having seizures,"" the father said, adding that magnetic resonance imaging scans later revealed swelling in the brain. ""They (The doctors) told me the brain swelling was irreversible, which means even if you turn it back, he can't be the normal Raees any more,"" he said. MOH had said the boy was admitted to the children's intensive care unit in critical condition on June 22 and diagnosed with severe meningoencephalitis - inflammation of the brain and membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Mr Basharath recalled praying a lot during that time. Doctors told him his son's case was very critical. He said he ""did what a father had to do"" and contacted different specialists and doctors for help. An appeal for help for his son on social media network LinkedIn - where Mr Basharath uses the nickname Farath Shba - was shared more than 300 times. Mr Basharath said he even contacted Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan - who is an MP for Holland-Bukit Timah GRC - for help and the minister offered assistance despite being overseas at the time. When contacted, Dr Balakrishnan said he will continue to support Mr Basharath's family and stay in close touch with them. ""We are all very sad. Mr Basharath has been a very devoted father and husband,"" he told ST via e-mail. ""He has gone through the ultimate nightmare of a parent."" The doctors said brain stem examinations showed that Zaheer Raees could not be revived, Mr Basharath said. He spoke with a close family friend, who advised him to think things through before deciding how to proceed. Mr Basharath said he had initially wanted to leave his son on life support for at least another month, citing cases where others had regained consciousness after being in long comas. But he said he could not bear the thought of his son's survival being dependent on tubes poking into his body. ""No parent should go through this,"" he said. After the decision was made to pull the plug, Mr Basharath said he was allowed to say his final goodbye to his son. ""I held on to him until his heartbeat came to zero."" Zaheer Raees died on June 27, the day his older brother turned three. Funeral prayers for the toddler were held at Maarof Mosque in Jurong West, and he was buried at Choa Chu Kang Muslim Cemetery on June 28. MOH said on June 27 that the boy had no medical history of other conditions and was previously well. ""He was a healthy child,"" Mr Basharath added, citing the various developmental milestones the boy had achieved. ""He learnt how to speak, he learnt how to walk, he learnt how to run even earlier than his older brother,"" he noted. Doctors told ST that cases like Zaheer Raees' were extremely rare. Dr Yeo Tong Hong, senior consultant and head of neurology service at KKH, noted that while encephalitis has been reported as a complication of Covid-19 infection, such instances were very uncommon. Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection president Paul Tambyah also said the chance of getting infected by three viruses simultaneously is very low. He suggested there could be a rare immunological problem that could have predisposed Zaheer Raees to complications. Pointing out that both he and his wife had been vaccinated against Covid-19 and taken their booster shots, Mr Basharath advised parents to get themselves and their children vaccinated where possible. They should also not hesitate to seek medical help should their children fall very sick, he said. He and his wife are trying to be strong for Zayan's sake, as well as for their own sanity. But he added: ""I can't seem to accept the reality that he's moved on."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/hiv-self-test-swab-kits-to-go-on-sale-from-aug-1-as-new-cases-fall-to-new-low-in-2021,"HIV self-test swab kits to go on sale from Aug 1, as new cases fall to new low in 2021","SINGAPORE - Self-test kits for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) will go on sale at two locations from Aug 1, even as new cases fell to 250 in 2021, the lowest in at least 18 years. The National HIV Programme, which is under the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), will introduce HIV self-testing to complement widely available tests at healthcare institutions such as polyclinics, hospitals and anonymous HIV test sites, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) and NCID in a press release on Friday (July 1). People using the self-test kits will use an oral swab for testing, and results can be obtained within 20 to 40 minutes. The kits, which cost between $20 and $32, will be available at the Department of Sexually Transmitted Infections Control clinic and the Action for AIDS (AfA) Anonymous Test Site, from August. Professor Roy Chan, president of AfA, said: ""The self-testing programme does not replace existing testing programmes, and we have to make sure that the kits are reliable. But this is another way of reaching our target, which is to end HIV by 2030. The earlier people know they are positive, the earlier they can get into treatment."" Those who test positive through the swab test should go to a healthcare provider to confirm the diagnosis and be referred for treatment, while those who test negative but engage in ""high-risk sexual behaviour"" - such as having multiple sex partners - are encouraged to test themselves regularly. ""The Ministry of Health and the Health Promotion Board urge individuals who engage in high-risk sexual behaviour to go for regular HIV testing,"" said MOH and NCID in the release. ""Going for HIV testing is the only way to know one's HIV status. Regular testing and early diagnosis allow persons living with HIV to be treated early and achieve better treatment outcomes. ""This also provides an opportunity to protect their partners from infection as persons living with HIV who are on treatment and have an undetectable viral load have practically no risk of transmitting the virus to their sexual partners. With early and effective treatment, people living with HIV can lead lives no different from others."" The new initiative comes even as the number of new cases fell from ""about 320"" in 2018 and 2019, and 261 in 2020. The number of new cases ranged from 400 to 500 each year from 2007 to 2017. In total, there were 9,129 Singapore residents diagnosed with the virus in 2021, of whom 2,255 have already died. Prof Chan said AfA has been working with ""target key populations, such as homosexual men, sex workers and heterosexual men with multiple partners"" on its prevention programmes. Some 95 per cent of the new cases last year were male and 68 per cent were aged 20 to 49 years, with 62 per cent having late-stage HIV infection when they were diagnosed. Of the 250 new cases in 2021, 237 were infected via sexual intercourse, with heterosexual and bisexual transmission accounting for 33 per cent and 3 per cent of the new cases respectively, and 59 per cent of the cases were transmitted through homosexual intercourse. Some 57 per cent of the new cases last year were detected when the patients were already receiving medical treatment, either for HIV-related symptoms or unrelated ailments, and were typically at a late stage of HIV infection, according to MOH and NCID. Conversely, newly diagnosed patients who proactively went for HIV screening tended to be at the early stage of infection. ""The most effective way to prevent HIV infection is to remain faithful to one's spouse/partner and to avoid casual sex, or sex with sex workers,"" said the two government bodies. ""Persons engaging in high-risk sexual behaviour, such as having multiple sexual partners or engaging in casual or commercial sex, are strongly advised to use condoms to reduce their risk of HIV infection and other sexually-transmitted infections. Condoms should be used consistently and correctly during every sexual encounter."" For more information about HIV self-testing, members of the public can visit this website. "
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/spore-couples-get-help-to-pay-for-tests-to-cut-risk-of-passing-on-genetic-diseases-in-ivf,S'pore couples get help to pay for tests to cut risk of passing on genetic diseases in IVF,"SINGAPORE - From July 1, Singaporean couples who wish to conceive but are worried about passing on serious inheritable diseases to their child will receive government funding support of up to 75 per cent to test for known genetic disorders in embryos in the in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) process. The Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Thursday (June 30) that the funding is for two types of pre-implantation genetic testing (PGT), which are done on embryos created via IVF and would reduce the risk of genetic diseases being passed on. The first type of test, known as PGT-M, screens for common and rare disorders, such as the blood disorder beta thalassemia and spinal muscular atrophy. The second type of test, PGT-SR, checks for chromosomal structural abnormalities, which may manifest themselves in developmental delays or learning disabilities in conditions such as Down syndrome. The tests cost about $11,000 to $31,000 each, with that for rare disorders costing the most as it involves more preparatory work. The funding covers the tests and the embryo biopsy done by an assisted reproduction centre. For instance, a Singaporean couple can get funding of up to $17,100 for the PGT process for common disorders and up to $31,420 for the process to test for rare disorders. On average, 40 to 50 couples a year are expected to benefit from the scheme, said Ms Indranee Rajah, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, at a doorstop interview in National University Hospital (NUH), where she was visiting to find out more about fertility treatment processes and to announce the details of the funding scheme. “We have been looking at a whole raft of measures to support families... this is a specific part... Think of the couple who give birth to a child who has inherited diseases or defects. They go through a lot, and there’s the costs, it’s emotional, and the difficulty. So, the question is whether you can help to circumvent this,” she said.  “The key indicator for PGT is if you or your family member has some kind of genetic defect or mutation, or you could be a carrier... Then you would want to test and make sure.. that you will have a healthy child,” she added. Ms Rahayu Mahzam, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Health, who was also at the same event, said the funding support is part of the Government's larger effort  to support couples who wish to conceive. “These are the things that would perhaps encourage parents as well as those who want to try for a second child,” she said.  This funding scheme is for couples with at least one Singaporean spouse who is clinically eligible for PGT and the funding is subject to co-funding caps. It is for couples where the wife is below 40 years old and covers up to six cycles of PGT. Those who have gone for an assisted reproduction technology or intrauterine insemination cycle before 40 and wish to try again after 40 can receive the funding for up to two cycles of PGT. Some 5½ in 1,000 people have changes in the structure of their chromosomes, but they are usually not aware of it, said Associate Professor Samuel Chong, the director of NUH’s Pre-Implantation Genetic Diagnosis Centre. “It’s only when they are married and want to have children that they find that they can’t get pregnant or, sometimes, they have offspring with a genetic condition,” he said.  PGT will reduce the risk of miscarriages that result from genetic abnormalities and, so far, most cases have been referred, said Prof Wong Peng Cheang, emeritus consultant and the head of the division of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at NUH’s department of obstetrics and gynaecology. “What happens is most people who have repeated miscarriages (will) see a doctor (who will) then investigate this. Then they usually do their… chromosome analysis called karyotyping,” he said. This will tell whether the husband or the wife has genetic abnormalities, and a genetic counsellor may then refer the couple for a PGT test, he added.  “There are a lot of miscarriages that happen and there are no explanations. This is different (as) the wife or the husband has an identified abnormality. Then we’ll know what to look for (in the PGT test),” said Prof Wong. MOH introduced PGT as regulated clinical services in May last year. Prior to that, the tests had been available only under a pilot programme since 2005. MOH said the level of co-funding and the co-funding caps depend on the citizenship status of the couples. This is similar to existing co-funding schemes for assisted reproduction technology and intrauterine insemination procedures, the ministry said. A couple made up of a Singaporean and a permanent resident will receive up to 55 per cent co-funding support while a couple with one foreign spouse will get up to 35 per cent co-funding support. Eligible couples can also tap their own or their spouse's MediSave to pay for PGT, regardless of whether they are seeking care at a public or private centre. There are nine assisted reproduction centres here, but only one lab - at NUH - that can process the tests. If the embryo biopsy is done at the private centres, the specimens will be sent to the NUH lab. However, the co-funding for embryo biopsy is available only for couples whose biopsies are done at public assisted reproduction centres, MOH said. Apart from NUH, these public centres include those at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital and the Singapore General Hospital."

The Yishun Health network comprises Admiralty Medical Centre, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and Yishun Community Hospital. Besides the household survey, residents who are keen to share more about their health will also be invited to take part in focus group discussions as part of this research. Yishun Health chief executive Chua Hong Choon said: ""Key findings from this study will supplement our existing healthcare utilisation and administrative data. This is important in enabling us to anticipate and strategise to serve the population's current, emerging and future health and social needs."" The survey follows Health Minister Ong Ye Kung's announcement earlier this year on a national preventive health initiative called the Healthier SG strategy. It will place a greater emphasis on patient-focused preventive care so that chronic illnesses and health issues can be caught early. As part of this new approach, the Ministry of Health will implement new measures, such as encouraging everyone to enrol with a family physician from next year. Associate Professor Ng Yeuk Fan, Yishun Health's principal investigator of this study and director of corporate development, urged residents to participate in the survey when approached. ""The information collected can help us identify gaps in the care of our residents, evaluate and improve our care planning and health system organisation, and drive resources towards initiatives that can better improve resident and population health outcomes,"" he said.

The products were also sold at the nine outlets of The Seafood Market Place by Song Fish, as well as Tasty Farm by Song Fish, all run by the supplier. The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) said on Thursday (June 30) that the affected products, which are packaged without a brand name, are Crayfish Large Cut, with an expiry date of Feb 4, 2023; Crayfish Medium Cut, with an expiry date of May 7, 2023; and Half Shell Scallop, with an expiry date of Aug 12, 2023. The crayfish are from Indonesia while the scallops are from China. SFA said that cadmium levels exceeding the maximum limit set under the Singapore Food Regulations were found in these products. Consumers who have consumed them and have concerns about their health should seek medical advice, it added. If unsure, consumers may contact the stores they bought their products from to check if they are the ones being recalled. Heavy metals such as mercury, lead, arsenic and cadmium are naturally present in the environment and can enter the food chain when the animals and plants humans eat come into contact with the metals in water, soil and the seabed. Shellfish live on the ocean floor and tend to accumulate heavy metals that have sunk to the bottom. Based on the levels detected, a one-off consumption of the affected products is fine, but long-term consumption of high levels of cadmium may cause renal dysfunction, bone demineralisation and increased risk of cancer in the lung, endometrium, bladder, and breast, SFA said."

Those aged 60 and above should take their first booster without delay, while those 80 and above and the medically vulnerable are encouraged to take their second booster if it has been five months since their first booster, the channel said in an advisory on Wednesday (June 29) that was also pushed on its Telegram channel. Those between the ages of 50 and 79 can opt to take their second booster to strengthen their protection against Covid-19. About 70,000 seniors aged 60 and above have yet to take their first booster shot, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said on Monday (June 27) at the opening of three Covid-19 mobile vaccination sites. As many as 50 such sites are being set up, mostly at residents' committee (RC) centres, to bring vaccination closer to seniors in their neighbourhoods. The return and expansion of mobile vaccination sites come amid an uptick in the number of infections, driven by the newer BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron sub-variants. There were 11,504 new Covid-19 cases recorded in Singapore on Tuesday (June 28), more than double the 5,309 cases on Monday. While priority will be given to seniors aged 60 and above to walk in and get their jabs, others can also do so at the mobile vaccination sites, subject to the availability of vaccination slots, the Ministry of Health has said. Anyone can walk into one of 10 joint testing and vaccination centres to get their vaccinations and boosters before 7pm each day, said the Gov.sg WhatsApp channel. From July 18, all households will receive 10 antigen rapid test kits. There are no changes to safe management measures, with mask wearing still required indoors, but optional outdoors. While the Gov.sg WhatsApp channel had been pushing out daily updates on the Covid-19 situation in the four official languages since 2020, the updates have become less frequent this year as Singapore pushed to live with Covid-19 and treat it as an endemic disease. Its last Covid-19 advisory was put out on March 12, though the channel issued a travel advisory on June 3. In February last year, the Government said its Gov.sg WhatsApp channel had 1.22 million subscribers."

The Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a statement on Monday (June 27) that it was Singapore's first Covid-19 death of a patient below the age of 12. The cause of death was encephalitis due to Covid-19, respiratory syncytial virus and enterovirus infections, it said. Respiratory syncytial virus is a common respiratory virus that may cause mild, cold-like symptoms. ""While most cases are mild, severe respiratory syncytial virus can cause bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia (infection of the lungs) in younger children,"" said Associate Professor Thoon Koh Cheng, a senior consultant, infectious disease service at the paediatrics department in KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH).

""In some rare cases, complications such as inflammation of the brain, spinal cord or heart may occur,"" he added. Dr Yeo Tong Hong, a senior consultant and the head of neurology service at KKH, said that encephalitis may initially present with flu-like symptoms such as fever, general lethargy or headache. These flu-like symptoms can become more severe in some cases, which can lead to confusion, drowsiness, seizures or problems with breathing and heart muscle function. ""Encephalitis can be caused either by an infection invading the brain (infectious encephalitis) or through the immune system attacking the brain (autoimmune or post-infectious encephalitis),"" he said. ""Viruses are the most common cause of infectious encephalitis, and it has also been reported to occur as a complication of Covid-19 infection. However, this is rare."" Professor Paul Tambyah, speaking as president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, said: ""There have been isolated, extremely rare cases of encephalitis with Sars CoV-2 in adults mainly, but also in children. In contrast, the enteroviruses are well known as episodic causes of encephalitis."" He added: ""The chances of being infected with three viruses at the same time are very low and suggest that there may be some rare immunological problem which might have predisposed this unfortunate infant to severe complications."" MOH said the baby had no past medical history. He was taken to the emergency department at KKH on the night of June 21, with a high fever and recurrent seizures, and subsequently began to lose consciousness. He was then admitted to the Children's Intensive Care Unit in critical condition on June 22, and was diagnosed with severe meningoencephalitis. The United Nations Children's Fund cited data that showed that 0.4 per cent of the 4.4 million reported Covid-19 deaths occurred in children and adolescents below the age of 20. Prof Tambyah said this is much lower than the proportion of deaths from malaria or influenza that occur in children, for example, which shows just how rare Covid-19 deaths among children are. ""This (data) suggests that the children who do die from Covid-19 have some unusual rare predisposing cause, which needs to be investigated,"" he said. ""For the rest of the children, the disease is overwhelmingly mild, and simple basic health hygiene practices should suffice. Children should be taken to the doctor if unwell or if parents are concerned."" Most children with Covid-19 will do well, but a few may have worsening of their underlying asthma or develop wheeze or have seizures, he said. Febrile seizures can occur with a number of viral infections and there are some useful materials online which can be tapped, for example, the online health information on this provided by the National University Hospital, he said. Dr Lim Yang Chern, a paediatrician from Thomson Paediatric Centre, said the death of the infant was unlikely the ""fault"" of Covid-19 alone. Without details of the case, he feels that it was likely due to the combination of multiple viral infections - the biggest suspects being the enterovirus and the coronavirus - and the resultant immune response that contributed or caused the severe encephalitis that then led to the demise of the child. Prof Thoon said the majority of paediatric patients with Covid-19 show typical symptoms that are similar to adults, including fever, respiratory tract infection symptoms like cough or runny nose, vomiting, diarrhoea, sore throat, anosmia (loss of sense of smell), muscle pain and lethargy. ""Complications among paediatric Covid-19 cases are rare. Some examples include pneumonia, myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation) and inflammation of brain and spine."" He said children should get the Covid-19 vaccine when it is nationally recommended, in order to get protection from the coronavirus and also to reduce the risk of complications if they do get infected. This is apart from keeping up with public health measures, such as wearing surgical masks where possible. ""Should children develop worsening symptoms of persistent fever, lethargy or drowsiness, persistent cough, breathlessness, chest pain, poor oral intake, poor urine output or seizures, they should be seen by their doctor,"" said Prof Thoon."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/covid-19-wave-has-arrived-earlier-than-expected-possibly-due-to-holiday-travels-ong-ye-kung,"Covid-19 wave has arrived earlier than expected, possibly due to holiday travels: Ong Ye Kung","SINGAPORE - The next wave of Covid-19 infections in Singapore has arrived sooner than expected, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said on Tuesday (June 28). Speaking to Chinese newspaper Lianhe Zaobao after the 30th annual general meeting of the Chinese Development Assistance Council (CDAC), Mr Ong said many people had travelled overseas, including to Europe, during the June school holidays, and the recent increase in Covid-19 cases here could be related to that. However, Mr Ong said he did not think this wave would be worse than the one in February this year that was caused by the BA.2 Omicron subvariant. Cases in Europe and the United States are on the rise, with the new Omicron subvariants, BA.4 and BA.5, steadily gaining ground. Speaking in Mandarin, he said: ""I had earlier said that the next wave might take place around July or August, but it's now here a little earlier, at the end of June - possibly due to the June holidays."" Mr Ong was referring to remarks he made on June 2, where he also said that every healthcare setting must be prepared to handle a surge in the number of Covid-19 patients. On Tuesday, Mr Ong said the Ministry of Health would continue to monitor the situation, and that it was important to ensure hospitals had enough support. In that respect, the three new nursing homes that opened in April were very important, as hospitals could transfer elderly patients with only mild illness to these homes, thus relieving pressure on themselves. Mr Ong also said that three doses of the Covid-19 vaccine are required to protect people from the new Omicron subvariants and called on seniors to have their booster shots as soon as possible. MOH said on Monday that about 45 per cent of the Covid-19 cases here in the last week were caused by the subvariants, with BA.5 estimated to have contributed to 40 per cent of all cases in the past week."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/more-than-11500-new-covid-19-cases-reported-in-spore,"11,504 new Covid-19 cases in S'pore","SINGAPORE - There were 11,504 new Covid-19 cases recorded in Singapore on Tuesday (June 28), more than double the 5,309 cases on Monday. This marks the highest daily number of infections in more than three months, since March 22 when it was over 13,000. It is also more than last Tuesday's 7,109 cases. Case numbers on Tuesdays tend to be higher compared with the rest of the week as they reflect the spike in infections after the weekend, when more people are out in various social settings. The week-on-week infection ratio rose slightly to 1.62 on Tuesday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) reported in an update on its website, up from 1.56 on Monday. Last Tuesday's ratio was 1.23. The rate refers to the ratio of community cases for the past week over that of the week before. A rate of more than 1 shows the number of new weekly Covid-19 cases is increasing. MOH said there were 437 patients hospitalised, with nine in intensive care and 36 requiring oxygen support. There was one death reported. Of the new local Covid-19 cases, 743 were detected through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Another 9,989 were detected through antigen rapid tests (ART), which means they either had no symptoms or their symptoms were mild. There were 772 new imported cases, with 24 detected through PCR tests and 748 through ART. Singapore has recorded a total of 1,425,171 Covid-19 cases, and 1,410 deaths. Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said on Monday there is no need to tighten safe management measures for now but this cannot be ruled out as more Covid-19 infections are reported. He also said the uptick in the number of infections is driven by the newer BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron sub-variants. But there is no evidence yet the current infections are more severe, and hospitals are still able to cope with the situation. Monday also saw the first death of a Covid-19 patient under 12 years old. The one-and-a-half year old child died of encephalitis - or inflammation of the brain - due to Covid-19 and two other viruses. See the full update from MOH here."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/non-surgical-procedure-for-dialysis-patients-piloted-at-spore-general-hospital,Non-surgical procedure for end-stage kidney patients piloted at Singapore General Hospital,"SINGAPORE - Patients with end-stage kidney failure may soon no longer have to undergo surgery before beginning dialysis, thanks to a new procedure being piloted by Singapore General Hospital (SGH). Associate Professor Tan Chieh Suai, head and senior consultant at SGH's department of renal medicine, announced this on Tuesday (June 28) and said that in 2020, 7,125 such patients - about three in four - chose to go for a form of dialysis known as haemodialysis, up from 4,270 in 2011. Haemodialysis involves using a dialysis machine and an artificial kidney to clean the blood of kidney patients. In order for the blood to be extracted from patients, however, an access point needs to be created in their body. Prof Tan said the best way of doing this is through the creation of what is known as an arteriovenous fistula (AVF), which involves joining a vein and an artery together and causing blood from the artery to flow through the vein. This increases blood flow in the vein, allowing blood to be extracted from it, explained Professor Tay Kiang Hiong, head and senior consultant at SGH's department of vascular and interventional radiology, who was also at Tuesday's media briefing. Traditionally, an AVF would have to be created through a surgical procedure on the patient's arm. However, about 80 per cent of patients with end-stage kidney failure here choose to put off such procedures for various reasons, including fear of surgery, being unable to accept their diagnosis, and worry about the scars left behind by the procedure, said Prof Tan. This results in many of them having to be admitted for emergency dialysis using a catheter. But this increases the risk of patients getting infected, as well as internal bleeding, said Prof Tan, adding that eventually, an AVF has to be created anyway in these patients. The method piloted by SGH is much less invasive. Known as endovascular AVF (endoAVF), the non-surgical procedure can be done in either of two ways. A needle is inserted in the vein under the skin and guided into an artery using ultrasound. A specially designed catheter with a clip is later inserted to link the vein and artery. Alternatively, needles are inserted into the vein and artery, allowing two catheters - both of which have magnets attached - to be inserted as well. The magnets will be attracted to each other, pulling the artery and vein together. An electrical current is then passed through the catheters, burning a hole between the artery and vein. The method used depends on several factors, including the size of the patient's veins. Prof Tan said overseas studies have shown that the endoAVF has a high success rate of 90 per cent, compared with the 78 per cent success rate of the traditional method used so far in Singapore. It is faster, taking around 15 minutes at best, as compared with 45 to 90 minutes when done the traditional way. EndoAVF also leaves no scars, whereas the traditional method typically leaves scars of between 3cm and 10cm on patients' arms. Also, while patients getting an AVF through surgery require up to three procedures of balloon angioplasty a year to maintain their AVFs, those who undergo endoAVF need to do this only once every two years. Associate Professor Chong Tze Tec, head and senior consultant at SGH's department of vascular surgery, said that because the traditional method involves moving veins around, the surrounding tissues will be disrupted, resulting in the vein which blood is extracted from becoming narrower as well. The endoAVF method does not cause this problem. Prof Tan said that a previous pilot programme launched by SGH in October 2021 with 13 patients had already produced encouraging results, with a 90 per cent success rate. Speaking to the media at the briefing, one of the patients from the pilot, 70-year-old Choong Yit Lin, said he had initially been reluctant to go for surgery to create an AVF, as he was concerned about the risks. Mr Choong, who works in the construction industry, said in Mandarin that despite developing severe headaches in July last year due to end-stage kidney failure, he put off any procedure until November that year, when his condition worsened and he had to use a catheter for emergency dialysis. At that point, he had no choice but to opt for a procedure to create an AVF. He was found to be suitable for endoAVF and underwent the procedure in December. ""I feel better every day,"" he said, adding that he is glad he underwent endoAVF after he noticed the scars on other patients who went for the traditional procedure. By the end of the year, SGH will launch a three-year pilot programme to offer endoAVF to 200 eligible patients from SGH, Changi General Hospital, Sengkang General Hospital and National University Hospital. Prof Tay said: ""Rather than just keeping (the procedure) to ourselves, we're involving more hospitals because we see that the potential benefits are tremendous. But we have to prove it first."" Prof Chong said the suitability of a patient for endoAVF depends on many technical considerations, including the position of their veins and arteries, as well as the size of their veins. But he added that he hoped the pilot would allow doctors to adjust the procedure so it could be offered to more patients in the future. Prof Tan said SGH is partnering community dialysis service providers such as the National Kidney Foundation and Fresenius Medical Care Singapore so that nurses can be trained to conduct dialysis on patients who have undergone the new procedure as well. ""The aim of all this is to shift care from the tertiary institutions to the community by reducing the need for these patients to come to the hospital. We do this by creating (AVF) that have high success rates and low maintenance rates. Overall, the whole country will benefit from lower healthcare costs,"" he said."

""Today, my strong, brave son passed on to the next world after fighting for his life,"" Mr Farath Shba wrote on LinkedIn. Mr Farath, a regional technical account manager at tech firm CloudBlue, said in the post that these past few days had been difficult. He added he would be spending time with his loved ones and not responding on social media. When contacted by The Straits Times, Mr Farath asked for time as his son's funeral was in progress. The Ministry of Health (MOH) announced on Monday that an 18-month-old Singaporean boy had died from Covid-19, marking the first death here of a coronavirus patient below the age of 12. MOH said the child died of encephalitis - or inflammation of the brain - due to Covid-19 and two other viruses, respiratory syncytial virus and enterovirus. In a separate LinkedIn post last week, Mr Farath said the toddler, Zaheer Raees Ali, had been hospitalised at KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) as the boy was severely affected by Covid-19. Doctors had said the boy's brain was swollen and that there was not much that could be done to alleviate the swelling. Mr Farath asked for help contacting a neurosurgeon or another medical professional who could save his son. ""He was admitted only a day back as he developed Covid-19 and the doctors are saying that his brain is swollen and there’s nothing much that could’ve done to alleviate the swollen which is due to inflammation and to save him,"" Mr Farath wrote.  In a comment on CNA's Facebook page, a woman with the handle Mamayu Zfa who identified herself as the toddler's mother, said the family deeply appreciated the ""kind expression of sympathy"" from others during their time of loss. ""Thank you for keeping us in your thoughts and prayers,"" she wrote. MOH said on Monday the boy had been taken to the KKH Children's Emergency Department on the night of June 21 with a high fever and recurrent seizures, and subsequently began to lose consciousness. He was then admitted to the Children's Intensive Care Unit in critical condition the next day, when he was diagnosed with severe meningoencephalitis. MOH said on Monday that it would study the safety and effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines for children under the age of five once the manufacturers submit the relevant documents. The ministry expressed its condolences to the boy's family, adding that KKH was in contact with them to provide the necessary support."

In a statement on Monday night (June 27), MOH said the child died of encephalitis - or inflammation of the brain - due to Covid-19 and two other viruses. The two viruses are the respiratory syncytial virus and the enterovirus. This is Singapore's first death caused by Covid-19 in a patient below 12, MOH said. It added that the boy had no other past medical history and was previously well. He was taken to KK Women's and Children's Hospital's (KKH) Children's Emergency Department on the night of June 21 with a high fever and recurrent seizures, and subsequently began to lose consciousness. He was then admitted to the Children's Intensive Care Unit in critical condition on June 22, and was diagnosed with severe meningoencephalitis. This refers to the inflammation of the brain and the meninges, which are membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. The boy’s polymerase chain reaction test came back positive for Covid-19, as well as the rhinovirus/enterovirus and the respiratory syncytial virus. In its statement, MOH said Covid-19 can result in severe disease, even in children and those without pre-existing medical conditions. ""Vaccination substantially reduces the likelihood of severe disease when one is infected,"" it said. The ministry added that it recommends that all children aged five to 11 years get the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine, especially those with underlying chronic medical conditions. MOH said that together with the Health Sciences Authority and the Expert Committee on Covid-19 Vaccination, it will study the safety and effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines that have been formulated for young children under the age of five, once manufacturers submit relevant documents. ""MOH extends our deepest condolences to the patient's family,"" said the ministry, adding that KKH is in contact with the family to support them where necessary. This is the first death from Covid-19 in Singapore in five days. The latest death takes Singapore's total number of Covid-19 fatalities to 1,409. On Monday, Singapore reported 5,309 new coronavirus cases, up from 5,116 the day before. The week-on-week infection ratio also grew to 1.56, up from 1.52 the day before. The rate refers to the ratio of community cases for the past week over that of the week before. A rate of more than 1 shows that the number of new weekly Covid-19 cases is increasing.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/kidney-transplants-in-spore-hit-by-covid-19-even-as-wait-list-grows,Kidney transplants in Singapore hit by Covid-19 even as wait list grows,"SINGAPORE - The number of kidney transplants - already decreasing before the Covid-19 pandemic hit - has fallen over the past two years, even as the waiting time for a donor kidney grows longer. In 2019, there were 33 kidney transplant operations involving deceased donors carried out in Singapore; but only 15 kidney transplants took place in 2020 and just 24 last year. Living-donor transplants were also affected, falling from 56 in 2019 to 31 in 2020, before going up to 47 last year. In contrast, the number of people here waiting for a kidney has steadily climbed. There were 330 people on the transplant wait list in 2019 and 371 last year. The average waiting time for a kidney from a deceased donor is now 97.4 months, or just over eight years. Doctors said Covid-19 is to blame for the backlog, as staff were redeployed to help with pandemic operations and operations postponed, especially if the patients were deemed to be high-risk. Associate Professor Terence Kee, who is director of the Singapore General Hospital's (SGH) renal transplant programme, said the first year of the pandemic hit especially hard. ""Even though the circuit breaker lasted only two months, more than 100 SGH patients were affected as processing of referrals and evaluations were suspended,"" he said. Evaluations for living donor kidney transplants were put on hold, as was placement on the deceased-donor wait list. ""Our staff were deployed elsewhere to support Covid-19 efforts such as the isolation wards, perimeter screening and swabbing operations,"" said Prof Kee. Dr Hersharan Kaur Sran from the National University Hospital's (NUH) adult kidney and pancreas transplantation programme, said her hospital's experience was much the same. The hospital's transplant team received fewer referrals from kidney doctors, who were swamped, and transplants involving deceased donors dropped significantly due to concerns about infection transmission, among other things. For instance, organs from higher-risk donors - such as people who were older or less healthy - were turned down, said Dr Hersharan, a senior consultant at the National University Centre for Organ Transplantation (Nucot). This was because such transplants require more medical resources and increase the risk of recipients having to stay longer in hospital or needing intensive care. Professor Tan Chee Kiat, who is director of the Health Ministry's National Organ Transplant Unit, said Singapore has one of the highest rates of diabetic kidney failure in the world. About 5.7 people are diagnosed with kidney failure daily, and two in three cases of kidney failure are due to diabetes. There are more than 8,500 dialysis patients in Singapore. For patients with end-stage disease, kidney transplants are often the best option. But even before the pandemic, the number of organs from deceased donors was already in decline, largely because they were medically unsuitable for various reasons, he said. ""On the other hand, there is an increase in the prevalence of kidney failure and hence a corresponding increase in the waiting time for a kidney transplant."" He added that the proportion of people who were put on the wait list during the pandemic, as compared with those who died or were taken off the list, remained relatively stable. Dr Hersharan said 5 per cent to 10 per cent of the people on Nucot's wait list are removed every year as they are no longer medically suitable for transplantation, while less than 5 per cent die. Before the pandemic, it used to add between 50 and 60 patients to the wait list each year. This dropped to between 30 and 40 yearly after Covid-19 struck. The good news is that transplant numbers are slowly picking up, as hospitals adjust to the new normal. Prof Kee said SGH had established a robust system of screening for Covid-19, requiring donors and recipients to self-isolate before surgery and undergo repeated tests for the virus. This is because transplant recipients are on drugs to prevent their immune systems from rejecting the transplant, and a Covid-19 infection could prove fatal. ""In other words, we have demonstrated that the processes in place allow us to perform kidney transplantation safely even during a pandemic,"" he said. As pressure from the pandemic eases off, Singapore will need to get back to business as usual for transplants, Dr Hersharan said. This means increasing referrals and accepting higher-risk donors and patients. ""Western countries have already increased transplantation rates to pre-pandemic levels,"" she added. ""Hence, we are hopeful we can follow suit."" Mr Koh Cheun Yang, 44, has been on the kidney transplant wait list for 14 years. He has had both kidneys removed due to a condition which results in cysts forming in them, and goes for dialysis three times a week. His doctor at NUH told him that the pandemic would impact his chances of getting a new kidney, but he remains upbeat. ""I just follow the doctors' and nurses' advice and keep positive,"" said Mr Koh, who works in information technology. ""I've been living my life normally, so it's not a big blow to me. I've been waiting for so long already."" 2017 - 53

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/social-media-appeals-lead-to-more-liver-transplants-from-strangers,Social media appeals lead to more liver transplants from strangers,"SINGAPORE - Online appeals have resulted in more people coming forward to donate their livers to strangers in recent years, a recent study by the National University Hospital (NUH) has found. Between June 2014 and December 2019, the social media effect resulted in seven liver transplants between living donors and people they did not know at NUH's National University Centre for Organ Transplantation (Nucot). In comparison, Nucot performed just two such procedures between living liver donors and strangers in the preceding 18 years. Each such appeal can lead to upwards of 10 people offering to donate a part of their livers, said Associate Professor Shridhar Iyer, surgical director and senior consultant in the Adult Liver Transplant Programme at Nucot. ""We find that people come forward asking to donate livers, even though it is a major surgery, to somebody they don't know,"" he told reporters on June 17. These donors then have to be assessed on their suitability for the procedure, he said. Donors should be above 21, be in good health and meet other conditions such as having a blood type compatible with the patient. Prof Shridhar noted that smokers and those with fatty livers can also qualify as donors, should they be assessed to be suitable after stopping smoking and making diet and lifestyle changes. In liver donations between two adults, the right side of the liver - comprising about 70 per cent of the organ - is donated, with Prof Shridhar noting the remaining 30 per cent is sufficient to regenerate the organ. Donors will be able to recover and perform most normal activities within a month, and be able to do more strenuous activities within six weeks to three months after the procedure. Most cases of living liver donor transplants here, however, were from parent to child, making up 97 of the 204 such operations conducted by Nucot between 1996 - when the procedure was first performed here - and 2019. Liver transplants from living donors are becoming more important, as donations of the organs from the dead have not kept pace with growing demand, said Prof Shridhar. Since 1990, there have been more than 500 liver transplants from both living and deceased donors in Singapore, with most of these procedures performed by Nucot. While Prof Shridhar noted that living donor liver transplant is a complex operation with associated risks, the study - of which he was lead author - found no cases of donor deaths in the 204 procedures performed by Nucot, with less than 10 per cent of donors experiencing complications, which were largely minor. Patients also performed well after such transplants. At five years after the procedure, the survival rate for adult patients who received livers from living donors was 83 per cent, while for children it was 89.2 per cent. Prof Shridhar hopes the study will assure the public it is safe to be a living liver donor in Singapore. Mr Sakthibalan Balathandautham, 29, was recognised as The Straits Times Singaporean of the Year 2021 for donating 23 per cent of his liver to one-year-old Rheya, following a social media appeal in 2020. She was diagnosed with biliary atresia – a rare disease in infants where the bile ducts in the liver are inflamed, blocking bile flow to the gall bladder. It eventually leads to liver failure. Despite surgery to improve the bile flow, her condition did not improve and her parents were told she would need a liver transplant. Mr Sakthibalan, a senior sales executive said that while he has had to cut down on oily and carbohydrate-heavy food since the procedure, he has not suffered any complications. Now two years old, Rheya is doing well, added Mr Sakthibalan, noting he regularly checks in with her parents to see how she is doing. People who wish to donate their livers or other organs, such as kidneys or pancreas, should consult their doctors to check on their suitability, and should do so only when they feel confident about it and are able to spare the time for the procedure and recovery, said Mr Sakthibalan, who is single. ""These kinds of things require a lot of commitment from the donor, and you have to be really healthy,"" he added."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/what-you-need-to-know-about-changes-to-cancer-treatment-insurance-coverage,Changes to cancer treatment insurance coverage and when they will kick in,"SINGAPORE - The cost of cancer treatment has been going up at a much faster pace than other medical treatments. The MediShield Life Council has reported to the Ministry of Health (MOH) that spending on cancer drugs was increasing at 20 per cent a year, as against 6 per cent for other drugs. Together with more cancer patients seeking treatments, MediShield Life payouts for outpatient cancer treatments had gone up by more than 50 per cent from $109 million in 2017 to $168 million in 2020. To rein in the soaring costs, the MOH announced last August that it will allow insurance to only cover effective as well as cost effective drugs and treatments on a newly created Cancer Drug List. The list will cover 90 per cent of treatments given in public hospitals. MOH's Agency for Care Effectiveness has said cancer patients account for about 2 per cent of all patients but cancer drugs constitute 35 per cent of public sector drug spending. It said that on average, 50 per cent of new cancer drugs or newly discovered uses for existing drugs enter the market with no evidence that they improve survival or quality of life. For the five-year period from 2017 to 2021, this spending increased by 90 per cent to $275 million, while overall national age-adjusted cancer mortality improved by 2.1 per cent. The agency was set up in 2015 to assess the impact and value of healthcare technology. MediSave withdrawal and MediShield coverage will be limited to drugs and treatments on the Cancer Drug List. This list was arrived at with input from cancer doctors in the public and private sectors, and are for treatments that have proven both effective and cost-effective. Those not on the list cannot be covered. At the same time, the MOH has changed the amount of cancer coverage by MediShield Life, the compulsory national health insurance. Instead of a flat rate of up to $3,000 a month, it will cover only the most expensive drug when more than one drug is being prescribed. If it is a combination therapy that is on the list, all the drugs in the combination therapy will be covered with amounts ranging from $200 to $9,600 a month. The MOH will also raise the ceiling for Singaporeans who can benefit from Medication Assistance Fund (MAF) from a per capita household income of $2,800 to $6,500, with subsidies ranging from 40 to 75 per cent. With the changes, MOH said close to 90 per cent of subsidised Singaporean patients who use treatments on the Cancer Drug List will have their cancer drug bills fully covered by subsidy and MediShield Life, subject to co-payment which can be paid using MediSave. The rule about insurance coverage for only drugs and their use that are on the Cancer Drug List will be extended to Integrated Shield Plans (IP). IP insurers will not be allowed to continue covering patients on treatments that are not on the list. About 70 per cent of people here have bought IPs that pay for private care. The MOH told The Straits Times that if IPs continue to cover cancer treatments the way they do now, ""claims and premiums will increase unsustainably and become unaffordable to many""."

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/more-than-150-tested-positive-for-tb-in-jalan-bukit-merah-moh-extends-screening,About 170 test positive for TB in Bukit Merah; MOH extends screening,"SINGAPORE - Some 30 per cent of 574 residents and workers at 2 Jalan Bukit Merah - or about 170 people - who went through voluntary testing in late May have tested positive for tuberculosis. The Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Friday (June 24) that further tests would be run for those living and working at the site – a Housing Board block with several shops on the ground floor – who tested positive to determine if they have TB infection or active TB disease. ""Those with active TB disease will be treated while those with latent TB infection will be given appointments for follow-up at the TB Control Unit and offered treatment if suitable,"" said MOH in the release. The ministry has also detected one more case that is ""genetically linked by whole genome sequencing"", with contact investigations under way. MOH offered tests for current and former residents, stallholders, shop owners and their employees in that block last month as a preventive measure after seven people were diagnosed with TB at the block between February 2021 and March this year. In its statement last month, MOH said that a genetic analysis in April revealed a similar genetic make-up in the first seven cases, suggesting that the cases were linked to at least one common source. There are still 175 people in the block who have yet to be screened and MOH will extend TB screening for people at that location to Saturday. Screening will be available from 9am to 5.30pm. The screening is mandatory under the Infectious Diseases Act and those who have been recalled for further tests will also be required to complete these tests. The extended screening and further tests are free. MOH said staff from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases have visited non-respondent units to urge residents who had not been screened earlier to undergo screening. Screening is not necessary for people who had occasionally visited the block or its vicinity as the risk of transmission to those who are transient contacts of a TB case is low, MOH added. According to MOH, the symptoms of TB disease include a persistent cough that lasts three weeks or longer, low-grade fever, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss and chest pain. MOH said on Friday: “TB is typically spread through close and prolonged contact with an infectious individual, and not by contact with items or surfaces touched by a person with TB.  “Therefore, persons who are contacted and screened following the detection of a TB individual typically comprise family members, close workplace colleagues and acquaintances from common social activities with close and regular interaction.”  The screening station is located at the Queenstown Hock San Zone Residents’ Committee Centre at Block 3 Jalan Bukit Merah. Those who are unavailable to attend this screening can get tested at the designated Sata CommHealth Potong Pasir Medical Centre before Aug 5, MOH said."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/drug-combination-could-be-less-invasive-treatment-for-breast-cancer-study-finds,"Drug combination could be less invasive treatment for breast cancer, study finds","SINGAPORE - When Madam Lim Hay Eng experienced a relapse of her breast cancer in 2017, she was concerned about the side effects of any treatments for her condition. She was first diagnosed with stage three breast cancer in 2011, and underwent surgery to remove cancerous tissues and lymph nodes. She was placed on chemotherapy for about six months, which often left her weak and unwell, leading to her being sent to the intensive care unit on three separate occasions over the course of six months. When the cancer came back five years ago, her doctor recommended that the 66-year-old retiree - now battling stage four breast cancer, which had spread to other parts of her body including her liver - try a new orally taken therapy, which was more convenient and had more manageable side effects. Female breast cancer is the most common cancer in Singapore, affecting more than 2,000 women each year, with more than 400 dying from the disease annually, according to figures from the Singapore Cancer Registry. Researchers from the National University Cancer Institute, Singapore (NCIS) at the National University Hospital and the Cancer Science Institute of Singapore (CSI Singapore) at the National University of Singapore found that combining two drugs - letrozole and lenvatinib - might help those with advanced stage metastatic breast cancer achieve better control of the disease. Letrozole is an anti-hormonal drug, while lenvatinib is already approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for use in treating cancers such as thyroid and liver. The researchers conducted a study of 43 patients with stage four breast cancer who had failed multiple prior therapies. Half of those given the combined therapy either saw their tumours shrink or experienced good control of the disease for more than six months, with many able to continue normal daily activities. ""There was no pain at all,"" Madam Lim told reporters on Friday (June 24). Noting that the orally taken nature of the medication meant that the dosage could be adjusted to suit her, she said she could perform household chores and spend time with her grandchildren. The treatment - which was administered to Madam Lim between January 2020 and February this year - resulted in a 7.6cm tumour in her liver shrinking by about 30 per cent to 5.5cm within the first few months, and helped control its growth for the two years that she was on the trial. The study's lead investigator, Professor Lee Soo Chin, told the media that ""currently, there is an ongoing late phase trial that is running at our institution that will compare this combination directly against standard second-line treatment"". Prof Lee - who is also head of the Department of Haematology-Oncology at NCIS and senior principal investigator at CSI Singapore - hopes the study will be completed in a few years. She expects that the treatment will be made affordable for patients, if the trial turns out successful and the treatment becomes a standard clinical option."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/vaccinations-more-than-halved-potential-global-covid-19-death-toll-lancet-study,Vaccinations more than halved potential global Covid-19 death toll: Lancet study,"SINGAPORE - Vaccinations more than halved the potential global death toll due to Covid-19, as an estimated 19.8 million deaths were averted in the first year after vaccines were introduced, according to a mathematical modelling study just published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. These reductions were concentrated in high-income countries that relied on their vaccination programmes to relax interventions and allow SARS CoV-2 transmission to increase as they moved into a new stage of the pandemic, the authors said. The researchers from Imperial College London estimated that 31.4 million people would have died, if no one had been vaccinated in the first year of vaccination, beginning Dec 8, 2020. ""However, because of vaccination, we estimate that 19.8 million of these lives were saved,"" said the study's lead author, Dr Oliver Watson. The estimates were based on excess deaths from 185 countries and territories. China was not included in the analysis owing to its large population and strict lockdown measures, which would have skewed the findings. The excess deaths, which are deaths that occur over and beyond what is typically expected in a year without a pandemic, could have been caused directly or indirectly by the coronavirus.  Many lower-middle income countries were not able to meet vaccine targets in the first year after they were introduced, and as a result, lost hundreds of thousands of lives. The study estimated that 156,900 additional deaths would have been averted if the vaccination target of 20 per cent set by global vaccine-sharing initiative Covax had been reached in that time frame, and a further 599,300 deaths would have been averted if the World Health Organisation's (WHO) 2021 Covid-19 vaccination target of 40 per cent of each country's population had been reached. Dr Watson said in a release that ""if the targets set out by the WHO had been achieved, we estimate that roughly one in five of the estimated lives lost due to Covid-19 in low-income countries could have been prevented"". More than three-quarters of the 19.8 million deaths averted were due to the protection directly provided by vaccination against severe symptoms. The remaining 4.3 million averted deaths were estimated to have had indirect protection because the use of vaccines led to reduced transmission of the virus in the population and burden on healthcare systems, thereby improving access to medical care for those most in need. The indirect protection extended to both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, said Dr Watson. First, populations with high vaccination coverage will have fewer transmission events, which reduces the likelihood of an individual encountering someone with an infection, he said. Second, individuals who are vaccinated but still become infected are likely to be less infectious than if they did not have a vaccine. This reduces how likely they are to lead to onward infections, he added. The latest study is the first to estimate the impact of Covid-19 vaccinations on a global scale and the first to assess the number of deaths averted both directly and indirectly. ""Such studies are absolutely necessary in health policy to determine the extent of preventable morbidity and mortality,"" said Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore. While these figures are at best an estimate, they nonetheless highlight the vital contributions of vaccines in saving lives. ""More importantly, it also demonstrates the collective benefit to the world if the challenge of inequality in vaccine access and delivery could have been successfully addressed,"" he said. The true death toll of the pandemic is unclear, but excess deaths have far outstripped official fatalities. Estimates released by the WHO in May showed that the excess deaths in the first two years of the pandemic were nearly 15 million. Singapore saw about 1,535 excess deaths in 2021, after accounting for the country's ageing population, and 52 per cent or 804 deaths were due to Covid-19, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said in May. Deaths due to Covid-19 will continue to accrue, as there will be people who will succumb to the complications arising from an infection. This is regardless of whether immune levels are waning or not, said Prof Teo. In a comment linked to the study, Professor Alison Galvani from the Yale University School of Public Health in the United States who was not involved in the research, said: ""The inequitable distribution of vaccines has prolonged the pandemic, and exacerbated the probability and frequency of the emergence of variants of concern. Additionally, many of these novel variants evade host immunity, thereby eroding vaccine efficacy, as well as increasing transmissibility."" The ""provision of vaccine doses from high-income to lower-income countries is therefore not only moral but also pragmatic"", she said."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/seniors-turn-up-to-receive-booster-shots-with-opening-of-five-new-vaccination-centres,Seniors turn up for booster shots as 5 new vaccination centres open,"SINGAPORE - He keeps a busy schedule and had just returned from a business trip to India, but on Thursday (June 23), Mr Ivan Lim was at the new Covid-19 joint testing and vaccination centre in Bukit Merah. He had turned up for his second booster shot. The 65-year-old director of a logistics company was among a number of seniors who streamed in to the centre in Lower Delta Road - one of five new vaccination centres which opened on Thursday. ""I travel quite often for work, and with cases increasing and the possibility of a new Covid-19 wave, it is necessary to take the booster,"" said Mr Lim, adding that he was in the area. The new centres, located in Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Merah, Sengkang, Woodlands and Yishun, will offer mRNA vaccines. This brings the total to 10 joint testing and vaccination centre across Singapore. Those aged 50 and above can walk in to any vaccination centre for a second booster shot. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH) website, the centres can also conduct antigen rapid tests and polymerase chain reaction tests. They are also designed so that operations can be scaled up if new Covid-19 variants emerge. When the Straits Times visited the vaccination centre in Bukit Merah at 2pm on Thursday, there were around 10 people in the queue. From 9am, the centre saw around 60 people, mostly elderly, walking in to get their shots. Colour-coded signs inform people about the different services available - green for the vaccination sections and purple for the testing areas. An MOH spokesman said the two areas do not intersect, and there is no possibility of contact between the two groups of people. A 66-year-old retiree, who wanted to be known only as Mr Fan, said he waited less than 30 minutes for his second booster jab. ""With the new variant and more people getting Covid-19, it is better to just get a jab. I am not young any more,"" he added. Singapore could be hit by the next wave of the virus in July or August due to the new Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung earlier this month. But MOH said 80,000 seniors aged 60 and above have yet to get their booster shots, even though this means they would be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill or dying of Covid-19. At the Yishun vaccination centre, about 50 people turned up between 9am and 1pm to get their shots. The crowd thinned out after lunch. Limousine taxi driver Leong Yin Wew, 65, was there for his fourth Pfizer shot. He added that he did not experience side effects from his previous three shots. ""I read in the news that a vaccination centre was opening in Yishun and decided to listen to the advice (to get a second booster),"" he said. Meanwhile, MOH said it will be closing the vaccination centre at Raffles City Convention Centre on July 18 as it consolidates its resources. The operating hours and locations of the 10 joint testing and vaccination centres can be found here."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/singapore-unlikely-to-roll-back-covid-19-rules-due-to-ba4ba5-wave-experts,S'pore unlikely to roll back Covid-19 rules due to wave driven by Omicron subvariants: Experts,"SINGAPORE - It is unlikely that Singapore will tighten Covid-19 rules across the board in response to the recent upswing in virus cases, public health experts told The Straits Times. This is especially since the country is in a good position to deal with the next wave and any rollback will have a significant impact on the economy and society. ""We would need good justification,"" said infectious diseases expert Dale Fisher. ""It's really hard to see a situation where you'd want to resume blanket measures, as they have a social and economic impact. You would want to make sure it is necessary."" Professor Fisher, a senior consultant at the National University Hospital, added that tightening measures would be necessary only if a new variant - which people have no immunity against - emerged, or if a completely new virus surfaced. Singapore has seen an uptick in Covid-19 cases driven by the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants, which are more transmissible but have not been linked to higher hospitalisation and death rates. On Tuesday (June 21), the Health Ministry said these variants accounted for around 30 per cent of all virus cases in the past week, up from 17 per cent the week before. A total of 7,109 new cases were reported that day, making for a 23 per cent week-on-week increase in community infections. There were 6,606 new cases on Thursday. Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore, noted that these variants have been spreading across multiple countries over the past two months, with both North America and Europe seeing a surge in local transmissions. ""The proliferation of Covid-19 infections internationally that are caused by the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants will certainly spill over to Singapore, given that the country is an international air and trading hub,"" he said. Asked if increased travel during the June holiday period is behind the recent increase in Covid-19 cases, Associate Professor Alex Cook, vice-dean of research at the Saw Swee Hock School, said this was unlikely to be the case. While travel may have brought these subvariants into Singapore, their spread is a result of inherently greater transmissibility and lower effective immunity against them compared with Omicron, he said. The experts reiterated that hospital capacity - especially bed space in the intensive care unit - will impact the country's decision to reinstate safe management measures. In any case, Singapore is more prepared to handle any surges, given that it successfully coped with the Omicron wave, they said. ""Now, more of us are doubly protected because of being vaccinated and having been infected during that wave,"" Prof Cook said. ""So, the proportion of infected people getting hospitalised should be lower and hence more manageable by the healthcare system."" It could make sense to tighten measures in settings such as hospitals and nursing homes, where there are more vulnerable people, Prof Fisher added. ""But really, the best protection for people in those specific settings is vaccination - that advice has never gone away."" How should Singaporeans then react to the latest upswing in Covid-19 infections? Prof Teo said there was no need for people to live in a state of paranoia, and that they should instead exercise personal responsibility by getting vaccinated when necessary and doing self-tests when unwell. ""There is certainly no harm in people following news on the Covid-19 situation locally and internationally, but there is no cause for concern or to be unduly influenced by Covid-19 trends,"" he said. ""There are specific health units established overseas and locally to sound the alarm when the situation warrants additional attention and concern."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/more-turn-up-for-their-shots-to-guard-against-coming-covid-19-wave,People turn up for Covid-19 shots to guard against next wave,"SINGAPORE - While Covid-19 vaccination centres were not crowded on Wednesday (June 22), people who did turn up for their shots said that they did so in anticipation of the next wave of infections which could be around the corner. At the Raffles City Convention Centre vaccination centre on Wednesday afternoon, there were more than 20 people in the waiting area. Housewife Evelyn Chua was there with her 12-year-old daughter, who was due for her third shot. ""I'm worried about the new wave as many friends are coming back from overseas,"" said the 43-year-old. ""I want to be prepared for it."" Earlier this month, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said that Singapore could be hit by the next wave of the virus in July or August due to the new Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5. He advised those who had not done so to get their booster shots. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), 77 per cent of the population has received at least one booster shot. Worryingly however, 80,000 seniors aged 60 and above have yet to get their booster shots, even though this means they would be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill or dying from Covid-19. In fact, seniors aged 70 years and above, especially those aged 80 years and above, are strongly urged to take their second booster shot to give them added protection. MOH said on Tuesday that there had been a 23 per cent week-on-week increase in Covid-19 community infections, with the rise largely driven by an increased spread of the Omicron subvariants. Anyone aged 50 and above can walk in to any vaccination centre for his second booster. At Hougang Community Club, Ms Irene Tan, 43, was with her daughter, Chloe Tan to get her second shot. Ms Tan said: ""Chloe got Covid-19 in February so she could only get her second jab now. We wanted to get her vaccinated before the centres close."" And Mr Zhang Qian Cheng, 26, a chef who got his booster shot at Queenstown Community Centre, said he was worried that he would be denied entry to bars and clubs in future if he did not get his latest shot. When The Straits Times visited Queenstown Community Centre at 5pm, Secondary  3 student Tai Yi Wei was resting at the seating area after taking his booster shot. Yi Wei, 15, said: ""None of my family members has gotten Covid-19 and I am worried that we might be infected."" Noting that people around him have tested positive for coronavirus, he added: ""I am worried because some of my classmates and relatives have tested positive."" ""I want to protect myself and my family from the virus so it is better to just get vaccinated."" From Thursday, five new joint testing and vaccination centres (JTVCs) will begin operations. They are located in Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Merah, Sengkang, Woodlands and Yishun and each offers two types of Covid-19 vaccines. The new centres add to the five existing JTVCs in Bishan, Commonwealth, Jurong East, Kaki Bukit, and Pasir Ris. Correction note: This article has been edited for accuracy."
