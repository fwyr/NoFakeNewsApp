Mark Gordon. “Regime change will unquestionably help spread democracy to the freedom-loving people of Wyoming and further advance our ability to broker a lasting peace between North and South Dakota. In fact, I’m sure the streets of Cheyenne will erupt into joy at the city’s liberation. To the people of Wyoming, I say this: Your state is rich with resources and human talent. With the help of Rep. Liz Cheney, you can build a future of stability, self-determination, and prosperity that will last for years to come.” At press time, Cheney denied claims that 257 Wyoming civilians had  died in an overnight raid to keep polls open for several additional hours."
https://www.theonion.com/report-not-protecting-children-very-well-saved-u-s-5-1849349154,Report: Not Protecting Children Very Well Saved U.S. $5 Trillion Over Last Decade,"BALTIMORE—Amid concerns about economic stagnation and rising federal debt, an encouraging report released Monday by researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that not protecting children very well saved the United States around $5 trillion over the last decade. “Our data shows that refraining from investments in expensive projects that improve or even simply maintain the health, safety, and overall well-being of this nation’s youth saves both federal and local governments billions of dollars per year,” said study co-author Erick Rosen, attributing the savings in part to lax regulations on companies using harmful chemicals in common foods and household items, avoiding improvements that would make roadways safer, and neglecting pediatric care. “While placing America’s children in an environment rife with treatable diseases, gun violence, and poverty may have its downsides, there is no denying the financial savings it generates. Importantly, these cost savings should continue to increase as long as this country continues to put off removing lead from pipes, repairing dangerous playgrounds, and improving the education system. Ultimately, there is a strong correlation between just kind of letting whatever happens to our children happen and a more cost-effective overall financial picture, and we expect this dynamic to continue.” A related study from Texas A&M University found that not protecting foreign children also offered numerous economic benefits, pointing to the billions of dollars in profits American companies generated by bombing them."

LOUIS—Warning that the corn found in kitchens, grocery stores, and restaurants across the country were ticking time bombs, Monsanto executive Jeff Dunbarton threatened to detonate every corncob in the nation Wednesday unless his demands were met. “Should you fail to deliver the $20 billion I require, I will be forced to set off every single ear of corn in America,” the company’s head of crop science said before blowing up an 800-acre Iowa cornfield as a demonstration, claiming that was just a small taste of what was to come if he did not receive the full amount by midnight. “We have genetically engineered all cobs to have the maximum blast radius, which would blow kernels through the skull of every man, woman, and child across the country. In addition, if you have consumed corn in the past 24 hours, the detonation will cause your abdomen to forcefully explode as the partially digested kernels rupture your intestines.” At press time, the cackling executive was reportedly counting his money when he decided to go ahead and level the entire Midwest anyway."

Well, today, in tandem with the newly installed jump ramps and corkscrew turns, Americans can once again release an oil slick at their competitor and yell ‘yippee!’” At press time, Buttigieg had abruptly concluded the press conference after receiving a questions about the epidemic of traffic fatalities caused by American drivers crashing into explosive TNT crates."
https://www.theonion.com/ukraine-completes-successful-takeover-of-russia-1849434577,Ukraine Completes Successful Takeover Of Russia,"MOSCOW—A bloody and costly months-long conflict between the two nations ended in an unconditional surrender early Friday morning after Ukraine completed its successful takeover of Russia. “While much of the world’s attention moved on, our people continued to fight, and today we have finally achieved our ultimate aim of annexing all of Russia into the nation of Ukraine,” said victorious Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky from the Kremlin, where he personally presided as deposed President Vladimir Putin and other top Russian officials were led away in chains. “At the beginning of this war, Russia overplayed her hand, and many around the world wrote us off. But our counter-offensives this summer went better than even we expected, and after we seized Russia’s entire railway system in June, we began to see a complete takeover as a real possibility. These past few weeks, as we successfully occupied Moscow, St. Petersburg, and several key military bases, the writing was on the wall. After accepting Putin’s surrender, my message to the 150 million former citizens of Russia is this: Though you fought hard, we have unambiguously defeated you in battle, and we now invite you to move forward with us as Ukrainians. Those who do not comply will join members of the Russian military and other dissidents in Ukrainian labor camps. We believe, however, that you will unite with us, because Ukrainians and Russians have always been the same people.” With the Russian domino having fallen, Zelensky added that troops were already mobilizing to  conquer Georgia, Poland, and Kazakhstan and make them all part of a united Ukraine."

Indeed, many of them were so brazen that they walked directly into the sea, where they floundered and suffered the same fate as so many before them.” The study also confirmed that major exploration of the Americas did not start, however, until humans created the technology to bind human corpses together into a raft and set sail for the New World."

There were dozens of high-ranking family members in attendance who could have been apprehended by our military. Our security officers knew the wedding’s date. They knew what was on the registry. They even knew what was being served for dessert. And yet they sat idly by while these people danced the night away and gave well wishes to the happy couple. How can the American people ever trust them again?” At press time, the Pentagon had denied wrongdoing in the incident, stressing that their forces had been engaged at the time in bombing a kindergarten classroom."

Every bus driver and train conductor will be wearing those reflective visor sunglasses and dressed in these badass steampunk trench coats. But it’s about more than just looks. There’ll be a lot of laser whirring noises all the time, and, every once in a while, just a low, vibrational rumble. We’re going to have all kinds of hologram advertisements on everything that will know information about you personally. It’ll be like Tokyo times a thousand.” Advising reporters that his job title and the name of his department had changed, Buttigieg added that he should henceforth be referred to as the Grand Admiral of the Department of Teleportation."

Paraphernalia like bookmarks, highlighters, and library cards will be immediately confiscated. And don’t think you can get away with hiding a paperback in your pocket, either. We will not hesitate to conduct a strip search.” At press time, all schools in the area had gone into lockdown after someone reportedly entered a junior high carrying a copy of The Giver. "

Alright, bud?  Sorry if that’s too much. Just a suggestion.” At press time, sources confirmed that a thousand year reign of femininity and estrogen had been inaugurated after Taylor was told that he also occasionally repeated the ideas of female coworkers as if they were his own."

That’s based on unanimous glowing reviews from several of our product testers in the instant before it stopped their hearts. If the cost alarms you, there’s also Herman Miller Fryer, our runner-up, which is of course the most classically iconic electric chair on the market. It offers all the speed and lethality of an injection cocktail as well as comfortable leather straps and timeless modernist touches. While you can’t go wrong with the top options, for those on a tight budget, there’s the Alcatraz 2.0, which is super stylish but unfortunately is unlikely to kill you.” Wirecutter staff also offered a disclaimer that if any prisons did purchase an electric chair through their site, they would earn a commission fee.

In fact, there’s nothing that should stop  you from turning to the nearest person and just saying everything that  comes to your mind. It will probably be incredibly interesting.” At press  time, the report suggested that maybe you shouldn’t bring up the race  stuff."

Plus, you’ll notice a resort fee of $50 per extra person in the room beyond two adults, and our daily parking rate for the 20 armored vehicles you left with our valets. And we did have to double the cleaning fee, seeing as you all left quite the mess of boxes and papers behind. If you’d like to dispute any of these charges, you’ll have to take them up with your personal financial institution, which in your case would be Congress.” Burns went on to explain that since she didn’t know how to charge the agency for the documents they removed from the property, that would show up on the bill as “stolen towels.”"

Especially when we have an ideal location for the factory right where the Watsons’ kitchen table now stands. Furthermore, enlarging the factory here will bring hundreds of new jobs to the Watsons’ home, among myriad other economic benefits. The site’s developers have assured me that any industrial runoff can go into the sink, and if there are any threats to air quality, one of the children can simply open a window to let it out. While we regret that the factory’s installation where the fridge used to be unintentionally created a food desert in the house, we need our residents to understand that we’re doing what is best holistically for the city.” At press time, city officials decided to knock the whole building down without any warning."

Prove it. It will be the responsibility of the cashier to make sure not a single crumb is left behind at checkout. Once you’re done, you’re done for the month.

He eats this stuff up, this little freak is always reading through lunch.

Ron DeSantis, adding that he thought it was disgusting for the Justice Department to target a former president when it had totally ignored Dick Dastardly’s repeated schemes to destroy beloved American war hero Yankee Doodle Pigeon. “President Trump spent four years doing nothing but helping the American people, yet the FBI has never once obtained a search warrant to enter Dick Dastardly’s dreaded Mean Machine. Plus, none of his associates like Zilly, Klunk, or any of the Vulture Squadron have even once been questioned. This is a banana republic!” At press time, DeSantis told reporters he had gathered several video confessions of Dick Dastardly yelling “Drat, drat, and double drat!” and “Curses, foiled again!” and was planning on turning them over as a part of a rival GOP probe."

When I look at him now, I’m endeared by him, and almost want to be his friend.

And why on earth did you do them all at once? If you don’t space them out a little, it’s pretty fucking obvious what you’re up to. Then again, maybe you amateurs don’t realize the goal is not to get media attention, considering you published all the details in a state-run newspaper! How stupid can you be?

Raytheon also told the Pentagon it had a really good idea for a knife that exploded into hundreds of tiny knives, a project Congress was eager to invest in. Ultimately, although the trials for this project did not produce enough tangible results to move forward, Raytheon  submitted another idea for an artificially intelligent tire that rolls into terrorists, and that’s what your personal tax dollars are being used for in 2022.” The report added that the IRS was originally planning to give you a refund this year, but put the money toward the Raytheon CEO’s annual bonus instead."

Those who do not comply will join members of the Russian military and other dissidents in Ukrainian labor camps. We believe, however, that you will unite with us, because Ukrainians and Russians have always been the same people.” With the Russian domino having fallen, Zelensky added that troops were already mobilizing to  conquer Georgia, Poland, and Kazakhstan and make them all part of a united Ukraine."

Indeed, many of them were so brazen that they walked directly into the sea, where they floundered and suffered the same fate as so many before them.” The study also confirmed that major exploration of the Americas did not start, however, until humans created the technology to bind human corpses together into a raft and set sail for the New World."

There were dozens of high-ranking family members in attendance who could have been apprehended by our military. Our security officers knew the wedding’s date. They knew what was on the registry.

That’s based on unanimous glowing reviews from several of our product testers in the instant before it stopped their hearts. If the cost alarms you, there’s also Herman Miller Fryer, our runner-up, which is of course the most classically iconic electric chair on the market. It offers all the speed and lethality of an injection cocktail as well as comfortable leather straps and timeless modernist touches. While you can’t go wrong with the top options, for those on a tight budget, there’s the Alcatraz 2.0, which is super stylish but unfortunately is unlikely to kill you.” Wirecutter staff also offered a disclaimer that if any prisons did purchase an electric chair through their site, they would earn a commission fee.

Plus, you’ll notice a resort fee of $50 per extra person in the room beyond two adults, and our daily parking rate for the 20 armored vehicles you left with our valets. And we did have to double the cleaning fee, seeing as you all left quite the mess of boxes and papers behind. If you’d like to dispute any of these charges, you’ll have to take them up with your personal financial institution, which in your case would be Congress.” Burns went on to explain that since she didn’t know how to charge the agency for the documents they removed from the property, that would show up on the bill as “stolen towels.”"

Especially when we have an ideal location for the factory right where the Watsons’ kitchen table now stands. Furthermore, enlarging the factory here will bring hundreds of new jobs to the Watsons’ home, among myriad other economic benefits. The site’s developers have assured me that any industrial runoff can go into the sink, and if there are any threats to air quality, one of the children can simply open a window to let it out.

Ron DeSantis, adding that he thought it was disgusting for the Justice Department to target a former president when it had totally ignored Dick Dastardly’s repeated schemes to destroy beloved American war hero Yankee Doodle Pigeon. “President Trump spent four years doing nothing but helping the American people, yet the FBI has never once obtained a search warrant to enter Dick Dastardly’s dreaded Mean Machine. Plus, none of his associates like Zilly, Klunk, or any of the Vulture Squadron have even once been questioned.

Raytheon also told the Pentagon it had a really good idea for a knife that exploded into hundreds of tiny knives, a project Congress was eager to invest in. Ultimately, although the trials for this project did not produce enough tangible results to move forward, Raytheon  submitted another idea for an artificially intelligent tire that rolls into terrorists, and that’s what your personal tax dollars are being used for in 2022.” The report added that the IRS was originally planning to give you a refund this year, but put the money toward the Raytheon CEO’s annual bonus instead."

Importantly, these cost savings should continue to increase as long as this country continues to put off removing lead from pipes, repairing dangerous playgrounds, and improving the education system. Ultimately, there is a strong correlation between just kind of letting whatever happens to our children happen and a more cost-effective overall financial picture, and we expect this dynamic to continue.” A related study from Texas A&M University found that not protecting foreign children also offered numerous economic benefits, pointing to the billions of dollars in profits American companies generated by bombing them."

That’s based on unanimous glowing reviews from several of our product testers in the instant before it stopped their hearts. If the cost alarms you, there’s also Herman Miller Fryer, our runner-up, which is of course the most classically iconic electric chair on the market. It offers all the speed and lethality of an injection cocktail as well as comfortable leather straps and timeless modernist touches. While you can’t go wrong with the top options, for those on a tight budget, there’s the Alcatraz 2.0, which is super stylish but unfortunately is unlikely to kill you.” Wirecutter staff also offered a disclaimer that if any prisons did purchase an electric chair through their site, they would earn a commission fee.

Especially when we have an ideal location for the factory right where the Watsons’ kitchen table now stands. Furthermore, enlarging the factory here will bring hundreds of new jobs to the Watsons’ home, among myriad other economic benefits. The site’s developers have assured me that any industrial runoff can go into the sink, and if there are any threats to air quality, one of the children can simply open a window to let it out.

Raytheon also told the Pentagon it had a really good idea for a knife that exploded into hundreds of tiny knives, a project Congress was eager to invest in. Ultimately, although the trials for this project did not produce enough tangible results to move forward, Raytheon  submitted another idea for an artificially intelligent tire that rolls into terrorists, and that’s what your personal tax dollars are being used for in 2022.” The report added that the IRS was originally planning to give you a refund this year, but put the money toward the Raytheon CEO’s annual bonus instead."

Mark Gordon. “Regime change will unquestionably help spread democracy to the freedom-loving people of Wyoming and further advance our ability to broker a lasting peace between North and South Dakota. In fact, I’m sure the streets of Cheyenne will erupt into joy at the city’s liberation. To the people of Wyoming, I say this: Your state is rich with resources and human talent. With the help of Rep.

Importantly, these cost savings should continue to increase as long as this country continues to put off removing lead from pipes, repairing dangerous playgrounds, and improving the education system. Ultimately, there is a strong correlation between just kind of letting whatever happens to our children happen and a more cost-effective overall financial picture, and we expect this dynamic to continue.” A related study from Texas A&M University found that not protecting foreign children also offered numerous economic benefits, pointing to the billions of dollars in profits American companies generated by bombing them."

But our counter-offensives this summer went better than even we expected, and after we seized Russia’s entire railway system in June, we began to see a complete takeover as a real possibility. These past few weeks, as we successfully occupied Moscow, St. Petersburg, and several key military bases, the writing was on the wall. After accepting Putin’s surrender, my message to the 150 million former citizens of Russia is this: Though you fought hard, we have unambiguously defeated you in battle, and we now invite you to move forward with us as Ukrainians. Those who do not comply will join members of the Russian military and other dissidents in Ukrainian labor camps. We believe, however, that you will unite with us, because Ukrainians and Russians have always been the same people.” With the Russian domino having fallen, Zelensky added that troops were already mobilizing to  conquer Georgia, Poland, and Kazakhstan and make them all part of a united Ukraine."

Indeed, many of them were so brazen that they walked directly into the sea, where they floundered and suffered the same fate as so many before them.” The study also confirmed that major exploration of the Americas did not start, however, until humans created the technology to bind human corpses together into a raft and set sail for the New World."

Especially when we have an ideal location for the factory right where the Watsons’ kitchen table now stands. Furthermore, enlarging the factory here will bring hundreds of new jobs to the Watsons’ home, among myriad other economic benefits. The site’s developers have assured me that any industrial runoff can go into the sink, and if there are any threats to air quality, one of the children can simply open a window to let it out. While we regret that the factory’s installation where the fridge used to be unintentionally created a food desert in the house, we need our residents to understand that we’re doing what is best holistically for the city.” At press time, city officials decided to knock the whole building down without any warning."

Raytheon also told the Pentagon it had a really good idea for a knife that exploded into hundreds of tiny knives, a project Congress was eager to invest in. Ultimately, although the trials for this project did not produce enough tangible results to move forward, Raytheon  submitted another idea for an artificially intelligent tire that rolls into terrorists, and that’s what your personal tax dollars are being used for in 2022.” The report added that the IRS was originally planning to give you a refund this year, but put the money toward the Raytheon CEO’s annual bonus instead."

Mark Gordon. “Regime change will unquestionably help spread democracy to the freedom-loving people of Wyoming and further advance our ability to broker a lasting peace between North and South Dakota. In fact, I’m sure the streets of Cheyenne will erupt into joy at the city’s liberation. To the people of Wyoming, I say this: Your state is rich with resources and human talent. With the help of Rep.

Importantly, these cost savings should continue to increase as long as this country continues to put off removing lead from pipes, repairing dangerous playgrounds, and improving the education system. Ultimately, there is a strong correlation between just kind of letting whatever happens to our children happen and a more cost-effective overall financial picture, and we expect this dynamic to continue.” A related study from Texas A&M University found that not protecting foreign children also offered numerous economic benefits, pointing to the billions of dollars in profits American companies generated by bombing them."

But our counter-offensives this summer went better than even we expected, and after we seized Russia’s entire railway system in June, we began to see a complete takeover as a real possibility. These past few weeks, as we successfully occupied Moscow, St. Petersburg, and several key military bases, the writing was on the wall. After accepting Putin’s surrender, my message to the 150 million former citizens of Russia is this: Though you fought hard, we have unambiguously defeated you in battle, and we now invite you to move forward with us as Ukrainians. Those who do not comply will join members of the Russian military and other dissidents in Ukrainian labor camps. We believe, however, that you will unite with us, because Ukrainians and Russians have always been the same people.” With the Russian domino having fallen, Zelensky added that troops were already mobilizing to  conquer Georgia, Poland, and Kazakhstan and make them all part of a united Ukraine."

Indeed, many of them were so brazen that they walked directly into the sea, where they floundered and suffered the same fate as so many before them.” The study also confirmed that major exploration of the Americas did not start, however, until humans created the technology to bind human corpses together into a raft and set sail for the New World."

That’s based on unanimous glowing reviews from several of our product testers in the instant before it stopped their hearts. If the cost alarms you, there’s also Herman Miller Fryer, our runner-up, which is of course the most classically iconic electric chair on the market. It offers all the speed and lethality of an injection cocktail as well as comfortable leather straps and timeless modernist touches. While you can’t go wrong with the top options, for those on a tight budget, there’s the Alcatraz 2.0, which is super stylish but unfortunately is unlikely to kill you.” Wirecutter staff also offered a disclaimer that if any prisons did purchase an electric chair through their site, they would earn a commission fee.

Essentially, we have to start from scratch.” At press time, Zuckerberg took several minutes to congratulate his engineers on their decision to eliminate the lower half of his avatar’s body, saying it fully captured how sexless he was in real life."

And why on earth did you do them all at once? If you don’t space them out a little, it’s pretty fucking obvious what you’re up to. Then again, maybe you amateurs don’t realize the goal is not to get media attention, considering you published all the details in a state-run newspaper! How stupid can you be?

Raytheon also told the Pentagon it had a really good idea for a knife that exploded into hundreds of tiny knives, a project Congress was eager to invest in. Ultimately, although the trials for this project did not produce enough tangible results to move forward, Raytheon  submitted another idea for an artificially intelligent tire that rolls into terrorists, and that’s what your personal tax dollars are being used for in 2022.” The report added that the IRS was originally planning to give you a refund this year, but put the money toward the Raytheon CEO’s annual bonus instead."

https://www.theonion.com/report-not-protecting-children-very-well-saved-u-s-5-1849349154,Report: Not Protecting Children Very Well Saved U.S. $5 Trillion Over Last Decade,"BALTIMORE—Amid concerns about economic stagnation and rising federal debt, an encouraging report released Monday by researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that not protecting children very well saved the United States around $5 trillion over the last decade. “Our data shows that refraining from investments in expensive projects that improve or even simply maintain the health, safety, and overall well-being of this nation’s youth saves both federal and local governments billions of dollars per year,” said study co-author Erick Rosen, attributing the savings in part to lax regulations on companies using harmful chemicals in common foods and household items, avoiding improvements that would make roadways safer, and neglecting pediatric care. “While placing America’s children in an environment rife with treatable diseases, gun violence, and poverty may have its downsides, there is no denying the financial savings it generates. Importantly, these cost savings should continue to increase as long as this country continues to put off removing lead from pipes, repairing dangerous playgrounds, and improving the education system. Ultimately, there is a strong correlation between just kind of letting whatever happens to our children happen and a more cost-effective overall financial picture, and we expect this dynamic to continue.” A related study from Texas A&M University found that not protecting foreign children also offered numerous economic benefits, pointing to the billions of dollars in profits American companies generated by bombing them."

In addition, if you have consumed corn in the past 24 hours, the detonation will cause your abdomen to forcefully explode as the partially digested kernels rupture your intestines.” At press time, the cackling executive was reportedly counting his money when he decided to go ahead and level the entire Midwest anyway."

Well, today, in tandem with the newly installed jump ramps and corkscrew turns, Americans can once again release an oil slick at their competitor and yell ‘yippee!’” At press time, Buttigieg had abruptly concluded the press conference after receiving a questions about the epidemic of traffic fatalities caused by American drivers crashing into explosive TNT crates."

But our counter-offensives this summer went better than even we expected, and after we seized Russia’s entire railway system in June, we began to see a complete takeover as a real possibility. These past few weeks, as we successfully occupied Moscow, St. Petersburg, and several key military bases, the writing was on the wall. After accepting Putin’s surrender, my message to the 150 million former citizens of Russia is this: Though you fought hard, we have unambiguously defeated you in battle, and we now invite you to move forward with us as Ukrainians. Those who do not comply will join members of the Russian military and other dissidents in Ukrainian labor camps. We believe, however, that you will unite with us, because Ukrainians and Russians have always been the same people.” With the Russian domino having fallen, Zelensky added that troops were already mobilizing to  conquer Georgia, Poland, and Kazakhstan and make them all part of a united Ukraine."

Indeed, many of them were so brazen that they walked directly into the sea, where they floundered and suffered the same fate as so many before them.” The study also confirmed that major exploration of the Americas did not start, however, until humans created the technology to bind human corpses together into a raft and set sail for the New World."

There were dozens of high-ranking family members in attendance who could have been apprehended by our military. Our security officers knew the wedding’s date. They knew what was on the registry. They even knew what was being served for dessert. And yet they sat idly by while these people danced the night away and gave well wishes to the happy couple. How can the American people ever trust them again?” At press time, the Pentagon had denied wrongdoing in the incident, stressing that their forces had been engaged at the time in bombing a kindergarten classroom."

That’s based on unanimous glowing reviews from several of our product testers in the instant before it stopped their hearts. If the cost alarms you, there’s also Herman Miller Fryer, our runner-up, which is of course the most classically iconic electric chair on the market. It offers all the speed and lethality of an injection cocktail as well as comfortable leather straps and timeless modernist touches. While you can’t go wrong with the top options, for those on a tight budget, there’s the Alcatraz 2.0, which is super stylish but unfortunately is unlikely to kill you.” Wirecutter staff also offered a disclaimer that if any prisons did purchase an electric chair through their site, they would earn a commission fee.

Plus, you’ll notice a resort fee of $50 per extra person in the room beyond two adults, and our daily parking rate for the 20 armored vehicles you left with our valets. And we did have to double the cleaning fee, seeing as you all left quite the mess of boxes and papers behind. If you’d like to dispute any of these charges, you’ll have to take them up with your personal financial institution, which in your case would be Congress.” Burns went on to explain that since she didn’t know how to charge the agency for the documents they removed from the property, that would show up on the bill as “stolen towels.”"

Especially when we have an ideal location for the factory right where the Watsons’ kitchen table now stands. Furthermore, enlarging the factory here will bring hundreds of new jobs to the Watsons’ home, among myriad other economic benefits. The site’s developers have assured me that any industrial runoff can go into the sink, and if there are any threats to air quality, one of the children can simply open a window to let it out.

https://www.theonion.com/report-not-protecting-children-very-well-saved-u-s-5-1849349154,Report: Not Protecting Children Very Well Saved U.S. $5 Trillion Over Last Decade,"BALTIMORE—Amid concerns about economic stagnation and rising federal debt, an encouraging report released Monday by researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that not protecting children very well saved the United States around $5 trillion over the last decade. “Our data shows that refraining from investments in expensive projects that improve or even simply maintain the health, safety, and overall well-being of this nation’s youth saves both federal and local governments billions of dollars per year,” said study co-author Erick Rosen, attributing the savings in part to lax regulations on companies using harmful chemicals in common foods and household items, avoiding improvements that would make roadways safer, and neglecting pediatric care. “While placing America’s children in an environment rife with treatable diseases, gun violence, and poverty may have its downsides, there is no denying the financial savings it generates. Importantly, these cost savings should continue to increase as long as this country continues to put off removing lead from pipes, repairing dangerous playgrounds, and improving the education system. Ultimately, there is a strong correlation between just kind of letting whatever happens to our children happen and a more cost-effective overall financial picture, and we expect this dynamic to continue.” A related study from Texas A&M University found that not protecting foreign children also offered numerous economic benefits, pointing to the billions of dollars in profits American companies generated by bombing them."

In addition, if you have consumed corn in the past 24 hours, the detonation will cause your abdomen to forcefully explode as the partially digested kernels rupture your intestines.” At press time, the cackling executive was reportedly counting his money when he decided to go ahead and level the entire Midwest anyway."

But our counter-offensives this summer went better than even we expected, and after we seized Russia’s entire railway system in June, we began to see a complete takeover as a real possibility. These past few weeks, as we successfully occupied Moscow, St. Petersburg, and several key military bases, the writing was on the wall. After accepting Putin’s surrender, my message to the 150 million former citizens of Russia is this: Though you fought hard, we have unambiguously defeated you in battle, and we now invite you to move forward with us as Ukrainians. Those who do not comply will join members of the Russian military and other dissidents in Ukrainian labor camps. We believe, however, that you will unite with us, because Ukrainians and Russians have always been the same people.” With the Russian domino having fallen, Zelensky added that troops were already mobilizing to  conquer Georgia, Poland, and Kazakhstan and make them all part of a united Ukraine."

Indeed, many of them were so brazen that they walked directly into the sea, where they floundered and suffered the same fate as so many before them.” The study also confirmed that major exploration of the Americas did not start, however, until humans created the technology to bind human corpses together into a raft and set sail for the New World."

There were dozens of high-ranking family members in attendance who could have been apprehended by our military. Our security officers knew the wedding’s date. They knew what was on the registry. They even knew what was being served for dessert. And yet they sat idly by while these people danced the night away and gave well wishes to the happy couple.

Every bus driver and train conductor will be wearing those reflective visor sunglasses and dressed in these badass steampunk trench coats. But it’s about more than just looks. There’ll be a lot of laser whirring noises all the time, and, every once in a while, just a low, vibrational rumble.

Paraphernalia like bookmarks, highlighters, and library cards will be immediately confiscated. And don’t think you can get away with hiding a paperback in your pocket, either.

That’s based on unanimous glowing reviews from several of our product testers in the instant before it stopped their hearts. If the cost alarms you, there’s also Herman Miller Fryer, our runner-up, which is of course the most classically iconic electric chair on the market. It offers all the speed and lethality of an injection cocktail as well as comfortable leather straps and timeless modernist touches. While you can’t go wrong with the top options, for those on a tight budget, there’s the Alcatraz 2.0, which is super stylish but unfortunately is unlikely to kill you.” Wirecutter staff also offered a disclaimer that if any prisons did purchase an electric chair through their site, they would earn a commission fee.

Plus, you’ll notice a resort fee of $50 per extra person in the room beyond two adults, and our daily parking rate for the 20 armored vehicles you left with our valets. And we did have to double the cleaning fee, seeing as you all left quite the mess of boxes and papers behind. If you’d like to dispute any of these charges, you’ll have to take them up with your personal financial institution, which in your case would be Congress.” Burns went on to explain that since she didn’t know how to charge the agency for the documents they removed from the property, that would show up on the bill as “stolen towels.”"

Especially when we have an ideal location for the factory right where the Watsons’ kitchen table now stands. Furthermore, enlarging the factory here will bring hundreds of new jobs to the Watsons’ home, among myriad other economic benefits. The site’s developers have assured me that any industrial runoff can go into the sink, and if there are any threats to air quality, one of the children can simply open a window to let it out. While we regret that the factory’s installation where the fridge used to be unintentionally created a food desert in the house, we need our residents to understand that we’re doing what is best holistically for the city.” At press time, city officials decided to knock the whole building down without any warning."

Ron DeSantis, adding that he thought it was disgusting for the Justice Department to target a former president when it had totally ignored Dick Dastardly’s repeated schemes to destroy beloved American war hero Yankee Doodle Pigeon. “President Trump spent four years doing nothing but helping the American people, yet the FBI has never once obtained a search warrant to enter Dick Dastardly’s dreaded Mean Machine.

Raytheon also told the Pentagon it had a really good idea for a knife that exploded into hundreds of tiny knives, a project Congress was eager to invest in.

Indeed, many of them were so brazen that they walked directly into the sea, where they floundered and suffered the same fate as so many before them.” The study also confirmed that major exploration of the Americas did not start, however, until humans created the technology to bind human corpses together into a raft and set sail for the New World."

That’s based on unanimous glowing reviews from several of our product testers in the instant before it stopped their hearts. If the cost alarms you, there’s also Herman Miller Fryer, our runner-up, which is of course the most classically iconic electric chair on the market. It offers all the speed and lethality of an injection cocktail as well as comfortable leather straps and timeless modernist touches. While you can’t go wrong with the top options, for those on a tight budget, there’s the Alcatraz 2.0, which is super stylish but unfortunately is unlikely to kill you.” Wirecutter staff also offered a disclaimer that if any prisons did purchase an electric chair through their site, they would earn a commission fee.

Plus, you’ll notice a resort fee of $50 per extra person in the room beyond two adults, and our daily parking rate for the 20 armored vehicles you left with our valets. And we did have to double the cleaning fee, seeing as you all left quite the mess of boxes and papers behind. If you’d like to dispute any of these charges, you’ll have to take them up with your personal financial institution, which in your case would be Congress.” Burns went on to explain that since she didn’t know how to charge the agency for the documents they removed from the property, that would show up on the bill as “stolen towels.”"

Especially when we have an ideal location for the factory right where the Watsons’ kitchen table now stands. Furthermore, enlarging the factory here will bring hundreds of new jobs to the Watsons’ home, among myriad other economic benefits. The site’s developers have assured me that any industrial runoff can go into the sink, and if there are any threats to air quality, one of the children can simply open a window to let it out.

Ron DeSantis, adding that he thought it was disgusting for the Justice Department to target a former president when it had totally ignored Dick Dastardly’s repeated schemes to destroy beloved American war hero Yankee Doodle Pigeon. “President Trump spent four years doing nothing but helping the American people, yet the FBI has never once obtained a search warrant to enter Dick Dastardly’s dreaded Mean Machine.

Raytheon also told the Pentagon it had a really good idea for a knife that exploded into hundreds of tiny knives, a project Congress was eager to invest in. Ultimately, although the trials for this project did not produce enough tangible results to move forward, Raytheon  submitted another idea for an artificially intelligent tire that rolls into terrorists, and that’s what your personal tax dollars are being used for in 2022.” The report added that the IRS was originally planning to give you a refund this year, but put the money toward the Raytheon CEO’s annual bonus instead."

Importantly, these cost savings should continue to increase as long as this country continues to put off removing lead from pipes, repairing dangerous playgrounds, and improving the education system. Ultimately, there is a strong correlation between just kind of letting whatever happens to our children happen and a more cost-effective overall financial picture, and we expect this dynamic to continue.” A related study from Texas A&M University found that not protecting foreign children also offered numerous economic benefits, pointing to the billions of dollars in profits American companies generated by bombing them."

These past few weeks, as we successfully occupied Moscow, St. Petersburg, and several key military bases, the writing was on the wall. After accepting Putin’s surrender, my message to the 150 million former citizens of Russia is this: Though you fought hard, we have unambiguously defeated you in battle, and we now invite you to move forward with us as Ukrainians. Those who do not comply will join members of the Russian military and other dissidents in Ukrainian labor camps.

That’s based on unanimous glowing reviews from several of our product testers in the instant before it stopped their hearts. If the cost alarms you, there’s also Herman Miller Fryer, our runner-up, which is of course the most classically iconic electric chair on the market. It offers all the speed and lethality of an injection cocktail as well as comfortable leather straps and timeless modernist touches. While you can’t go wrong with the top options, for those on a tight budget, there’s the Alcatraz 2.0, which is super stylish but unfortunately is unlikely to kill you.” Wirecutter staff also offered a disclaimer that if any prisons did purchase an electric chair through their site, they would earn a commission fee.

Especially when we have an ideal location for the factory right where the Watsons’ kitchen table now stands. Furthermore, enlarging the factory here will bring hundreds of new jobs to the Watsons’ home, among myriad other economic benefits. The site’s developers have assured me that any industrial runoff can go into the sink, and if there are any threats to air quality, one of the children can simply open a window to let it out.

Raytheon also told the Pentagon it had a really good idea for a knife that exploded into hundreds of tiny knives, a project Congress was eager to invest in. Ultimately, although the trials for this project did not produce enough tangible results to move forward, Raytheon  submitted another idea for an artificially intelligent tire that rolls into terrorists, and that’s what your personal tax dollars are being used for in 2022.” The report added that the IRS was originally planning to give you a refund this year, but put the money toward the Raytheon CEO’s annual bonus instead."

Mark Gordon. “Regime change will unquestionably help spread democracy to the freedom-loving people of Wyoming and further advance our ability to broker a lasting peace between North and South Dakota. In fact, I’m sure the streets of Cheyenne will erupt into joy at the city’s liberation. To the people of Wyoming, I say this: Your state is rich with resources and human talent. With the help of Rep.

Importantly, these cost savings should continue to increase as long as this country continues to put off removing lead from pipes, repairing dangerous playgrounds, and improving the education system. Ultimately, there is a strong correlation between just kind of letting whatever happens to our children happen and a more cost-effective overall financial picture, and we expect this dynamic to continue.” A related study from Texas A&M University found that not protecting foreign children also offered numerous economic benefits, pointing to the billions of dollars in profits American companies generated by bombing them."

But our counter-offensives this summer went better than even we expected, and after we seized Russia’s entire railway system in June, we began to see a complete takeover as a real possibility. These past few weeks, as we successfully occupied Moscow, St. Petersburg, and several key military bases, the writing was on the wall. After accepting Putin’s surrender, my message to the 150 million former citizens of Russia is this: Though you fought hard, we have unambiguously defeated you in battle, and we now invite you to move forward with us as Ukrainians. Those who do not comply will join members of the Russian military and other dissidents in Ukrainian labor camps. We believe, however, that you will unite with us, because Ukrainians and Russians have always been the same people.” With the Russian domino having fallen, Zelensky added that troops were already mobilizing to  conquer Georgia, Poland, and Kazakhstan and make them all part of a united Ukraine."

Indeed, many of them were so brazen that they walked directly into the sea, where they floundered and suffered the same fate as so many before them.” The study also confirmed that major exploration of the Americas did not start, however, until humans created the technology to bind human corpses together into a raft and set sail for the New World."

Especially when we have an ideal location for the factory right where the Watsons’ kitchen table now stands. Furthermore, enlarging the factory here will bring hundreds of new jobs to the Watsons’ home, among myriad other economic benefits. The site’s developers have assured me that any industrial runoff can go into the sink, and if there are any threats to air quality, one of the children can simply open a window to let it out. While we regret that the factory’s installation where the fridge used to be unintentionally created a food desert in the house, we need our residents to understand that we’re doing what is best holistically for the city.” At press time, city officials decided to knock the whole building down without any warning."

Raytheon also told the Pentagon it had a really good idea for a knife that exploded into hundreds of tiny knives, a project Congress was eager to invest in. Ultimately, although the trials for this project did not produce enough tangible results to move forward, Raytheon  submitted another idea for an artificially intelligent tire that rolls into terrorists, and that’s what your personal tax dollars are being used for in 2022.” The report added that the IRS was originally planning to give you a refund this year, but put the money toward the Raytheon CEO’s annual bonus instead."

Mark Gordon. “Regime change will unquestionably help spread democracy to the freedom-loving people of Wyoming and further advance our ability to broker a lasting peace between North and South Dakota. In fact, I’m sure the streets of Cheyenne will erupt into joy at the city’s liberation. To the people of Wyoming, I say this: Your state is rich with resources and human talent. With the help of Rep.

Importantly, these cost savings should continue to increase as long as this country continues to put off removing lead from pipes, repairing dangerous playgrounds, and improving the education system. Ultimately, there is a strong correlation between just kind of letting whatever happens to our children happen and a more cost-effective overall financial picture, and we expect this dynamic to continue.” A related study from Texas A&M University found that not protecting foreign children also offered numerous economic benefits, pointing to the billions of dollars in profits American companies generated by bombing them."

But our counter-offensives this summer went better than even we expected, and after we seized Russia’s entire railway system in June, we began to see a complete takeover as a real possibility. These past few weeks, as we successfully occupied Moscow, St. Petersburg, and several key military bases, the writing was on the wall. After accepting Putin’s surrender, my message to the 150 million former citizens of Russia is this: Though you fought hard, we have unambiguously defeated you in battle, and we now invite you to move forward with us as Ukrainians. Those who do not comply will join members of the Russian military and other dissidents in Ukrainian labor camps. We believe, however, that you will unite with us, because Ukrainians and Russians have always been the same people.” With the Russian domino having fallen, Zelensky added that troops were already mobilizing to  conquer Georgia, Poland, and Kazakhstan and make them all part of a united Ukraine."

Indeed, many of them were so brazen that they walked directly into the sea, where they floundered and suffered the same fate as so many before them.” The study also confirmed that major exploration of the Americas did not start, however, until humans created the technology to bind human corpses together into a raft and set sail for the New World."

That’s based on unanimous glowing reviews from several of our product testers in the instant before it stopped their hearts. If the cost alarms you, there’s also Herman Miller Fryer, our runner-up, which is of course the most classically iconic electric chair on the market. It offers all the speed and lethality of an injection cocktail as well as comfortable leather straps and timeless modernist touches. While you can’t go wrong with the top options, for those on a tight budget, there’s the Alcatraz 2.0, which is super stylish but unfortunately is unlikely to kill you.” Wirecutter staff also offered a disclaimer that if any prisons did purchase an electric chair through their site, they would earn a commission fee.

Essentially, we have to start from scratch.” At press time, Zuckerberg took several minutes to congratulate his engineers on their decision to eliminate the lower half of his avatar’s body, saying it fully captured how sexless he was in real life."

And why on earth did you do them all at once? If you don’t space them out a little, it’s pretty fucking obvious what you’re up to. Then again, maybe you amateurs don’t realize the goal is not to get media attention, considering you published all the details in a state-run newspaper! How stupid can you be?

Raytheon also told the Pentagon it had a really good idea for a knife that exploded into hundreds of tiny knives, a project Congress was eager to invest in. Ultimately, although the trials for this project did not produce enough tangible results to move forward, Raytheon  submitted another idea for an artificially intelligent tire that rolls into terrorists, and that’s what your personal tax dollars are being used for in 2022.” The report added that the IRS was originally planning to give you a refund this year, but put the money toward the Raytheon CEO’s annual bonus instead."

https://www.theonion.com/report-not-protecting-children-very-well-saved-u-s-5-1849349154,Report: Not Protecting Children Very Well Saved U.S. $5 Trillion Over Last Decade,"BALTIMORE—Amid concerns about economic stagnation and rising federal debt, an encouraging report released Monday by researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that not protecting children very well saved the United States around $5 trillion over the last decade. “Our data shows that refraining from investments in expensive projects that improve or even simply maintain the health, safety, and overall well-being of this nation’s youth saves both federal and local governments billions of dollars per year,” said study co-author Erick Rosen, attributing the savings in part to lax regulations on companies using harmful chemicals in common foods and household items, avoiding improvements that would make roadways safer, and neglecting pediatric care. “While placing America’s children in an environment rife with treatable diseases, gun violence, and poverty may have its downsides, there is no denying the financial savings it generates. Importantly, these cost savings should continue to increase as long as this country continues to put off removing lead from pipes, repairing dangerous playgrounds, and improving the education system. Ultimately, there is a strong correlation between just kind of letting whatever happens to our children happen and a more cost-effective overall financial picture, and we expect this dynamic to continue.” A related study from Texas A&M University found that not protecting foreign children also offered numerous economic benefits, pointing to the billions of dollars in profits American companies generated by bombing them."

In addition, if you have consumed corn in the past 24 hours, the detonation will cause your abdomen to forcefully explode as the partially digested kernels rupture your intestines.” At press time, the cackling executive was reportedly counting his money when he decided to go ahead and level the entire Midwest anyway."

Well, today, in tandem with the newly installed jump ramps and corkscrew turns, Americans can once again release an oil slick at their competitor and yell ‘yippee!’” At press time, Buttigieg had abruptly concluded the press conference after receiving a questions about the epidemic of traffic fatalities caused by American drivers crashing into explosive TNT crates."

But our counter-offensives this summer went better than even we expected, and after we seized Russia’s entire railway system in June, we began to see a complete takeover as a real possibility. These past few weeks, as we successfully occupied Moscow, St. Petersburg, and several key military bases, the writing was on the wall. After accepting Putin’s surrender, my message to the 150 million former citizens of Russia is this: Though you fought hard, we have unambiguously defeated you in battle, and we now invite you to move forward with us as Ukrainians. Those who do not comply will join members of the Russian military and other dissidents in Ukrainian labor camps. We believe, however, that you will unite with us, because Ukrainians and Russians have always been the same people.” With the Russian domino having fallen, Zelensky added that troops were already mobilizing to  conquer Georgia, Poland, and Kazakhstan and make them all part of a united Ukraine."

Indeed, many of them were so brazen that they walked directly into the sea, where they floundered and suffered the same fate as so many before them.” The study also confirmed that major exploration of the Americas did not start, however, until humans created the technology to bind human corpses together into a raft and set sail for the New World."

There were dozens of high-ranking family members in attendance who could have been apprehended by our military. Our security officers knew the wedding’s date. They knew what was on the registry. They even knew what was being served for dessert. And yet they sat idly by while these people danced the night away and gave well wishes to the happy couple. How can the American people ever trust them again?” At press time, the Pentagon had denied wrongdoing in the incident, stressing that their forces had been engaged at the time in bombing a kindergarten classroom."

That’s based on unanimous glowing reviews from several of our product testers in the instant before it stopped their hearts. If the cost alarms you, there’s also Herman Miller Fryer, our runner-up, which is of course the most classically iconic electric chair on the market. It offers all the speed and lethality of an injection cocktail as well as comfortable leather straps and timeless modernist touches. While you can’t go wrong with the top options, for those on a tight budget, there’s the Alcatraz 2.0, which is super stylish but unfortunately is unlikely to kill you.” Wirecutter staff also offered a disclaimer that if any prisons did purchase an electric chair through their site, they would earn a commission fee.

Plus, you’ll notice a resort fee of $50 per extra person in the room beyond two adults, and our daily parking rate for the 20 armored vehicles you left with our valets. And we did have to double the cleaning fee, seeing as you all left quite the mess of boxes and papers behind. If you’d like to dispute any of these charges, you’ll have to take them up with your personal financial institution, which in your case would be Congress.” Burns went on to explain that since she didn’t know how to charge the agency for the documents they removed from the property, that would show up on the bill as “stolen towels.”"

Especially when we have an ideal location for the factory right where the Watsons’ kitchen table now stands. Furthermore, enlarging the factory here will bring hundreds of new jobs to the Watsons’ home, among myriad other economic benefits. The site’s developers have assured me that any industrial runoff can go into the sink, and if there are any threats to air quality, one of the children can simply open a window to let it out.

https://www.theonion.com/report-not-protecting-children-very-well-saved-u-s-5-1849349154,Report: Not Protecting Children Very Well Saved U.S. $5 Trillion Over Last Decade,"BALTIMORE—Amid concerns about economic stagnation and rising federal debt, an encouraging report released Monday by researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that not protecting children very well saved the United States around $5 trillion over the last decade. “Our data shows that refraining from investments in expensive projects that improve or even simply maintain the health, safety, and overall well-being of this nation’s youth saves both federal and local governments billions of dollars per year,” said study co-author Erick Rosen, attributing the savings in part to lax regulations on companies using harmful chemicals in common foods and household items, avoiding improvements that would make roadways safer, and neglecting pediatric care. “While placing America’s children in an environment rife with treatable diseases, gun violence, and poverty may have its downsides, there is no denying the financial savings it generates. Importantly, these cost savings should continue to increase as long as this country continues to put off removing lead from pipes, repairing dangerous playgrounds, and improving the education system. Ultimately, there is a strong correlation between just kind of letting whatever happens to our children happen and a more cost-effective overall financial picture, and we expect this dynamic to continue.” A related study from Texas A&M University found that not protecting foreign children also offered numerous economic benefits, pointing to the billions of dollars in profits American companies generated by bombing them."

LOUIS—Warning that the corn found in kitchens, grocery stores, and restaurants across the country were ticking time bombs, Monsanto executive Jeff Dunbarton threatened to detonate every corncob in the nation Wednesday unless his demands were met. “Should you fail to deliver the $20 billion I require, I will be forced to set off every single ear of corn in America,” the company’s head of crop science said before blowing up an 800-acre Iowa cornfield as a demonstration, claiming that was just a small taste of what was to come if he did not receive the full amount by midnight. “We have genetically engineered all cobs to have the maximum blast radius, which would blow kernels through the skull of every man, woman, and child across the country. In addition, if you have consumed corn in the past 24 hours, the detonation will cause your abdomen to forcefully explode as the partially digested kernels rupture your intestines.” At press time, the cackling executive was reportedly counting his money when he decided to go ahead and level the entire Midwest anyway."

Well, today, in tandem with the newly installed jump ramps and corkscrew turns, Americans can once again release an oil slick at their competitor and yell ‘yippee!’” At press time, Buttigieg had abruptly concluded the press conference after receiving a questions about the epidemic of traffic fatalities caused by American drivers crashing into explosive TNT crates."
https://www.theonion.com/ukraine-completes-successful-takeover-of-russia-1849434577,Ukraine Completes Successful Takeover Of Russia,"MOSCOW—A bloody and costly months-long conflict between the two nations ended in an unconditional surrender early Friday morning after Ukraine completed its successful takeover of Russia. “While much of the world’s attention moved on, our people continued to fight, and today we have finally achieved our ultimate aim of annexing all of Russia into the nation of Ukraine,” said victorious Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky from the Kremlin, where he personally presided as deposed President Vladimir Putin and other top Russian officials were led away in chains. “At the beginning of this war, Russia overplayed her hand, and many around the world wrote us off. But our counter-offensives this summer went better than even we expected, and after we seized Russia’s entire railway system in June, we began to see a complete takeover as a real possibility. These past few weeks, as we successfully occupied Moscow, St. Petersburg, and several key military bases, the writing was on the wall. After accepting Putin’s surrender, my message to the 150 million former citizens of Russia is this: Though you fought hard, we have unambiguously defeated you in battle, and we now invite you to move forward with us as Ukrainians. Those who do not comply will join members of the Russian military and other dissidents in Ukrainian labor camps. We believe, however, that you will unite with us, because Ukrainians and Russians have always been the same people.” With the Russian domino having fallen, Zelensky added that troops were already mobilizing to  conquer Georgia, Poland, and Kazakhstan and make them all part of a united Ukraine."

Indeed, many of them were so brazen that they walked directly into the sea, where they floundered and suffered the same fate as so many before them.” The study also confirmed that major exploration of the Americas did not start, however, until humans created the technology to bind human corpses together into a raft and set sail for the New World."

There were dozens of high-ranking family members in attendance who could have been apprehended by our military. Our security officers knew the wedding’s date. They knew what was on the registry. They even knew what was being served for dessert. And yet they sat idly by while these people danced the night away and gave well wishes to the happy couple. How can the American people ever trust them again?” At press time, the Pentagon had denied wrongdoing in the incident, stressing that their forces had been engaged at the time in bombing a kindergarten classroom."

Every bus driver and train conductor will be wearing those reflective visor sunglasses and dressed in these badass steampunk trench coats. But it’s about more than just looks. There’ll be a lot of laser whirring noises all the time, and, every once in a while, just a low, vibrational rumble. We’re going to have all kinds of hologram advertisements on everything that will know information about you personally. It’ll be like Tokyo times a thousand.” Advising reporters that his job title and the name of his department had changed, Buttigieg added that he should henceforth be referred to as the Grand Admiral of the Department of Teleportation."

Paraphernalia like bookmarks, highlighters, and library cards will be immediately confiscated. And don’t think you can get away with hiding a paperback in your pocket, either. We will not hesitate to conduct a strip search.” At press time, all schools in the area had gone into lockdown after someone reportedly entered a junior high carrying a copy of The Giver. "

Alright, bud?  Sorry if that’s too much. Just a suggestion.” At press time, sources confirmed that a thousand year reign of femininity and estrogen had been inaugurated after Taylor was told that he also occasionally repeated the ideas of female coworkers as if they were his own."

That’s based on unanimous glowing reviews from several of our product testers in the instant before it stopped their hearts. If the cost alarms you, there’s also Herman Miller Fryer, our runner-up, which is of course the most classically iconic electric chair on the market. It offers all the speed and lethality of an injection cocktail as well as comfortable leather straps and timeless modernist touches. While you can’t go wrong with the top options, for those on a tight budget, there’s the Alcatraz 2.0, which is super stylish but unfortunately is unlikely to kill you.” Wirecutter staff also offered a disclaimer that if any prisons did purchase an electric chair through their site, they would earn a commission fee.

Plus, you’ll notice a resort fee of $50 per extra person in the room beyond two adults, and our daily parking rate for the 20 armored vehicles you left with our valets. And we did have to double the cleaning fee, seeing as you all left quite the mess of boxes and papers behind. If you’d like to dispute any of these charges, you’ll have to take them up with your personal financial institution, which in your case would be Congress.” Burns went on to explain that since she didn’t know how to charge the agency for the documents they removed from the property, that would show up on the bill as “stolen towels.”"

Especially when we have an ideal location for the factory right where the Watsons’ kitchen table now stands. Furthermore, enlarging the factory here will bring hundreds of new jobs to the Watsons’ home, among myriad other economic benefits. The site’s developers have assured me that any industrial runoff can go into the sink, and if there are any threats to air quality, one of the children can simply open a window to let it out. While we regret that the factory’s installation where the fridge used to be unintentionally created a food desert in the house, we need our residents to understand that we’re doing what is best holistically for the city.” At press time, city officials decided to knock the whole building down without any warning."

Ron DeSantis, adding that he thought it was disgusting for the Justice Department to target a former president when it had totally ignored Dick Dastardly’s repeated schemes to destroy beloved American war hero Yankee Doodle Pigeon. “President Trump spent four years doing nothing but helping the American people, yet the FBI has never once obtained a search warrant to enter Dick Dastardly’s dreaded Mean Machine. Plus, none of his associates like Zilly, Klunk, or any of the Vulture Squadron have even once been questioned.

Raytheon also told the Pentagon it had a really good idea for a knife that exploded into hundreds of tiny knives, a project Congress was eager to invest in. Ultimately, although the trials for this project did not produce enough tangible results to move forward, Raytheon  submitted another idea for an artificially intelligent tire that rolls into terrorists, and that’s what your personal tax dollars are being used for in 2022.” The report added that the IRS was originally planning to give you a refund this year, but put the money toward the Raytheon CEO’s annual bonus instead."
