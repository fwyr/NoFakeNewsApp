In his National Day Rally speech on Sunday (Aug 21), PM Lee Hsien Loong said this will send a clear signal to the world that Singapore is charging ahead. He also spoke about the new town that will be built in Paya Lebar after Paya Lebar Air Base is relocated to Changi in the 2030s. Here is what PM Lee said about the three developments. ""When completed in the mid-2030s, T5 will show the world what sort of place Singapore is."" PM Lee revealed some of the new features of Changi Airport's T5, after the design was reviewed during the pandemic. He showed a video of T5, which showed a brief preview of a journey in T5 - from touchdown at the terminal to taking the skytrain to collecting baggage. He said T5 will allow operations to be quickly scaled up and down amid a pandemic, and that passengers from different flights can be prevented from mixing. The Ministry of Transport said on Sunday that the terminal can be split into smaller sub-terminals when the need arises. There will also be spaces that can be converted into testing or quarantine zones in future pandemics. Passenger touchpoints will be contactless. The terminal will support the use of cleaner alternative fuels such as sustainable aviation fuel made from biofeed.

PM Lee said Tuas Port is already ""up and running"", with two berths currently open. In about 20 years, all container operations in Singapore's four other terminals - Tanjong Pagar, Keppel, Brani and Pasir Panjang - will be consolidated at Tuas, which will by then have a capacity of 65 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), doubling Singapore's current capacity. PM Lee said all container operations at Tanjong Pagar terminal have already moved to Tuas Port. With Tuas Port's contributions last year, Singapore handled a record high of 37.5 million TEUs of cargo. With the land reclamation in phase one of Tuas Port's development now completed, phase two, three and four of the $20 billion project will follow, he said. The Transport Ministry said on Sunday that another three berths at Tuas Port will open by year end, bringing the total number of berths in operation there to five.

PM Lee said an estimated 150,000 new homes - both public and private - can be built in the new town in Paya Lebar after the relocation of the military airbase in the 2030s. This is roughly the size of Punggol and Sengkang. The 3.8km runway can be repurposed to become the town's central spine - as a green connector or community space - and be turned into a distinctive and attractive heritage feature, he added. The town can also be aligned along the runway, which is orientated in the direction of prevailing winds for aircraft to take off and land without any crosswinds. This would make the town naturally breezy, so residents will not need much air-conditioning, he said. PM Lee said the airbase moving out could also lead to the redevelopment of neighbouring towns in Hougang, Marine Parade and Punggol, as building height restrictions around the area would be lifted. ""Paya Lebar is just one example of how we are reimagining and transforming Singapore,"" he said. ""We are doing this all across the island - Jurong Lake District, Greater Southern Waterfront and many other areas too.""

Here are eight highlights from his speech: Singaporeans will soon be able to take their masks off in most indoor settings, returning to almost pre-Covid-19 normalcy. PM Lee said that with the country's situation stabilising, the Government will reduce mask requirements further to prevent fatigue from setting in. Masks will be required only on public transport, where people are in prolonged close contact in a crowded space, and in healthcare settings such as clinics, hospitals, residential and nursing homes, where there are vulnerable persons, said PM Lee. He said schools in particular should not require students to wear masks in class. Children need to see the facial expressions of their teachers and of one another, as this is crucial for their learning and development. More details will come from the multi-ministry task force handling the pandemic. READ FULL STORY: Masks will soon be optional in Singapore, except on public transport and in clinics, hospitals Section 377A of the Penal Code, which criminalises sex between men, will be repealed, said PM Lee. Sentiments have shifted over the years as more Singaporeans accept that sex in private between consenting men should not be a criminal offence, he said. But most Singaporeans do not want the repeal to trigger a drastic shift in societal norms across the board, including how marriage is defined and what is taught to children in schools, he noted. In consultations held by the Government on this topic, the main worry among those with reservations is what they feel Section 377A stands for, and that repealing it may encourage more aggressive and divisive activism on all sides. Even as Singapore repeals Section 377A, it will uphold and safeguard the institution of marriage, said PM Lee. Only marriage between a man and a woman is recognised in Singapore, he said, adding that many national policies such as public housing and adoption rules rely on this definition. The Government does not intend to change these policies or the definition of marriage. He added that currently, the definition of marriage could be challenged in the courts, like Section 377A has been. If such a challenge succeeds, it could cause same-sex marriage to become recognised. Hence, to protect the definition of marriage from being challenged in the courts, the Government will amend the Constitution. This will help Singapore repeal Section 377A in a controlled, carefully considered way, said PM Lee. READ FULL STORY: Govt will repeal Section 377A, decriminalise sex between men The external environment has become very troubled, as United States-China relations - which set the tone for global affairs - are worsening, said PM Lee. Both powers are divided over many issues, from trade to the South China Sea to Taiwan. But they also need to work together on pressing global problems like climate change, pandemics and nuclear proliferation. Their tense relationship is making this almost impossible, which is bad news for the world, he said. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has violated the fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, which are particularly important to Singapore. The war has also created deep hostility between Russia and other states, and affected security in the Asia-Pacific by complicating already strained US-China relations, and between China and America's partners in Asia like Australia and Japan, said PM Lee. Pointing to how things have gone wrong in Europe, he asked: ""Can you be sure things cannot go wrong like that in our region too? So we must get real and we must get ourselves prepared psychologically."" To do so, Singapore must stand firm on fundamental principles of international law, take national service seriously and keep the Singapore Armed Forces and Home Team strong and credible, and stay as one united people, he said. READ FULL STORY: 'Better get real' and be prepared should things go wrong in the region, says PM Lee Cost of living is at the top of everyone's minds, acknowledged PM Lee. While most sectors are recovering from the pandemic, the war in Ukraine has clouded the country's outlook. Inflation was already becoming a problem pre-war and the war made things worse by pushing up energy prices worldwide and causing shortages and price spikes in grain globally. The Government is doing everything necessary to support Singaporeans, in particular the middle- and lower-income families, and will do more if the situation worsens, said PM Lee. But the basic reality is that international economic conditions have fundamentally changed. The era of globalisation is over. China's growth and exports are slowing and countries are relooking at their own supply chains to prioritise resilience and self-sufficiency. Singapore has little influence over the global inflation picture, said PM Lee. To become better off, the country has to press on with economic upgrading and restructuring, redouble transformation efforts and encourage workers to upskill. READ FULL STORY: Changes in global economic conditions have led to new era of rising costs, says PM Lee An estimated 150,000 new homes - public and private housing - will be built where the Paya Lebar Air Base is located, said PM Lee. This is roughly the number of homes in Punggol and Sengkang today. The relocation of the air base will start in the 2030s. The air base and its surrounding industrial areas will yield a space five times the size of Toa Payoh. The new town will have amenities and recreational areas as well as commercial and industrial developments to bring jobs closer to homes. Once the air base moves out, some building height restrictions around it in towns like Hougang, Marine Parade and Punggol can be lifted, said PM Lee. This means the town can be redeveloped to make better use of the space there. READ FULL STORY: 150,000 homes to be built in future town at Paya Lebar Air Base, says PM Lee After a two-year pause brought on by the pandemic, work on Terminal 5 at Changi Airport will restart, said PM Lee. The new terminal will serve about 50 million passengers a year, more than T1 and T3 put together. The design of the terminal will draw on lessons learnt from the pandemic and allow spaces to be converted for testing or the segregation of high-risk passengers. Autonomous vehicles could be deployed to support baggage and cargo transport. T5 will also be greener and more energy-efficient, said PM Lee. Next to it, the Government will develop the Changi East Urban District, a new business and lifestyle destination. The mega Tuas Port began operations last December, with two berths opened. Three more will start operations by December this year. When fully operational, the port will have 66 berths spanning 26km and be capable of handling the largest container ships. Because Singapore had planned ahead, its port was able to handle extra volumes during the pandemic while ports in other countries experienced closures, severe congestions and long delays, said PM Lee. Phase 1 of Tuas Port has just been completed, with three more phases to come before it is fully completed in about 20 years from now. It will be the world's largest fully automated port. Then, it will handle 65 million twenty-foot equivalent units - a cargo capacity measurement - which is almost double today's volumes, he added. READ FULL STORY: Singapore pushing ahead with Changi Airport's T5, Tuas Port and new town in Paya Lebar The ministries of manpower and trade and industry and economic agencies will soon be announcing new initiatives to attract and retain top talent from around the world, said PM Lee. Singapore has attracted the interest of many talented individuals and international companies, thanks to its trusted brand of quality, reliability and efficiency and its track record in tackling Covid-19. The country must seize the opportunity to secure its place in the post-Covid-19 world, he said. It needs to do more, especially in sectors with good potential, to get people to come here, said PM Lee. If Singapore can get the people it wants to come, it will help the country shine brightly as a hub of innovation, entrepreneurship and growth. It will also make Singapore's own talent want to stay here, to participate in building a dynamic and outstanding nation, he said. READ FULL STORY: Singapore to attract and retain top talent with new initiatives PM Lee said that to tackle the challenges facing Singapore, the country must get three fundamentals right: a united people, a high-quality leadership team and high trust between the people and their leaders. ""We may have the best laid schemes, but without these three fundamentals, they will come to nothing."" He singled out good leadership as non-negotiable. Pointing to countries with unstable governments and where policies never make it through political gridlock, he said: ""Often, it is not just the leaders who disappoint, but the whole system that has failed."" The result is the loss of faith not just in individual politicians or parties but in the whole political system and political class. He said Singapore's very survival depends on having the right leaders, and leadership succession is therefore of paramount importance. With the younger ministers having chosen Finance Minister Lawrence Wong to be their leader, PM Lee said that he was happy that his succession plans, which had been put on hold when Covid-19 hit, are back on track. ""I am also glad that from everything I see, Singaporeans are supportive of Lawrence and his leadership of the team.""

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/ndr-2022-singapore-to-attract-and-retain-top-talent-with-new-initiatives,Singapore to attract and retain top talent with new initiatives,"SINGAPORE - New initiatives to attract and retain top talent will be rolled out to secure Singapore's success in a post-Covid-19 world, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in his National Day Rally speech on Sunday (Aug 21). ""We want to make top talent everywhere sit up, pay attention, and think seriously about coming to Singapore,"" he said, adding that the Ministry of Manpower, Ministry of Trade and Industry and economic agencies will soon announce new measures to achieve this. While Singapore already has schemes in place to draw top talent, such as in the technology industry, it still needs to do more, especially in sectors with good potential, PM Lee said. Singapore must build a world-class talent pool because this is an age where talent makes all the difference to a nation's success, he said. Singapore does its utmost to develop its own talent and help every citizen reach their fullest potential, he added, ""but when it comes to top talent, we can never have enough"". Hence, ""we need to focus on attracting and retaining top talent, in the same way we focus on attracting and retaining investments"", PM Lee said. Other countries are also making a special effort to court top international talent, such as Germany, as well as Britain, which recently introduced a special visa for graduates from top universities globally. ""In this global contest for talent, Singapore cannot afford to be creamed off or left behind,"" he said. In fact, Singapore has a window of opportunity to draw the best talent now, with its track record of tackling Covid-19 helping it to stand out even more. ""Our trusted Singapore brand of quality, reliability and efficiency... gives us a competitive edge,"" PM Lee said. ""Those with special talents and skills are looking for places to move to, where they and their families feel safe and welcome, and where they can make an impact,"" he noted. Meanwhile, ""businesses want to invest in places where the talent is... where the politics and policies are stable, and where the system works"", he said. Singapore has been successful in attracting the interest of talented people and international firms. ""That is why even during the pandemic, the Economic Development Board continued to bring in many good projects, and even now, we have a very strong investment pipeline of potential projects which we have a good chance of getting,"" PM Lee said. He acknowledged the concerns of Singaporeans about the impact of large numbers of non-residents living and working here. The Government is following up to tackle the problems and ease these concerns. ""But while we manage the overall population of foreign professionals here, we must not stop seeking out top talent who can contribute to our Singapore Story,"" PM Lee said. For example, the biomedical sciences grew in Singapore because top names in the field - the ""whales"" - were attracted to move here. They then nurtured local talents - ""the guppies"" - who were new to the field at the time, but now have grown into ""whales"". One key figure who played a role in persuading top biomedical science talent to move here is Mr Philip Yeo, who was chairman of the National Science and Technology Board (NSTB) in the 1990s. The NSTB then became the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star). Today, Singapore's biomedical sector employs 25,000 workers and contributes almost a fifth of Singapore's manufacturing gross domestic product, PM Lee said. Home-grown scientists are also now doing cutting-edge research and development, with some who have become principal researchers and others who have founded start-ups. During the pandemic, researchers here made significant contributions like helping to secure vaccines early and developing test kits. Singapore has also attracted major projects, including from Sanofi and BioNTech, which are the leading firms for vaccine-manufacturing facilities. In fact, PM Lee said he was told that BioNTech was investing in Singapore when he met former chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel before she retired last year. ""They take note. It is significant. It means something to them. It means a lot to us,"" he said. He added: ""Had we not sought out top talent 30 years ago, then continued to build up our biomedical research teams and activities, and develop home-grown talent, all this would never have happened. ""This is the difference that top talent can make."" It is also why Singapore must seize the opportunities now. ""If we can get the people we want to come here, it will really help Singapore to shine brightly as a hub of innovation, entrepreneurship and growth,"" he said. ""It will also make our own talent want to stay in Singapore, to participate in building a dynamic and outstanding nation, and every Singaporean will benefit from our progress and success."" An MOM spokesman said the ministry will be making an announcement soon on the policy changes to enhance and clarify the work pass framework to better support Singapore’s need for talent.

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong gave details of the area's redevelopment in his National Day Rally speech on Sunday (Aug 21). The military airbase's move to Changi will also have an impact on neighbouring towns like Hougang, Marine Parade and Punggol, as building height restrictions in those areas can be lifted, said PM Lee. This means that the towns can make better use of their space and be redeveloped to have more amenities. ""It will not happen overnight. But over decades, we can completely reimagine the eastern part of Singapore."" He also gave the assurance that Singapore would not run out of space in the future, and that housing would be available and affordable, adding that the Government has done its studies and planning. ""Our problem is not finding the space to build enough flats, nor keeping the flats affordable for Singaporeans. It is having enough babies to grow up and live in them,"" said PM Lee, who was speaking at the Institute of Technical Education headquarters in Ang Mo Kio. About 800ha of land in Paya Lebar will be freed up for housing and industries with the airbase's relocation, which was announced by PM Lee at the 2013 National Day Rally. In June this year, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) said the site would comprise housing and recreational facilities, provide space for businesses, which would offer employment opportunities, and tap the area's aviation history. The URA is currently engaging the public and industry partners to explore redevelopment concepts for the site. One idea features the airbase's 3.8km-long runway, which is aligned along the direction of prevailing winds so aircraft can avoid crosswinds when taking off and landing, said PM Lee. The future town could be oriented parallel to the runway so it can be naturally breezy. ""Hopefully, residents will not need air-conditioning quite as much,"" he said. The runway could also be repurposed to become the town's central spine, and turned into a green connector or community space extending from one end of the town to the other, he added. Public and private housing could be built on both sides of the spine, and it would be a distinctive and attractive heritage feature unique to Paya Lebar, said PM Lee. Paya Lebar is just one example of how the Government is reimagining and transforming Singapore, he said, citing other examples across the island like the Greater Southern Waterfront, which extends from Pasir Panjang to Marina East, and the Jurong Lake District. Each new estate would be more liveable, greener, and more sustainable than the previous one, and that is not easy to achieve, PM Lee said. ""But just as past generations planned for and created the Singapore that we live in today, we too must never stop imagining and building the future Singapore for the next generation and beyond,"" he said.

In his National Day Rally speech on Sunday (Aug 21), PM Lee said good leadership is non-negotiable if the Republic is to deal with the geopolitical dangers and economic uncertainties ahead, and build for the long term. ""Look at countries where governments are unstable and politics messy, swinging wildly from one election to another. ""Whenever things do not work, leaders are forced out, or they resign en masse. But even after changing teams, things fail to improve,"" he said. In these countries, policies and laws are either stuck in political gridlock or they are made by one government only to be reversed by the next, PM Lee added. ""Often, it is not just the leaders who disappoint, but the whole system that has failed. And the result is a devastating loss of faith - not just in individual politicians or parties, but the whole political system and the whole political class. And there is no way forward from there."" PM Lee said for a country like Singapore, there is zero margin for such errors. This is why the Republic needs leaders with integrity, dedication and competence; leaders with the conviction to make the tough calls and do the right thing even if it may cost them some votes; and leaders whom people can trust. ""We cannot afford any compromise on this,"" said PM Lee. He added that for the 57 years since independence, Singapore has had leaders who have earned the people's trust, delivered on sound policies and improved lives here. Urging Singaporeans not to take this for granted, PM Lee said the country needs to keep working hard to find the right people to serve the nation, and to help these people do their best for Singapore. ""It is our duty to extend our success formula into the next generation and beyond."" It was in this light that the Prime Minister said he was happy that the issue of his succession is settled, and his leadership transition plans are moving forward again. He did not elaborate on the timeline of his succession, but urged Singaporeans to lend their full support to DPM Wong, who is also Finance Minister, and the People's Action Party's (PAP) fourth generation of political leaders. ""From everything I see, Singaporeans are supportive of Lawrence and his leadership of the team,"" he added. PM Lee had previously said he hopes to step down by the time he turns 70, a milestone he reached in February this year. But after Covid-19 struck in 2020, he said he would see the Republic through the crisis and ""hand over Singapore, intact and in working order, into good hands"". He led the PAP to victory in the 2020 General Election with 61.2 per cent of the votes. But the party's leadership transition hit a snag when Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, 61, bowed out as PM Lee's successor in April last year, citing his age and the need for the next prime minister to have a longer runway. It took a year before Mr Wong, 49, was endorsed by his peers as the leader of the PAP's fourth-generation team, paving the way for him to eventually succeed PM Lee. In June, Mr Wong was promoted to Deputy Prime Minister, further cementing his position as Singapore's next prime minister. In an interview with Bloomberg earlier this month, Mr Wong sketched out two possible scenarios for when the leadership transition could take place. In the first, he could take over as prime minister before the next general election, which must be held by November 2025. In the second scenario, PM Lee could continue to lead the party in the election and then relinquish the position to him if the PAP wins. ""These are the options, but we have still yet to make a decision on the actual timing,"" Mr Wong had said in the interview. On Sunday, PM Lee highlighted two other factors besides high quality leadership that are fundamental to Singapore's success - a united people and high trust between the people and their leaders. ""These are vital if we are to respond creatively and resiliently to challenges, year after year. We may have the best laid schemes, but without these three fundamentals, they will come to nothing,"" he said. Concluding his speech, PM Lee said the next few decades will be bracing but exhilarating for Singapore. ""With your trust, we can come through whatever difficulties await. ""With your support, we can turn hopes and dreams into reality. ""And united as one people, we can secure a brighter future in this uncertain world, not just for now, not just for ourselves, but for every Singaporean child, for many generations to come."""

Passenger touchpoints will also be contactless, and there will be ventilation systems that can be activated to increase fresh air or minimise the mixing of air when there is a threat of airborne disease, said the Ministry of Transport (MOT) on Sunday (Aug 21). Drawing from the lessons of the Covid-19 pandemic, the features will make the airport more resilient and able to handle future pandemics more nimbly, MOT said. The construction of T5, which was halted because of the pandemic, will start in about two years. Details of the design were unveiled in tandem with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's National Day Rally on Sunday (Aug 21). In his speech, which gave updates on T5, PM Lee said the new terminal will be able to scale operations up and down more easily, and isolate passengers from different flights to limit cross-infection when future pandemics hit. It will also be greener and more energy efficient. With borders reopening and people travelling again, the future of aviation remains bright, PM Lee added. ""When completed in the mid-2030s, T5 will show the world what sort of place Singapore is,"" he said. ""Our decisions to press on with Changi T5 and Tuas Port send a strong and clear signal to the world that Singapore is emerging stronger from the pandemic and charging full steam ahead."" PM Lee first spoke about Singapore's plans for a fifth terminal 10 years ago - in 2013 - and planning for it began a year later. A mega terminal that should serve 50 million passengers a year, T5 is bigger than T1 and T3 put together, and is expected to open in the mid-2030s to meet a doubling of travel volume in the region then. In its statement, MOT said T5 is designed with the flexibility to be built in two phases, in line with traffic growth. On Sunday, MOT said the terminal will be ready for viable alternative fuels, including greener sustainable aviation fuel made from used feedstock which the industry believes must be widely used by aircraft for air travel to meet its emissions target of net zero by 2050. T5 is located within the 1,080ha Changi East development, which is Changi Airport's largest expansion project to date and also includes the Changi East Urban District, a business and lifestyle destination next to the terminal. MOT said the development of this will be done in consultation with the Ministry of National Development, Urban Redevelopment Authority and other agencies when the time comes. PM Lee added: ""Passenger traffic has already exceeded half of pre-Covid-19 levels. In the longer term, air travel will keep growing because of a fast-expanding middle class in our region.

Taking pride in being Singaporeans and having a stronger sense of national identity was among three ""enduring imperatives"" that PM Lee highlighted in his National Day Rally speech on Sunday (Aug 21). ""Singaporeans are being exposed to all sorts of persuasion and propaganda, misinformation and agitation, not least on social media and messaging apps, more so in a world riven by rivalries and tensions, with countries coming under pressure to support one side or the other,"" noted PM Lee, echoing what he said in his Mandarin speech. ""We need a strong sense of national identity to hold us together and give meaning to our nation building."" He hopes this will be one of the outcomes of the ongoing Forward Singapore exercise. Launched by Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on June 28, the nationwide exercise will engage citizens on shaping and strengthening Singapore's social compact for its next phase. Spanning a year, it will conclude with the publication of a report in mid-2023 which will set out policy recommendations and highlight how different segments of society can contribute towards these shared goals. While it will be led by DPM Wong , the exercise will have six pillars headed by his fellow fourth-generation leaders in areas such as jobs, housing and health. Building a world-class talent pool in Singapore was also highlighted by PM Lee. ""We need to focus on attracting and retaining top talent, in the same way we focus on attracting and retaining investments,"" he said. He also said Singapore needs to remain open and connected to the world despite waning globalisation and countries turning inwards and protectionist in their policies. ""It is impossible for us to grow or make everything we need ourselves, nor can we consume everything we produce, whether computer chips or pharmaceuticals or petrochemicals,"" he said. ""To make a living, we will always require foreign investments, overseas markets, and excellent transport and communications links with all parts of the world."" He added that while international tensions and uncertainties make remaining open and connected harder, countries will still need to conduct business with each other; multinational corporations will still look for places to sink their investments; and hubs for finance, communication and transport will still be needed by the world. ""If we are nimble and enterprising, we will get our share of these and more,"" he said. READ NEXT - 8 highlights from NDR 2022: Masks optional in most indoor settings, Section 377A to be repealed"

But to guard against the move triggering a drastic shift in societal norms, the Government will also amend the Constitution to protect the definition of marriage as one between a man and a woman to stave off future legal challenges, he added. Explaining the rationale for repeal, he noted that there is a significant risk of the law being struck down by judges in future legal challenges, and it would be unwise to ignore this and do nothing. Societal attitudes towards gay people have also ""shifted appreciably"" and it is timely to consider again whether sex between men in private should be a criminal offence, he added. ""We need to find the right way to reconcile and accommodate both the traditional mores of our society, and the aspiration of gay Singaporeans to be respected and accepted,"" he said.

His announcement at the National Day Rally comes months after the Court of Appeal ruled in February this year that Section 377A of the Penal Code was unenforceable in its entirety. Following the judgment, Cabinet ministers held extensive consultations with religious leaders, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) groups as well as regular Singaporeans on the best way to deal with the law. The court, led by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, ruled that Section 377A would remain on the books, but cannot be used to criminalise gay sex - going further than the Government's earlier promises that the law would not be proactively enforced on consensual sex between men. On Sunday, PM Lee said following this judgement, Minister for Home Affairs and Law K. Shanmugam and Attorney-General Lucien Wong have advised the Government that in a future court challenge, there is a significant risk of the law being struck down on the grounds that it breaches Article 12 of the Constitution - the Equal Protection provision. When the House debated amendments to the Penal Code in 2007, then Nominated MP Siew Kum Hong had filed a citizen's petition to repeal Section 377A, sparking a passionate debate on the topic with fierce arguments from both sides. PM Lee had argued then that it was better to accept the legal untidiness and ambiguity of keeping the law on the books, while not proactively enforcing it to ""maintain a balance, to uphold a stable society with traditional heterosexual family values, but with space for homosexuals to live their lives and to contribute to the society"". It would have been too divisive to force the issue then, he said on Sunday. PM Lee noted that Section 377A was originally introduced in the 1930s by the British colonial government, and reflects moral attitudes and social norms that prevailed back then. He said over time, homosexuality has become better understood scientifically and medically, resulting in greater acceptance of gay people for who they are instead of being shunned and stigmatised. This has been so in Singapore and many other societies, he added. Many countries with similar laws have since repealed them including several Asian countries, he added. ""It is timely to ask ourselves again the fundamental question: should sex between men in private be a criminal offence?"" he said, noting that it is a sensitive issue that needs to be resolved. ""Like every human society, we also have gay people in our midst. They are our fellow Singaporeans. They are our colleagues, our friends, our family members. They too want to live their own lives, participate in our community, and contribute fully to Singapore,"" he added. He acknowledged that Singaporeans still have differing views on whether homosexuality is right or wrong, but said most people accept that a person's sexual orientation and behaviour is a private and personal matter, and that sex between men should not be a criminal offence. Even among those who want to retain Section 377A, most do not want to see it being actively enforced, he said. From the national point of view, private sexual behaviour between consenting adults also does not raise any law-and-order issue, he added. ""There is no justification to prosecute people for it, nor to make it a crime,"" he said. The months-long government review on what to do with the law had attracted pushback from religious groups and conservative Singaporeans, who have raised concerns that it could pave the way for LGBT activists to push for marriage equality. Acknowledging these concerns, PM Lee said it had come through clearly over several months of engagement on the issue that while some feel strongly about keeping Section 377A itself, many of those who had reservations about the law being abolished worry about what repeal could lead to. They want to preserve the status quo on how marriage is defined, what children are taught in schools, what is shown on television and in cinemas, and even what is generally acceptable in public, said PM Lee, adding that the Government too, does not want the repeal to trigger wholesale changes in society. Therefore, it will also move to amend the Constitution in tandem to protect the definition of marriage from being challenged constitutionally in the courts, he said. ""This will help us to repeal S377A in a controlled and carefully considered way. It will limit this change to what I believe most Singaporeans will accept, which is to decriminalise sexual relations between consenting men in private,"" he said. ""But it will also keep what I believe most Singaporeans still want, and that is to retain the basic family structure of marriage between a man and a woman, within which we have and raise our children,"" he added to applause from the audience at the Institute of Technical Education Headquarters at Ang Mo Kio. Marriage is defined as a union between a man and a woman in the Interpretation Act and the Women's Charter, and many national policies rely upon this definition, including public housing, education, adoption rules, advertising standards, film classification, he added. PM Lee said the Government has no intention of changing the definition of marriage or these policies. However, as the law stands, marriage as it is now defined can be challenged on constitutional grounds in the courts, just like Section 377A has been challenged, he noted. For same-sex marriages to become recognised here like that would not be ideal, as Parliament may not be able to restore the status quo ante even if the majority of MPs opposed the changes, since changing the Constitution would require a two-thirds majority, he added. Ultimately, judges are trained and appointed to interpret and apply the law, and have neither the expertise nor the mandate to rule on social norms and values, he said. ""These are fundamentally not legal problems, but political issues,"" he added. PM Lee noted this has been wisely acknowledged by the courts in their judgements dealing with such cases. If those seeking change try to force the pace through litigation, which is by nature adversarial, it would highlight differences, inflame tensions and polarise society, he added. He called on all sides to avoid aggressive and divisive activism noting that if one side pushes too hard the other side will push back even harder. In some Western societies, this has resulted in culture wars, contempt for opposing views, cancel culture, and bitter feuds splitting society into warring tribes, and Singapore should not go in this direction, he cautioned, noting there are already some signs of such developments here. He urged all groups to exercise restraint and work hard to keep society harmonious so Singapore move forward together. ""What we seek is a political accommodation that balances different legitimate views and aspirations among Singaporeans,"" he added. ""For some, this will be too modest a step. For others, it will be a step taken only with great reluctance, even regret. But in a society where diverse groups have strongly held opposing views, everyone has to accept that no group can have things all their way."" ""I hope the new balance will enable Singapore to remain a tolerant and inclusive society for many years to come.""

But it is also within Singapore's power to become more productive and competitive so that workers can earn more, and more than make up for the higher prices of food, fuel and other imports. ""That way, we can all become better off, in real terms,"" said PM Lee at the Institute of Technical Education headquarters in Ang Mo Kio, where the NDR was held. In his speech, PM Lee touched on the economic challenges Singapore faces in the current global environment, including the disruption of imported supplies such as food into the Republic. Aside from the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, new realities such as rising protectionism between trade partners, China's slowing growth and exports, countries relooking their supply chains, and companies changing their production strategies have contributed to higher inflation everywhere. For Singapore and its people to be better off in real terms, efforts must be made on several fronts, PM Lee said. ""This requires us to press on with economic upgrading and restructuring, redouble our transformation efforts, and encourage workers to upgrade their skills at every opportunity. And indeed, that is exactly what we have been doing,"" he added. Besides prices rising, the flow of physical supplies into Singapore has also been disrupted in recent times, PM Lee said, citing Malaysia's export ban on chickens, Indonesia's palm oil export halt and India's ban on wheat exports. ""Under pressure, faced with food shortages and rising prices, governments will put their domestic needs first, and so we must expect more arbitrary actions like these, which will impact us,"" he warned. This is because Singapore, being a small and open economy, is heavily dependent on imports, including that of essential goods. Yet, the Republic is not helpless, PM Lee said, highlighting how it has been actively diversifying its import sources. This has been through means such as building up adequate stockpiles of food and medical essentials, investing in agri-tech to make local farms more efficient and productive, and pushing ahead with efforts to produce about a third of the country's nutritional needs locally by 2030. PM Lee noted that it costs money to make Singapore's supplies more resilient. ""Buying from diversified sources means that we don't just buy from the cheapest or the most convenient producer, and maintaining stockpiles requires space and incurs costs... But we must think of it as paying for insurance,"" he said. PM Lee cited the period when live chickens stopped arriving from Malaysia following an export ban in June as an example of how Singapore's efforts to make its food supplies more resilient has paid off. ""We didn't flap. We could draw on our ample stocks of frozen chicken from Brazil, the (United States), and other places. And we soon brought in more chilled chicken from Australia, New Zealand and Thailand, and now Indonesia."" As a result, ""the chicken rice stalls are back in business again"", he added. People take Singapore's resilience for granted, but a lot of work goes behind the scenes to ensure that it is prepared when issues arise, PM Lee said. ""Nothing happens by itself, not even in Singapore. It is only possible because we always plan forward, to give ourselves options and solutions during crises, and that's how we must continue to prepare ourselves for the future."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/ndr-2022-better-get-real-and-be-prepared-should-things-go-wrong-in-the-region-says-pm-lee,"'Better get real' and be prepared should things go wrong in the region, says PM Lee","SINGAPORE - Singapore's neighbourhood has enjoyed peace for so long it is hard to imagine things being different. But anyone who thinks that war cannot break out in the region needs to get real, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Touching on the state of global security in his English National Day Rally speech, PM Lee on Sunday (Aug 21) called on Singaporeans to be mentally ready for disruptions to the region's stability. Singapore's external environment has become very troubled amid worsening United States-China ties and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, said PM Lee. Speaking at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) Headquarters at Ang Mo Kio, PM Lee said that the relationship between the US and China, which sets the tone for global affairs, is worsening. The two powers are divided over many issues, he warned. This includes their rival ideologies and systems of government, China's growing influence in the world, as well as many specific problems, including trade disputes, cyber espionage, the South China Sea and Hong Kong. Most recently and worryingly, there have been sharply escalating tensions over Taiwan, added PM Lee. Yet the two superpowers need to work together on many pressing global issues, including climate change, pandemics, and nuclear proliferation, said PM Lee. ""Their tense relationship is making this almost impossible,"" he said. ""And this is bad news for the world."" US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping recently held a video call and made plans to meet in November, their first in-person meeting since Mr Biden took office last January. But neither side expects relations to improve any time soon, said PM Lee. ""Furthermore, we must all hope that there are no miscalculations or mishaps, which can make things much worse very quickly,"" he added. Russia's invasion of Ukraine also has profound implications for the world and for Singapore, said PM Lee. The invasion violates the United Nations (UN) Charter and fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, which are particularly important to Singapore given that its existence and security relies on countries upholding these principles, he said. This is why Singapore cannot legitimise Russia's wrongful actions, he added. In March, Singapore strongly condemned Russia's actions, and imposed sanctions on focusing on the exports of military and technological goods, as well as financial measures. ""Russia claims that what it calls a 'special military operation' in Ukraine is justified by 'historical errors and crazy decisions'. If we accept this logic, what happens if one day others use this same argument against us?"" asked PM Lee. The war has also created deep hostility between Russia and other states, especially the US and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato), a military alliance of 30 countries in Europe and North America. With nuclear powers on both sides and relations having completely broken down, it is hard to imagine any satisfactory end to the conflict, said PM Lee. The war in Ukraine also affects security in the Asia-Pacific as it has complicated already-strained US-China relations, as well as relations between China and America's partners in Asia, like Australia and Japan. Singaporeans should expect more geopolitical contestation in the Asia-Pacific, said PM Lee. ""Our region has enjoyed peace for so long that it is hard for us to imagine things being different. But look at how things have gone wrong in Europe, how suddenly and quickly,"" said PM Lee. ""Can you be sure that things cannot go wrong in our region too? Better get real, and we must get ourselves prepared psychologically."" On how Singapore can respond to these external dangers, PM Lee said that it must stand firm on fundamental principles of international law and work with other countries to uphold a rules-based order. This can be done by speaking up at the UN. Conversely, taking cover and keeping quiet will hurt Singapore in the long-term, he said. There is also a need to take national service seriously, and keep the Singapore Armed Forces and Home Team strong and credible. ""If we do not defend ourselves, no one is going to defend us on our behalf,"" stressed PM Lee. But the bottomline is that Singaporeans must stay together as one united people and never allow themselves to be divided, whether by race, religion, income, social differences or place of birth, he said. This is especially pertinent in the face of foreign actors looking to exploit Singapore's vulnerabilities and influence its people for their own interests. ""If we are taken in and we are divided, we will stand no chance. But united, we can deal with any problems that come our way,"" he said. PM Lee had similarly highlighted the importance of Singapore’s resilience and unity in the face of an increasingly uncertain and complex world in his earlier Malay and Chinese speeches.  A united Singapore, a high-quality leadership and high trust between people and their leaders are essential for the nation to respond creatively and resiliently to challenges it faces, year after year, he said. “We may have the best laid schemes, but without these three fundamentals, they will come to nothing.” READ NEXT - 8 highlights from NDR 2022: Masks optional in most indoor settings, Section 377A to be repealed"
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/ndr-2022-new-special-state-award-to-be-given-to-those-who-helped-directly-fight-covid-19,New special state award to be given to those who helped directly fight Covid-19,"SINGAPORE - A special state award, called the Covid-19 Resilience Medal, will be given to those who have helped to directly fight Covid-19 during the pandemic in recognition of their sacrifices and public spirit. This new award from the Government will recognise both individuals and teams, PM Lee said on Sunday (Aug 21) in his National Day Rally speech. In addition, those who made exceptional contributions will receive existing state awards such as the Commendation Medal, the Public Service Medal and the Public Administration Medal. There will be a special indication with the name and the insignia to show that the medal was presented for service fighting Covid-19, said PM Lee, who jokingly suggested having two red lines on the ribbon representing the lines in antigen rapid test results. The recipients will be announced at the end of the year, and the award ceremonies will be held next year. In his speech, PM Lee also mentioned some people who had gone the extra mile to help others. One of them is retiree Alice Chua, who is in her early 60s, who volunteered at vaccination centres in East Coast, and took fellow seniors to their appointments. ""Because she spoke Malay, and Chinese dialects, she also bridged language gaps, and could reassure and comfort the seniors during their jabs. Every bit counted in our national vaccination campaign,"" said PM Lee. Another individual he singled out is Madam Ruku Pakirisamy, 72, a Yishun resident. ""She noticed many elderly neighbours were afraid to go out during the pandemic, so they were getting listless and moody. To lift their spirits, she cooked and distributed meals for her neighbours. Sometimes curry, sometimes beehoon. A simple pack of hot meal brought many warm smiles,"" added the Prime Minister. PM Lee also noted Toa Payoh resident Razali Puasa's kind act. ""The playground near his block is very popular with young kids. But he saw that everyone was afraid of Covid-19. So he decided to wipe down and disinfect the playground. To reassure families that it was clean and safe to let their kids play there. A simple gesture, which made all the difference to the community,"" he said. In his Malay speech, PM Lee also gave credit to the many Malay/Muslims at the front and centre in Singapore's Covid-19 fight. One individual he cited is Dr Norhisham Main from Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, who is the president of the Muslim Healthcare Professionals Association. Despite his heavy load of patients, both Covid-19 and non Covid-19, Dr Norhisham was regularly on the ground outside of work to explain the Covid-19 situation to the Malay/Muslim community. He helped to dispel their fears and concerns about the virus and garnered their support for Singapore's safe management measures, PM Lee said. ""These personal acts of kindness, courage and concern, the Singapore spirit shone brightly. It has made us collectively a better people and a more resilient society."" In Singapore's national response, many also went above and beyond their call of duty. For example, healthcare workers, through their care and professionalism ensured that the rest of Singapore could carry on safely with their daily lives; public officers, especially those on the front lines, carried out many demanding operations, often at short notice; private companies generously provided resources and industry know-how to tackle many problems; non-governmental organisations and community groups made special efforts to take care of those who needed more help. PM Lee also noted that Singapore has managed to successfully spread out the impact of the pandemic and prevented the hospitals from being overwhelmed. Thus far, the Republic has had fewer than 1,600 Covid-19-related deaths, he added. READ NEXT - 8 highlights from NDR 2022: Masks optional in most indoor settings, Section 377A to be repealed"
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/masks-will-soon-be-optional-except-on-public-transport-and-in-clinics-hospitals,"Masks will soon be optional in S'pore, except on public transport and in clinics, hospitals","SINGAPORE - Masks will soon be required only on public transport and in healthcare settings such as hospitals, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Sunday (Aug 21). In his National Day Rally speech, PM Lee said the Covid-19 situation in Singapore has stabilised, and that relaxing mask requirements would help prevent fatigue from setting in. ""But don't take off your masks this very moment,"" he said, as details will be announced by Singapore's multi-ministry Covid-19 task force. Currently, while masks are optional in outdoor settings, they are mandatory indoors, in places such as shopping malls. With the reduced requirements, they will be optional in most indoor settings. But they will still be required on public transport, where people are in prolonged close contact in a crowded space; and in healthcare settings such as clinics, hospitals, and residential and nursing homes, where there are vulnerable persons, PM Lee said. For schools in particular, masks should not be needed in class, he said. He acknowledged that parents may be worried, but assured them that the Government has assessed that relaxing mask requirements in schools would be safe.  “Children do need to be able to see the facial expressions of their teachers and of each other,” said PM Lee. “You have to learn to read faces... if (a person) is angry or happy... otherwise, you grow up with a blank space in your brain,” he said. “It’s crucial for learning and development.”  Experts in Singapore had suggested recently that there was no need to continue enforcing mandatory mask-wearing indoors, since over 90 per cent of the population has been vaccinated and over half the population has been infected with the virus. In his speech on Sunday, PM Lee said people have worked with one another, trusted the Government and patiently endured rounds of easing and tightening of safe management measures. Unlike other countries that have seen sharp spikes and declines in the number of Covid-19 cases, the Republic's Covid-19 waves grow and tail off more gradually, he said. ""In many other countries, when a wave happens, cases shoot up furiously and then crash down suddenly, like a roller coaster. ""And when cases shoot up hospitals come under a lot of pressure."" In Singapore, where the latest Omicron BA.5 wave is subsiding, waves grow and tail off more gradually, he pointed out. ""This suggests we have been effective in slowing down disease transmission."" This has helped the country spread out the impact and prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed, he added. Singapore has recorded fewer than 1,600 Covid-19-related deaths so far. Every death is one too many, but the death toll could have been higher if the Republic had suffered mortality rates similar to other countries. ""We could easily have suffered 10,000 Covid-19 deaths, or more,"" he said. ""Our collective efforts have saved many lives."" The high level of trust has been key to the country's success in tackling Covid-19, he added. In some countries, a precaution as simple and essential as wearing a mask had become a heated point of contention. ""But in Singapore, people worked with and not against one another."" ""You trusted your Government. You patiently endured rounds of easing and tightening despite the inconvenience,"" he said. ""The Government upheld your trust by being open and transparent. We spoke directly to you, shared information readily, and gave you the full facts even when things did not look good."" Above all, he added, there was a trust among Singaporeans that each person would do the right thing and have one another's back. For instance, people practised personal and social responsibility by getting vaccinated, practising hand hygiene, keeping their masks on indoors and by self-testing and isolating when infected with Covid-19. But Singapore must be prepared to encounter more variants and waves because the virus will remain for quite some time, he warned. Stressing that Singapore must learn from Covid-19, he said: ""One day, the next pandemic will come. A new virus will emerge, more transmissible, more adaptable and more dangerous than Covid-19. ""And we must be ready for it."" The most important lesson was to maintain the spirit of exercising personal and social responsibility, he said. ""Continue to nurture trust in our society, day in day out, during normal times,"" PM Lee added. ""So that during the next crisis, we can again draw upon a deep reservoir of trust to see us through, just like we have done during Covid-19."" Professor Teo Yik-Ying, dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore, told The Straits Times that relaxing the measures showed that the nation has determined that the overall cost of maintaining a mask mandate does not justify the compromises and sacrifices of doing so. This includes, for example, the ability to work and communicate effectively, as well as children’s ability to learn effectively in schools, he said. Prof Teo also noted that the removal of indoor mask mandates in other jurisdictions, such as in Europe and North America, had not significantly impacted their Covid-19 containment strategies. But there is a higher risk of Covid-19 transmission on public transportation and in healthcare settings, he said, and continuing to wear masks in these settings will help to protect the vulnerable against infections. He added: “ I wish to emphasise that people should still keep their masks on in any settings they are uncomfortable with, and the reality is that wearing masks does reduce the risk of respiratory infections, including influenza and common colds, not just against Covid-19.” READ NEXT - 8 highlights from NDR 2022: Masks optional in most indoor settings, Section 377A to be repealed"
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/ndr-2022-be-wary-of-social-media-messages-on-ukraine-war-with-ulterior-aims-says-pm-lee,"Be wary of social media messages on Ukraine war with ulterior aims, says PM Lee","SINGAPORE - Singaporeans should be vigilant about messages that are shared on social media and actively guard against hostile foreign influence, regardless of where they originate from, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Speaking during the Mandarin portion of his National Day Rally speech on Sunday (Aug 21), PM Lee said information that is shared on social media, such as Facebook and WeChat, as well as messaging platforms such as WhatsApp and Telegram, may be perceived as true and credible. But some of these messages have an ulterior aim of persuading Singaporeans to take sides, or to erode their trust in the Government, he said. Citing examples, he said there were messages in Chinese and English related to the Ukraine war that try to stir up strong anti-American sentiments. Others aim to discredit Russia and China, and seek to persuade people to side with the West, he added. ""We need to ask ourselves: Where do these messages come from, and what are their intentions? And are we sure we should share such messages with our friends? ""So please check the facts and do not accept all the information as truths. We must actively guard against hostile foreign influence operations, regardless of where they originate,"" said PM Lee. Only then can Singapore's sovereignty and independence be safeguarded, he added. PM Lee, who was speaking at the Institute of Technical Education headquarters in Ang Mo Kio, said he was heartened that most Singaporeans support the Government's position on the Ukraine war, including Chinese Singaporeans who are active on Chinese-language social media. The first part of his Mandarin speech was devoted to geopolitical challenges, as the international environment has become more unstable. He cited the deepening division between the United States and China, and the hostility created between Russia and other countries as a result of its invasion of Ukraine. These have profound implications for Singapore, PM Lee said. Greater geopolitical rivalry and tension among the major powers in Asia-Pacific could happen, and the possibility of the region experiencing similar conflicts to that of Europe cannot be ruled out, he said. ""Hence, we need to be psychologically prepared and stay united."" He reiterated why Singapore had to take a strong stance against Russia's invasion of Ukraine which started on Feb 24. Most Singaporeans understood the Government's position, he said, but some have questioned the need to offend Russia, to side with the US, or for Singapore to stick its neck out. PM Lee said Singapore was not siding with the US and neither was the Republic against Russia. ""But we have to be firm in our position and defend fundamental principles robustly. We cannot be ambiguous about where we stand. We believe the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, big or small, must be respected. ""These principles are existential for all nations, but especially so for a small nation like Singapore,"" he said. Singapore has consistently opposed the approach of ""might is right"", said PM Lee. ""If we do not stand firm and take a clear stand on the Ukraine crisis, should Singapore be invaded one day, no one will speak up for us,"" he said. PM Lee outlined how countries such as India, China, Vietnam and Laos abstained when the United Nations voted in March on a resolution deploring Russia's invasion of Ukraine. While the remaining Asean members voted for the resolution, they did not name Russia in their statements. As the smallest nation in Asean, Singapore's interests and considerations are naturally different from the others, said PM Lee. ""This is why we have not only explicitly condemned Russia's invasion, but also gone further to impose our own targeted sanctions on Russia,"" he said. As for Singapore's Chinese community, it is clear about the country's national interests because of a deeper sense of national and cultural identity, said PM Lee. The strong sense of local identity can be seen in the way home-grown artists infuse local flavours in their works, he said. PM Lee cited the example of the recent musical Shadow Moon, presented by the Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre, which incorporated xinyao, a genre of Singapore Mandarin songs. The centre also plans to set up a dedicated unit this year to conduct research on the evolution of Singapore Chinese culture - a move which the Government supports, he added.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/ndr-2022-strong-resilient-malaymuslim-community-makes-for-stronger-singapore,"Strong, resilient Malay/Muslim community makes for stronger S'pore, says PM Lee","SINGAPORE - A strong and resilient Malay/Muslim community makes for a stronger and more resilient Singapore, as it navigates an increasingly uncertain and complex world. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted that the community has forged a distinctive and confident Singaporean Malay/Muslim identity, which has integrated deeply into the Republic's multiracial society. Speaking in Malay during his National Day Rally speech on Sunday (Aug 21) at ITE College Central in Ang Mo Kio, he said: ""The contributions of the Malay/Muslim community during the pandemic are testament to our society's progress and success, reflecting how integrated we all are in Singapore's multiracial, multi-religious society."" He noted the steady progress the community has made on socio-economic issues over the decades, and lauded the strong network of community organisations committed to the development of the Malay community. PM Lee described the self-help group Mendaki as a ""prime example of how the community comes together to help one another"", adding that a number of individuals who have done well are contributing back to the community. He said Mendaki, which is marking its 40th anniversary in October, had since its inception helped the community focus on education as the key to socio-economic progress. The group's efforts have paid off. Over the past decade, almost 500 people have received the Mendaki Excellence awards, which are given to those who attain degrees with first class honours, said PM Lee, adding that only a handful of the awards were given in Mendaki's first 10 years. ""The results of Mendaki's effort speak for themselves,"" he said. ""Better academic performance has led to better jobs, with more Malay/Muslims in professional roles, higher incomes, and having better lives,"" he added. PM Lee said the success and self-confidence of a community depends not only on its socio-economic progress, but also intangible cultural and spiritual factors. ""In this journey, the Malay/Muslim community has benefited from strong religious leadership,"" he said. Practical guidance by the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) and asatizah (religious teachers) here have helped the community adapt its religious practices to Singapore's ""constantly changing and complex circumstances"". He said these include adjusting Friday prayer arrangements and deferring the Haj pilgrimage for two years in a row because of Covid-19, which helped keep pilgrims safe. PM Lee also pointed to the contributions of the Religious Rehabilitation Group (RRG), which has worked to rehabilitate radicalised individuals and guide the community on the correct interpretation and practice of Islam. ""They not only protected our Muslim community from extremist ideologies, but helped to maintain trust and confidence towards our multiracial, multi-religious society,"" he added. PM Lee thanked asatizah who had served in the RRG - which will be marking its 20th anniversary next year - singling out co-chairmen Ustaz Hasbi Hassan and Ustaz Ali Mohamed for showing ""strong leadership, courage, and commitment"". Ustaz Ali will be retiring as the RRG's co-chairman at the end of this month and will serve as the group's emeritus president, he said. PM Lee noted that as a multiracial society, Singapore needs to deal with sensitive issues in a way that preserves society's racial and religious harmony. He said the decision to allow Muslim nurses in public hospitals to wear the headscarf with their uniforms was years in the making. It took a lot of quiet engagement, dialogue, preparation and understanding from all parties, and not just the Malay/Muslim community, added PM Lee. The announcement was made in August last year. The Prime Minister said that from time to time, there will be other sensitive issues but they must be addressed in the same manner. ""This requires mutual understanding across all groups, and the willingness to give and take, and work together. ""Only then can every group have the space to maintain its religious and cultural practices, and get on harmoniously together,"" said PM Lee. He pointed to Section 377A of the Penal Code - legislation inherited from the British penal system which criminalises sex between men - as one such sensitive issue. He said that in handling the contentious issue, the Government will continue to uphold families as the basic building blocks of society. ""We will keep our policies on family and marriage unchanged, and maintain the prevailing norms and social values of our society,"" he added. Noting that there are strong views on both sides, PM Lee said the issue must not be allowed to divide Singaporeans. ""Every group must accept that it cannot get everything it wants, because that is simply not possible.

Addressing the nation in Malay at the National Day Rally at ITE College Central in Ang Mo Kio, PM Lee said: ""We will keep our policies on family and marriage unchanged, and maintain the prevailing norms and social values of our society."" He noted that Section 377A - a law in the Penal Code that criminalises sex between men - is a highly sensitive and contentious issue, with strong views on both sides. ""But we must not allow it to divide us, like what has happened elsewhere,"" he said. Every group has to accept that it cannot get everything it wants, as that is ""simply not possible"", he added. ""And we must maintain the mutual respect and trust that we have painstakingly built up over the years, and stay united as one people."" PM Lee said he would speak more on Section 377A during his English speech, which will start at 8pm on Sunday. He noted that as a multiracial society, Singapore will often have to deal with sensitive issues in a manner that preserves racial and religious harmony. “This requires mutual understanding across all groups, and the willingness to give and take, and work together,” he said.  “Only then can every group have the space to maintain its religious and cultural practices, and get on harmoniously together.” While Section 377A is fundamentally different from the tudung issue, it has to be handled just as carefully, he said. PM Lee had announced at last year's Rally that nurses would be allowed to wear tudungs in public hospitals - a decision that he said was years in the making and took much engagement, dialogue and preparation from all parties, not just the Malay and Muslim community.  READ NEXT - 8 highlights from NDR 2022: Masks optional in most indoor settings, Section 377A to be repealed"
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/unpacking-the-issues-around-section-377a,Unpacking the issues around Section 377A,"SINGAPORE - The law criminalising gay sex has been in the spotlight in recent weeks, amid talk of a possible review. The Straits Times looks at some of the key issues. Section 377A of the Penal Code is a law criminalising sex between men, which is not enforced. It was introduced in 1938 by the British colonial government, and was likely partially aimed at stopping European men from engaging Asian male prostitutes, based on documents declassified by the UK government between 2014 and 2016. Before Section 377A was introduced, the colonial government used a different, more loosely worded law - Section 377 - to prosecute men who had sex with men. This law was adopted from the Indian penal code in 1872 and criminalised ""carnal intercourse against the order of nature"", which included oral and anal sex between heterosexual couples. Similar laws were put in place in territories ruled by the British empire around the world, including India and New Zealand. Some of these countries have since repealed such laws over the years. Singapore kept Sections 377 and 377A after independence in 1965, but the Government repealed Section 377 in 2007 after a comprehensive review of the Penal Code. A new law was instituted in its place, criminalising sex with a human corpse. Section 377A was retained - a decision which generated fierce debate in Parliament. In a speech then, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the Government would not actively enforce Section 377A. Since 2007, there have been several legal challenges contending that Section 377A should be struck down as it is unconstitutional. None was successful. In 2010, a man was charged under Section 377A over having oral sex with another man in a public toilet cubicle. Although the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) later amended the charge against Mr Tan Eng Hong to one of committing an obscene act in public, he subsequently filed a suit challenging the constitutionality of Section 377A. In 2012, gay couple Gary Lim and Kenneth Chee also challenged the law. The Court of Appeal eventually ruled in both cases that Section 377A was constitutional. In 2019, three men filed another constitutional challenge against the law. They were: Dr Roy Tan Seng Kee, a retired general practitioner and an activist for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights; disc jockey Johnson Ong Ming; and Mr Bryan Choong, the former executive director of LGBT non-profit organisation Oogachaga. The Court of Appeal, led by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, ruled that the law would stay but was ""unenforceable in its entirety"". In its arguments for the case, the AGC said the question of whether to repeal Section 377A is a deeply divisive socio-political issue that should be decided by Parliament, not the judiciary. Many of the constitutional challenges to Section 377A have revolved around these two articles of Singapore's Constitution. Article 9 states: ""No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law."" Article 12 states: ""All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law."" Constitutional challenges to Section 377A have contended that the law is not consistent with these articles, and hence should be void. In their legal challenge, Mr Lim and Mr Chee argued that the right to life and personal liberty under Article 9 should include a right to privacy and personal autonomy for a person to express love towards another human being. But the apex court rejected this interpretation, holding that the phrase ""life or personal liberty"" refers only to a person's freedom from an unlawful deprivation of life and unlawful incarceration. Lawyer M. Ravi, acting for Mr Tan Eng Hong, had argued that Section 377A was absurd because it criminalised a minority based on a core aspect of their identity that was unchangeable. The court rejected this, saying there were still conflicting scientific views on whether sexual orientation is unchangeable, and it was thus premature to express any conclusive views on it. The court also said Article 12 does not cover the issues involved in Section 377A. While the provision specifically prohibits discrimination based on religion, race, descent or place of birth, the words ""gender"", ""sex"" and ""sexual orientation"" are noticeably absent. In throwing out the challenge against Section 377A in February this year, the Court of Appeal noted that the courts had established another approach to the ""reasonable classification"" test used to determine if a law is legal under Article 12. This could make a difference to how Section 377A is evaluated, depending on how the legislative object of Section 377A is framed. If Section 377A is a law meant to express societal disapproval of homosexual acts between men, then it would not violate the ""reasonable classification test"" and will be considered constitutional under Article 12. But if the object of Section 377A is to show societal disapproval of homosexual conduct in general, or to safeguard public morality generally, then that would strengthen the case that Section 377A falls foul of the ""reasonable classification"" test. That is because in these scenarios, Section 377A would appear to be under-inclusive because it does not criminalise female-female homosexual conduct, for instance. Similarly, if Section 377A is a law meant to express societal disapproval of male prostitution, it may then be considered over-inclusive, and thus also unconstitutional under Article 12. In October 2007, as the House debated amendments to the Penal Code, then Nominated MP Siew Kum Hong filed a citizen's petition to repeal Section 377A. The move sparked a passionate debate on the topic with fierce arguments from both sides. Mr Siew, a lawyer, appealed for gay men to have equal treatment under the law, arguing that criminalising sex between men discriminates against them and is unconstitutional. Then Nominated MP Thio Li-Ann, a law academic, called for the retention of the law, saying repealing it would ""further batter the institution of marriage"". Most People's Action Party MPs argued for keeping the law on the books to signal society's disapproval of the homosexual lifestyle, but not enforcing it so as not to actively oppress gays. Former Punggol East MP Charles Chong was among the few who spoke out in favour of repeal. He said that if homosexuality is inborn, it would be wrong to criminalise and persecute those who are born different, regardless of how conservative Singapore society claims to be. Workers' Party chairman Sylvia Lim said her party would not be calling for the law to be abolished as it had not come to a consensus on the matter. Wrapping up the debate then, PM Lee said the Government's position was that it was better to accept the legal untidiness and ambiguity of keeping the law on the books, while not proactively enforcing it to ""maintain a balance, to uphold a stable society with traditional heterosexual family values, but with space for homosexuals to live their lives and to contribute to the society"". In 2018, veteran diplomat Tommy Koh called on the gay community in Singapore to mount another challenge to the law, after India's Supreme Court struck down the country's law against consensual gay sex. Former attorneys-general Walter Woon and V.K. Rajah also separately said it was not desirable for the Government and Parliament to direct the AGC not to prosecute offences under Section 377A. In a paper published in 2019, former chief justice Chan Sek Keong called for a review of Section 377A. In it, he asked whether the law violates the fundamental rights of all to equality before the law and equal protection under the law, as provided for under Article 12 of the Constitution. Following the comments by Mr Woon and Mr Rajah, Attorney-General Lucien Wong said in 2018 that the Public Prosecutor retains independence in deciding whether to pursue a case under Section 377A. The police, when conducting investigations into an offence under the law, ""will decide whether or not there is sufficient basis to refer the case to the Public Prosecutor"". The Public Prosecutor will then determine whether to charge an offender under the law, and in doing so exercises his independent discretion solely on the basis of his assessment of the facts, the law and the public interest. ""While the PP (Public Prosecutor) is entitled to consider public policies in exercising his discretion, these do not fetter the exercise of prosecutorial discretion,"" he had said. ""The Public Prosecutor's exercise of prosecutorial discretion has always been, and remains, unfettered. In the case of Section 377A, where the conduct in question was between two consenting adults in a private place, the Public Prosecutor had, absent other factors, taken the position that prosecution would not be in the public interest. This remains the position today."" In February, the Court of Appeal, led by the Chief Justice, held that Section 377A is completely unenforceable in its entirety, meaning that while the law will stay on the books, it cannot be used to prosecute men for having sex with other men. Legal scholars and the gay community lauded the decision for giving gay men real protection from prosecution under the law. The apex court said that the Attorney-General's comments in 2018, when he said the Public Prosecutor would not prosecute two consenting men for having sex in private, had given legal significance to the political compromise struck in 2007 when PM Lee said the law would not be proactively enforced. Mr Wong's representations had also given people a legitimate expectation of not being prosecuted under Section 377A, based on the administrative law doctrine of substantive legitimate expectations, the court said. As such, Section 377A would remain unenforceable unless and until the Attorney-General of the day revokes the 2018 representations. Given this, the three men who challenged the law - Dr Tan, Mr Ong and Mr Choong - do not currently face any real and credible threat of prosecution. They thus do not have the legal standing to mount constitutional challenges against the law, the court said, dismissing their bid. The ruling could also mean that other gay men will not have the standing to challenge the constitutionality of Section 377A, unless and until the Attorney-General's stance changes. Following the Court of Appeal's ruling in February on Section 377A, Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam said the Government is carefully considering the best way forward on the law. He also reiterated the Government's stance on the law, noting PM Lee had said in 2007 that Singaporeans want ""a stable society with traditional heterosexual family values, but with space for homosexuals to live their lives and to contribute to society"". But Mr Shanmugam, who made the remarks in Parliament when responding to questions from MPs on the ruling, had also said that public policies need to evolve to keep abreast of changes in views in society, and legislation will also have to evolve to support updated policies. He said that if the Government decides to move on the law, it will ""do so in a way that continues to balance these different viewpoints, and avoids causing a sudden, destabilising change in social norms and public expectations"". Shortly after, the Government started its review of the law, consulting widely, including religious and LGBT groups."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/religious-leaders-take-nuanced-position-on-repeal-of-section-377a,Singapore's religious leaders outline positions on repeal of gay-sex law,"SINGAPORE - The decision on whether to do away with a law that criminalises sex between men is one for the Government to take, and the Catholic Church here takes a neutral position on repealing Section 377A of the Penal Code, said Archbishop of Singapore William Goh. As long as the rights of the Church and the religious are protected, and they can continue to teach what they believe is right, the Church will not oppose any repeal of Section 377A, he added in a recent interview. The issue of whether the law should be changed or repealed resurfaced after the Court of Appeal ruled in February that it will stay on the books but cannot be used to prosecute men for gay sex. The head of the Roman Catholic Church was among religious leaders, Singaporeans and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) groups Cabinet ministers have engaged in recent weeks as the Government considers the best way forward on the law. Religious and LGBT groups have seen this as signalling imminent policy change, and issued statements to state their position. Responding to questions about the matter, Archbishop Goh emphasised that whether the law should be repealed is for the Government to decide. He said: ""For us, we are neutral so long as our rights are protected. That's all. We don't want to criminalise people."" He was referring to the Catholic Church's rights to maintain its position on marriage as a union between a man and a woman, and that the family unit comprises a father, mother and their children. Several other religious leaders have stated similar positions. Taoist Federation chairman Tan Thiam Lye told The Straits Times when asked: ""We neither oppose nor support repeal (of Section 377A)."" Sikh Advisory Board chairman Malminderjit Singh said repealing Section 377A will be a pragmatic move, since the law has not been enforced. But he added that from the point of view of the Sikh faith, this should be balanced with the strengthening of the concept of marriage and a family unit as being between a man and a woman. Earlier this year, Singapore's top Islamic leader, Mufti Nazirudin Mohd Nasir, said in an interview with The Straits Times that the LGBT issue is a very complex matter, but there was also a need to work harder and move faster towards some resolution, as people expect religious leaders to provide guidance on the matter. Although Islam's position on homosexuality is clear - that it is not permissible - many values in the religion are rooted in compassion, kindness and inclusivity, even in dealing with prohibitions in religion, Dr Nazirudin had said. He urged the community not to reject Muslims who do not practise certain aspects of the religion, but instead to find a constructive way of coexisting while reminding one another to uphold the faith. Census 2020 found that among Singapore residents aged 15 years and above, 31.1 per cent identified themselves as Buddhists, 8.8 per cent as Taoists, 15.6 per cent as Muslims and 5 per cent as Hindus. Those who identified as Christians made up 18.9 per cent, of whom 36 per cent, or 6.7 per cent of the resident population, are Catholics. The Alliance of Pentecostal and Charismatic Churches of Singapore has cautioned against doing away with Section 377A, describing it as ""a marker for many social and moral considerations"". In a statement last Friday, it warned that repealing the law, ""without placing an equally weighted proscription in place"", would lead to wide-ranging negative social consequences, such as rewriting of the norms of acceptable sexual relationships. It would also spur ""a brand of intolerant and aggressive LGBT activism which seeks to impose its ideology upon Singapore society"", said the alliance. It called on the Government to put in place other ""clear moral markers, not ambiguities, of the values that we want promoted, and protected"". Religious groups have also expressed concern that any repeal could encourage and embolden LGBT activists to push for same-sex marriages to be recognised, and have called for greater protection for marriage. The alliance, which represents a network of churches, Christian organisations and pastors, hopes that the definition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman will be enshrined in the Constitution. Last month, about 1,200 people, including Christian and Muslim leaders attended a private gathering called Protect Singapore Townhall to discuss the impact of a repeal, and pushed for safeguards to protect marriage, family, children and the freedom of conscience. About a week later, Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam noted that most people want the current position on marriage to remain, and said the Government is considering how best to strike a balance between dealing with the law and safeguarding the current legal position on marriage from challenges in courts. Archbishop Goh, in the interview with The Straits Times and Lianhe Zaobao, also said he hoped people would respect the Catholic Church's rights to maintain its position on marriage and family. Christians and Catholics dread the repeal of Section 377A as they fear it might lead to a situation, as in the West, where people are unable to practise what they believe, and cannot even say that a same-sex relationship is wrong, he said. ""But we have to tell our children: For us, it is not acceptable. So we must have the right to continue to teach (this) in our Catholic schools, for that matter."" He added that the Catholic Church's argument is not against repealing the law. ""We are just saying, we must have the freedom to continue to teach what we believe, practise what we teach as well."""

He will be replaced by his fellow Aljunied GRC MP Leon Perera in the role, in a move meant to give the MPs more exposure in leadership roles, said the town council. A series of Government Gazette notices published on Monday (Aug 15) and Tuesday announced the changes had taken effect on July 31. Meanwhile, Aljunied GRC MP Gerald Giam was reappointed as vice-chairman of the town council, a role he has held since April 2021. Asked about the moves, an AHTC spokesman said they are ""part of a rotation exercise among MPs to facilitate deepening of leadership capacity"". The changes come amid uncertainty over Mr Faisal's future, after he and WP chief and Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh were referred by Parliament to the Public Prosecutor for further investigations over their role in a lying scandal involving former WP MP Raeesah Khan. Mr Faisal, who is vice-chair of the party, and Mr Singh could lose their seats in Parliament if they are eventually charged, convicted and fined at least $10,000. Mr Faisal, who oversees the Kaki Bukit division of Aljunied GRC, has been vice-chair of the town council since April 2021. On the AHTC website, he is listed as chairman of the town council's Estate & Community Liaison Committee. He was also chairman of the town council from September 2018 to April 2021, when he was succeeded by Hougang MP Dennis Tan in the role."

It comes as the cost of living in Singapore increases, WP chief Pritam Singh told media before the party's annual National Day dinner event in Hougang Avenue 5 on Saturday (Aug 13). The scheme, which was piloted at the start of the year, was targeted at older singles living in WP wards, but will now be offered to all residents on a case-by-case basis, said a WP spokesman. More than 1,400 residents, WP supporters and members of the public attended the dinner held at an open field next to Block 324. Former WP chief Low Thia Khiang was also at the event along with all nine WP MPs. Leader of the Opposition Singh told media that WP MPs will continue to highlight cost of living issues in Parliament. He also spoke on the party's resumption of outreach activities following the relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions in April this year. ""In East Coast and Marine Parade, the party continues with house visits and activities, which they also did when safe management measures allowed. ""Now many restrictions have been lifted and they will continue with their work,"" said Mr Singh. The party contested the two constituencies at the 2020 General Election, losing both GRCs to the incumbent People's Action Party. WP has also resumed distribution of its newsletter Hammer, said Mr Singh. Sengkang MP Louis Chua and WP youth wing president Nicole Seah said that the party had expanded its outreach efforts to young people through new media such as podcasts and short-video sharing app TikTok. WP launched its TikTok account on Aug 5 with a video featuring Mr Low. Mr Chua said WP focuses on ground outreach to speak to residents face-to-face to understand their concerns and issues, but also recognises the importance of expanding to all communications channels, especially those relevant to younger people. When asked about the party's plans to replace former MP Raeesah Khan, who resigned from Parliament in November last year after lying to the House, Mr Singh said the new Sengkang candidate will be unveiled in due course. Asked about the party's plans for the next general election, which must be held by November 2025, Mr Singh said WP would share which constituencies it intends to contest at the appropriate time. The Singapore Democratic Party had announced on Tuesday that it would contest Sembawang GRC."

He was responding to the Singapore Democratic Party's (SDP) declaration of its intention to contest Sembawang GRC in the next election. Mr Ong is the anchor minister for the People's Action Party's (PAP) team in that constituency. On National Day, after a five-hour walkabout in the five constituencies that the SDP had contested during the 2020 General Election, the opposition party said it intends to ""return home"" to Sembawang GRC, which it had contested in the 2006 and 2011 elections. In a Facebook post on Tuesday, SDP also reiterated its commitment to contesting the five constituencies - Bukit Batok, Bukit Panjang, Holland Bukit-Timah GRC, Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC and Yuhua - which it had done in the 2020 election. The next general election must be held by November 2025. Speaking to media at the sidelines of a community event on Saturday, Mr Ong, a member of the PAP's central executive committee, said that he was not surprised by the SDP's intention as it had contested the constituency before. However, that was more than 10 years ago and the party has not been active in the area since, he added. ""We look forward to a healthy contest and we'll do our best to win the mandate of the people,"" said Mr Ong. There are still some years to go before the next election, noted Mr Ong, who stood in Sembawang GRC in the 2015 and 2020 elections. During this time, he said his team will focus on fulfilling the promises made to residents, such as building the Bukit Canberra integrated hub, that will help to improve their lives. The hub will have an 800-seat hawker centre, an indoor sports hall and a polyclinic. The PAP beat the SDP with 76.7 per cent of the vote for Sembawang GRC in 2006 and 63.9 per cent in 2011. In the 2015 election, the PAP beat the National Solidarity Party (NSP) in Sembawang with 72.3 per cent of the votes. The ruling party beat NSP again in the same GRC in 2020, with 67.3 per cent of the vote."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/gotabaya-rajapaksa-leaves-singapore-for-thailand-after-short-term-visit-pass-expires,Gotabaya Rajapaksa leaves S'pore for Thailand after short-term visit pass expires,"SINGAPORE - Former Sri Lanka president Gotabaya Rajapaksa has left Singapore, after his short-term visit pass expired on Thursday (Aug 11). Responding to media queries, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority said on Thursday that Mr Rajapaksa left Singapore on Thursday. On Thursday evening, Mr Rajapaksa boarded a flight from Singapore to Bangkok, after Thailand confirmed a day before that it had received a request from the current Sri Lankan government for him to visit the country. Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that permission was granted on humanitarian grounds, reported the Bangkok Post, while Thai Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai said Mr Rajapaksa will enter the country on a diplomatic passport, which would allow him to stay for 90 days. Thailand is the second South-east Asian country Mr Rajapaksa is seeking temporary shelter in after he fled his island nation last month amid mass protests. He flew to Singapore on July 14, via the Maldives, following unprecedented unrest triggered by Sri Lanka's worst economic crisis in seven decades, and days after thousands of protesters stormed the president's official residence and office. Shortly after he arrived in Singapore, Mr Rajapaksa, 73, tendered his resignation as the country's leader. Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs had said on his arrival in Singapore that the former president had been allowed entry on a private visit on a 14-day visit pass and had not asked for asylum. This pass was later extended for another 14 days. While in Singapore, Mr Rajapaksa kept a low profile and was not seen in public. He initially stayed at a hotel in the city centre, but was believed to have moved to a private residence. It is not clear how long Mr Rajapaksa will remain in Thailand or what his next destination may be. Mr Don said the Thai government believed Mr Rajapaksa's stay would not cause any trouble for Thailand, and that the Sri Lankan government did not oppose the decision, according to the Bangkok Post. According to Reuters, Thai foreign ministry spokesman Tanee Sangrat said that Mr Rajapaksa's stay in Thailand was temporary, and that ""the Sri Lankan side informs us that the former president has no intention for political asylum in Thailand and will travel to another country afterwards"". On July 31, Sri Lanka's new President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who was voted in by lawmakers earlier last month, told the Wall Street Journal that he did not think it was the right time for Mr Rajapaksa to return to the country as this could inflame political tensions. Sri Lanka remains mired in economic crisis, with the country's central bank expecting inflation to increase to 70 per cent this month."

He said in a Facebook post: ""We also had a good exchange on strengthening collaboration - including on sustainability. As small states, our two countries share many similar interests."" In another meeting with Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean, Sheikh Mohammed discussed bilateral ties and the potential to strengthen cooperation in fields such as energy, food security and sustainable development. They also spoke about the importance of the Singapore-Qatar High Level Joint Committee (HLJC) as a platform to advance bilateral cooperation. Singapore looks forward to hosting the 8th HLJC at a mutually convenient time, MFA added. On Wednesday (Aug 10), Sheikh Mohammed was hosted to breakfast by Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for Education and Foreign Affairs Maliki Osman. Dr Maliki welcomed Qatar's engagement of Asean, including its signing of the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation at the recent Asean Ministerial Meeting in Cambodia.

He was asked if he would run in the presidential election that will have to take place next year as President Halimah Yacob's six-year term comes to an end. The election will be open to candidates of all races. The 2017 presidential election was reserved for Malay candidates as Singapore had not had a Malay head of state for a period of time. The eligibility criteria for private-sector candidates was also made more stringent, requiring them to have had experience running large, complex companies that have $500 million in shareholders' equity. Madam Halimah, 67, was elected unopposed after she was found to be the only one of three presidential hopefuls who qualified. After Mr Yeo said running was not a prospect that appealed to him, he was asked: ""So 'no' is the answer"". ""Yes,"" he replied. The interviewer then pressed him, and asked if he would consider running next year should there be the possibility of another walkover. ""No, I'm sure there are many candidates,"" he said at the interview. Mr Yeo, who retired from politics after his People's Action Party Aljunied GRC team lost to the Workers' Party team in the 2011 General Election, had been urged by some to enter the fray in the presidential election that same year. Since then, his name has come up in discussions about presidential candidates for Singapore. After retiring from politics in 2011, he took on the role of chairman of Kerry Logistics Network in August 2012, and became an executive director in November 2013. In 2019, he retired from the posts. He was appointed an independent non-executive director of mainboard-listed Creative Technology in 2021. He has also been an independent non-executive director at Hong Kong-listed AIA Group since 2012 and Nasdaq-listed Pinduoduo since 2018. Mr Yeo was also asked if his upcoming book was meant to pave the way for a presidential run. To this, he said the book was not a publicity exercise. Describing it as an ""enormous effort"", he said: ""By the time it's over, I would have written a quarter million words, so it is a huge exercise."" Mr Yeo also said his views on running for president had also been made previously. He had said in George Yeo On Bonsai, Banyan And The Tao, a compendium of his speeches and writings, that he thought himself ""temperamentally unsuited for the responsibility"" but was prepared to run nonetheless out of a sense of duty. He had also said that his candidacy was initially supported by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, but he decided to bow out of the race when Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam expressed his willingness to run for the presidency with the PAP's support. He added during the Monday interview that his upcoming book might ""sharpen"" what he had said before on the topic. The idea for the new book was for Mr Yeo to be interviewed on a range of topics by writer and former journalist Woon Tai Ho. But Mr Yeo said preparing the notes for the interviews turned out to be more laborious than he had expected. ""It started with an invitation to do something quite simple, then it got more and more involved and then it grew and grew. Looking back, had I known at the beginning what the journey entailed, I would never have begun,"" he quipped. ""But now, having reached maybe the three-quarter mark, I'm glad I embarked on that journey. At least the end is in sight."" In the book, Mr Yeo speaks about topics from politics to economics and religion, and also foreign affairs, said publisher World Scientific on its website."

After many ups and downs, we have come through as one united people. We are now in a much better position. Our population is highly vaccinated, and well protected. Our hospitals and clinics are still busy, but not overwhelmed. Despite the recent surge in cases, we have been able to avoid tightening measures again. I thank the many individuals and organisations, public and private, who have participated in the fight against Covid-19. Key to our success has been the high level of trust in our society. Singaporeans trusted your government, and followed its advice. You accepted and complied with difficult but necessary safe management measures. You stepped forward to get vaccinated when your turn came. But above all, Singaporeans trusted one another. We all practised personal and social responsibility. We did the right thing even when no one was checking. We supported and took care of fellow citizens, contributing hand sanitiser in lifts, and delivering food packs to those quarantined at home. Our mutual trust in one another made all the difference. Indeed, Covid-19 has been the test of a generation. We held up through this trial, to emerge stronger and more united. This unity is crucial as we move forward beyond Covid-19. Our road ahead will not be easy. Around us, a storm is gathering. US-China relations are worsening, with intractable issues, deep suspicions, and limited engagement between them. This is unlikely to improve any time soon. Furthermore, miscalculations or mishaps can easily make things much worse. Russia's invasion of Ukraine also has profound implications for the world and for Singapore. First, it has set Russia, a nuclear power, bitterly against many states, especially the US and the Nato countries. The hostility is deep, and will not be resolved easily. Second, the invasion violates fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity under the United Nations Charter. This is particularly vital to Singapore, because these principles underpin our security, and even our existence. Third, war in Europe will affect regional security in the Asia-Pacific. Already it has further strained China's relations with the US, and with America's partners in Asia. Singapore will be buffeted by intense rivalry and tensions in the region around us. What can we do about this? Staying united is key to Singapore's survival - it is the only way to deal with challenges in an increasingly troubled world. We must look to our Total Defence, and maintain a strong and credible SAF and Home Team. We must also brace ourselves and be psychologically prepared that in the next decades our region may not be as peaceful and stable as it has been thus far. More immediate, however, are the economic challenges. Even though our economy has emerged strongly from the pandemic, the outlook has clouded considerably. Before Russia invaded Ukraine, the pandemic had already disrupted supply chains, and inflation was already rising. But the invasion has aggravated both problems. Food and energy prices are rising all around the world. I know that the cost of living is at the top of everyone's minds. The Government is doing everything necessary to help Singaporeans cope with rising prices. We have announced multiple support packages, targeting assistance to those who need it most. Some measures have already been implemented, and more will be rolled out in the coming months. We have acted decisively to secure supplies of food and other essentials, diversifying our sources and building up adequate stockpiles. I am also glad to see that companies and community groups have initiated their own support programmes. By helping each other, Singapore can be Stronger Together. Meanwhile, we have tightened our exchange rate policy and strengthened the Singapore dollar, to dampen imported inflation. The Government also stands ready to do more to help Singaporeans if things worsen. But the basic reality is that international economic conditions have shifted. The world is not likely to return any time soon to the low inflation levels and interest rates that we have enjoyed in recent decades. Singapore's deeper response to this shift must be to transform our industry, upgrade our skills and raise our productivity. Then our wages can go up higher than inflation, and Singaporeans can earn more in real terms year by year. Beyond these immediate issues, we must also look to the long term. I am speaking to you from Gardens by the Bay. This year is the Gardens' 10th anniversary, but the Gardens were decades in the making. Where I am standing used to be open sea. About 50 years ago, we started to reclaim land here to create Marina South and a future downtown. And we decided that the new downtown should not just be office and residential buildings, but would have at its heart an iconic green public space. Thus was Gardens by the Bay conceived, designed and built. Since it opened in 2012, the Gardens have become a landmark which Singaporeans enjoy and are very proud of. And we keep on improving. Soon, we will be starting works at Bay East Garden, where the Founders' Memorial will be sited. This is how we do things in Singapore - always daring to dream, setting our sights on the next frontier, and searching for better solutions and fresh possibilities. We look and plan ahead not just for the next five or 10 years, but for the next 30 or 50 years and beyond. Last year, the URA launched the Long-Term Plan Review. They consulted and engaged many people, old and young, looking for ideas to reimagine our city and island for the next bound. The ongoing exhibition at the URA Centre showcases concepts for major developments, and ideas to create new communities and green spaces. These concepts represent our collective dreams and aspirations for what Singapore can become. They will transform the way we live, work and play, while strengthening our roots and heritage. There is a lot for Singaporeans to look forward to. Of course, long-term plans are not just about the physical infrastructure. We also need to sustain economic progress and social resilience - investing in our people to reach their full potential, taking care of our elderly and vulnerable, fostering a common identity and building a brighter future for our grandchildren and beyond. Each generation should be able to aim higher and bolder, to build a better Singapore than the one they inherited. DPM Lawrence Wong and the 4G team have launched the Forward Singapore exercise, to involve citizens in refreshing our social compact, and to chart our way forward together. I invite you to participate actively, contribute your ideas, and help to shape our future Singapore. We must never stop imagining and building the Singapore we want, even as we strengthen our guard against what can go wrong. Covid-19 will not be Singapore's last crisis. More storms and turbulence lie ahead. But do not fear. As long as we stay united and resolute, we can keep our nation peaceful and secure, build a more prosperous economy, and forge an inclusive society that all of us can belong to and can be proud of, for many years to come. Happy National Day!"

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/dpm-lawrence-wong-and-his-wife-and-another-new-tiktok-account-what-politicians-are-up-to-this-week,"DPM Wong and his wife, and another new TikTok account: What politicians are up to this week","SINGAPORE - The Straits Times looks at what politicians, and the politically related, are up to in this weekly series. In this edition, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's wife makes a ""guest"" appearance in some social media posts, as does former Workers' Party chief Low Thia Khiang. Look out for the latest edition of the series every Friday, and check out past ones here. When Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong was chosen by his fourth-generation People's Action Party colleagues as their leader in April this year, curiosity peaked about him and his personal life. And one of the things people were interested about: just who his wife is. From April 10 to 16, the search terms ""Lawrence Wong and wife"" reached its peak popularity, based on Google Trends. But most people were unlikely to have found many pictures of Ms Loo Tze Lui, who has mostly kept out of the spotlight. This week, though, she made a guest appearance as Mr Wong and Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean hosted a special guest, Brunei Crown Prince Al-Muhtadee Billah, during his visit to Singapore for the 8th Singapore-Brunei Young Leaders' Programme. Ms Loo, who is Mr Wong's second wife - his first marriage in his 20s had ended in an amicable divorce due to incompatibility - had accompanied him on a visit to River Wonders with their foreign guests. In some photos posted by Mr Teo, she is standing close to Mr Wong, together with Crown Prince Billah, his wife Princess Sarah, and their children, Princess Muneerah Madhul, Prince Muhammad Aiman and Princess Faathimah Az-Zahraa'. Ms Loo, who runs a family office and sits on the YMCA board of directors, was also at a dinner hosted by Mr Wong and Mr Teo for the Crown Prince and his wife, which was also attended by Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Maliki Osman and Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong. With Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong having said that he hoped to hand over to Mr Wong once he is ready, perhaps Ms Loo will find it harder to stay out of the spotlight. The Workers' Party launched its official TikTok page on Friday (Aug 5), with a video of former party chief Low Thia Khiang walking around a Sengkang estate. Mr Low, who was covering Sengkang GRC MP Jamus Lim during his sabbatical abroad, had checked out a fitness area and playground in the estate, hanging on a pull-up bar and climbing on a suspension bridge to make sure the equipment was safe and working well. The long-time WP leader had retired from politics at the 2020 general election - shortly after he fell at home in April 2020 and had a head injury - but it appears he is still popular with residents. In a comment on the video, TikTok user mamafurry said: ""Happy to see Mr Low in good health and in action."" Another TikTok user, Malcolm Sunny, quipped: ""I thought he was going to do a pull up."" In the past week, the WP had also resumed the sale of its Hammer newsletter after a break of two years due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The party had covered Blk 630 Bedok Reservoir Road market, in Aljunied GRC's Eunos ward - where the MP is Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh - as well as Eunos Crescent in Marine Parade GRC, where the WP has been active.Aljunied GRC MP Leon Perera, announcing this in a Facebook post on July 31, said: ""It was good to spend the morning with constituents and fellow members of The Workers' Party as we work towards a healthy, balanced politics in the country we love."""

While cyber threats occur in the thousands and even millions every day, there are some that have ""the most pernicious intent and seek to undermine our nation's sovereignty or security"", he told Parliament on Tuesday (Aug 2). He was speaking during a debate on a Bill - which was later passed - that paves the way for the formation of the Digital and Intelligence Service (DIS) by the end of this year. Dr Ng said: ""For the SAF, it has asked itself this simple question, just as it does if the threat came from the air, land or sea: How does it detect, mitigate or repel any potential aggressor - an orchestrated cyber attack by state and non-state actors - that means to do Singapore and Singaporeans harm?"" The answer is a dedicated service to raise, train and sustain cybertroops and capabilities to defend the Republic's digital borders, he said, describing the DIS as ""the force on the front line"" in the digital domain. He gave examples of cyber attacks on critical infrastructure that have occurred recently around the world, such as one in the United States last year which resulted in gas supplies being cut off to many south and east coast states for at least two weeks. While intelligence agencies have not detected any coordinated campaign against Singapore in the digital domain, it would be prudent to build up the fourth service now, he said. ""That alone would serve as a deterrent."" Besides amending the SAF Act to formally set up the DIS as the fourth military service, there were disciplinary and administrative changes, as well as related amendments to the Constitution. They authorise the DIS chief to be a member of the Armed Forces Council, have legal powers to discharge his duties, and to lead the DIS in times of conflict. The proposed changes also designate the DIS chief as an appointment made by the president acting in his discretion - similar to those of the Chief of Defence Force and other service chiefs. More than 10 MPs spoke during the debate on the DIS, including talent recruitment and retention, potential coordination with other government agencies, and how conflicts in the digital domain will be defined. They included Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang GRC), who asked if DIS recruits must also undergo the same type of training as other soldiers, such as physical fitness tests, and if so, whether this means losing out on people with relevant expertise but not other military skills. In response, Dr Ng said two main reasons led to the decision to form the DIS - the need for talent and to have a ""mission mindset"". Forming a formal fourth service on a par with the army, navy and air force is the best footing for the DIS is to attract the right type of people it needs, he said. ""It provides their new entrants and existing staff career paths and progressions on par with the army, navy and air force, including for those with the aptitude to be Chief of Service and even to be the Chief of Defence Force."" In its current configuration, the command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I) community is a supporting force akin to combat support, logistics and maintenance, said Dr Ng. It will continue to perform its role of providing the three services and the SAF actionable timely intelligence and to ensure that communications are secure to execute plans. ""But with the DIS as a formal service, it is now also directly responsible and accountable to protect the cyber domain against external aggressors. ""As cyber warriors there, they are front-line troops. This mindset shift is crucial for the SAF as it builds the DIS,"" said Dr Ng. This is why the DIS needs ""a military man in a uniform to have the military mindset"" and not a civilian chief, he said. Dr Ng also said that while the right military values and mission mindset are needed for a DIS soldier, an individual with the right aptitude can join the service even if he is not best suited for physical combat. Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh said that while the Workers' Party (WP) has no fundamental objection to the new appointment of Chief DIS and ""substantively"" supports the SAF and Other Matters Bill, his party will vote against the Constitution (Amendment) Bill as a matter of principle. He said the WP had in 2016 called for the elected presidency to return to its original form as an appointed office without blocking powers to focus on being a unifying figure for the nation rather than having any confrontational role with the elected government. The WP had also previously raised in Parliament the prospect of gridlock should an elected president withhold nominations to key appointments, he added. ""In view of the Workers' Party's position on the elected presidency, we will vote against the Constitution (Amendment) Bill as a matter of principle,"" he said. The Constitution (Amendment) Bill was passed with 75 MPs voting for it, with eight against and no abstentions. This cleared the 63 votes required for changes to be made to the Constitution. 1. A three-year limitation period for the trial of offences in military courts has been amended to allow it to start later in some situations. The default limitation period under the SAF Act had required a serviceman to be tried within three years from the date the offence was committed or the date the offence was reported to a disciplinary officer or military policeman, whichever was later - after which, the serviceman can no longer be dealt with under the SAF Act. 2. The Ministry of Defence (Mindef) can now offer composition for minor military offences. This was not an option for Mindef previously. Amendments were passed to allow for composition fines up to a cap of $5,000, or half of the maximum fine prescribed for the offence, or half the maximum fine that may be imposed for the offence at summary trial, which ever is lowest. This is meant to resolve minor offences efficaciously while maintaining deterrence. 3. A senior military expert of a rank of or above ME8, when it is created, will be subject to the same disciplinary processes as another officer of or above the rank of a Brigadier-General."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/provide-more-lactation-rooms-and-paid-nursing-breaks-for-working-mothers-says-louis-ng,Provide more lactation rooms and paid nursing breaks for working mothers: Louis Ng,"SINGAPORE - Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC) has called for buildings that contain offices and sited in business parks to have more lactation rooms, and working mothers to have paid nursing breaks. Citing a local survey of about 970 respondents by the Breastfeeding Mothers' Support Group Singapore this year, Mr Ng said in Parliament on Tuesday (Aug 2) that eight in 10 working mothers said one of the things they need most is a lactation room. The same survey found that the challenges of expressing milk at work is one of the top three reasons why mothers stop breastfeeding. In his adjournment motion, Mr Ng said: ""Dedicated lactation rooms are the best way to facilitate breastfeeding. Today, too many mothers are forced to use undignified spaces like toilets or storerooms. Such mixed-use spaces are often dirty or disruptive, and the stress can block mothers from expressing milk."" Currently, the Ministry of National Development requires one lactation room for buildings with a gross floor area of 10,000 sq m or more. Mr Ng proposed that the Government lower this threshold so that more buildings are required to have such a room. Larger buildings with a higher gross floor area should also have more than one lactation room, he said. He also proposed that lactation breaks be legislated. Two-thirds of working mothers in the survey he referred to said they do not have time at work to express milk. On average, a session of expressing milk takes 20 to 30 minutes. Singapore is among the minority of countries that do not provide paid lactation breaks, he said, citing a 2020 report by the International Baby Food Action Network on 97 countries that found that 73 per cent of them had laws for such breaks. ""Legislating paid lactation breaks can spark a broader conversation about how expressing milk can be normalised and supported at the workplace,"" he said, and it is not mutually exclusive with building trust and encouraging employers. While some might say that flexible work arrangements help breastfeeding mothers, working from home is not an option for everyone, and many mothers have returned to offices in recent months, he added. Acknowledging the progress made over the years, Mr Ng said various ministries and organisations have done more to support breastfeeding mothers at the workplace. He noted that based on local studies, the rate of exclusive breastfeeding for at least six months has grown from 1 per cent in 2011 to 38.2 per cent in 2019. Still, 20 per cent of women of working age are not in the labour force, he said, and more can be done to ease the transition for those who are breastfeeding back to the workforce. A more inclusive workplace with greater support for this group of mothers might make it easier for them to re-enter or remain in work, he added. In response, Second Minister for National Development Indranee Rajah said building requirements for lactation rooms have expanded over the years, as a result of regular reviews of the Code on Accessibility in the Built Environment. The last review that led to the latest lactation room requirement in 2020 took two years and was carried out by a committee, which had considered that the demand for such facilities will vary depending on each building's user profile, she said. ""For example, the premises of a company that employs more women of child-bearing age will need to have more lactation facilities. On the other hand, it may be impractical for a small building to have a room permanently set aside for lactation due to space constraints."" The committee thus had to strike a balance between the need for such facilities and the buildings' constraints, especially with older and smaller buildings, said Ms Indranee, adding that Mr Ng's feedback will be taken into consideration for the code's next review which starts next year. She said the Building and Construction Authority has extended its Accessibility Fund in August to all buildings built between 1990 and 2014, which was when requirements for family-friendly features were first introduced. Under this fund, building owners who wish to retrofit their buildings with such facilities can get co-funding of up to 60 per cent of the construction cost. Ms Indranee said it is in employers' interests to take care of the needs of their employees, including nursing mothers, as this improves staff retention and morale. ""It is also important that co-workers support one another, especially through difficult periods such as when mothers return to work,"" she said. Fostering a more inclusive work culture will require mindset shifts and support from colleagues, supervisors and the wider community, she added."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/no-changes-to-cpf-interest-rates-tan-see-leng,No change to CPF interest rates: Tan See Leng,"SINGAPORE - There is no change to the interest rates being paid out to Central Provident Fund (CPF) members, given that the current bank interest rates continue to be below the effective CPF floor rates, said Manpower Minister Tan See Leng in Parliament on Tuesday (Aug 2). Responding to MPs' queries on whether CPF will increase its interest rate for the next few years to compensate for the high inflation rate environment, Dr Tan noted that the three-month average interest rate of three major local banks continues to be at around 0.09 per cent according to CPF's latest estimates, which is below the CPF Ordinary Accounts' (OA) interest rate of 2.5 per cent. Meanwhile, the interest rate for the Special, MediSave and Retirement Accounts (SMRA) is pegged to the 12-month average yield of 10-year Singapore Government Securities plus 1 per cent. The peg was 2.72 per cent in May and around 3 per cent based on latest estimates, he said. ""As these are below the effective floor rates for these accounts, the interest rates for the OA and SMRA are maintained at 2.5 per cent and 4 per cent respectively,"" said Dr Tan. He was responding to queries on CPF interest rates posed by MPs Henry Kwek (Kebun Baru) and Louis Chua (Sengkang GRC). Asked how CPF computes its interest rates, Dr Tan said the rates are pegged to returns on investments of comparable risk and duration in the market. For instance, members' OA savings are in a liquid account that can be withdrawn at any time for home purchases, servicing mortgage loans and investments. ""The OA interest rate is pegged to the three-month average fixed deposit and savings rates of our three major local banks which are DBS, UOB and OCBC,"" he said. ""These three banks have a larger share of domestic deposits than other banks."" For SMRA accounts, Dr Tan said the Government has maintained a floor rate of 4 per cent since 2008. ""Despite the low interest rate environment since the global financial crisis, the Government has continued to pay generous interest rates due to the floor rates,"" Dr Tan said. ""If the pegged rates exceed the floor rates, members will correspondingly earn the higher interest rates on their CPF savings."" CPF will continue to periodically review its interest rates, he added. In September, the CPF Board will announce the interest rates effective for the last three months of this year. There is some time lag in CPF interest rate adjustments to avoid subjecting people to unnecessary fluctuations. Those with HDB concessionary loans who pay the prevailing OA interest rate plus 0.1 percentage point also benefit from the stability compared with market mortgage rates, he said. To help boost retirement savings, the Government will continue to pay 1 per cent of extra interest on the first $60,000 of members' combined CPF balances as well as an additional 1 per cent on the first $30,000 of post-55 members' combined CPF balances, he added. This means members below age 55 can earn up to 5 per cent, while members aged 55 and above can earn up to 6 per cent. People can also transfer their OA money to the Special or Retirement Account to earn the higher risk-free rate. In a follow-up question, Mr Chua asked if CPF would consider granting extra interest and noted that local banks have raised interest rates for their savings accounts, such as for DBS' Multiplier account. Dr Tan replied that the banks' interest rates and their fluctuations are ""very short-term volatile instruments"", while the CPF system takes a longer-term horizon to provide security in retirement with risk-free interest rates. ""The rates that are chosen are effective basic rates with no further conditions,"" Dr Tan said. On the other hand, banks' promotional deposit rates are contingent on customers providing fresh funds, reaching a minimum spend on credit cards or other criteria, and are valid only for a limited period for a limited amount of deposits. ""In other words, as financial advisers, it behoves us to to actually be very transparent to all of our clients that these benefits are not uniformly applicable to all balances of all the depositors,"" he said."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/ensure-guidelines-on-adequate-rest-for-nurses-are-followed-louis-ng,Ensure guidelines on adequate rest for nurses are followed: Louis Ng,"SINGAPORE - With more nurses resigning, there is a need to ensure local nurses are given enough rest, said Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC) on Tuesday (Aug 2). He was addressing Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Health Rahayu Mahzam in Parliament, following her statement on nurse welfare, attrition and salaries. In response, Ms Rahayu said the Ministry of Health (MOH) is rolling out ways to ensure that nurses, who are working in a challenging environment, have adequate rest. During her speech earlier, she said the attrition rate for both local and foreign nurses in public hospitals had hit a five-year high in 2021, with a rate of 7.4 per cent and 14.8 per cent respectively. She added duty rosters for nurses are planned in advance to ensure staff have adequate rest between shifts. Mr Ng asked Ms Rahayu to clarify what it means for a nurse to have adequate rest. He said: ""A lot of nurses are sharing they sometimes end the shift at 9pm or 10pm, and then they are back at work at 7am. And that really is insufficient rest for many of them."" Ms Rahayu replied that different healthcare clusters have different arrangements to ensure adequate rest for their nurses. These include being given rest time during their shifts, or guidelines stating nurses should not work beyond a certain number of consecutive days. She added: ""The reality on the ground is there are many challenges and these nurses work very hard. ""There are realities of their workplaces that require them to actually go beyond their call of duty. We really appreciate that and we know it's been challenging."" Mr Ng later replied: ""A lot of the foreign nurses are leaving, and that really puts a stress on the local nurses... ""We can rely on their passion, they're very passionate about (their jobs), but I think they're really urging for some protection, especially of their rest time... ""I ask whether MOH can at least ensure the guidelines on adequate rest for nurses are being adhered to at this point."" Ms Rahayu responded by highlighting the internal cross-cluster Staff Well-being Committee, which was formed in 2019 for healthcare clusters to share best practices with each other and provide feedback to MOH on how staff well-being could be improved. She said the committee had raised the issue of sufficient rest for nurses, and MOH is in the midst of rolling out some of its recommendations. Mr Ng also asked if the National Wellness Committee for Junior Doctors could look into the working hours and conditions of nurses. In response, Ms Rahayu said this committee was formed to specifically address issues related to junior doctors, which need to be tackled differently because of the doctors' regular rotations across the public healthcare system, compared with other staff groups who are employed directly by the respective public healthcare clusters. Citing several measures that have been taken, she highlighted that MOH and public healthcare clusters have always been concerned about the well-being of nurses and other staff groups. As the pandemic eases, public healthcare institutions have been allowing nurses to take time off work to rest and recover, and foreign nurses to return home to spend time with their loved ones, she added. In addition to the measures taken by MOH and the public healthcare institutions, Ms Rahayu said that patients' families also have a part to play in working together with the healthcare system to care for their loved ones who are ill. Without going into details, she said: ""There's a certain expectation of what nurses are expected to do in hospitals. This does not help in terms of adding to their workloads. The culture may be different elsewhere, and we may want to educate and look into this matter."" She also said a task force is looking at tackling the abuse of healthcare workers. Ms Rahayu added: ""Give us some time to roll out some of the recommendations that have been put up, (and) hopefully through all these efforts we're putting up, there's improvement."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/changi-airport-leading-recovery-within-asia-pacific-focus-now-on-ramping-up-capacity-iswaran,Changi Airport leading recovery within Asia-Pacific; focus now on ramping up capacity,"SINGAPORE - Changi Airport is leading the post-pandemic recovery within the Asia-Pacific region, with weekly passenger traffic hitting 55 per cent of pre-Covid-19 levels in the first week of last month (July). There are also passenger flights connecting to 108 cities as at last month - close to two-thirds of the connections that the airport had before the pandemic hit. This puts Changi ahead of major air hubs in the region, such as Incheon (Seoul), Hong Kong and Bangkok, Transport Minister S. Iswaran told Parliament on Tuesday (Aug 2). But he also acknowledged that the pattern of recovery across the world has been uneven, and that airports in Europe, North America and the Middle East, where borders were reopened earlier, have bounced back more quickly. For instance, passenger traffic at air hubs in Dubai, Doha and Istanbul exceeded 90 per cent of their pre-pandemic levels even before June, and connectivity at these airports is back to 90 per cent of 2019 levels, or more, Mr Iswaran added. While the initial target of restoring air travel in Singapore to 50 per cent of pre-Covid-19 levels by the end of the year has been ""well and truly met"", the minister said the focus now is on ramping up capacity at Changi to meet future demand, especially during the year-end peak travel season. He was responding to Workers' Party MP Louis Chua (Sengkang GRC), who had asked whether the authorities would be revising their 2022 and 2023 passenger traffic targets in the light of the recent recovery. Mr Iswaran said: ""It is difficult to set a target at this stage of our recovery for the total volume of passengers that can come in. And the reason is simply that source markets are at different stages of managing the recovery from Covid-19."" He added: ""Key markets like China, Japan and North-east Asia in general are still working their way through, and we are not sure when exactly and how exactly they will make changes."" But Mr Iswaran also said that demand for air travel remains fundamentally strong, and he expects recovery at Changi Airport to gather pace when countries such as China and Japan fully reopen their borders. He added that Changi Airport Terminal 4 will reopen on Sept 13, and the southern wing of Terminal 2 will be opened for departure operations in October to ensure that the airport will be ready to manage the higher traveller flows. These moves will return the airport's handling capacity to its pre-pandemic level of 70 million passengers a year. Efforts are also ongoing to build up manpower at the airport and ""restore the traveller experience that Changi is renowned for"", Mr Iswaran said. He said the aviation sector had lost a third of its workforce on account of Covid-19, and that recovering from that is a major challenge - both in terms of recruitment and getting new workers ready for operations. Manpower woes have plagued some of the world's busiest airports, resulting in cancelled flights, lost baggage and other disruptions. Last month, Heathrow Airport in London set a limit of 100,000 daily departing passengers and asked airlines to stop selling tickets for summer flights, blaming a lack of airline ground handlers for the chaos. Said Mr Iswaran: ""One only has to consider the experience in many other airports around the world to appreciate the enormity of the task."" In June, Changi Airport handled 2.93 million passengers, slightly more than half of June 2019 levels. In contrast, Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok handled 1.4 million international passengers in June, 35 per cent of 2019 levels, and Incheon Airport handled 1.3 million international passengers, or 21 per cent of pre-pandemic levels."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/national-flag-may-be-displayed-more-often-max-penalty-for-misuse-increased-to-30k,National flag may be displayed more often; penalty for misuse increased to $30k,"SINGAPORE - The Singapore flag may soon be displayed more often instead of just during the National Day period, under proposed changes to the law tabled in Parliament on Tuesday (Aug 2). Meanwhile, the maximum penalties for misuse of national symbols may also be increased - from the current $1,000 to $30,000, and six months' jail - to safeguard against disrespectful use. The National Symbols Bill introduced on Tuesday by Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth Low Yen Ling will, if passed into law, replace the existing Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem (Safna) Act. The Safna Act currently covers only the state crest, national flag and national anthem, while the new Bill will give formal statutory recognition to national symbols introduced after 1959: the pledge, public seal, lion head symbol and national flower. Under the proposed law, the presidential crest, presidential standard and presidential seal will be formally recognised as presidential symbols. The Bill also provides for a prescribed person - such as the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth - to permit or prohibit the use of national symbols under the regulations. For example, the minister can make an exception to allow the display of the national flag outside the usual National Day period of July to September. Under the existing Safna Act and its rules, any changes to the display period requires the law to be amended. This change is in response to growing calls from the public to allow the flying of the national flag outside the National Day period during significant occasions such as the Olympics as a way to express national pride and solidarity, said the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY). This was echoed by the Citizens' Workgroup for National Symbols, an engagement exercise convened by the ministry from January to April 2021. The workgroup, which comprised of 47 Singaporeans, discussed how to strengthen Singaporeans' connections with their national symbols and also explored the possibility of new national symbols. MCCY had also conducted a public consultation through government feedback unit Reach from June 13 to July 8 this year on the proposed National Symbols Regulations to replace Safna. Feedback and suggestions were taken into consideration for the Bill. In parallel with moves to provide more flexibility in the use of national symbols, the Bill also provides for harsher penalties for their misuse. Under the Bill, offenders may be fined up to $30,000 or jailed for up to six months, or both. Under the Safna Act, the current penalty is a fine of up to $1,000 - set in 1959 when the first national symbols were introduced. MCCY added that the new penalty is similar to existing penalties for defacing a national monument under the Preservation of Monuments Act 2009. The ministry said it will continue to raise public awareness of appropriate use, including issuing clear guidelines on usage of the symbols."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/spore-stepping-up-efforts-to-tackle-heat-as-temperatures-could-hit-40-deg-c-by-2045,S'pore stepping up efforts to tackle heat as temperatures could hit 40 deg C by 2045,"SINGAPORE - By 2045, temperatures in Singapore could hit 40 deg C on some days due to a warming planet, compounded by the urban environment releasing trapped heat from buildings, roads and vehicles. But the Republic is bracing itself for rising temperatures in three ways: further understanding how intense heat will impact the country and its people, reviewing efforts to strengthen people's resilience to heat, and coming up with effective cooling strategies. These three prongs were laid out by Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu in Parliament on Tuesday (Aug 2), in response to questions about how Singapore is preparing for rising temperatures. Ms Fu said while the country does not experience extreme temperatures felt by temperate regions, Singapore is affected by climate phenomena, such as El Nino, that is likely to be worsened by climate change. El Nino is an abnormal warming of sea surface temperatures in the central equatorial Pacific Ocean. It typically causes drier and warmer conditions across South-east Asia. The National Environment Agency's Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS) has been working to localise global climate projections. Those projections are being reviewed and will be updated in the third national climate change study that will be released next year. Ms Fu added that the projections are shaped based on three carbon emission scenarios: business-as-usual, a scenario where the nation is taking good steps to mitigate emissions, and the worst-case scenario where fossil fuels continue to be harnessed. Researchers are also studying the factors that contribute to urban heat and are testing different cooling strategies, which include planting more greenery in urban areas and using cooling materials and paint on buildings, the minister said. The need to adapt to a warmer world has become more urgent given the pace of climate change globally, with concerns on how higher temperatures affect people, especially the elderly, those who live in less ventilated conditions, and those who work outdoors. April and May this year have seen some of the highest temperatures recorded in Singapore. CCRS has also projected that climate change would lead to average temperatures rising by 1.4 deg C to 4.6 deg C by the end of the century. Ms Fu also noted that the past decade between 2012 and 2021 was Singapore's warmest on record. Globally, record heatwaves have baked India, Pakistan and Europe, killing thousands and sparking wildfires. Ms Fu said: ""These heatwaves are increasing in frequency and intensity worldwide as a result of climate change, and portends the severe consequences we would face if we do not take significant steps today. ""Although Singapore has so far not faced heat crises on the same scale as other countries, it would not be possible to avoid the rise in temperatures due to global warming."" She outlined how scientists here are building a digital model to simulate Singapore's urban climate - to find out how heat affects different parts of Singapore and to identify cost-effective heat mitigation methods. Workers' Party MP He Ting Ru (Sengkang GRC) and Nominated MP Koh Lian Pin had asked about the measures being taken to reduce heat stress among the vulnerable groups, including the elderly and lower-income groups, and whether workplace guidelines on managing heat stress were regularly updated. In response, Ms Fu said the Health Ministry and Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment are studying how heat stress could affect the population, including at-risk outdoor workers and seniors. These include inter-agency work groups to study how intense heat will affect people's health. The Workplace Safety and Health Council also works closely with other ministries to ensure that workplace guidelines are regularly updated based on the latest scientific evidence. Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong GRC) also asked if Singapore's climate mitigation planning will consider low-probability, high-damage climate impacts. Examples include extreme rises in sea levels caused by the sudden collapse of major ice sheets, for instance, in West Antarctica. Responding to Dr Tan's question, Ms Fu said Singapore is constantly in discussion with scientists here and abroad on low-probability, high-impact climate events. ""While our long-term planning does not have these impact events in mind, we are always constantly looking for inputs, and they will always shape our planning parameters,"" she added."

This is up from about one in 20 in the early 2000s, with PRs and new citizens forming an increasing proportion of enlistees over the years, he added. He said: ""Without that extra inject of new citizens and PRs, our smaller birth cohorts would have impacted Singapore Armed Forces' (SAF) manpower needs more acutely."" Of the enlistees who are new citizens or PRs, slightly more than half belong to the former category while the rest are PRs, Dr Ng told Parliament in response to statements about national service (NS) exemptions for new citizens made by Non-Constituency MP Leong Mun Wai. Dr Ng said: ""I have decided that it is important to correct the misleading statements put out by Mr Leong, because they strike at the foundations of equity and universality that underpin NS in Singapore."" The minister cited a Facebook post that Mr Leong had made on SAF Day (July 1), where he said it is only fair that all PRs who want to become citizens must do NS. In the post, Mr Leong also argued that Singapore should allow easier deferment or even exemption from NS for talented individuals. He said: ""Is it fair that we forfeit our local talents their chances of developing their talents while many new male citizens do not need to do NS?"" Referring to this statement and others Mr Leong had made over the last year, Dr Ng said the facts must be put out to reassure the national servicemen in the SAF and Home Team. He said: ""If pre-enlistees are misled into thinking that new citizens of their age are exempted, where will they have the heart to serve NS?"" Many new citizens are enlisted for NS every year, Dr Ng added, and new citizens and PRs are contributing to national defence. He said NS is the bedrock of the SAF and Singapore's national defence. ""MPs have the duty to ask questions and debate policies, including NS policies, in this House. But they should not make misleading statements that can weaken NS, the SAF and Home Team."" Dr Ng added that there should be no doubt that for every young male citizen, whether by birth, registration or descent, NS liabilities are the same. He said they will be enlisted for NS at 18 years or older to perform full-time NS and thereafter must fulfil their Operationally Ready NS duties. In a separate written response to Mr Leong, Dr Ng said that in 2021, 9 per cent of NSFs enlisted were PRs. This has grown from about 1 per cent in the early 2000s, he said.  He added that if a foreigner comes to Singapore and becomes a citizen as a mature adult, typically in his 30s or 40s, he is exempt from NS as he did not enjoy any socio-economic benefits like young Singaporeans did, and also because he would be too old to enlist for full-time NS. After Dr Ng spoke, Mr Leong took the floor to register an objection and seek clarifications. He objected to not being allowed a speech in response to Dr Ng, adding that the minister had made several accusations against him. Mr Leong went on but was reminded by Deputy Speaker of Parliament Jessica Tan that he was allowed only to ask for clarifications and not make statements - as per Parliament’s standing orders for ministerial statements. He then said the minister had not answered his question on the number of new citizens who were not required to serve NS. Mr Leong said: ""What is the number or the number of new citizens who have not performed NS? The number the minister has given only forms a subset of the new citizens."" Dr Ng reiterated that an average of 3,400 new citizens serve or will serve NS each year - a figure that the Defence Ministry had given Mr Leong in July - and said he had already answered Mr Leong's question. ""It's not in the interest of this House to further debate based on misleading statements and inaccurate statements,"" said Dr Ng. He added that he had given Mr Leong the full facts, and that the facts speak for themselves. On Monday, Dr Ng said there were about 60,000 new citizens who sponsored their children for Singapore citizenship or PR between 2000 and 2021.
 
In a written reply to a question from Mr Leong, Dr Ng added that among the male children who were below 18 at the point they were sponsored, around 3 per cent were exempted from NS for reasons such as being medically unfit. This mirrored the overall exemption rates for each enlistment cohort, he said. "

He was responding to a question in Parliament posed by Nominated Member of Parliament Koh Lian Pin on an update on the progress and impact of the initiative to plant more trees in industrial estates to create a better work environment. Studies have also shown that intensified tree planting in Singapore can reduce midday temperatures in the surrounding area by up to 0.9 deg C. Data has shown that 2012 to 2021 was the warmest decade on record. The Centre for Climate Research Singapore has projected that climate change would lead to average temperatures rising by 1.4 deg C to 4.6 deg C by the end of the century. ""We will continue planting more trees across Singapore under the OneMillionTrees movement, to mitigate the effects of climate change and provide Singaporeans with a more liveable and sustainable environment,"" he said. The OneMillionTrees movement refers to the national initiative to plant one million trees from 2020 to 2030. Mr Tan added that studies are currently being done in collaboration with institutes of higher learning to examine the different tree species and planting configurations that could maximise their cooling effects. An islandwide network of sensors will also be deployed to monitor the cooling effects of Singapore's tree-planting efforts, he noted. The data collected will support microclimatic research in Singapore and help the National Parks Board (NParks) develop better greening strategies to cool the nation. To mitigate heat in people's homes and residential areas, the Housing Development Board (HDB) has embarked on various measures to optimise comfort for residents, said Mr Tan. For example, HDB buildings are predominantly oriented north-south to reduce heat gain, he noted. ""For new towns and estates, HDB conducts environmental modelling to site new flats, design building facades, and refine building layouts to harness existing wind corridors and optimise wind flow,"" said Mr Tan. HDB is also conducting a pilot study on cool paint which could absorb less heat and reduce the ambient temperature of HDB blocks for existing towns, he added. Past trials have shown a reduction of ambient temperatures by up to 2 deg C, with the pilot expected to be completed in 2024, said Mr Tan. Based on the study outcomes, HDB will consider extending the use of cool paint to more estates. Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC) noted that HDB flats currently have full glass windows that emit a considerable amount of heat in the late afternoon, and asked if HDB would look into installing low-heat double-glazed windows for Build-to-Order flats, and flats eligible for the Home Improvement Programme. In response, Mr Tan said that HDB would take these suggestions into consideration."

He touched upon the limitations of the current arrangement, the changing environment, and Singapore's growing capabilities and ambition as factors the Government considered when it decided to terminate the relationship."

In a written reply to a parliamentary question on Monday (Aug 1), Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said: ""In general, the Singapore Government does not accord privileges, immunity and hospitality to former heads of state or heads of government. ""Consequently, former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa was not accorded any privileges, immunity or hospitality."" Mr Rajapaksa landed in Singapore on July 14 on a Saudia flight from the Maldives and was issued a 14-day visit pass. His visit pass was later extended by another 14 days and will expire on Aug 11. He had fled Sri Lanka amid a deepening economic crisis and widespread protests against his government as soaring inflation affected the prices of basic necessities such as food and fuel. Shortly after he arrived in Singapore, Mr Rajapaksa tendered his resignation, which was officially announced by the Sri Lanka Parliament on July 15. His ally and former prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was voted in by lawmakers as the new president on July 20. The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) said in response to media queries last week that visitors from Sri Lanka who enter Singapore for social visits will generally be issued with a short-term visit pass with a duration of up to 30 days. Those who need to extend their stay here may apply online for an extension and applications will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, added ICA."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/about-10000-applications-a-year-for-special-approval-for-higher-childcare-infant-care-subsidies,"About 10,000 applications a year for Special Approval for higher childcare, infant care subsidies","SINGAPORE - There are about 10,000 applications a year for child and infant care subsidies under the Special Approval scheme, where successful applicants - who are not working - get the higher subsidy given to working mothers. About 95 per cent of these applications are approved, Minister for Social and Family Development Masagos Zulkifli said in a written reply to a parliamentary question by Workers' Party MP He Ting Ru (Sengkang GRC) about the scheme on Monday (Aug 1). Working mothers get a basic childcare subsidy of $300 per month and additional subsidies that are means tested, while non-working mothers get $150 in their basic subsidy a month. The applicants under the Special Approval scheme are not working due to factors such as illness, seeking employment or caring for another person. But even if they are not working, successful applicants get the same subsidy given to working mothers. Mr Masagos also said that since August 2020, families receiving financial aid from the Government's ComCare scheme or those living in highly subsidised Housing Board rental flats are automatically eligible for the maximum pre-school subsidy until the next time their application is assessed, regardless of whether the mother is working. Workers' Party MP Jamus Lim (Sengkang GRC) asked the Ministry of Social and Family Development how it determines the duration of aid given to those on the ComCare scheme. Mr Masagos said that for short-to-medium term assistance, it is typically given for three to six months in the first instance, with the aid renewed if it is deemed that the family continue to require support. ""If a person is temporarily unable to work for an even longer period due to illness, we will grant the support for the duration of their medical certificate,"" he added. The Social Service Offices (SSOs), which administer the ComCare schemes, decide on the duration of aid to be given based on their assessment of how long the family require help to stabilise their circumstances and also the likelihood of their circumstances improving. When applicants apply to renew their short-to-medium term assistance, the SSOs will consider their most recent circumstances and decide whether to raise or reduce the financial aid given."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/ceos-and-directors-face-prosecution-for-workplace-safety-lapses-if-they-are-culpable-zaqy,CEOs and directors face prosecution for workplace safety lapses if they are culpable: Zaqy,"SINGAPORE - Company leaders can and will be prosecuted if they are culpable for workplace safety and health (WSH) lapses, and compliance with an upcoming code of practice outlining their duties will be considered by the courts in the event of an offence. Senior Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad said on Monday (Aug 1) that the Approved Code of Practice (ACOP) for Company Directors' WSH Duties will be published later this year, with public consultations set to begin this month. ""We are putting managements and boards on notice that the ACOP is coming,"" he told Parliament in response to a speech by Mr Melvin Yong (Radin Mas). The authorities are also reviewing whether to expand the requirement for WSH personnel to more workplaces, Mr Zaqy added. In his speech, Mr Yong had called for more action to beef up workplace safety in the light of an alarming rise in workplace fatalities and injuries post-Covid-19. There have been 31 work-related deaths so far this year, the most over the same period since 2016 and more than the 30 deaths recorded in the whole of 2020. Mr Yong had asked whether the upcoming code of practice could be written into law to give it ""legislative teeth"". He cited an Australian case where two recycling company directors were jailed after a worker was killed by a forklift, and noted that it is a legal requirement there for company directors and business owners to ensure their employees' safety. Mr Yong also noted that Sweden requires every company, regardless of size and industry, to have a WSH representative. ""In Singapore, where we pride ourselves on being efficient and attentive in all that we do, we certainly need to do more, and do better,"" the labour MP said. He acknowledged that some steps have been taken to curb the rising number of workplace deaths, but ""the Government's actions alone are not enough"". Noting that a factor behind the recent spate of accidents has been the rush to catch up on work, he called for minimum rest hours for workers in higher-risk sectors to be legislated. ""If employers are pushing our workers to - quite literally work towards their deaths - then we must surely act to stop this,"" Mr Yong said. He also called for better whistle-blowing channels to make the reporting of near-misses more prevalent, and suggested that the public be allowed to use the OneService application to report unsafe work practices. WSH training should also be made mandatory for workers in high-risk sectors, he added. Agreeing broadly, Mr Zaqy said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) is extremely concerned about the recent spate of workplace fatalities, and that its analysis of recent fatal accidents showed that many companies did not conduct risk assessments or follow safe work procedures. ""This is disturbing - simple and totally avoidable mistakes that resulted in loss of lives,"" he added. He said MOM takes every report it receives on safety lapses seriously, and that there are safeguards to protect workers who report breaches. The ministry received 2,300 reports over the past year, and 62 per cent of follow-up inspections led to enforcement action, he added. On more ways for the public to report unsafe practices, Mr Zaqy said MOM is looking at adding such a function to another government app but he did not give specifics. He agreed that fatigue could contribute to accidents, but noted that there are already protections under the Employment Act spelling out the maximum hours an employee can work, including overtime. On training, he said management and supervisors are already required to attend courses on risk management as part of the bizSAFE programme. The WSH Council is also working with the National Trades Union Congress to develop modules for worker refresher training, and there are plans to expand this to supervisors and management, he added. Despite the recent setback, Mr Zaqy said the goal to reduce the workplace fatality rate here to less than one per 100,000 workers by 2028 still stands. Singapore can and should be held to higher standards given its stage of development, he said. ""We must take important lessons from this episode to build a safety culture that will endure for years to come,"" he said."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/parliament-passes-bill-to-set-up-public-defenders-office,Parliament passes Bill to set up Public Defender's Office,"SINGAPORE - The way has been paved for a Public Defender's Office (PDO) to be set up by year end, after Parliament on Monday (Aug 1) passed a Bill to establish it to provide criminal legal aid to the needy. Under the scheme, Singaporeans and permanent residents who are facing criminal charges but cannot afford a lawyer can have a full-time public defender represent them in court, if they pass a means test and a merits test. Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Law Rahayu Mahzam said in her speech that the exact means test criteria will comprise two components - income and wealth - and will be laid out in subsidiary legislation. The income criterion is the monthly per capita household income threshold of up to $1,500, or around the 35th percentile of resident households by income. This is an increase from the coverage of around the 25th percentile of households, under the existing Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (Clas), which is run by the Law Society Pro Bono Services and funded by the Government and private donations. It is the equivalent of people whose monthly per capita household income is less than $950. The wealth component looks at an applicant's savings, assets and investments. Even if an applicant does not satisfy the means test criteria, the Law Minister can direct the Chief Public Defender to grant aid if the minister is of the opinion that it is just and proper to do so, said Ms Rahayu. ""This gives leeway to provide aid to those who do not satisfy the means test criteria, but are unable to afford legal services due to extenuating circumstances. ""For example, an applicant may be battling an illness, or may have to care for an incapacitated family member. We will consider all relevant circumstances in the grant of aid,"" she added. In April, Law Minister K. Shanmugam announced the move to set up the fully government-funded PDO, marking a significant shift in the Government's policy on criminal legal aid. The move followed a fundamental shift in 2015, when the Government started funding Clas. The Public Defenders Bill that was passed on Monday provides for the appointment of the Chief Public Defender and public defenders, the scope of criminal defence aid, the administration of aid and a penalty framework to deter abuse. Ms Rahayu told the House that the establishment of a criminal defence aid scheme, to be administered by the PDO, came after at least 10 consultations with the Law Society and Criminal Bar over the last two years. She noted that the previous view taken by the Government was that the State should not be paying to defend accused people. ""For a long time, the balance has been struck against providing representation,"" she said. ""This is a question of judgment, and our view is that the right balance was struck at that time. However, in today's Singapore, we think that the balance has shifted."" The PDO, which will be set up as a department under the Law Ministry, will provide aid to eligible people charged with all non-capital offences with specific exceptions. Regulatory offences such as traffic summonses and minor statutory board charges, as well as 10 specific Acts, are excluded. For the merits test, aid can be granted where the applicant requires legal representation to plead guilty, or there are reasonable grounds for defence, said Ms Rahayu. In cases where legal aid is required urgently, applicants can be issued with a provisional grant of aid. ""This ensures that no deserving applicant will be denied aid while waiting for the means and merits tests to be completed,"" she added. And in cases where multiple accused persons qualify for aid, the PDO will represent only one person, to prevent any potential or perceived conflicts of interest. Ms Rahayu said the Chief Public Defender will decide which accused person will be represented by the PDO, and the others may be referred to Clas. Applicants will be required to co-pay the costs of legal aid, to ensure that they contribute towards their defence and do not abuse the system. ""The less they have, the less they pay, and vice versa. Those with very little savings and investments may even pay nothing,"" she added. And those who abuse the system by making false or misleading statements about their means can face a maximum fine of $5,000 or a maximum jail term of six months. Twelve MPs rose to speak in support of the Bill. They also raised concerns about the independence of the PDO, funding, the quality of public defenders and the scope of offences covered. Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied GRC) concluded in her speech: “This Bill represents an important milestone for Singapore’s criminal justice system. “The PD scheme has the potential to go some way towards addressing the imbalance of power and resources between the state prosecution and an accused person. For that alone, I welcome this development.”

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/new-amendment-will-allow-police-to-collect-dna-samples-in-wider-array-of-crimes,New amendment will allow police to collect DNA samples in wider array of crimes,"SINGAPORE - The police could soon collect DNA, such as blood samples, saliva and hair follicles, from individuals involved in a wider scope of crimes, including mischief, obscene acts and drink driving. The enhanced collection of information from suspects, which was one of the main amendments in the Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill introduced in Parliament on Monday (Aug 1), will provide the authorities with larger databases to compare samples from crime scenes. Currently, the police can collect non-DNA identifying information like photographs and fingerprints as well as DNA information only for registrable crimes, which are serious crimes that lead to a criminal record for convicted individuals. As a result, the current DNA database is small and limits the police's ability to solve crimes, especially in cases with very few leads, said the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). With the amendments, the police will be allowed to collect DNA information for registrable crimes and eligible crimes. In the context of the Bill, eligible crimes, such as voluntarily causing hurt, unlawful stalking and affray, are crimes which are imprisonable. Such crimes are non-compoundable, which means offenders are not eligible for the option of settling the case out of court by paying a compensation in lieu of punishment and a criminal record. A new offence will also be introduced for accused individuals who refuse to provide blood samples without a reasonable excuse. They may be fined up to $1,000, jailed for up to one month, or both. A key amendment in the Bill includes allowing any individual to provide his DNA or non-DNA identifying information voluntarily to the police. Volunteers can request the police to delete their information at any time, and the police must accede to their request. Currently, only individuals who are present at the crime scene or questioned in investigations can voluntarily provide their DNA to the police. MHA also tabled several other amendments in the Registration of Criminals (Amendment) Bill that will allow for law enforcement agencies to carry out their duties more effectively and to safeguard personal data. These include:"
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/mas-contributions-to-government-budget-not-affected-by-recorded-loss-dpm-wong,MAS’ contributions to Govt budget under NIR framework not affected by recorded loss: DPM Wong,"SINGAPORE - The $7.4 billion loss reported by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in the last financial year has limited impact on the funds available for the Government's Budget, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong told Parliament on Monday (Aug 1). This is because the Net Investment Returns (NIR) framework by which the three Singapore investment entities contribute a share of their gains to the annual Budget is based on their long-term expected returns, and is not affected by their short-term performance, he said. Under this framework, the Government can spend up to 50 per cent of the expected long-term real return on the net assets invested by MAS, GIC and Temasek. ""The NIR framework is designed to provide a steady, sustainable stream of income to help meet the government's expenditure needs,"" Mr Wong said. ""Investment returns are inherently volatile, reflecting market conditions. The Government has taken steps to ensure that this volatility does not unduly affect the Budget."" ""It is neither responsible nor prudent for us to rely on windfall surpluses in any given year to fund our increased structural spending needs,"" he added. Mr Wong, who is also deputy chairman of the MAS, was responding to questions from MPs Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang), Ang Wei Neng (West Coast GRC) and Vikram Nair (Sembawang GRC) on MAS' net loss of $7.4 billion for financial year 2021/2022. His clarification follows the central bank's annual review two weeks ago when it said the loss for the last financial year which ended in March was largely due to a negative foreign exchange translation effect, due to a stronger Singdollar. Mr Wong said that, even though MAS recorded a net loss for the last financial year, it will also contribute $1.1 billion to the Government as a statutory board, because it recorded net profits in the two years before that. ""In the case of MAS, the Government recognises that its contributions will vary considerably from year to year due to the combined effect of currency translation and investment returns on MAS' balance sheet. ""This is why, since FY2019, the Government has smoothened the revenue volatility by requiring the annual contributions made by MAS to be paid in equal proportions over a period of three years,"" said Mr Wong. He noted that the smoothening formula has helped to mitigate the impact of MAS' net loss on the Government's budget. As for the negative currency translation effect, Mr Wong said it comes from translating the foreign currency value of the Official Foreign Reserves (OFR) into Singapore dollars for reporting purposes. In financial year 2021/22, MAS made investment gains of S$4 billion on the OFR. But these were outweighed by the negative currency translation effects of $8.7 billion arising from a stronger Singdollar as MAS tightened monetary policy in October last year  and January this year, resulting in a currency translation loss. The purpose of the OFR is to safeguard the international purchasing power of the Singdollar, so it is the foreign currency value rather than the Singdollar value of the OFR that matters, he noted. ""The negative currency translation effect is not relevant to MAS' investment performance, which is measured in foreign currencies. It also has no bearing on the international purchasing power of the OFR, or on MAS' conduct of monetary policy,"" he said. In the past 10 months, the Singdollar has been strengthened four times as part of MAS' moves to tackle inflation. MAS conducts an exchange rate-centred monetary policy. This means it manages the Singdollar against a basket of foreign currencies of Singapore's major trading partners. When inflationary pressures build up, MAS allows the trade-weighted exchange rate to appreciate faster. ""Negative currency translation effects do not have any bearing on MAS' ability to manage the exchange rate; rather, they are a consequence of MAS' conduct of exchange rate policy,"" Mr Wong said. Asked by Mr Liang about the impact of rising interest rates, Mr Wong said perhaps MAS might need to spend more when it needs to borrow as part of money market operations to manage banking system liquidity. But in the medium term, rising interest rates will also help to raise investment income from foreign asset holdings. Mr Wong added that taking both factors into consideration, MAS should be able to manage the effects of rising interest rates on its financials. Correction note: An earlier version of this article reported that Mr Wong said MAS might need to spend more than it needs to borrow as part of money market operations. This version has been amended to reflect that Mr Wong said MAS might need to spend more when it needs to borrow as part of money market operations."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/debt-collection-companies-set-to-be-licensed-following-rising-public-concerns,Debt collection companies set to be licensed following rising public concerns,"SINGAPORE - Debt collection companies could soon be required to apply for a licence to carry out debt collection activities and will be held accountable for the conduct of their employees. This licensing regime was one of the key provisions of the Debt Collection Bill introduced in Parliament on Monday (Aug 1) to regulate debt collection activities in Singapore and curb problematic debt collection practices following a rise in complaints from the public. Unlicensed debt collection activities will be criminalised with penalties including fines and a jail term of up to five years should the Bill be passed, while a firm that breaches licensing conditions may have their license suspended or revoked. Anyone who wants to become a debt collector for a debt collection company will also have to put a joint application with their employer, and be subject to screening by the police. Approvals can be rescinded if the debt collector breaks the law. Currently, there are no regulations that deal specifically with what debt collectors can or cannot do. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said on Monday that the Bill comes as a high number of police reports were lodged in recent years against debt collection companies and their debt collectors for causing alarm and nuisance to the public. A total of 134 police reports were made in 2015, increasing over the years to a peak of 590 in 2018, said the ministry. There were 272 reports made against these companies and their staff last year. While there was a drop in reports made in 2020 and last year that could be due to Covid-19 related restrictions, the number of reports has remained high, said an MHA spokesman in response to queries from The Straits Times. ""In view of the increasing public concerns, MHA will institute regulations to better manage the disamenities arising from such activities,"" said the ministry. It also took into consideration the feedback provided through a public consultation exercise held in June. The Bill defines debt collection activity to mean any activity carried out in Singapore that involves finding the debtor of a debt, or requesting, demanding or collecting from the debtor money due under the debt. Under the licensing regime, debt collection companies must be assessed by the police, who will take into consideration past offences committed by the companies, such as those under the Organised Crime Act and the Vandalism Act. Individuals collecting personal loans owed to them, and in-house credit control departments collecting debts owed to its company do not fall within the scope of regulation. A class licensing regime will also be introduced for regulated businesses which are primarily in the lending and collecting of monies owed to their business. This includes banks, finance companies, and licensed moneylenders. This will allow the police to impose regulatory conditions on these lower risk groups while minimising compliance costs, said MHA. The Bill is expected to be passed before the end of this year and to take effect between mid-2023 and the first half of 2024."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/seniors-no-longer-eligible-for-silver-support-scheme-will-receive-2-payments-to-ease-transition,Seniors no longer eligible for Silver Support Scheme will receive 2 payments to ease transition,"SINGAPORE - Senior citizens who are no longer eligible for the Silver Support Scheme will receive two smaller payments over two quarters to ease their transition out of the scheme, said Manpower Minister Tan See Leng on Monday (Aug 1). Additionally, those who no longer qualify for the scheme in the following year will be notified the December before, he said. The amount for each stepped-down payment would be half of what the seniors had last received when eligible for the scheme. All seniors who have become ineligible will receive the two smaller payments, said a Ministry of Manpower spokesman. Dr Tan was responding to a question in Parliament from Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang) about support for seniors who may have been dependent on the payouts originally but had become ineligible. The scheme, introduced in 2016, provides quarterly cash support to seniors who had lower incomes during their working years and now have little or no family support in their retirement. It was enhanced last year with an increase in the payout quantum and eligibility criteria. The number of recipients has increased from one in five seniors in 2020 - about 150,000 seniors - to one in three seniors this year, or about 250,000 seniors. As a result, Silver Support payouts have nearly doubled from $330 million in 2020 to $600 million per year today, said Dr Tan. Mr Liang had also asked if the ministry would consider reviewing the scheme to assist more seniors, and if communication on the scheme criteria could be improved. Dr Tan replied that the Central Provident Fund (CPF) board automatically reviews the eligibility of senior citizens for the scheme every year, and that payouts are directly credited into their registered bank account or to their registered address by cheque. One reason that a recipient becomes ineligible could be that their household monthly income per person has increased, he added. This is a broad indicator of the level of household support that is available to the senior. ""In many of these circumstances, the seniors' financial situations have actually improved,"" he said. Recipient who are unable to transition appropriately as they exit the scheme can appeal to the CPF board, which is prepared to consider each appeal, said Dr Tan."

Madam Halimah and the congressional delegation affirmed the excellent and longstanding partnership between Singapore and the United States, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said. Madam Halimah said in a Facebook post after their meeting at the Istana: ""We discussed ways to deepen educational and people-to-people ties between our two countries, and welcomed cooperation in new and forward-looking areas like climate change. We also exchanged views on fostering social cohesion and creating greater opportunities for women."" Singapore is the first stop of the congressional delegation's visit to the Indo-Pacific region this week. Mrs Pelosi had, in a statement on Sunday, said the visit - which will include stops in Malaysia, South Korea and Japan - aimed to reaffirm America's commitment to its allies and friends in the region. The delegation also met PM Lee and Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan at the Istana. PM Lee, who had met Mrs Pelosi in Washington in March and May, said in a Facebook post that he was glad to reciprocate her hospitality. He said he had a good meeting with the delegation, during which they discussed deepening the US’ economic engagement, including through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), as well as key issues such as Asean-US cooperation, cross-strait relations and climate change. “This is the first Codel (congressional delegation) to visit Singapore since the pandemic, and we value Congress’ strong support for our bilateral partnership with the US, and for a sustained US presence in the region,” he said. “I look forward to welcoming more Codels to Singapore."" During their meeting, both sides also affirmed the deep and multi-faceted partnership between Singapore and the US, underpinned by robust cooperation across the defence, security and economic spheres, said MFA. “PM welcomed the commitment expressed by the congressional delegation for strong US engagement of the region,” added MFA. PM Lee and the delegation also exchanged views on key international and regional developments, including the war in Ukraine, cross-strait relations and climate change, the ministry said. MFA added: “PM Lee highlighted the importance of stable US-China relations for regional peace and security.” Singapore was among 12 countries at the virtual launch of the IPEF, a US-led initiative to strengthen economic cooperation with the region, in May. The Republic is also a major security cooperation partner of the US, the only country to have that designation. On Monday, the congressional delegation also had meetings with Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong, Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean, and Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for Social Policies Tharman Shanmugaratnam. Mr Wong said in a Facebook post that both sides affirmed the crucial role of the US in providing the framework for regional peace, stability and progress. “We look forward to deepening our cooperation with the US in many areas including the green economy, sustainable finance and the digital economy,” he added.  “We are grateful for our many friends in Congress, who play an important role in strengthening ties between Singapore and the United States.” Meanwhile, Mr Teo said that during his meeting with the delegation, they discussed common security challenges and reaffirmed the excellent and mutually beneficial partnership between both countries and their defence and security establishments. “I expressed Singapore’s appreciation for the US’ strong support for the SAF’s (Singapore Armed Forces) training in the US,” he said.  “We also exchanged views on mitigation measures like accelerating the renewable energy transition and adopting innovative green solutions by harnessing new technologies, and adaptation to sea level rise. We also discussed the importance of Asean and its role in bringing countries together,” he added. The visit to Singapore is the first by a congressional delegation in recent memory to be led by a House Speaker, who ranks third in order of protocol after the US president and vice-president. Besides Mrs Pelosi, the delegation comprises chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Gregory Meeks of New York, chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee Mark Takano of California, congresswoman Suzan DelBene of Washington, congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, and congressman Andy Kim of New Jersey. All six members are from the Democratic Party. The US is the largest foreign direct investor in Singapore, with an investment stock of $528 billion in 2020, and Singapore is the US' second-largest Asian investor after Japan, with investment stock valued at US$65.2 billion (S$89.7 billion) in 2020. The delegation's visit follows several high-level meetings between leaders on both sides, including Vice-President Kamala Harris' official visit to Singapore in August last year and PM Lee's working visit to Washington in March this year - during which he met US President Joe Biden and Ms Harris, and was hosted to lunch with US congressional leaders by Mrs Pelosi. PM Lee was also in Washington in May this year for the Asean-US Special Summit, where he met Mr Biden, Ms Harris as well as Mrs Pelosi and other key members of Congress."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/ssg-acknowledges-gaps-in-levy-collection-is-updating-its-it-system-gan-siow-huang,"SSG acknowledges gaps in levy collection, is updating its IT system: Gan Siow Huang","SINGAPORE - The gap between estimated and actual payments collected under the Skills Development Levy (SDL) has fallen from 18 per cent in 2008 to between 3 per cent and 4 per cent today, said Minister of State for Education Gan Siow Huang. This is due to SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) improving its IT system and through reminder letters and calls, Ms Gan said in reply to MPs' questions about lapses flagged by the Auditor-General's Office (AGO) in its annual report last month. She told Parliament on Monday (Aug 1): ""Nevertheless, SSG acknowledges that more needs to be done to actively reconcile the remaining gap and help all employers pay the correct amount of SDL."" In its report released on July 20, the AGO had found SSG lax in enforcing the collection of SDL funds from 2015 to 2020. This resulted in an estimated $43 million owed to the agency as at April this year. The SDL is a levy which companies pay every month for foreign and local employees in Singapore, which is about 0.25 per cent of their monthly wages. The report also found that SSG, which is the government agency in charge of lifelong learning, had overpaid an estimated $4.22 million due to lapses in the management of its grants. Responding to questions from MPs Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang) and Sylvia Lim (Aljunied GRC) on the AGO's findings, Ms Gan said SSG uses existing government data, such as data from the Central Provident Fund, to estimate how much in levies companies should pay. This means that SSG's estimates may differ from the actual amount paid by employers, due to factors like fluctuations in workers' actual wages every month. SSG is working with GovTech to roll out an IT system by the middle of next year that can more accurately estimate and track such payments while also helping employers better estimate their SDL liabilities, she added. Ms Gan, who is also Minister of State for Manpower, said SSG has started engaging affected employers and will contact all of them by the end of the financial year, and that they will be given time to validate the amount owed. SSG will send payment reminders and develop more efficient processes to resolve differences in companies' and SSG's estimates, she added. ""For the few recalcitrant employers who do not pay the outstanding levies despite reminders, SSG will take decisive punitive action,"" she said. Addressing the overpayment of grants by SSG, Ms Gan said the agency was still investigating and had not yet determined if they were due to fraud. ""We have not used that term yet because, as I explained, there is a lengthy verification process with the individuals and the companies and training providers involved,"" she said in reply to a follow-up question by Ms Lim. The bulk of these claims occurred before November 2020, when SSG's IT system was using a declaration-based approach, noted Ms Gan. Errors had also occurred during manual processing of grants, including human errors made by a service provider contracted by SSG, she added, without naming the provider. Ms Gan said SSG is now looking at the service provider's contractual liability. ""The root cause we have identified is the massive volume of manual processing that makes it very difficult for all the verifications to be done fully and hence, there needs to be more upstream changes in the policies and business rules,"" she said."

""I have deliberately used the term up-to-date vaccinations, rather than a second, third or fourth booster shot. This is because at some point, just like flu vaccinations, we have to stop counting the number of jabs we have taken."" ""Instead, we must ensure that we get a jab at a suitable interval - maybe nine months or a year. This is something MOH (Ministry of Health) will try to determine in the coming months."" Mr Ong said the current wave is subsiding and the worst is over, but it is important not to be complacent. ""As the protection of vaccines and prior infection wanes, the virus will circulate in our society again and cases will rise. We must anticipate when that will happen and take the necessary precautions, the most important of which is to keep our vaccinations up to date,"" he said. Mr Ong said in Parliament at the start of the year that regular Covid-19 shots is a possible scenario in the future when the virus becomes an endemic disease. In Parliament on Monday, he said: ""As of now, there is no change to MOH's guidelines and recommendations."" Mr Ong said that the country needs to be alert to the threat of a new variant that is more infectious, lead to more severe illnesses, or evades the protection of current vaccines. He added that the hope is that it will not happen, but many countries in the northern hemisphere are wary of what may emerge in the coming winter. If Singapore encounters such a variant, social restrictions will become necessary again, he said."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/government-to-set-up-holding-company-to-manage-kallang-alive-precinct-sports-hub,"Govt to set up holding company to manage Kallang Alive precinct, Sports Hub","SINGAPORE - National agency Sport Singapore (SportSG) will incorporate a holding company to own and operate the upcoming Kallang Alive precinct, and a subsidiary of this holding company will be set up specifically to own and manage the Sports Hub. Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong made the announcement in Parliament on Monday (Aug 1) as he delivered a ministerial statement in response to MPs' queries about the Government's June 10 announcement that it would take over the Sports Hub's management and ownership. The move to terminate the partnership with Sports Hub Pte Ltd (SHPL), the private consortium that has been running the $1.33 billion facility since it opened in 2014, brings to an end the public-private partnership and its profit-driven model, which ultimately proved restrictive to the role the Government wanted the Sports Hub to fulfil. Spelling out the Government's intentions to build on the foundation of the Sports Hub's world-class infrastructure, Mr Tong said: ""We intend to build on that, and continue to bring in top tier international sporting and entertainment events, whilst at the same time incorporating our ambition of attaining wider and better social and sporting outcomes for Singapore and Singaporeans."" To do this, SportSG will incorporate a holding company to own and operate the various assets within Kallang Alive. The Kallang Alive project, announced in 2019, will see six new developments in the area around the Hub. These include the Kallang Football Hub, Singapore Tennis Centre and a redevelopment of the Kallang Theatre. In a first for Singapore, a velodrome looks set to be built and will be part of the Youth Hub. A subsidiary of this holding company will be set up specifically to own and manage the Sports Hub. ""This structure will enable SportSG to focus on the Sports Hub, but at the same time, also have regard to its deployment in the wider Kallang Alive precinct,"" said Mr Tong. ""Where necessary, it can be operated as a single, integrated entity, able to reap synergies and economies of scale across the entire suite of sporting and lifestyle assets of Kallang Alive."" Mr Tong added that a team of officers from SportSG have already been earmarked to move into the Sports Hub holding company, and manage Sports Hub on a full-time basis once the takeover is in effect from Dec 9. ""These are officers who have had years of experience with the Sports Hub, many of them having worked alongside SHPL since the inception of the project, gaining experience and know-how along the way. ""They have been functionally organised to cohere with the organisational structure of SHPL, suited to running the Sports Hub. They have been in this position for the last few years, readying for a takeover if and when needed,"" said Mr Tong, who also reiterated that existing SHPL employees have been offered an opportunity to cross over into the new corporate entity. Beyond the new internal structure, he went on to add, the Government will continue to retain the contracting model the SHPL has leveraged on to run the Sports Hub in the areas of programming, broadcast, hospitality, facilities upkeep and management. This would allow the Government to work with market leading partners to provide the best services and facilities as may be needed, and may also help it tap the private sector, to explore the prospects of redeveloping some parts of the Kallang Alive precinct. Mr Tong added: ""Overall, with SportSG taking over, the Government would be better placed to drive a coherent vision for the whole precinct, and achieve internal synergies while providing more integrated offerings and programmes for the public."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/costs-of-terminating-sports-hub-ppp-represented-fair-deal-for-government-says-edwin-tong,$2.3b cost of ending Sports Hub public-private tie-up represented 'fair deal' for Govt: Edwin Tong,"SINGAPORE - The Government's decision to take over the management and ownership of the Singapore Sports Hub came after ""detailed financial, legal and operational due diligence"" was carried out, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong told Parliament on Monday (Aug 1). The Government came to the conclusion that the move would serve the interests of Singapore and Singaporeans better, he said. National agency Sport Singapore (SportSG) had announced on June 10 that it would terminate the partnership with Sports Hub Pte Ltd (SHPL), the private consortium that has been running the $1.33 billion facility since it opened in 2014, and start operating the 35ha facility from Dec 9. This brings to an end the public-private partnership (PPP) and its profit-driven model, which ultimately proved restrictive to the role the Government wanted the Sports Hub to fulfil. Responding to questions from various MPs, Mr Tong explained in a ministerial statement that the Government has been ""closely evaluating the performance of the Sports Hub"" over the last 12 to 18 months and assessing whether to continue with the PPP. The arrangement saw SportSG paying SHPL an annual fee of about $193.7 million from 2014 to 2035 to finance and operate the facility. He also gave a detailed breakdown of the costs of the move and explained how it was comparable to the $2.32 billion that SportSG would have paid had it continued with the PPP arrangement till 2035. He said the takeover decision represented a ""fair deal"" for the Government on which to take back the assets. ""None of these components are penalties to the Government for the termination... These are simply costs we would have had to incur or would have incurred going forward,"" Mr Tong reiterated. With the termination, the Government would have to pay two main ""buckets"" of cost, he added. The first is the amount to be paid to SHPL for the termination, worth about $1.5 billion, and the second is the costs that will be spent post-handover, estimated at about $800 million. From the first bucket, the largest component, which accounts for $1.2 billion, he said, is the capital expenditure that the Government would have had to bear if it had adopted the traditional procurement approach from the start. The remaining components, worth about $300 million, are primarily the fair open market value of the Sports Hub, which is commercially negotiated, and other costs, expenses and deductions. The second bucket, said Mr Tong, comprises the costs of running and operating the facility, post-handover. He noted that the current operating assumptions and costs incurred by SHPL, which includes maintenance and programming costs, and the day-to-day costs of operating the venue, amount to approximately $68 million a year, or a sum of $800 million until 2035. ""Taking the two buckets of costs to be paid for the termination - the sum to be paid to SHPL, which largely reflects the upfront capital expenditure and future operating costs - this would be a fair deal that the Government is making to take back the assets,"" said Mr Tong. He also further explained in Parliament that there was ""a confluence of several reasons"", and not just any single one which led to the Government's decision. The first is that, despite the world-class infrastructure of the venue, the ""quality and volume"" of the SHPL's calendar of events and programming for the facility, which includes the 55,000-seater National Stadium, fell short of expectations. ""We wanted to see SHPL invest in the creation of their own new event intellectual properties and building on existing event properties, but these did not come to fruition,"" said Mr Tong. ""Apart from the Super Rugby event from 2016-2019, SHPL has not secured any recurring or marquee sport events at the Sports Hub on a multi-year basis. The Sports Hub is a world-class sporting facility, and of course international marquee events are important."" He added that there ""ought to have been more community participation and activation"" around the Sports Hub, in the form of grassroots, schools, or junior national athletes programmes having more access to the venue through key events at National School Games, or Family Days and carnivals centred around sporting objectives. There was a need for greater emphasis on community programming and ""driving social outcomes, even if such programmes did not always resonate with commercial returns"", he said. The SHPL's profit-driven focus meant that SportSG ""encountered resistance"" when it planned to bring the ActiveSG basketball academy programme to the OCBC Arena ""as such activities were not revenue-generating"", while costs of hosting school sport events, such as combined sports days and National School Games, were high and prohibitive to organisers. While he noted that moving to have more community participation at the Sports Hub will likely mean higher expenditures and increases in daily operating and maintenance costs, Mr Tong said they would be cushioned by the fact that full revenue generated from the Sports Hub would now accrue to the Government. Among the various supplementary questions that were later posed for about half an hour, Leader of the Opposition and Workers' Party chief Pritam Singh asked about how much the SHPL has had to pay to the Government for non-performance or unmet standards since 2014. Mr Tong replied: ""Subject to checking this and... based on memory, I believe the figure is around the order of $44 million for defects rectification, non-availability payments and so on."" Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio GRC) also asked if the National Day Parade would return regularly to the National Stadium - it has been staged there only once, in 2016, since the Sports Hub opened - to which Mr Tong said the Government ""would certainly be open to it"", but has to be ""circumspect"" about the matter given the lead-up and preparation time required for the parade to take place. While Mr Tong reiterated why it made sense for the Government to utilise the PPP model at the inception of the project in 2003, he highlighted how the local sporting and entertainment ecosystem in Singapore has grown and matured since. He cited the growth of internal capabilities within SportSG as well as those of local and locally based companies, the rise in demand for world-class events, as reasons which made the Republic ""now much better placed"" to move forward from the arrangement. ""Overall, the limitations of the current arrangement, the changing environment, and our growing capabilities and ambition were factors we considered when deciding on terminating the relationship,"" he said. ""I would add that this was not a decision taken lightly, but we felt that... with the confluence of all these factors coming together, the time was now right."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/no-evidence-of-further-spread-of-monkeypox-in-spore-from-reported-cases,No evidence of further spread of monkeypox in S'pore from reported cases,"SINGAPORE - There is no evidence of further spread of monkeypox in the community from the reported cases. As at Sunday (July 31), Singapore had a total of 11 cases reported, with 45 close contacts identified, Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary said in Parliament on Monday. All close contacts who remained in Singapore are well and 11 have completed their quarantine. Thus far, none of the local contacts developed symptoms compatible with monkeypox nor tested positive for monkeypox, he added. Close contacts were offered the smallpox vaccine as post-exposure prophylaxis, which is reported to be 85 per cent effective at preventing monkeypox infection. Post-exposure prophylaxis means taking medicine to prevent monkeypox after a possible exposure. To date, 11 close contacts have taken the vaccine. ""However, and as recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO), mass population-wide vaccination... is currently not recommended as a preventive strategy for monkeypox as the benefits do not outweigh the risk,"" Dr Janil said. Individuals who are at higher risk of infections, including healthcare and laboratory personnel, due to exposure to confirmed cases or their specimen may be offered the smallpox vaccines to protect them from getting infected. There is an adequate supply of vaccines, said Dr Janil. Based on available international data, the current monkeypox outbreak generally causes a mild and self-limiting illness. With three deaths out of more than 20,900 cases reported outside of Africa, the case fatality rate currently stands at around 0.01 per cent, or approximately one in 10,000. As the Ministry of Health (MOH) learns more about the disease, it will continually review and calibrate its response measures to be commensurate with the public health risk. In line with the WHO's recommendations, MOH has also provided appropriate advice and precautionary measures to the public, including the at-risk population, to raise awareness and reduce the risk of onward transmission. ""MOH will continue to monitor the monkeypox situation closely and further calibrate our preparedness and response measures, including vaccination strategies, as needed,"" Dr Janil said."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/mof-has-begun-recovery-of-gst-voucher-u-save-rebates-given-to-ineligible-households,MOF has begun recovery of GST Voucher U-Save rebates given to ineligible households,"SINGAPORE - The process of recovering rebates given out in the last financial year to ineligible households has begun. These payouts by the Ministry of Finance were identified by the Auditor-General’s Office in its report released in July. The report had found 5,120 instances where GST Voucher U-Save rebates amounting to $864,500 could have been given to 3,166 ineligible households. One eligibility condition for the rebate is that the household must have a living Singapore citizen. Second Minister for Finance Indranee Rajah told Parliament on Monday (Aug 1) that a time lag issue affected about 3,100 households, or about 0.3 per cent of all households living in Housing Board flats. These were cases where the sole Singapore citizen household member had already passed away as of the date used to determine eligibility, and the error arose as there was a time lag in some deceased citizens' living status data, due to legal processing of records after their deaths had taken place. ""There were another 23 cases of U-Save rebates given even though there were no Singaporean citizens in the household, due to errors in agencies' databases,"" said Ms Indranee. She was responding to questions from Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong GRC) and Workers' Party MP He Ting Ru (Sengkang GRC) about reasons for disbursement to ineligible households. Ms Indranee added that the Ministry of Finance is working with agencies such as HDB and the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority to tighten operational processes and ensure the use of latest available data to administer the GSTV - U-Save scheme. In response to a further question from Ms He on the action taken to claw back the monies and the timeline for it, Ms Indranee said she did not have the exact figures at the moment as it was still in process, but added that the ministry is doing it as soon as it can."

He said that children under the age of five are the last group in Singapore that is not protected by vaccination, and the Ministry of Health (MOH) is preparing to start vaccination for them around the fourth quarter of this year. The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) is currently reviewing data submitted by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna on their vaccines for those in this age group, he added. Children from five to 11 years old have been offered the Pfizer-BioNTech/ Comirnaty Covid-19 vaccine since Dec 27 last year. Those aged 12 and above have been able to book their vaccination appointments since June 11 last year.  On Monday, Dr Janil highlighted that the overall incidence of severe outcomes from Covid-19 infection remains lower among children compared with the elderly. ""Children needing medical attention should be seen by a general practitioner or polyclinic if unwell,"" said Dr Janil, who was responding to questions from several Members of Parliament on Covid-19 treatment and vaccination plans for children. Dr Janil said that he was saddened by the recent deaths of two young children from the coronavirus, and offered condolences to their families. He added that data has shown the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants have not been observed to affect children more severely than past variants, and that severe infection continues to be rare in children, especially among those who are vaccinated. He noted that for children aged five to 11, a third dose of an mRNA vaccine may be necessary at some point to keep their protection levels high. He added that MOH is preparing to roll out vaccination booster doses for this age group in about two months' time. Dr Janil said that currently, children with acute respiratory infections are tested using antigen rapid tests or polymerase chain reaction tests, and that those under three months old are admitted to hospital by default whereas older children under the Home Recovery Programme are reviewed by doctors via telemedicine, a service which is available round the clock. ""Our hospitals continue to prioritise care for children with urgent medical conditions and those who require further observation and treatment will be admitted,"" said Dr Janil, adding that oral antivirals are licensed for use under the HSA's Pandemic Special Access Route only for patients aged 18 and above. The Government will continue to review the evidence for the use of oral antivirals for those aged below 18, said Dr Janil, adding that Paxlovid may be used on a case-by-case basis for those aged 12 to 18. He said: ""We'll continue to monitor the incidence of severe illness and deaths due to Covid-19 closely and adjust our processes to protect our healthcare system and our patients. We ask everyone to take the necessary precautions and remain socially responsible."""

In a petition submitted to Parliament on behalf of five Ang Mo Kio residents, Mr Leong also asked for a complete review of the scheme. He said: ""They (the residents) allege that there was a lack of transparency concerning various aspects of the Sers project and the treatment given to them was unfair."" The petition comes after Blocks 562, 563, 564 and 565 in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 were chosen for Sers in April, which resulted in residents expressing dismay at having to fork out more money to buy similar-sized replacement units under the scheme. The Housing Board then gave older residents two new options for rehousing: a shorter 50-year lease and a lease buyback scheme. In July, National Development Minister Desmond Lee said nearly all of the 540 Ang Mo Kio residents aged 45 years and above will not have to top up any money to move into a similarly sized replacement flat if they opt for a 50-year lease. Mr Leong also listed the petitioners' other requests. These are for Parliament to consider revealing the intended use of the Sers site so that its value can be accurately assessed, and to consider allowing affected residents to be relocated near the reclaimed site. They also asked Parliament to consider an ex-gratia payment to affected residents to help them with renovation costs, and for this sum to be adjusted for inflation and other factors, as well as to consider waivers and reimbursement of stamp and legal fees for residents in future Sers exercises. In the petition, the five residents also expressed unhappiness at the site where their new flats will be located - near the Institute of Technical Education College Central. They said their current location is much better situated, spaced and connected with many amenities and transport links. They said the new site is on the ""fringe of Ang Mo Kio"", and they were disappointed that they had only been offered one option, citing how residents in past Sers exercises in Tanglin Halt and West Coast Road had been offered several replacement options. After a petition is presented to Parliament, it is referred to the Public Petitions Committee. The committee is made up of seven MPs and chaired by Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/those-who-had-covid-4-to-7-months-ago-have-a-3-chance-of-reinfection,Lower infection risk for those who had Covid-19 several months ago compared with uninfected,"SINGAPORE - People who had Covid-19 four to seven months ago have a much lower chance of catching the virus now, as compared with someone who has never had Covid-19 before, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said on Monday (Aug 1). For instance, he said that for those infected four to seven months ago, the probability of getting infected again is just 3 per cent that of a person who has never had Covid-19. But this rises to 20 per cent in those infected with the Delta variant last year. Responding in Parliament to a question by Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar GRC), who had asked about reinfection rates in the light of the new Omicron sub-variants, Mr Ong said that for those infected over the last three months, the chance of getting another infection is ""very rare"". ""Of course, this picture will change as time goes by, and the protective effect of prior infections will wane. Hence, having been infected by Covid-19 before should not be a reason to let your guard down,"" said Mr Ong. He added that reinfection during the current wave has been low in Singapore, likely due to the good vaccination coverage here and the nation having gone through a major Omicron BA.2 infection wave recently. Mr Ong said that reinfections are likely to increase as the protection from prior infections wanes. He added that the Ministry of Health (MOH) should start to include reinfection numbers in its daily case counts. In the past, if a patient was infected twice, he would be counted only once in the daily reports, said Mr Ong. From today, MOH will start to report the number of infection episodes rather than the number of daily infections, which should lead to a more accurate reflection of the pandemic situation, he said. Mr Ong said that after 10 months, the protective effect of three doses of mRNA vaccines remains very strong in preventing severe illness. This is why the Government is recommending those aged 80 and above to get their second booster, so as to protect themselves against severe disease. Mr Ong said that those aged 50 to 79 have a strong protection level from their previous three shots, but noted that they are at the age when chronic illnesses start to set in. So they will be offered the second booster if they want to take it because they are travelling, or are worried about their health because of underlying illnesses. He added that experts are actively studying the benefits of a fourth shot for the 60- to 79-year-olds in further reducing the likelihood of severe illness, and that their recommendations will be announced shortly. Those below the age of 60 do not require a second booster if they are healthy, added Mr Ong. Responding to a question from Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied GRC) on the effectiveness of non-mRNA vaccines, Mr Ong said that while Novavax’s vaccine has been shown to be effective in preventing severe illness, data from around the world has shown that those from Sinovac and Sinopharm are slightly less effective. “Having said that, they do have a protective effect. Having those (vaccines) is better than not having vaccination,” he said."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/6-in-10-residents-in-singapore-have-likely-been-infected-with-covid-19-says-ong-ye-kung,6 in 10 in S'pore likely had Covid-19; no herd immunity as virus continues to mutate,"SINGAPORE - Six in 10 local residents have likely been infected with Covid-19, but this does not confer herd immunity, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung in Parliament on Monday (Aug 1). He said that about 1.7 million Covid-19 cases have been reported, and the number translates to about 30 per cent of Singapore's population. ""We also systematically monitor blood samples from routine polyclinic cases and other health volunteers for signs of previous infection. From these samples, we estimate about 60 per cent of local residents are likely to have been infected with Covid-19,"" said Mr Ong. ""Notwithstanding, this does not confer herd immunity to us. By and large, scientists around the world do not think herd immunity is achievable because the virus will continue to mutate, escape the protection of vaccines and then infect people,"" he added. In response to a question from Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade GRC), Mr Ong said: “Even if we hit 100 per cent, we will not have herd immunity because it’s no longer a function of... vaccinations or infections, but it is the fact that it is a fast-mutating virus and you will escape prior infections’ protection.” Do not aim for herd immunity and think the virus will disappear, he added. Singapore is currently experiencing a Covid-19 wave driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant BA.5, which is expected to subside further this week. But as the protection of vaccines and prior infection wanes, cases are expected to rise again, said Mr Ong. Mr Ong said that during the last Omicron wave at the start of this year, 2.4 per cent of infected persons needed hospitalisation. During this wave, 1.9 per cent ended up in hospitals. The actual percentages are likely to be lower because not all cases are reported cases. Nevertheless, the vaccination coverage of vulnerable sectors of the population, especially the seniors, remains a concern as the country has hit a plateau where booster shots are concerned. Three mRNA shots are needed to get good vaccine protection against severe illness from Omicron infections. However, there remain 40,000 seniors aged 60 and above who have not received their booster shots, even though they are eligible, he said. Another 40,000 seniors have not completed two doses yet, he said. ""All of them are very vulnerable to severe illness if infected, and we will continue to try to reach out to them through our mobile vaccination teams, through our home vaccination teams."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/covid-19-wave-likely-to-subside-further-this-week-says-ong-ye-kung,Covid-19 wave in S'pore likely to subside further this week: Ong Ye Kung,"SINGAPORE - The current Covid-19 infection wave, which has been driven by the Omicron variant BA.5, is likely to subside further this week, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung on Monday (Aug 1). Speaking in Parliament, Mr Ong said that while the nation is still in the middle of the infection wave, infection numbers have been falling over the past 10 days and the week-on-week ratio has dipped below 0.9 over the last week. The week-on-week infection ratio refers to the ratio of community cases for the past week, over the week before. A ratio of below one shows that the number of new weekly Covid-19 cases is decreasing. Mr Ong noted that Singapore did not have to tighten social restrictions during the current wave, allowing most people to go about their lives as per normal. ""However, life is not as normal in our hospitals... Our healthcare system is bearing the brunt of the current wave. Healthcare workers have been very busy. Polyclinics and our general practitioner clinics also saw higher patient volumes,"" he said. Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar GRC) asked about measures to help the healthcare system cope with the spike in patients, as well as whether there were plans to support the telemedicine sector here so as to reduce the number of patients at clinics. In response, Mr Ong said that the Government is promoting the use of telemedicine for mild Covid-19 cases, and that this is now more accepted than in the past. But he added: ""Even so, we need to be realistic that in a big infection wave, the healthcare system will come under stress... Waiting times at private clinics, polyclinics (and) hospitals will inevitably go up, and I seek the patience and understanding of residents."" In such a situation, the key is to ensure that hospitals are not overwhelmed, and that those who need urgent care can be attended to promptly - something that the healthcare system has generally been able to achieve so far, said Mr Ong. Responding to a question from Mr Louis Chua (Sengkang GRC) on the bed capacity of hospitals that is currently in use and has been set aside for Covid-19 cases, Mr Ong said that based on the worst-case scenario projection for the current wave, the Government has plans to set aside up to about 1,000 beds for such patients. He added: ""This is a dynamic plan and, fortunately, in the course of this infection wave, we did not have to activate all of these beds."" Mr Ong later clarified that the figure does not include beds in private hospitals, which have a few hundred more beds that can be allocated for Covid-19 patients. He added that it is quite common for hospitals today to have 90 per cent bed occupancy, not from Covid-19 patients but as a result of those seeking treatment for other conditions. Mr Ong said that the Government has eased the workload of hospitals by transferring lower-risk patients to Covid-19 treatment facilities, and discharging long-staying patients to community care facilities such as nursing homes.  “Many of these facilities and services are run by private or social sector providers and we are deeply appreciative of them for doing this work,” he said. He noted that compared with the last Omicron wave, the transfer processes are now smoother, and patients and their families are also more understanding when hospitals have to make the transfers. This has allowed more transfers to be made than during the last infection wave earlier this year, and it has made a significant difference, said Mr Ong. Hospitals have also cut down on their “business-as-usual” workload in order to manage the demand for beds.  Mr Ong said that during the current wave, hospitals have reduced such workload by about 5 per cent, most of which involve elective surgery. While he acknowledged that this is “not ideal”, Mr Ong said that this is less than the 15 per cent cut during the previous Omicron wave. Hospitals also restricted, but did not suspend, visits to patients. He added that the leave of healthcare workers was not suspended, allowing them to take breaks and fly back to their home countries to see their families - a move that was key in maintaining their morale. Responding to Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang), who  asked about hospital-acquired Covid-19 infections, Mr Ong said that absenteeism in hospitals has been about 2 per cent during the current wave, and has not contributed to a bed crunch. “As far as we can determine, while there had been some transmission within hospitals, overall hospital-acquired Covid-19 infection has been low, and very likely lower than community-acquired infections. And this is because of good infection control measures in hospitals,” he said."

In this edition, we look at how politicians and their constituencies are gearing up for National Day, how one office-holder is trying out the different sports that Singapore is being represented in at the Commonwealth Games, and an update from a Progress Singapore Party member. Look out for the latest edition of the series every Friday, and check out past ones here. It's the time of the year again where Housing Board estates are decked out in red and white decor, each trying to one up the other with a bigger and more spectacular display. In a Facebook post on Wednesday (July 27), Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen consolidated various displays across the island - from Bishan to Woodlands to Choa Chu Kang, with several towns choosing to use the national flag to form 57 - Singapore's age this year. Mountbatten MP Lim Biow Chuan shared photos of Tanjong Rhu pier decked out with flags and streamers - an eye-catching sight from afar. For those looking forward to this year's National Day Parade, Dr Ng and Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat have posted sneak peeks from the previews. Ever been slung over someone's shoulder? Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Culture, Community and Youth Eric Chua has experienced it first-hand and given it the thumbs up. In a Facebook post on Wednesday, Mr Chua posted a photo of himself being fireman-lifted by a Team Singapore wrestler - while wearing a smile from ear to ear. In a series of posts over the past month, Mr Chua, who is also Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Social and Family Development, has been showcasing the different sports that Singapore is being represented in at the Commonwealth Games. He has tried his hand at lawn-bowling and gymnastics - and even learnt to point his toes as he struck a pose with the Team Singapore rhythmic gymnasts - while meeting other athletes who are travelling to the Games. A total of 67 Team Singapore athletes will be competing in nine sports - athletics, badminton, gymnastics, lawn bowling, para-powerlifting, swimming and para-swimming, table tennis, weightlifting and wrestling. The Commonwealth Games began on Thursday in Birmingham in Britain. Ms Gigene Wong, a Progress Singapore Party candidate in the 2020 General Election, has resigned as a member of the party. In a Facebook post on Wednesday, Ms Wong, who contested Hong Kah North against the People Action Party's Dr Amy Khor, said she had also resigned as head of the party's headquarters administration. ""My father has dementia and I want to take care of him,"" she said. She added that she is enrolled in a continuing studies course. ""Even so, I hope to help more people in other ways. As long as we have a sincere heart for the country, for the people, it doesn't matter where you are, which party you are in,"" said Ms Wong. Ms Wong had spent 20 years working and living in China, with roles in multinational corporations. During the elections, she said she would move to Hong Kah North if elected."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/sri-lankas-ex-president-gotabaya-rajapaksa-gets-short-term-visit-pass-in-singapore-extended,Sri Lanka's ex-president Gotabaya gets short-term visit pass in S'pore extended,"SINGAPORE - Sri Lanka's former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa is set to extend his stay in Singapore. The Straits Times understands that his short-term visit pass, which was issued when he arrived here on a private visit two weeks ago, has been extended by another 14 days. This development comes as Sri Lanka's Cabinet spokesman Bandula Gunawardena told reporters on Tuesday (July 26) that he was expected to return home. He added that he was not aware of when the former president was returning but emphasised Mr Rajapaksa was not in hiding, neither was he in exile. Another Sri Lankan government official who asked not to be identified said Mr Rajapaksa wanted to return home as soon as possible and was keen to live again at his private residence in the outskirts of Sri Lanka's capital of Colombo, Bloomberg news agency reported. On July 14, Mr Rajapaksa, 73, was issued a 14-day visit pass when he arrived at Changi Airport on a Saudia flight from the Maldives. He had fled Sri Lanka amid a deepening economic crisis and widespread protests against his government as soaring inflation affected the prices of basic necessities such as food and fuel. Shortly after he arrived in Singapore, Mr Rajapaksa tendered his resignation, which was officially announced by the Sri Lanka Parliament on July 15. His ally and former prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was voted in by lawmakers as the new president last week. ST understands that the new visa Mr Rajapaksa has been issued will expire on Aug 11. Mr Rajapaksa initially stayed at a hotel in the city centre, but is believed to have moved to a private residence. He has kept a low profile since he arrived, and has not been seen in public. Shortly after he arrived on July 14, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman confirmed that Mr Rajapaksa had been allowed entry on a private visit, and said he had not asked for asylum, and had not been granted asylum. Singapore generally does not grant requests for asylum, the spokesman added. Last Wednesday (July 20), the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) said in response to media queries that visitors from Sri Lanka who enter Singapore for social visits will generally be issued with a short-term visit pass with a duration of up to 30 days. Those who need to extend their stay here may apply online for extension of their visit pass. Applications will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, said ICA."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/elections-dept-to-provide-postage-paid-envelopes-confirm-receipt-of-postal-votes-for-overseas-voters,"ELD to provide QR code envelopes, confirm receipt of postal votes for overseas voters","SINGAPORE - Overseas Singaporeans voting by post in future elections will get confirmation that their envelopes have been received, and these envelopes will be postage-paid where available, said the Elections Department (ELD) on Tuesday (July 26). Each return envelope would have a unique QR code that does not contain personal information or identifiers, and only envelopes with valid QR codes will be accepted. This ensures only one postal ballot paper from each registered overseas voter will be counted, said ELD. The ELD was providing an update to feedback collected on new voting arrangements it had proposed in May for overseas voters and those in nursing homes. These changes, which make it easier for people to vote, are part of a regular review of election processes. A total of 13 political parties and 39 nursing home operators provided feedback, as did overseas Singaporeans and members of the public, said ELD. An online survey of overseas Singaporeans garnered 3,221 responses from across 64 countries, it added. In May, ELD had said that it planned to roll out postal voting in time for the presidential election, which is due by September next year. On Tuesday, the department said that 82 per cent of respondents in the online survey supported postal voting, with convenience and being able to exercise the right to vote while living overseas as the top two reasons for their support. Of the 1,771 respondents who had never voted while living overseas, 83 per cent indicated that they were willing to take part in postal voting. However, respondents expressed concerns such as the security and safety of ballots - such as lost, damaged or delayed mails, the transparency of the process and the ease and cost of postal voting. In response, ELD said that on top of requiring a postal voter to log in to the secure ELD Voter Services using Singpass to authenticate his identity and download the return envelope and postal ballot paper, there would be additional safeguards. On top of unique QR codes, technology will be used to verify the wet-ink signature on the return envelope against the specimen signature provided during registration for overseas voting. With regard to transparency, ELD said it will make clear the criteria for rejection of return envelopes in the legislation. For example, damaged or unsealed envelopes, multiple envelopes with the same QR code from one person, non-matching signatures, and envelopes with more than one postal ballot paper would all be rejected. ELD will also provide information so that candidates and counting agents can verify that there is no ballot paper stuffing or non-legitimate ballots being counted. It will also give postal voters an update on whether their return envelopes were received after overseas votes have been counted. For greater convenience, postal voters can download and print their postal ballot papers and return envelopes starting from the day after Nomination Day. The marked postal ballot papers must be posted before Polling Day in Singapore and reach ELD no later than 10 days after Polling Day. At the 2020 General Election, there were 6,570 registered overseas voters, and of these, a total of 4,794 cast their ballots at 10 overseas polling stations. On the pilot of special voting arrangements at some nursing homes, ELD received feedback on concerns about voting secrecy, in particular for bedbound voters who might vote in close proximity to other residents and the possibility of undue influence from nursing home staff or next-of-kin when voting. There were also concerns about ascertaining whether the residents have the mental capacity to vote and operational and resource challenges to set up on-site polling stations and to carry out bed-to-bed polling, which ELD had proposed in May. ELD said a portable lap booth will be provided for bed-to-bed polling so voters can mark their ballot papers in private, shielded by the front and sides of the booth. It will also provide clear guidelines on what nursing home staff can and cannot do. For example, they can help a voter to sit up in bed to prepare for bed-to-bed polling but will have to move away when the voter is ready to vote. Nursing home staff are also not allowed to mark the ballot paper on behalf of a voter or engage in any actions that may influence a voter then, said ELD. If a voter is physically unable to mark the ballot paper, he can request for an election official to assist him to do so, similar to what is done at a regular polling station. A second election official will witness the process as a safeguard. ELD will also handle nursing home voters who may lack the mental capacity to vote in a similar manner to voters at regular polling stations. For example, the voter will not be issued a ballot paper if he does not respond to the election official's repeated requests for his identification document and poll card. ELD said it will continue to engage nursing home operators before finalising the parameters and selection criteria for the pilot, given that residents across nursing homes can vary widely in terms of their physical and mental health."

Calling themselves the Protect Singapore Townhall, the group held an event at the Singapore Expo convention centre last Saturday (July 23), which was attended by more than 1,200 people. Organisers Jason Wong and Mohamed Khair Mohamed Noor published brief updates on the session in similar Facebook posts titled Silent No More the same day, after the event. They wrote: ""We urge the Government to maintain the current political package and not to repeal Section 377A unless and until there are adequate safeguards for our marriages, families, and freedom of conscience. ""This includes enshrining man-woman marriage in the Constitution."" The Government has been consulting various groups of Singaporeans on the law in recent months, as it decides on the next steps. Currently, the law - Section 377A of the Penal Code - is not actively enforced, a position that has been reiterated by the authorities since it was discussed at length in Parliament in 2007. However, a Court of Appeal ruling on Feb 28 this year that the law cannot be used to prosecute men for gay sex reignited the debate on whether the law should be repealed. Asked about the issue in Parliament in March, Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam said the Government is carefully considering the best way forward. ""If and when we decide to move, we will do so in a way that continues to balance these different viewpoints, and avoids causing a sudden, destabilising change in social norms and public expectations,"" he said. Social and Family Development Minister Masagos Zulkifli told Parliament the same month that traditional societal norms and values will be reflected in policies and laws concerning marriage, parenthood, adoption, fertility treatment, as well as housing and inheritance, among other things. ""We'll continue to adopt the approach of civil dialogue, working with all, involving all stakeholders, as we chart our own unique Singapore way forward without creating sudden shifts and deep divisions in our society,"" he added. The organisers of Saturday's event, which the media was not invited to, said it was attended by people of all ages, races and backgrounds, including people who formerly identified as part of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and/or queer (LGBTQ) community and who shared their experiences. Mr Wong and Mr Khair wrote: ""Youths, parents, workers and more decided that it was #timetoact to protect family, marriage, our freedom of conscience, and most importantly our children, who are at the heart of these social institutions."" They added: ""We've been relatively restrained in the face of an intolerant, vocal minority that seeks to overturn the order in all areas of society - be it marriage, education, businesses, or beliefs, while demonising all those who disagree as 'bigots' or 'haters', instead of engaging us with good faith. We will be silent no more."" Mr Wong is a former board member and chairman of Christian organisation Focus on the Family, while Mr Khair is executive chairman of SuChi Success Initiatives, which runs marriage preparation courses for Muslim couples and other training programmes. The Straits Times has contacted the organisers for comment. In a statement on Monday (July 25) night, a spokesman for the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said the organiser had applied for a permit from the police to hold the event. Under the Public Order Act, a police permit is required for a public assembly whose purpose is to demonstrate support for or opposition to the views or actions of any person, group or government. It is also required for assemblies seeking to publicise a cause or commemorate any event. The organiser told the police that entry to the town hall was by invitation, involving only members of her organisation and invited guests, the spokesman added. The police had assessed that a permit was not required as it was a private event. MHA added: ""Everyone, including religious groups, is entitled to their views on different matters, including on LGBT issues, and to express their views, so long as they do not denigrate any groups of persons, and do not break any laws."" The spokesman also confirmed that police reports have been lodged relating to the town hall. ""We will not be taking any action against the organisers as there is no criminal offence disclosed,"" he added. Correction note: This story has been corrected to say that Mr Jason Wong is a former board member and chairman of Christian organisation Focus on the Family."

Alongside these external events, Singaporeans are coming of age with different aspirations and expectations, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said of why it is timely for the country's fourth-generation (4G) leaders to engage Singaporeans in the year-long Forward Singapore exercise to update the Republic's social compact."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/past-engagements-and-the-changes-they-ushered-in,Past public engagement exercises in Singapore and the changes they ushered in,"SINGAPORE - As the fourth-generation political leaders lead a year-long public consultation to renew the social compact and chart a road map for Singapore for the next decade and beyond, The Straits Times looks at key large-scale reviews and public engagements in the past. The first notable large-scale public engagement exercise was launched after Mr Goh Chok Tong was sworn in as prime minister, and was led by the Long Term National Development Committee. This was a Cabinet sub-committee headed by then Acting Minister for Information George Yeo and consisting of six ministers of state and three top civil servants."

Noting the sometimes fraught state of labour relations elsewhere, Mr Wong said the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) will have to evolve or even reinvent itself in tandem with the times, even as its fundamental role of being the voice and champion of workers remains unchanged. ""If the NTUC remains strong, then we can take heart that we are moving in the right direction, and Singapore will continue to be successful,"" he said. The minister was speaking at the Suntec Singapore Convention Centre during a Young NTUC event called LIT DISCOvery 2022, which is aimed at helping youth learn how to harness technology where they work, live and play. During the event, NTUC launched a task force to better understand the work-life aspirations of youth and support them in their careers. There will be a year-long engagement, after which the task force, chaired by NTUC assistant secretary-general Desmond Choo and led by Young NTUC executive secretary Wendy Tan, will share insights and recommendations on how to better support youth. Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister, said the conversations and insights from the engagement will feed into the broader Forward Singapore exercise, helping to ensure that the concerns and aspirations of a new generation of workers are heard and reflected in Singapore's policies and programmes. Forward Singapore is a national exercise launched by Mr Wong last month. It is aimed at refreshing and strengthening the country's social compact for the next bound of development, with the Republic at a crossroads post-Covid-19. In his speech, Mr Wong also said the state of labour relations gives a clue to the overall health of any society and acts as a litmus test of how strong the society and its social compact are. ""Unfortunately, across most developed countries, labour relations have come down and trade union membership has declined considerably,"" Mr Wong noted. ""Some of it is partly because of very aggressive and confrontational tactics pursued by many trade unions in Western countries in the 1960s and 1970s. They took a strident, aggressive approach and, as a result, they lost the support of the broad middle of their societies."" This, in turn, led to the defeat of social democratic parties in these countries, and the rise of pro-market conservative parties in the 1980s. Mr Wong cited former US president Ronald Reagan and former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher as examples of ""transformative figures"" who were supported by their populations to counter the excesses of those on the political left, including unions. But the decline of unions in these countries was not without cost. Mr Wong noted that, without strong unions and collective bargaining, the wages of rank-and-file workers across Europe and the United States became depressed, which contributed to stagnant wages for many and a greater divide between the haves and the have-nots. ""When the working class becomes a permanent underclass, with very little prospects for advancement, they lose faith in the system and trust breaks down. This is what you see happening in many developed countries,"" the minister said. He noted the recent resurgence of unionisation efforts such as the formation of unions among Starbucks and Amazon workers in the US. Mr Wong said such efforts are an uphill battle as many powerful corporations still see unions as harmful to their growth and profits, and try to clamp down on unions. He added that this leads to trust between employers and workers breaking down further, and that trust can be lost quickly and is hard to restore once eroded. ""It is no wonder that many of these societies have become fraught with tension. There is no consensus on how to move forward to implement important issues and progress becomes ever more elusive."" The lesson for Singapore, and its younger unionists, workers and students in particular, is not to take for granted the Republic's harmonious tripartite relations as they are neither a given nor a natural state of affairs, Mr Wong said. He added: ""We should also not assume that somehow in Singapore, we have some special immunity against the stresses and fissures that have torn through other societies... and we must not assume that we have arrived at the promised land, that we have reached nirvana and have no more room for progress. ""Instead, let us consider how we can build upon the foundation that we have today - this strong foundation of trust to further strengthen the labour movement - and do our utmost to not just preserve what we have inherited, but to make it better. ""To do that, the NTUC must continue to be forward-looking and progressive, especially as we refresh our social compact."""

The Taoiseach is the Irish Prime Minister. The leaders discussed domestic and global developments, including the war in Ukraine and its impact on global energy markets, particularly renewable energy, said PM Lee in a Facebook post on Friday. He added that they addressed areas for further cooperation, such as trade and investment, green growth, food security and climate change. The two countries have maintained diplomatic relations since 1974, with Ireland opening its embassy here in 2000, PM Lee noted. ""We are in very different parts of the world, but we are both similarly small countries in our own regions relying heavily on foreign trade for our living,"" he wrote. ""I look forward to our countries working together in these areas and more."" In a statement on Friday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Mr Martin also met Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong. They reaffirmed the importance of upholding a rules-based multilateral system. They also discussed the challenges of climate change and rising food and energy prices, and agreed that there was room for further cooperation in areas such as sustainable development and low-carbon solutions, the ministry added. In a statement on Friday, the Department of the Taoiseach said this is the first visit by a Taoiseach to Singapore since 2014. It added that the prime ministers also had an exchange on the death penalty and LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) rights. The Taoiseach also attended a business lunch hosted by Irish agencies including Enterprise Ireland, investment agency IDA Ireland and food agency Bord Bia, and was to attend an Irish community reception before leaving Singapore on Friday evening. On Friday morning, he also visited the Changi Chapel and Museum. His uncle Philip Martin, who was with the British Royal Engineers, was a prisoner of war (POW) at the Changi prison camp for more than three years during the Japanese Occupation. The museum contains exhibits on what happened at the Changi prison camp during World War II. The names of POWs held at the camp have also been digitised, and Mr Martin viewed his uncle's name on a display screen. Mr Martin wrote in the museum's guest book: ""Thank you for a most informative and insightful guide of Changi. It was a most moving and emotional experience particularly to see my uncle Philip's name on the screen. History and archives are so important."""

Associate Professor Lim will be away from Monday (July 18) to Aug 8. In a Facebook post on Monday, Prof Lim said former WP MPs Low Thia Khiang and Png Eng Huat will be temporarily taking over his constituency responsibilities, with the help of volunteers. Mr Low, 65, former WP chief and a former Aljunied GRC MP; and Mr Png, 60, a former Hougang MP, had both retired from electoral politics at the 2020 General Election. In response to queries from The Straits Times, a WP spokesman said on Tuesday that Mr Low will be covering the estate walks, while Mr Png will take over the Meet-the-People Sessions in Anchorvale, which is Prof Lim's ward in the group representation constituency. She added that Mr Low had been on an estate walk on Tuesday morning. ""Prior to his departure, Jamus had doubled up on house visits and will double up upon his return to stay on schedule. He will still be available virtually to attend to other responsibilities as an MP, such as town council meetings,"" said the spokesman. Prof Lim, 46, an associate professor of economics at the Asia-Pacific campus of Essec Business School near Buona Vista, said he will also continue to be available to help with residents' concerns virtually. He added that he will be back to catch up with residents on National Day and meet them at related festivities. Sengkang GRC currently has three MPs - Prof Lim, Ms He Ting Ru and Mr Louis Chua - following the resignation of Ms Raeesah Khan last year. Prof Lim will be in California, where he is attending the annual Draper Hills Summer Fellow Programme, which began in 2005, at Stanford University's Centre on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law. According to the school's website, it is a three-week training programme for global democratic leaders holding senior roles in their respective fields such as business, government or the non-profit sector. This year's programme participants comprise 32 leaders from 26 countries who were selected from hundreds of applicants. Fellows will stay on the Stanford campus and attend classes conducted by Stanford faculty, visit Silicon Valley technology firms and connect with peers."

Highlighting the importance of such international collaboration in achieving these green aims, Second Minister for Trade and Industry Tan See Leng and the United States Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm underscored the importance of energy cooperation between the two countries. The two leaders, who met on the sidelines of the US-South-east Asia Clean Energy Roundtable at the Shangri-La Hotel on Thursday (July 14), affirmed the importance of strengthened US-Singapore cooperation on energy security, clean energy transitions and regional energy interconnectivity. In a joint ministerial statement, they said that they welcomed efforts by policymakers, the private sector and financiers to scale up the deployment of renewables and emerging low-carbon energy technologies in the region. ""Stronger public-private partnerships are needed to further advance regional clean energy transitions. Companies should continue to actively innovate and drive sustainability at the core of their business models,"" said the leaders. Welcoming deeper cooperation to enhance energy security and strengthen grid resilience, the ministers expressed interest in a feasibility study on enhancing energy connectivity in the region. ""Enhancing energy connectivity would enable mutual support for the region's power systems, while facilitating regional power electricity trading,"" they said. In a speech at the event, Dr Tan said that the Asean region needs to scale up its deployment of low-carbon technologies that are already commercially available and cost-competitive. It also needs to work together on emerging technologies such as hydrogen, and to make the transition to clean energy in a pragmatic manner. Emerging regions like South-east Asia face the continued challenge of managing increasing energy demand with economic growth. Dr Tan noted that the International Energy Agency estimates that the Asia-Pacific will account for half of the expected growth in global gas demand up to 2025. He also said that gas use in the region could increase by 40 per cent between 2020 and 2030, according to the South-east Asia Energy Outlook 2022 report. Calling this increase significant, Dr Tan stressed that even as efforts to deploy renewable energy are accelerated, work needs to continue to ensure that there are sufficient investments in gas supply chains to meet the growth in its demand. ""The choices we make now are going to set the direction of the energy transition for several generations to come,"" he said."

In a letter to Mr Kishida on Friday (July 15), PM Lee said: ""While your party's success comes at a time of grief given the recent passing of former prime minister Shinzo Abe, the election results are a strong signal of the Japanese people's trust and confidence in your government and leadership."" Mr Kishida's incumbent Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its coalition partner won a convincing majority in Japan's Upper House of Parliament in an election on July 10, two days after Mr Abe was killed by a lone gunman at a campaign rally. PM Lee said that Singapore and Japan enjoy an excellent and multifaceted partnership, underpinned by warm people-to-people ties and close cooperation across many sectors. He added that during the two leaders' recent meetings in Tokyo and Singapore, they expanded collaboration in many areas including digitalisation, innovation and defence. ""We also agreed to explore further collaboration in the economic sphere and on the full resumption of cross-border travel. I look forward to continue working with you to further enhance our ties. ""I wish you good health and every success, and look forward to meeting you again soon,"" PM Lee said in the letter. PM Lee made a working visit to Tokyo in May in conjunction with the 27th International Conference on the Future of Asia, where he met Mr Kishida.

This is especially so given today's challenging times, PM Lee said on Tuesday (July 12) at the PAP's appreciation dinner for its MPs who retired at the last general election. Thanking the 20 MPs who retired in 2020, PM Lee said the PAP continues to need new generations of people to come forward, enter the political arena and fight for the support of Singaporeans. Such men and women must not only possess integrity, commitment and ability, but also ""the grit to take the rough and tumble of politics, and the passion and imagination to build a better Singapore"", said PM Lee, who is also the PAP's secretary-general. As he paid tribute to the retired MPs for their various community activities and constituency projects that have benefited their residents, PM Lee said most important was their political work to mobilise support for the PAP and win votes in elections. ""We must never do things solely for political advantage, but unless good policies and good work translate into votes and electoral success, they cannot endure,"" he told attendees at the dinner held at Parliament House. Addressing the 100-strong audience - which includes current MPs and the party's branch chairs - PM Lee quelled the notion that PAP MPs are all cut from the same cloth. ""Some think that since PAP MPs all wear white and white, they are also monochrome in their ideas and perspectives,"" he said. ""But this view is quite mistaken."" In fact, the PAP does its utmost to field a diverse team at each election and ensures that every MP brings something different to the table, he said. These varied perspectives help make the Government's policies more rounded and robust, he added. ""We must maintain this diversity in our ranks, keep our party a broad tent, and field the best possible team in the next general election,"" said the Prime Minister. ""And that work is under way."" PM Lee also presented valedictory letters to 13 of the 20 retired MPs. They are Mr Ang Hin Kee, Mr Cedric Foo, Mr Charles Chong, Dr Chia Shi-Lu, Professor Fatimah Lateef, Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar, Ms Lee Bee Wah, Mr Lee Yi Shyan, Dr Lily Neo, Mr Ong Teng Koon, Dr Teo Ho Pin, Mr Yee Chia Hsing and Mr Zainal Sapari. The other seven - Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, Mr Khaw Boon Wan, Mr Lim Hng Kiang, Mr Lim Swee Say, Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, Mr Teo Ser Luck and Mr Sam Tan - had already received their letters when they stepped down from political office. The longest-serving of the 20 retired MPs is ESM Goh, who served 10 terms or 43 years since 1977, followed by Mr Charles Chong, who served seven terms or 31 years since 1989. In his speech at the dinner, PM Lee noted that the appreciation dinner was customarily held soon after each general election, but had been postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In preparing the valedictory letters, he said he was struck afresh by the wide range of issues that the retired MPs handled, the diversity of projects they implemented, as well as the intensity of their engagements with both residents and community groups in order to win their support and consolidate the ground. Different MPs championed different issues close to their hearts, while others shaped their constituencies through various projects, he noted. Former Jalan Besar GRC MP Lily Neo spoke passionately for the elderly and under-privileged, said PM Lee. Some initiated schemes to expand common spaces, mobilised residents and brought different groups together to build the community spirit. For example, Dr Teo Ho Pin, former Bukit Panjang MP and mayor of the North West District, popularised brisk walking groups in Bukit Panjang and North West Community Development Council, which grew into a national network, said PM Lee. The Prime Minister said he was grateful that the outgoing MPs appreciated the need for the PAP to keep up leadership renewal and to make sure that Singapore always has the strongest team to lead it. He thanked them for making way for their successors, and for guiding and supporting them. Prof Fatimah, who was formerly MP for Marine Parade GRC and served for three terms, told The Straits Times that her time in politics taught her that serving patients and constituents has many evidence-based similarities. For instance, excellent communication is needed, just like for a doctor's bedside manner, and clinical reasoning was useful in solving problems for her residents, just as it is for diagnosing her patients. The emergency department senior consultant at Singapore General Hospital quipped: ""Medicine and politics - not a difficult mixture to swallow."" Mr Yee, who was Chua Chu Kang GRC MP for one term, said it was good to have the chance to catch up with his comrades after two years of Covid-19. ""(I have) many happy memories and made a lot of friends with volunteers and residents,"" he said of his time in politics. Dr Chia, who was Tanjong Pagar GRC MP for two terms, said he was very proud of having been able to advance healthcare in Singapore, as chair of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Health for several years. ""It was one of my personal and stated reasons for entering politics, and I felt proud and honoured to have been able to contribute in this respect."" He added that his most memorable moment was from the hustings in 2011 and 2015. ""Nothing really prepares you for the sheer passion and energy you feel during the days of campaigning,"" he said. Asked what he will remember most from politics, Mr Lim Swee Say said it is the countless chit-chats he had with his residents to know their concerns and aspirations, and to help them appreciate the reasons behind government policy. His top tip for the latest batch of new MPs: “People do not care how much we know until they know how much we care. So engage our residents deeply and pursue solutions innovatively.”

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/civil-servants-must-take-charge-of-own-learning-and-growth-chan-chun-sing,Civil servants must take charge of own learning and growth: Chan Chun Sing,"SINGAPORE - Since last year, civil servant Samuel Tan has been embedded with e-commerce company Shopee, where his work is to understand business models in various markets, identify opportunities and develop solutions to capture them. Mr Tan, who has been a civil servant for 16 years, took up the post to help him gain a deeper understanding of technology, which will serve him well on his return to the public service later this year. Mr Tan, 41, said: ""I saw it as a natural progression from my work in the Infocomm and Media Development Authority (IMDA) that would enable me to pick up new skill sets and gain new insights related to the technology sector."" Minister-in-charge of the public service Chan Chun Sing said on Friday (July 8) that other public servants should take the chance to get exposure like Mr Tan, and take charge of their own growth and development. Speaking at the One Public Service Observance Ceremony, which is part of the annual Public Service Week, Mr Chan, who is also Education Minister, said: ""With the new skills, insights, and network that Samuel picked up at Shopee, he is much better equipped to drive digitalisation and tech talent development for the nation back at IMDA."" Adopting lifelong learning is essential for both individual public officers and the service as a whole to stay relevant so that it is ready to take on the complex challenges of the future, said Mr Chan. He added that starting from this year, each public officer can also use up to 40 hours a year to pursue developmental opportunities with private, social, and non-profit organisations. Public Service Week has been held since 2008 to celebrate and recognise the work of government officers. Friday's event at the HDB Auditorium in Toa Payoh was attended virtually and in-person by about 15,000 public servants from across the Government. Mr Chan said Singapore's public service must also be agile and collaborative if it is to steer Singapore successfully through the coming period of global political and economic instability and change. How nimble it is will determine if Singapore can seize opportunities within the challenges, and secure its future, he said. Citing how the public service was swift to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic and how it is now cross-training its officers in front-line services, he said: ""We were able to do these (measures against Covid-19) in an agile and coordinated manner because of our early steps to form cross-functional teams like the multi-ministry task force on the virus and the Homefront Crisis Executive Group. ""Working together gave agencies a deep understanding of the challenges that we were all facing together. It gave us a deep sense of trust in one another. This is the 'secret sauce' that allows us to be agile."" The service must also cultivate a culture of collaboration, said Mr Chan, adding that no single agency has a monopoly of knowledge or skills. In tackling climate change, for instance, various agencies are working with businesses, households and individuals to bring Singapore's carbon emissions to net zero by the middle of this century. Besides collaboration at agency level, all officers are encouraged to work with one another, said Mr Chan. He said: ""The next lap of our nation building will not just be about how well we do as a public service. ""It will also be about how well we bring the rest of the country along with us, where everyone feels a sense of commitment in this journey ahead. It is not just about delivering for our people. It is about delivering with our people."""

As Singapore's daily Covid-19 cases crossed the 12,000 mark this week - fuelled by the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron sub-variants - several politicians became part of the statistics. Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin was among them, and said on Monday (July 4) that he had tested positive for the coronavirus. As a result, he had to miss this week's Parliament sitting, and could not host his Malaysian counterpart, Dewan Rakyat Speaker Tan Sri Azhar Azizan Harun, and his delegation when they visited Parliament House on Tuesday. But perhaps the biggest loss was not being able to attend his daughter's commencement ceremony as she graduated from the National University of Singapore. ""Sadly have to miss this event!!"" Mr Tan said, followed by a teary-eyed emoji. ""Already missed my son's OCS (Officer Cadet School) commissioning... and now this… Stars aren't aligned,"" he said on Facebook. Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong, who also had the bug, had to sit out the Disability Sports Awards on Wednesday. Mr Tong said he elected to stay away from the ceremony despite having passed the seven-day period since he first tested positive in an abundance of caution. ""I decided to stay away, given that many athletes are training, and will be travelling to Asean Para Games shortly,"" he said. Amid the current Omicron wave, MPs like Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC), Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC) and Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar GRC) went around this week to remind residents to get boosted. Mobile vaccination centres have been set up around Singapore so that those eligible can get their booster vaccination dose easily. Mr Sharael, who visited the mobile vaccination centre at Block 484 Pasir Ris Drive 4, observed turnout was good, and one residents even remarked that it was as convenient and ""as fast as McDonald's drive-through"". As Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung noted in a Facebook post on Wednesday, this is the first time that Singapore will be going through a Covid-19 wave without much safe management measures - like group size and venue capacity limits - in force. ""The weight is mostly on our healthcare system and its workers - our nurses, our doctors, our medical personnel, to manage and care for the patients who need hospitalisation,"" he said after the annual Nurses' Merit Award ceremony on Wednesday. ""They are working flat out as we weather through this wave. They are the backbone of our healthcare system. Without them, our system cannot stand."" Just what do MPs do? That was on the mind of Kristen, a primary school student from Fengshan who had been waiting patiently for her MP, Ms Cheryl Chan (East Coast GRC), to visit so she could get a first-hand answer. Ms Chan did not say what exactly she told Kristen, but after the conversation, the girl was asked by her grandmother if she wanted to be an MP now that she knew what the job entailed. The girl shook her head immediately and said: ""Too much work."" Relating the incident in a Facebook post, Ms Chan said: ""Such innocence and honesty of a child."" Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson) was also chuffed after a young resident said it like it is. During a block visit, she had showed the little girl a picture of the younger of her two sons, as they are the same age. ""I asked my little resident if my younger son was handsome,"" she said. Later in the comments under the post, she said: ""I am delighted to share that… she said yes."" One netizen teased: ""Wah... finding future daughter-in-law liao?"" Interactions with children seem to be one of the more enjoyable parts of the job, if MPs' social media posts are anything to go by. For instance, Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah GRC) was tickled even though he was bludgeoned by a little girl. ""Lovely to meet Mr Chris de Silva and his daughter, Cassandra, whom (I think) was trying to bless me with her balloon sculpture! Mr de Silva was as surprised as I was!"" he said in a Facebook post accompanied by smiling emojis. It was Singapore Armed Forces Day last Friday (July 1), and several MPs took to social media to mark the period of their lives when they went from ah boys to men. Calling national service a rite of passage and a brotherhood, Mr de Souza said today's world has made the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) even more relevant to protecting Singapore's sovereignty. ""Alliances, good international relationships and, of course, our armed forces' own innate capability are key,"" he said accompanied by a photo of himself in uniform, alongside his fellow NSmen in 163 Squadron. ""These are lessons which NS and my father have taught me. I believe these life lessons to be true."" Mr Desmond Tan (Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC), who is deputy secretary-general of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), said in his own Facebook post that he had ""spent and gained from the SAF"" over a 28-year career. Mr Tan held various key appointments in the Ministry of Defence and the Singapore Armed Forces including as Chief of Staff (General Staff), Director of Joint Operations and Chief Guards Officer before he joined politics. He said: ""I didn't plan how I would end my journey, but I gave my best at every step, focused on my task at hand and people around me. I'm indebted to this great organisation that has kept us strong and free."" Meanwhile, Leader of the Opposition and Workers' Party chief Pritam Singh said he was grateful to the SAF ""for all the friends made, life lessons taught and learnt, and the small part each of us was able to play (and in many cases, are still playing) in contributing to the defence of Singapore"". Resharing a group photo of his 35 Singapore Combat Engineers platoon, Mr Singh said it is not enough to hope and pray that war never comes to Singapore. ""A strong, capable and credible SAF plays an oversized role in keeping the peace - while being operationally ready for war,"" he said. Not to be outdone by the ""boys"", Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang GRC) - who was a helicopter pilot in the military before politics - shared a snapshot from her days in basic military training as an 18-year-old. ""Good old memories"", she said of her time in Officer Cadet School, as she thanked SAF servicemen and women for their sacrifices and contributions. NTUC secretary-general Ng Chee Meng, who flew high (literally and figuratively) before joining politics - as a fighter pilot and then as Chief of Defence Force - meanwhile spent part of SAF Day watching the latest Tom Cruise blockbuster, Top Gun: Maverick. ""Finally found the time to enjoy the movie and relive the Top Gun days!"" he quipped in a Facebook post. He even wore a bomber jacket with his old Air Force call sign: Camel."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/imagine-and-explore-the-singapore-of-2030-with-ips-web-app,Imagine and explore the Singapore of 2030 with IPS Web app,"SINGAPORE - By 2030, Singapore could become ""Cosmopura"", a place where there is strong regional cooperation but where domestic climate protests are common affairs and high income inequality has taken root. Or it could turn into ""Bukit Mampus"", a dystopia where nothing is working out at home and abroad and its citizens feel a sense of dejection. Mampus means die in Malay. It could also become ""Soma-stan"", a version of Singapore where people feel lulled into complacency and there is little impetus to beat what the region can offer. These three visions of the future are currently the front runners of what Singapore could look like in 2030, based on the inputs of about 700 participants in a new interactive, game-like Web app launched by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) in May. Known as Quest2030, the app hopes to engage the public in reimagining the country's future, said IPS deputy director Gillian Koh at a media briefing on Thursday (July 7). She said: ""It asks how Singapore will respond over the decade, through this period of radical uncertainty, and invites members of the public to share their views on key trends and in that way, craft alternative possible futures of Singapore."" On entering the app, participants are asked to fill in their feelings on how Singapore will fare in three areas: a sense of agency, economic inequality and regional cooperation. These choices lead to one of eight future Singapores, such as Cosmopura and Bukit Mampus, which participants can then explore through the Web app, encountering potential headlines, objects and reimagined spaces such as a virtual Hong Lim Park. Participants are also asked to choose a guide from a range of eight characters, including activists, lawyers, retirees and hawkers, and are able to see how their version of Singapore in 2030 will affect these characters' lives and livelihoods. They can also answer additional questions and simulate decision-making for the country on issues such as openness to talent, which may then cause their version of future Singapore to change and evolve into another. IPS hopes to attract more than 20,000 participants for Quest2030. The app is part of the third phase of the think-tank's Reimagining Singapore 2030 exercise that began in 2020. This phase also included a series of focus group discussions. Data from the app, which is anonymous but collects some demographic information like age and race, will be used in the final phase of the exercise, which involves the development of recommendations, action plans and pilot programmes to tackle policy problems of the future, Dr Koh said. The app can be found at this website and will run at least until the middle of August, IPS said."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/pm-lee-dpm-wong-meet-foreign-ministers-in-singapore,"PM Lee, DPM Wong, meet foreign ministers in Singapore","SINGAPORE - Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong met the foreign ministers of three countries - Australia, South Korea and South Africa - on Wednesday (July 6). In a Facebook post on Wednesday afternoon, PM Lee said he met the three foreign ministers separately. During his meeting with Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, he expressed Singapore's interest in enhancing the Republic's comprehensive strategic partnership with Australia. The Green Economy Agreement that both sides are negotiating is one way to enhance the partnership, he said. He added: ""I look forward to visiting Australia later this year to meet (Australian Prime Minister) Anthony Albanese for the Annual Leaders' meeting."" Established under the auspices of the comprehensive strategic partnership, it is an annual meeting between the prime ministers of both countries, set to be held for the seventh time. Mr Lee also met Dr Park Jin, South Korea's newly appointed foreign minister, who is on his introductory visit to Singapore. ""Our countries have cooperated closely in trade and digitalisation, and we hope to explore new collaborations in other sectors, such as innovation and smart cities,"" said Mr Lee, adding that he welcomed South Korea's continuing efforts to deepen its engagement with the region. Mr Lee also said he had an engaging discussion with South African Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor on regional and global developments. ""We also shared our thoughts on how Singapore and South Africa could work more closely together for mutual benefit. ""Singapore values its friendship with South Africa, and I look forward to further building on these strong ties."" Summing up the visits, Mr Lee said: ""We took stock of our countries' cooperation in various areas and looked towards exploring new collaborations and opportunities."" ""Singapore values our good relations with other countries, and we seek to strengthen our bilateral ties on the basis of shared interests and mutual benefit,"" he added, wishing the foreign ministers a pleasant and productive stay in Singapore. Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong met with Ms Wong and Indian foreign minister S Jaishankar separately. Mr Wong said he discussed with Dr Jaishankar areas for bilateral cooperation as well as broader geopolitical developments. Mr Wong also said that he looked forward to further strengthen the Singapore-India partnership. As for his meeting with Ms Wong, Mr Wong said they had a wide-ranging conversation on geopolitical and Covid-19 developments, as well as climate change, and emphasised the longstanding and strong relationship between both countries underpinned by the comprehensive strategic partnership."

For the second time this week, cost-of-living challenges were raised in Parliament. Workers' Party MP Jamus Lim (Sengkang GRC), in his adjournment motion on the use of macroeconomic policy to combat inflation, said that ""when the prices of what we eat, getting to work, and keeping our homes and businesses running are all rising rapidly, this isn't an inflation problem any longer""."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/parenting-education/salaries-of-teachers-counsellors-and-other-moe-officers-being-reviewed-chan-chun-sing,"Salaries of teachers, counsellors and other MOE officers being reviewed: Chan Chun Sing","SINGAPORE - Salaries of teachers, counsellors and other officers on Ministry of Education (MOE) schemes are currently under review, said Education Minister Chan Chun Sing on Tuesday (July 5). In a written parliamentary reply, Mr Chan said the MOE is working with the Public Service Division on this review. The last two salary reviews for teachers were in October 2015 and September 2012. In 2012, teachers and allied educators received a pay rise of between 5 and 15 per cent. Classroom teachers got an 8 per cent raise, which was meant to keep pace with the market, MOE said at that time. The 2015 review led to a 4 per cent to 9 per cent increase for teachers. He was responding to a question from Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah GRC) on whether his ministry would consider giving greater pay incentives to school counsellors across primary, secondary and tertiary institutions to attract sufficient counsellors of the highest quality and ensure low student-to-counsellor ratios. Mr Chan added that MOE and the institutes of higher learning periodically review salaries of staff to ensure pay packages remain competitive. Adjustments are also made, where necessary, to keep pace with the market, he added. Said Mr Chan: ""Besides competitive remuneration, counsellors are provided opportunities for professional development and growth, which is important for staff attraction and retention. ""MOE supports counsellors in honing their counselling competencies through courses and regular clinical supervision and consultation sessions with their clinical supervisor."" He did not elaborate on when the review would be completed, or by how much salaries would be adjusted. In June, the Government said 23,000 civil servants will get a pay rise of between 5 per cent and 14 per cent from Aug 1 this year. Mr Patrick Tay, who chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for Education, said the review was timely so that educators and those in MOE-specific jobs are fairly and competitively remunerated to keep pace with the overall rise in wages across different sectors. Mr Mike Thiruman, general secretary of the Singapore Teachers’ Union, said the union had been looking forward to a salary review.  He said such a review was an important signal that Singapore as a society values its teachers and the sacrifices they make.  “Teachers’ workloads have increased because of the pandemic. Regardless of the pandemic, the duties of a teacher have become more complex,” said Mr Thiruman. He added  the union was hoping for a substantial increase in the salaries of teachers at all grades, but it would be significant if this review could take into account years of service.  A review every three to five years would be appropriate as there are rapid developments in the market, he said. “We understand that this time around, Singapore had to address the pandemic situation first since late 2019,” added Mr Thiruman. Sengkang MP He Ting Ru said that other factors which raise teachers’ turnover rates, including working hours and administrative duties, should be regularly reviewed along with pay in a holistic fashion. "
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/additional-duties-on-property-transfers-into-trusts-are-not-meant-to-be-wealth-taxes-chee-hong-tat,Additional duties on property transfers into trusts are not meant to be wealth taxes: Chee Hong Tat,"SINGAPORE - Additional duties on property transfers and stake transfers in property holding entities to nameless living trusts are not meant to be wealth taxes but are instead part of market cooling measures, Senior Minister of State for Finance Chee Hong Tat said on Tuesday (July 5). He was responding in Parliament to questions from four MPs about proposed changes in the law aimed at plugging a gap in the existing stamp duty regime. Transfers of stakes in a property holding entity into living trusts with non-identifiable owners will be subject to additional conveyance duties (ACD) of up to 44 per cent if the new Bill is passed. Property holding entities include asset holding companies and family offices' fund vehicles which have their tangible assets mainly in residential properties in Singapore. The ACD (Trust) duties will be payable on such transfers executed from May 10 and in situations where the significant ownership threshold has been reached. This means it will apply to a person who beneficially owns at least 50 per cent of the equity interests or voting power in the entity. Under the proposed changes, a stamp duty is also imposed when interest in a residential property held on trust is renounced by a beneficial owner. These changes affect people such as high-net-worth individuals who have been trying to use a nameless trust to avoid taxes. Mr Chee said they are not expected to affect Singapore's position as a wealth management hub, in response to questions by Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang GRC) on the move's impact on the country's hub status and its contribution to tax revenue. He said: ""ABSD (additional buyer's stamp duty) or ACD already apply to purchases of residential properties in Singapore, or transfers of equity interests in property holding entities as part of our property market cooling measures. ""The proposed amendments in this Bill are to ensure a fair and consistent tax treatment when such purchases or transfers are made through trusts."" The changes follow the introduction of ABSD for trust, or ABSD (Trust) which took effect on May 9. Under the rule, transfers of residential properties into a living trust are subject to an ABSD of 35 per cent, even if there is no identifiable beneficial owner at the time the property is transferred. Workers' Party MP Louis Chua (Sengkang GRC) asked why the changes were not implemented earlier, what was the volume and value of such transactions that made use of this gap in the regime, and if there was an increase in transactions that prompted the Finance Ministry's review. Mr Chee said that before ABSD (Trust) was introduced, transfers of residential properties into a trust with an identifiable beneficial owner were subject to ABSD. Such transfers were not separately tracked before May 9 and were instead accounted for according to the profile of the identifiable beneficial owner, he said. ""ABSD would not apply before May 9 for trusts which do not have an identifiable beneficial owner, and this is what the proposed changes... seek to address, to ensure that ABSD and ACD continue to remain relevant as property market cooling measures, irrespective of whether trusts are used,"" added Mr Chee. Trusts can be set up for various reasons, including non-tax purposes such as to provide for charitable giving, he said. ""Given the diversity and complexity of trust instruments, we decided to study the proposed changes carefully, and do a thorough review so that we could achieve our policy objectives while avoiding unintended consequences,"" he added. Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC) asked how the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras) determines the existence of an associate relationship between parties with an oral or implied agreement, or an arrangement to acquire, hold or dispose of equity interests and exercise votes in a property holding entity. Examples of associates include parents, children, spouses and associated companies. Mr Chee said such relationships are already factored in under the existing ACD regime, and Iras examines supporting documents that include a declaration of associates and equity interests in the property holding entities they beneficially own. Progress Singapore Party Non-Constituency MP Leong Mun Wai said Singapore has a tax regime that favours the rich, citing examples such as a lack of capital gains taxes and low personal income taxes, and added that loopholes should be dealt with strictly. Mr Chee said in response that Singapore's system of taxes and benefits is fair and progressive when considered as a whole. He added: ""Everybody contributes, but those who earn more and have more will contribute more, while those who have less and are more vulnerable, the lower income, they will receive more benefits and more help."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/jamus-lim-and-alvin-tan-spar-over-response-to-cost-of-living-issues,Jamus Lim and Alvin Tan spar over response to cost-of-living issues,"SINGAPORE - Prices of food, transportation and energy here have been going up so fast that Singapore is now facing a cost-of-living crisis, said Workers' Party MP Jamus Lim on Tuesday (July 5). He added in Parliament that the situation has gone beyond an inflation problem, and stressed that the Government must do more to help. ""When the prices of what we eat, getting to work, and keeping our homes and businesses running are all rising rapidly, this isn't an inflation problem any longer,"" he said. ""It is a cost-of-living crisis. It is therefore incumbent on policymakers to do what they can to alleviate the pain felt by the people."" Associate Professor Lim (Sengkang GRC) suggested several ways this could be done, including strengthening the Singapore dollar and spending more funds to support those who need it the most. In response, Minister of State for Trade and Industry Alvin Tan said that the Government plans and executes its fiscal policies for the long term, but maintains dexterity to zoom into details that matter on the ground to Singaporeans as well as local businesses. Its approach focuses on strong job creation and wage growth as the best ways to help Singaporeans tide over the current economic difficulties, and on making sure that the country has sufficient resources to tackle long-term challenges. ""This mindset and bias towards action have allowed us to weather storms and seize opportunities throughout our history. This is the hallmark of our government,"" he said. ""This is our commitment to Singapore, and we will continue to do our utmost to deliver on this commitment. Especially in these challenging times."" Mr Tan added that there is a need to recognise the global nature of price pressures that Singapore is facing. The sharp rise in food and oil prices since the fourth quarter of last year principally reflects the effects of serious disruption of global supply, including the Ukraine conflict, he said. “It is inevitable that some of these price increases will affect our economy.” On strengthening the Singapore dollar, Prof Lim said that doing so will reduce the cost of imported goods and services. A stronger currency could lower domestic inflation as well, given how so much of what is consumed here is imported. He added that there is ample evidence that such strengthening is affordable, given how standard metrics for comparing the under and overvaluation of the Singapore dollar suggest that it is significantly undervalued. Doing so could be as simple as ceasing interventions that restrain Singapore's exchange rate, and allowing foreign exchange markets to work, he said. ""This is a luxury that precious few countries can afford, but one that we can leverage now."" Mr Tan said Singapore's central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), takes several factors into account when it comes to the exchange rate. Strengthening this rate cannot fully offset global prices without causing immediate negative consequences on growth, and therefore, the labour market, he warned. He said this is why many advanced central banks are guarded in the speed and the extent to which they will raise interest rates. ""Monetary policy action in and of themselves have attendant spillover effects that must be taken into account in the uncertain challenging economic environment. Therefore, a judicious blend of tight monetary policy and targeted supportive fiscal policy that is carefully calibrated is most appropriate,"" he said. Singapore maintains a stable macroeconomic environment so businesses and households can make economic decisions with confidence, said Mr Tan. He noted that a core tenet is Singapore’s exchange rate-centred monetary policy, which has helped the country manage inflation.  “During this period of rising inflationary pressures, MAS has pre-emptively tightened monetary policy since October last year. This longstanding policy has directly helped dampen imported inflation,” he said.  For instance, while global food commodity prices increased by an average of 25.4 per cent year on year over the first five months of 2022, domestic food prices increased by an average of 3.6 per cent year on year over the same period, he noted. He also cited how even as global energy prices rose by 27.5 per cent, energy-related components in Singapore’s consumer price index, which include the cost of electricity, gas and petrol, increased by 13.6 per cent year on year between January and May. Another point Prof Lim made was that policies involving Singaporeans on fixed incomes have to be adjusted. He said that for such people, who include retirees drawing from their Central Provident Fund (CPF) accounts or needy families on the Government's ComCare financial assistance scheme, inflation can be devastating. ""An elderly person spending $20 a day may now be able to buy only one prata instead of two for breakfast, be forced to skip their afternoon tea, or order two instead of three items of cai png (mixed rice),"" he said. ""And what's worse, this diminished consumption will be with them for the rest of their lives, even when inflation has returned to normal rates, because elevated prices do not automatically come back down even when inflation disappears."" While financial markets can and do adjust returns to reflect higher inflation, this is not the case for those locked in fixed-income streams, added Prof Lim. He suggested that ComCare assistance be raised permanently and universally by a ""margin that reflects the excess inflation experienced by families for this year"". He also suggested that the Government roll out a temporary increase in CPF interest rates of around 2 percentage points for a six-month period, which would be consistent with the increase in inflation and could be funded by increasing the returns paid on Special Singapore Government Securities (SSGS). SSGS are non-tradable bonds issued to the CPF to meet its investment needs for Singaporeans' retirement. Mr Tan said that Singapore's current round of combined fiscal and monetary policy responses are expected to contain medium-term inflation without significant loss of output or inadvertently add to the underlying tightness of the economy. When it comes to financial assistance programmes, inflation is one of many factors that the Government takes into account, he added. ""On indexing financial assistance payments to inflation, the Government regularly reviews our schemes to take into account needs and affordability. Inflation is one of many factors taken into consideration,"" said Mr Tan."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/mindef-prepared-for-more-athletes-to-disrupt-during-ns-but-they-must-complete-duties-satisfactorily-ng-eng-hen,"More athletes may be allowed to disrupt NS, but they must complete duties satisfactorily","SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Defence (Mindef) is prepared to allow more national athletes to disrupt their full-time national service to train for international competitions, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen told Parliament on Tuesday (July 5). But they must fulfil the full period of their NS obligations after taking time off for training, and perform their duties satisfactorily, he added. ""I am proud that our national athletes understand and accept this duty of NS,"" said Dr Ng said, in response to Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade GRC) and Non-Constituency MP Leong Mun Wai on whether Mindef would hold a dialogue on the expectations of national athletes who are serving NS, and if deferment criteria could be relaxed. Dr Ng noted that no athlete has asked to be exempted from NS duties, including those who have participated in recent international competitions. ""I also know that our national sportsmen want to do well in both - fulfil their NS duties and also win medals for Singapore, at least some of them. Some have achieved it, but it's not easy to attain, and we must not set unrealistic expectations of all of them,"" he said. ""However, for those who want to pursue both goals, Mindef is prepared to allow more to disrupt, to train and compete in international competitions during their full-time NS."" The issue of NS and national athletes came back in the spotlight in May, after swimmer Joseph Schooling said it was challenging to balance NS duties and swimming. He called for a national dialogue to manage expectations of athletes doing NS. In his speech, Dr Ng said high public support for NS has been maintained due to the unequivocal upholding of the principles of universality and equity. This means that all male Singaporeans and permanent residents who are fit and eligible to serve are conscripted as required by the Enlistment Act, and not serve only at a time of their choosing, he added. He said 96 per cent of Singaporeans polled in 2021 by his ministry affirmed that NS was critical for the defence and security of the country. ""Let me tell you, 96 per cent, even for our country, is highly unusual. There are very few questions that you can get above 85, let alone 90 or 95 per cent."" This strong support that Singapore enjoys is an exception, not the norm, compared with other countries with military conscription, said Dr Ng. He added that the list of countries with conscription has shrunk since Singapore started NS in 1967. ""So it would be a serious mistake if we take that affirmation we receive today from Singaporeans for NS, that we take it for granted, or think it came by happenstance."" Noting that NS defaulters can be sentenced to jail for choosing to do NS when and how they like, Dr Ng said deferments and disruptions are thus granted very sparingly - only with adequate justification - and implemented openly. Appeals from sports and arts talents must pass a very high bar, he said. He added that Mindef assesses each request on its own merits, in consultation with the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, and takes into consideration the applicant's past achievement and his potential to excel in international competitions and bring national glory. But deferment and disruption are not a licence to do away with NS obligations, Dr Ng said. The applicant's NS duties must be taken seriously, and he must be trained to be competent in his assigned vocation. This will include periods such as basic military training, specialist and commander's courses, and his unit's key operations, which the applicant must fulfil as part of his NS duties, said Dr Ng. He noted that not all Singaporeans support deferment and disruption for sportsmen, citing how Mindef receives letters from Singaporeans questioning the fairness of the policy when such sportsmen receive financial rewards through endorsements. Others view serving NS as more important, he added. ""I cite these criticisms to show even when sparingly applied, deferments and disruptions can have a pernicious effect, to cause invidious comparisons that some are given preferential treatment and not performing their NS duties."" Short-term disruption or leave for sportsmen to train are allowed only outside critical NS periods, he said, and those who benefited in the recent SEA Games include paddler Koen Pang, hurdler Ang Chen Xiang and triathlete Luke Chua. Swimmers Joseph Schooling and Quah Zheng Wen were granted seven and six years' deferment respectively, as they were judged to have the potential to win medals at the Olympic Games. Mindef will incorporate views from across the spectrum of supporters and detractors of deferment and disruptions for sports and arts talent when the next review of NS policies is convened, Dr Ng added."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/changes-to-cancer-coverage-a-challenge-to-some-patients-but-benefits-population-rahayu,Changes to cancer coverage a challenge for some patients but help cut costs: Rahayu,"SINGAPORE - The changes to insurance coverage for cancer treatment may be challenging for some patients, but ""we need to look at the bigger picture and that is to reduce the ever-increasing drug prices"", said Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Health Rahayu Mahzam. Unless something is done to slow the rapidly escalating cost of cancer treatment, ""cancer drugs will eventually be unaffordable for the majority of cancer patients"", she told Parliament on Tuesday (July 5). From September, MediShield Life and MediSave can be used to cover only approved outpatient cancer treatments that are listed on the Cancer Drug List. They cannot pay for treatments not on the list. This will also apply to Integrated Shield Plans from April next year. Replying to a question from Mr Gerald Giam (Aljunied GRC) on the number of patients who will be adversely affected by the changes, Ms Rahayu said this number is ""constantly fluctuating"" but about 10 per cent of treatments used in the public sector are not covered. She did not give a number for those affected in the private sector, which is likely to be higher. Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang GRC) asked if patients who have rare cancers, and need treatment that is not on the list, can appeal, and if so, how long it takes for a decision to be made. Ms Rahayu said: ""It usually takes about five months from submission until the funding decision. And funding implementation typically occurs within four to six months after a funding decision has been made."" She added that about 50 more treatments have been added to the list since it was launched last year. Treatments on the list have to be both effective as well as cost-effective. Mr Giam pointed out that ""for individual cancer patients for whom time is of the essence, anything more than one week may be too long to wait for a decision on a drug subsidy approval"". He asked: ""Can we therefore have a National Cancer Care Appeals Board which can make rigorous yet speedy decisions to subsidise drugs for these patients to get the life-saving drugs that they need?"" Ms Rahayu said such patients can be referred to the public sector where their treatment can be assessed to see if they are appropriate. If they are, such patients can ""get discretionary funding that's available for them and thereby getting treatment at a far lower cost"". Reiterating the Ministry of Health's rationale for the changes, she said: ""It provides the incentive for pharmaceutical companies to price their drugs more reasonably so as to benefit from financing coverage."" Since the announcement in August last year, the public sector has seen an average price cut of 30 per cent for cancer drugs, with some prices falling by as much as 60 per cent. However, there is no similar drop in the price of drugs sold to the private sector, which continues to pay more for many drugs than in countries like Australia and South Korea. Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio GRC) asked if the cheaper prices negotiated for the public sector can be extended to the private sector. Ms Rahayu said the ministry will look into it, but letting the private sector buy at the same price requires the agreement of drug companies. She added: ""The feasibility of applying negotiated drug prices to the private sector really depends on whether the price controls can be introduced to ensure cost savings are passed on to the patients""."

Minister of State for Trade and Industry Low Yen Ling told Parliament that artificially reducing pump prices leads to a market that benefits car owners - who make up a minority of the population - especially those who consume more fuel and who are more well-to-do. Fixing pump prices below market rate also reduces the incentive for drivers to switch to more energy-efficient modes of transport, such as public transport and electric vehicles. ""Instead, the Government's approach is to ensure that we have a competitive fuel retail market,"" she said. ""The Government will review the fuel retail market if there are other ways to alleviate the pressure on fuel prices."" The question of how the Government can help ease the pain of drivers amid surging crude oil prices has been raised by MPs multiple times in recent parliament sittings. On Tuesday, Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang GRC) asked if the Government will regulate pump prices, citing record profits for oil companies, while Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar GRC) asked if a cooperative should be set up to help moderate fuel costs. Ms Low said the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) is monitoring the market closely and will not hesitate to investigate retail operators for anti-competitive behaviour. Establishing a cooperative also may not help, as it can only offer lower pump prices if it can secure lower-cost supplies. The current spike in fuel prices is primarily driven by high demand and insufficient supply, as countries reopen after locking down for the Covid-19 pandemic and amid the ongoing tensions caused by the Russian-Ukraine war. There has also been under-investment in fossil fuel production over the years, Ms Low said. Mr Wee asked her what the aims of the ongoing review of the fuel market are, to which Ms Low said it will cover global developments and the practices of retail operators and their relationship with oil prices. The CCCS has been in touch with retailers for more data on fuel price movements, she said. ""Now, if the findings of the review suggest that there are ways to improve the fuel retail market, I want to assure the member that the Government is certainly open to consider all measures that could enhance the effectiveness of the fuel retail market,"" she added. Last month, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said there will be targeted assistance to less well-to-do groups which are hardest hit by rising fuel costs, such as those who rely on vehicles for their livelihoods. Eligible taxi main hirers and private hire car drivers will receive a one-off relief of $150 in August, while eligible drivers of combi buses and limousines, as well as delivery drivers and delivery motorcycle riders, can also apply for a one-off cash relief of up to $300. According to pump price tracker Fuel Kaki, diesel is being sold at between $3.12 and $3.14 a litre as at Tuesday. The popular 95-octane fuel is being sold at between $3.31 and $3.35 per litre."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/mass-vaccination-against-monkeypox-not-recommended-ong-ye-kung,Mass vaccination against monkeypox not on the cards,"SINGAPORE - Singapore will not hold a nationwide vaccination drive against monkeypox as the public is at low risk of being infected, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung. Globally, there are now more than 5,000 cases of monkeypox. In a July 1 statement, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said monkeypox cases have tripled in the European region over the past two weeks to more than 4,500 laboratory confirmed cases. Mr Ong said that monkeypox is unlikely to become a global pandemic like Covid-19, as transmission requires close or prolonged physical contact with infectious individuals or contaminated material. The WHO had determined that this outbreak does not constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern as at June 23, he noted in a written parliamentary reply on Monday (July 4). ""Unlike Covid-19 vaccination, mass population-wide vaccination with the smallpox vaccine is not recommended as a preventive strategy for monkeypox, in line with international recommendations and the global response thus far,"" said Mr Ong. Although the smallpox vaccine is up to 85 per cent effective at preventing monkeypox, it has potentially severe side effects, he said. For the general population, the risks of complications outweigh the benefits, because they are at low risk of being infected, Mr Ong added. Replying to MPs who had asked about the infectious viral disease during Tuesday's sitting, Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary said monkeypox is a self-limiting illness where patients recover and largely does not cause serious illness. It is also spreading very slowly, relative to Covid-19. ""Smallpox vaccine is available in Singapore, and can be used for, for example, healthcare workers that are at high risk or laboratory personnel that are handling such pathogens,"" said Dr Janil in response to Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang GRC). The smallpox vaccine is being used for monkeypox as the monkeypox virus is closely related to the virus that causes smallpox. Data from the current multi-country outbreak indicated that in Europe - where the majority of recent cases were reported - 99 per cent of the cases were men, and many  were among men who have sex with men. Also, most of the reported cases there have been among people aged between 21 and 40. ""Given that sexual contact with infected individuals appeared to be the main driver of the current monkeypox outbreak, and that transmission requires close physical or prolonged contact, the risk to the general public remains low,"" said Mr Ong. Singapore has so far reported one imported case of monkeypox - a British male flight attendant who was here from June 15 to 17 and then on June 19. He tested positive for monkeypox on June 20. Similar to the management of other emerging infectious diseases, the key to controlling the spread of monkeypox is early diagnosis and isolation of the case, contact tracing and monitoring of close contacts, and quarantining them if necessary, Mr Ong said. To reduce spread, cases are isolated in hospital. Their close contacts will be quarantined for up to 21 days from the last date of exposure for monitoring, and will be offered smallpox vaccines to reduce their risk of infection or severe symptoms, Mr Ong added. Asked about efforts to reach out to more susceptible groups, Dr Janil said there is currently no evidence to suggest that the disease is sexually transmitted. Hence, there is no specific advice beyond general recommendations such as not coming into contact with infectious individuals, and seeking medical care when infected."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/mental-health-task-force-proposes-better-support-for-seniors-youth-and-employees-in-workplace,"Mental health task force proposes better support for seniors, youth and employees in workplace","SINGAPORE - A national task force on mental health will focus on three key areas to support well-being in the community - boosting access to mental health services, strengthening support for youth mental health and stepping up resources for employees in the workplace. During a debate in Parliament on Tuesday (July 5), Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary addressed MPs' concerns regarding mental health support in Singapore and discussed the preliminary recommendations put forth by the Interagency Taskforce on Mental Health and Well-being. In response to questions by Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio GRC), Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar GRC) and Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson), Dr Janil said that the task force is currently conducting a public consultation to seek views on its preliminary recommendations, which will end on Aug 7. ""The findings from the public consultation will enable the task force to refine the recommendations and develop a national strategy on mental health and well-being. Following this, indicators will be developed to measure the implementation progress and effectiveness of the strategy,"" he said. Ms Nadia raised the record number of cases of suicides among seniors in 2020, when there were 154 deaths, the highest since 1991, and asked if there would be special focus on the mental well-being of the elderly and caregivers. In his reply, Dr Janil noted that healthcare providers would take a holistic approach to the well-being of seniors that caters to both their physical and mental health needs. ""Some of the efforts that we're making around the larger strategy of mental health will directly improve access to and services for the elderly. For example... we are looking at community care providers to bring some of the services closer to home, including eldercare centres,"" he added. Noting that the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) was the ""first port-of-call"" for elderly people exhibiting self-harming and aggressive behaviour, Ms Tin asked if the capacity of IMH would be sufficient to deal with such cases. Dr Janil said the task force was trying to shift the perception of IMH as the first and most important point of help and instead, develop a wider network of health and social care organisations to support the needs of seniors. Among the recommendations are the designation of ""first-stop touchpoints"" for residents to find mental health services easily and equipping front-line service providers with the knowledge and training to help residents. To help support employees' welfare in the workplace, the task force proposed improving vocational training and job opportunities for those with mental health conditions, among other suggestions. To better support young people, the task force recommended the development of a parents' toolbox which will enable parents to support children's social-emotional well-being and promoting the positive use of social media and technology. Youth mental health has been in focus in recent months, with the number of suicides among young people aged 10 to 29 hitting a record high of 112 cases in 2021, up by 11 cases from the year before. A spokesman for suicide prevention non-profit Samaritans of Singapore said that the number of suicide cases last year among those in this age group was the most reported since the Samaritans' earliest recorded data in 2000."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/work-injury-compensation-act-may-be-applied-to-employee-like-gig-workers-koh-poh-koon,Work Injury Compensation Act may be applied to 'employee-like' gig workers: Koh Poh Koon,"SINGAPORE - An advisory committee set up last year to better protect platform workers is looking at whether the Work Injury Compensation Act (Wica) can be applied to them to provide greater financial protection when they are injured. The authorities are also working with food and goods delivery companies here to review their work processes after traffic accidents claimed the lives of five delivery platform workers in the past year and a half. Platform workers are workers who rely on online platforms for income, mainly cabbies, private-hire car drivers and deliverymen. They are considered to be self-employed and are not covered under Wica or the Employment Act. In contrast, workers hired by a company to do delivery work are considered employees, and covered under the two laws. But Senior Minister of State for Manpower Koh Poh Koon said in Parliament on Tuesday (July 5) that these workers are in fact more like employees, given the management controls exerted by the platforms and their algorithms. Hence, the advisory committee, after consulting widely, is taking the principle that a delivery gig worker is not dissimilar from a worker who does delivery work as an employee if they provide the same service to people. ""By providing some form of equal principle in terms of protection using the Workplace Injury Compensation Act, we hope to actually cover some of the vulnerabilities of this segment of workers,"" Dr Koh said. ""In principle, there should be no differentiation whether the person's life is worth more or less just because he is being engaged in a different form of employment."" Dr Koh was responding in Parliament to Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong GRC), who had asked why workers in the gig economy cannot be covered under Wica if the law covers employees who have flexible work arrangements. Calling the lack of work injury compensation for gig workers a ""policy lacuna"", Dr Tan said there are broader implications for workplace safety if this gap is not closed. ""What happens if, tomorrow, a marine, manufacturing or construction company decides to gazette their Singaporean workers as self-employed or independent contractors? They would need protections too,"" he said. ""No company should ever be allowed to send the message that when a worker dies, it is, 'you die, your problem'. Because when a worker dies on the job, it is everyone's problem."" In response, Dr Koh said the advisory committee, comprising representatives from the Government, labour movement, industry and academia, has been deliberating these issues. It is expected to give its recommendations later this year. On Dr Tan's point about reclassifying workers, Dr Koh said that in adjudicating such disputes, it is important to look at the nature of engagement between the company and the worker - for example, whether the company has to provide a workplace and equipment, and whether the worker is expected to meet certain key performance indicators. ""In that case, that relationship is more akin to an employer-employee relationship, and the company will then be expected to provide employee benefits to this worker under the Employment Act,"" Dr Koh said. ""It does not matter whether the person is a full-timer or a part-timer, or whether in the contract itself, the company claims this person is self-employed."" Dr Koh added that workers should look closely at the terms of their contractual agreements before they sign them, and approach the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management for help if they are unclear. Dr Koh had raised the idea of applying Wica to gig workers during the debate on his ministry's budget earlier this year, noting that the insurance coverage provided to platform workers is not consistent across companies. Ride-hailing and food delivery giant Grab currently offers free personal accident insurance to its delivery workers when they are using the Grab platform, with a sum insured of US$20,000 (S$28,000) in the case of accidental death or permanent disability. For foodpanda, the sum insured for its active riders is $30,000 for death or permanent disability, while Deliveroo riders get US$45,000 (S$63,000). Under Wica, the minimum compensation for the accidental death of an employee is $76,000 and the maximum is $225,000, depending on age and monthly earnings. The amount payable for permanent incapacity, which includes fractures, sprains and cuts, is between $97,000 and $289,000, but the compensation sum is then adjusted according to the degree of disability. In the light of the recent fatal accidents involving delivery workers, Dr Koh said the Workplace Safety and Health Council is working with food and goods delivery companies to enhance the safety of workers on the road and prevent accidents. More details will be shared when ready. In a separate written reply on Monday (July 4), Manpower Minister Tan See Leng said no delivery employees have died at work in the past five years. Last year, there were 17 work injuries among delivery employees that resulted in permanent incapacity, compared with 16 in 2020, 17 in 2019 and 12 in 2018. The median work injury compensation amount awarded to these workers in those years was $8,951, $15,085, $9,907 and $5,298 respectively."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/support-scheme-for-young-suspects-during-questioning-to-be-expanded-to-cover-those-aged-16-and-17,Support scheme for young suspects during questioning to cover those aged 16 and 17,"SINGAPORE - A scheme under which a trained adult accompanies young suspects during law enforcement interviews will be expanded to cover suspects aged 16 and 17. The Appropriate Adult Scheme for Young Suspects (AAYS) currently applies to suspects under the age of 16. Minister of State for Home Affairs and Social and Family Development Sun Xueling said from April next year, the age threshold will be increased in phases, with the aim to complete the expansion by October next year. She added that MHA is working on building up the trained adult volunteer pool. ""It is accepted that young suspects may require more support during interviews. Thus, as far as possible, police will interview young suspects in a police station, away from their school or place of employment,"" said Ms Sun, who was responding to Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang GRC). She added that if interviews need to be done at the school or place of employment, the police will avoid drawing unnecessary attention or causing embarrassment to the young suspect by dressing in plain clothes and using unmarked vehicles, for example. Ms Sun also said that volunteers undergo structured training, including a one-day session conducted by the Singapore Children's Society. Their training is also supported by the Association of Criminal Lawyers of Singapore, the Law Society of Singapore and the Attorney-General's Chambers. On whether parents could volunteer to be an appropriate adult, she said: ""The parents of suspects may have conflict of interest, or may be perceived to have a conflict of interest, so we will not allow parents of the suspects themselves to be the appropriate adult."" She added that if parents want to volunteer to be appropriate adults for young suspects not related to them, this would be encouraged. The scheme's expansion comes after Minister of State for Home Affairs Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim in November last year said MHA was in the process of reviewing expanding the AAYS to cover those aged 16 and 17. He estimated then that the current pool of 351 volunteers would have to be doubled to cover this group, and that training, which has to be conducted face to face, has been made difficult amid the Covid-19 pandemic. He had mentioned the review of the AAYS in Parliament following the death of Justin Lee, 17, on Sept 16 last year from a fall from height. Justin had earlier been arrested by Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers before being charged in court with drug trafficking. He was not assigned an appropriate adult during questioning since he was 17 at the time. He also informed officers then that he had been diagnosed with depression. A similar appropriate adult scheme provides support for the mentally vulnerable, such as those with mental disabilities or mental health issues. However, CNB said last October that Justin was observed not to show signs of distress during the interviews."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/spore-near-or-at-peak-of-current-covid-19-wave-with-cases-expected-to-cross-12k-ong-ye-kung,S'pore near or at peak of current Covid-19 wave,"SINGAPORE - Singapore is near, if not already at, the peak of the current wave of Covid-19 infections, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung on Tuesday (July 5). He told Parliament that the number of cases is expected to cross 12,000 on Tuesday - about 10 per cent higher than the same time last week. ""There are indications that we are near the peak, if not at the peak, and we should be relieved that the number this week did not double from last week. Otherwise, we'll be at 24,000 or 22,000 this week,"" said Mr Ong. He said the current wave will not be as severe as the previous Omicron wave, as many people have gained stronger immunity through booster shots or recovery from infections, which will reduce transmission of the virus. The key, as before, is to ensure that hospital capacity is not overly stressed, he added in response to questions from MPs. Mr Ong said the number of Covid-19 hospitalisations here have reached almost 700, though this remains below the figure of around 1,700 cases during the Omicron wave earlier this year. Responding to Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang), he said the hospitals have cut back about 4 per cent of the load from non-Covid-19 patients - these are mostly elective procedures - compared with a cut of 15 per cent during the earlier wave. With public hospitals continuing to face high demand, Mr Ong said more Covid-19 Treatment Facilities (CTFs) could be converted to take in non-Covid-19 patients. One existing CTF at Sengkang Community Hospital has been reconfigured to cater to both sets of patients, he noted. ""Over time, we hope more of our CTFs can be multi-purpose isolation and treatment facilities, for both Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients,"" he said. Giving an update on Covid-19 healthcare subsidies, he told the House that the Government has spent about $730 million and $220 million subsidising inpatient and outpatient treatments for Covid-19 respectively as at the end of the 2021 financial year. Mr Ong also said the authorities are stepping up efforts to get as many people as possible to take the vaccine and booster jab. About 60,000 seniors aged 60 and above have not taken their first booster or third shot, he said. Encouraging these seniors to do so, he said: ""It makes a huge difference as to whether you will fall severely sick if infected."" This 60,000 number is an improvement from the 80,000 seniors who had yet to take their booster shots as at June 20, the day Mr Ong uploaded a video clip on TikTok to urge them to get their jabs. To ensure that the majority of Covid-19 cases can continue to be managed outside of hospitals, all polyclinics and 103 participating Public Health Preparedness Clinics can, as at June 30, prescribe oral antivirals such as Paxlovid to those who are eligible, he said. MOH has also made these antivirals more readily available in nursing homes as early treatment to help reduce the risk of severe disease and hospitalisation, while medication given before exposure to Covid-19 to protect those who are, for instance, not able to take the current vaccines, is available in hospital outpatient settings for at-risk populations. ""Our hospitals remain ready to ramp up dedicated ICU (intensive care unit) and isolation bed capacity should there be an increase in the number of Covid-19 patients who require hospitalisation,"" he said. He added that the hospitals have started to do so.  ""They are already doing so and they are now very busy,"" he said. Sufficient beds are also being maintained at the CTFs to manage serious cases that do not need hospital care, he said. ""We have recently consolidated our CTFs, from about 2,000 beds to 1,300 beds but with higher manning ratio, and this will make it easier to transfer patients from acute hospitals to the CTFs without a significant drop in level of care,"" said Mr Ong. The CTFs are now about 25 per cent occupied. MOH data shows that as at July 4, a total of 631 Covid-19 patients are hospitalised, with 14 in the intensive care unit. About half of the infections in Singapore are now caused by the latest Omicron sub-variants BA.4 and BA.5, up from 30 per cent last week, Mr Ong said. Cases driven by these sub-variants have been doubling every week, and they could account for 70 per cent or 80 per cent of total cases next week.  Mr Ong also said in Parliament that they will continue to study the risks and benefits of using a bivalent vaccine - one that targets the original virus as well as Omicron. If these vaccines by Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna are approved and the shipments arrive, they could be available here by the end of the year. Those who have yet to take their booster should not wait as the current booster works very well, he added.  On the topic of healthcare manpower, Mr Ong hinted that plans are afoot to give foreign nurses better retention benefits, given the global competition for nurses. 
The cohort size here is limited while healthcare demand is growing, he said. “So, therefore, we must be able to accept that over time, we have to recruit more foreign nurses from different sources, be able to take them in, train them and over time... be able to review pay, pay them competitively,” he said.  “And the good ones, over time, should be able to be part of our community, become PRs (permanent residents) and live with their families here.” Mr Ong added: “I think this is the only way for us to not just weather through this wave but as our population gets older... the size of our healthcare workforce will have to increase and we have to tap both a strong local pipeline as well as foreign recruitment."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/spore-morocco-to-cooperate-on-carbon-markets-providing-technical-aid-to-africa,"S'pore, Morocco to cooperate on carbon markets, providing tech aid to Africa","SINGAPORE - Singapore and Morocco have agreed to collaborate on carbon markets and work together to provide technical assistance to governments in Africa. At the end of a three-day official visit to mark 25 years of bilateral diplomatic ties, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said on Monday (July 4) that a memorandum of understanding, which he and Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita signed, sets the two countries to cooperate in achieving emission targets. Under the agreement, Singapore and Morocco will work towards developing a legally binding framework that will allow carbon credits to be transferred between the two countries. Carbon credits are tradeable permits that give their owner the right to emit a fixed amount of greenhouse gases. When credits are transferred from one country to another, the changes in emission volumes for each country are reflected in their greenhouse gas accounting. The two countries are also working together to provide technical assistance to Africa. Dr Balakrishnan said that in October, Singapore and Morocco will jointly organise a pilot programme on leadership and governance for African countries, which will be held in Morocco for African countries. On Monday, a letter of intent on cooperation in capacity building was signed by Moroccan Ambassador director-general Mohamed Methqal and Singapore Ambassador to Morocco George Goh in Morocco's capital Rabat. The letter's signing, said Dr Balakrishnan, signals hope that both countries have to conclude a memorandum of understanding on technical cooperation soon. At a joint press conference with Mr Bourita on Monday, Dr Balakrishnan said he had presented Mr Bourita an invitation from President Halimah Yacob to King Mohammed VI to pay Singapore a state visit. Although Morocco and Singapore are in different parts of the world, Dr Balakrishnan said they share in being gateways to respective areas of the world. ""This is a relationship which has, in fact, been founded on very good diplomatic ties, but I think the economic dimension of it is just waiting to take off, and to take off significantly,"" he said. Dr Balakrishnan said that during his visit to Morocco, he was struck by the ""values of tolerance, coexistence and religious harmony"" that the country represents, adding that he had been to Hassan II Mosque and David Hamelekh Synagogue during his visit. ""In Morocco, you consider this natural,"" said Dr Balakrishnan. ""But this wonderful attribute of Morocco is, in fact, unusual, special and precious. This is a message that Morocco needs to take to the world. That is the other reason why we hope His Majesty will visit us, come to South-east Asia and show that wonderful aspect of Moroccan society, history and tradition."" The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Monday that Dr Balakrishnan and Mr Bourita also discussed sustainable development, education, trade and investment, as well as enhancing connectivity. ""Minister Balakrishnan welcomed Morocco's interest to strengthen its engagement of Asean and reiterated Singapore's support for Morocco's application to become a sectoral dialogue partner of Asean,"" the ministry said. During his visit, Dr Balakrishnan also met other Moroccan leaders such as Minister of Industry and Trade Ryad Mezzour, Minister in Charge of Digital Transition Ghita Mezzour, and the president of the National Museums Foundation Mehdi Qotbi."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/measures-to-boost-energy-security-helped-reduce-prices-in-wholesale-market-gan-kim-yong,Measures to boost energy security helped reduce prices in wholesale market: Gan Kim Yong,"SINGAPORE - Measures taken by regulator Energy Market Authority (EMA) to boost Singapore's energy security since October 2021 have helped to push down the wholesale electricity price, which changes every half hour. Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong said in a written reply to a parliamentary question on Monday (July 4) that the average Uniform Singapore Energy Price - which refers to the half-hourly energy price in the Singapore wholesale electricity market - in the second quarter of 2022 was about $300 per megawatt-hour (MWh). This works out to be about 30 cents per kilowatt-hour (KWh) This is down from the average price of $440 per MWh, or 44 cents per KWh, in the fourth quarter of 2021, the period when global energy prices started to spike due to growing demand for energy for heating in the cooler months, and ramped-up economic recovery. Figures from EMA's website showed that the average half-hourly energy price for the third quarter of 2021 was about $153.07 per MWh, or 15.3 cents per kWh. In October last year, EMA said it would take steps to boost the country's energy security amid the global supply crunch. This includes the establishment of a standby liquified natural gas facility, which is essentially a stockpile of the fuel, that generation companies (gencos) can draw from to generate electricity in the event of disruptions to their natural gas supplies. ""We also required gencos to bolster their own stockpile of fuel and empowered EMA to direct the gencos to generate electricity using gas from the (facility) if there are potential shortages,"" Mr Gan said. He was responding to Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang GRC), who wanted to know how Singapore was ensuring the reliability and affordability of its electricity supply. It is mainly the large electricity users in Singapore, such as shopping malls and manufacturing facilities, that are affected by the fluctuations in the wholesale market. Currently, such users, which have an average monthly consumption of at least 4,000kWh - about 10 times the average monthly consumption of a four-room Housing Board flat, can only buy electricity from retailers, or from the wholesale market - where electricity prices fluctuate every half hour. But the volatile gas and electricity prices, and risk of piped natural gas disruptions, had limited the retailers' ability to offer fixed price contracts. A number of independent electricity retailers have also exited the market since the global energy crunch. Households, however, are cushioned from this as they have the option of buying electricity from grid operator SP Group at the regulated tariff, which is currently at 32.28 cents per kWh including the goods and services tax. To cushion the impact of the fluctuations in the wholesale market to large electricity users, EMA in December 2021 introduced the Temporary Electricity Contracting Support Scheme, which allows businesses to buy electricity at fixed prices. ""For businesses who want greater certainty, EMA has been working with electricity retailers and gencos since January 2022 to offer longer-term fixed price plans of up to three years,"" Mr Gan added. With the global energy crisis exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, EMA has extended these measures until March 31 next year, Mr Gan said. But while the authorities will continue to monitor the situation and consider if further extensions or measures are needed, Mr Gan said companies should become more energy-efficient to manage business costs. Companies can monitor their half-hourly electricity usage on the SP Utilities portal or Open Electricity Market e-services portal to manage and reduce their electricity consumption, Mr Gan said, or tap the various support measures to enhance their energy efficiency. These include the recently announced Energy Efficiency Grant for the food manufacturing, food services, and retail sectors; the National Environment Agency's Energy Efficiency Fund; the Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark Incentive Scheme; and EnterpriseSG's Enterprise Sustainability Programme. ""Businesses which need financing support can also tap EnterpriseSG's programmes such as the Enterprise Financing Scheme and the Temporary Bridging Loan. The Small Business Recovery Grant will also help eligible firms in sectors most badly affected by Covid-19 cope with overall higher costs of doing business,"" Mr Gan said. Separately, Mr Dennis Tan (Hougang) asked if Malaysia's ban on renewable energy exports will prevent Singapore from importing renewable energy from other countries in the region. Mr Gan replied that it would not. He said Malaysia's decision to disallow the export of renewable energy to Singapore does not extend to the passage of electricity from other countries, through Malaysia, to Singapore. The Republic on June 23 began importing renewable energy from Laos via Thailand and Malaysia - a move that marks the first multilateral cross-border electricity trade involving four Asean countries and the first renewable energy import into Singapore. Up to 100MW of hydropower from Laos will be brought into Singapore using existing interconnectors under the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project - an intergovernmental project set up in 2014 to study the feasibility of cross-border power trade. The 100MW account for about 1.5 per cent of Singapore's peak electricity demand in 2020 and could power around 144,000 four-room Housing Board flats for a year. ""Malaysia and Singapore have been working closely at bilateral and multilateral platforms on our decarbonisation efforts,"" Mr Gan said. ""There is significant benefit for all countries involved, as cross-border electricity trade will encourage investments in renewable energy production as it can serve a broader regional market."" Mr Gan said Singapore is having collaborative discussions with regional and global partners, including Malaysia, to advance mutual and collective interests."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/2400-to-3800-reports-of-unsafe-work-activity-received-each-year-mom,"2,400 to 3,800 reports of unsafe work activity received each year: MOM","SINGAPORE - About 2,400 to 3,800 reports of unsafe work activities were made to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) each year over the past five years, said Manpower Minister Tan See Leng on Monday (July 4). In a written parliamentary reply, he said MOM takes every report seriously and inspects workplaces when necessary. Of the inspections conducted in the past year as a result of these reports, 84 per cent led to enforcement action such as fines and stop work orders. Between January and June this year, more than 3,500 inspections were conducted in higher-risk sectors such as construction, marine and manufacturing - 35 per cent more than in the same period last year. Enforcement action was taken for more than 9,000 safety breaches, and more than 50 stop work orders were issued, a twofold increase compared with the first half of 2021. Dr Tan was responding to Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar GRC) and Workers' Party MP Leon Perera (Aljunied GRC), who had asked for this data following the deaths of 28 workers in the first half of this year, the most over the same period since 2016. The latest involved a 54-year-old GrabFood delivery rider, who died after a traffic accident near Waterway Point in Punggol on June 24. ""MOM will continue to step up its inspections at work sites and impose harsher penalties on companies with poor workplace safety and health performance,"" Dr Tan said, citing the stiffer penalties introduced last month (June) that will double the composition fine meted out to errant firms. Meanwhile, all workers, including migrant workers, are strongly encouraged to report unsafe work conditions to their supervisors, employers or MOM, Dr Tan added. Workers can also approach union leaders or non-governmental organisations, such as the National Trades Union Congress-backed Migrant Workers' Centre, which will work directly with employers to make changes or ask MOM to follow up. Dr Tan gave the assurance that workers' identities will be kept confidential. MOM will act against employers who fire, or threaten to fire, whistle-blowers, if they are reported to have done so. Dr Tan also reiterated the various measures his ministry plans to implement following the recent spate of deaths, such as reviewing the current demerit points system and standardising the disqualification criteria used for public construction tenders. He said MOM has also been working with government procurement entities to include suitable workplace safety and health (WSH) technology as part of the specifications for some public sector construction tenders. ""I encourage the private sector and members of the public to also shape your procurement policies to hire firms with strong safety track records by checking firms' WSH performance on CheckSafe on MOM's website,"" Dr Tan added. MOM and the WSH Council will also do more to engage small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to build up their WSH capabilities, he said. Of the 28 deaths so far this year, 80 per cent occurred in higher-risk industries, including 10 in construction and five in the transport and storage sector. A majority of the accidents involved SMEs, and most were due to preventable safety lapses, Dr Tan said in response to questions from Mr Melvin Yong (Radin Mas). Falls from heights and vehicular accidents accounted for 14 of the 28 deaths. While firms here have suggested that an exodus of experienced workers and an influx of greenhorns may be one reason behind the recent workplace fatalities, Dr Tan said inexperience was unlikely to be a contributory factor. All 28 fatal accidents so far this year involved workers with at least two years of experience, he said, and any co-workers involved had at least three years of experience. Noting how, at the end of last year, Singapore had been on track to meet its 2028 goal of reducing the workplace fatality rate to below one per 100,000 workers, Dr Tan said MOM is committed to strengthening the current WSH framework to make company management and boards more accountable. There were 37 workplace deaths in 2021, compared with 30 in 2020 and 39 in 2019. MOM is also committed to enhancing training support and tightening enforcement, Dr Tan added. ""I urge all companies to take time to review your WSH processes, use... the learning points from recent fatalities to reinforce the importance of safety to your workers, and implement the necessary control measures."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/126-of-p4-pupils-who-failed-2-or-more-subjects-live-in-rental-flats,12.6% of P4 pupils who failed 2 or more subjects live in rental flats,"SINGAPORE - Of the Primary 4 pupils who failed two or more subjects, an average of 12.6 per cent lived in public rental flats, said Education Minister Chan Chun Sing on Monday (July 4). Rental flat dwellers make up about 4.7 per cent of the total number of households living in Housing Board flats. Mr Chan, referring to data from the past five years, added in a written parliamentary reply that among the Primary 4 pupils who scored Band 4 in only one subject, 4.5 per cent lived in rental flats. Primary school students are now graded using Achievement Bands 1 to 4, where Band 4 refers to a score of less than 50 marks. Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC) had asked for the number of Primary 4 pupils who had failed one subject, failed two or more subjects and the number who had passed all subjects in each year in the past five years. He had also asked what percentage of these pupils live in public rental flats and whether the Ministry of Education (MOE) intends to collect this data if it is not available. Mr Chan said that among Primary 4 pupils who scored better than Band 4 in all four subjects, 0.8 per cent live in public rental flats. He said: ""Where appropriate, schools support students through subject-specific remediation. ""Students can also take subjects at Foundation level at Primary 5 and 6 so that they can focus on building strong fundamentals for secondary school."" Separately, younger children living in public rental flats are less likely to go to pre-school than the national average. Minister for Social and Family Development Masagos Zulkifli said: ""In 2021, the pre-school participation rate of Singaporean children aged three to four years residing in public rental flats was about 80 per cent, slightly lower than the national average of about 88 per cent."" However, the rate for children aged five to six years residing in public rental flats was comparable to the national average of 95 per cent, he added in a written parliamentary reply. Overall, about nine in 10 Singaporean children aged three to four years were enrolled in pre-schools in 2021, up from around eight in 10 in 2017, he added. Mr Masagos, responding to questions from Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang GRC) and Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied GRC), said instead of setting specific targets for pre-school participation at each of the lower, middle and higher levels of family income, his ministry's approach is to ensure every child has access to affordable and quality pre-schools. He said: ""We recognise that the early years are important to a child's development, particularly for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. ""For children from lower-income families, the Early Childhood Development Agency facilitates pre-school enrolment from age three onwards through KidStart and the Preschool Outreach programme."" KidStart is a national programme meant to help low-income families build strong foundations for their children. He added that families under HDB's Public Rental Scheme and MSF's ComCare schemes are automatically eligible for maximum pre-school subsidies. Mr Masagos also said there are no plans to expand the provision of pre-school education in MOE kindergartens to four-year-olds. Instead, the MOE has partnered with pre-school operators to pilot a programme to provide affordable pre-school education for children aged two months to six years, he said."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/wp-mp-he-ting-rus-characterisation-of-elderly-patients-case-was-unfair-says-koh-poh-koon,"WP MP He Ting Ru's characterisation of elderly patient's case was unfair, says Koh Poh Koon","SINGPORE - Workers' Party MP He Ting Ru had unfairly characterised Singapore society as one that does not look after seniors when she cited an anecdote in February without giving government agencies enough time to respond to the case, said Senior Minister of State for Manpower Koh Poh Koon. Dr Koh spoke in Parliament on Monday (July 4) after question time on the matter, which Ms He (Sengkang GRC) had first raised in a speech on Feb 28 when she made reference to seniors who asked doctors to reduce the dosages of prescribed medicines, as they could not afford the full amount. ""What does it say about us as a society?"" she had asked. At a subsequent sitting in April, Dr Koh - who was also Senior Minister of State for Health then - sought clarifications from Ms He. She said her resident had told her during a Meet-the-People session that he no longer had the means to pay out-of-pocket for various medications prescribed for his chronic conditions, despite tapping MediSave and various subsidies. Ms He appealed to the Central Provident Fund Board on his behalf. On Monday, Dr Koh said he had reviewed the details of the case and was satisfied that the healthcare support system had worked as it was intended to. He said the resident - whom he referred to as Mr H for confidentiality reasons - had access to additional avenues of support, and only thought he did not, as he had not followed his doctor's recommendation to see a medical social worker in September 2021. Had Mr H done so, he would have been informed of his eligibility for a 62.5 per cent subsidy on his medicines under the Medication Assistance Fund, which has now been extended to him, Dr Koh said. Following Ms He’s appeal, Mr H was informed on March 16 that his withdrawal limit under the MediSave Chronic Disease Management Programme had also been increased from the current $700 per year to $800 per year, Dr Koh noted. He pointed out that Ms He had referenced Mr H's case in her Feb 28 speech just two working days after she filed the appeal on Feb 24, before the facts of the case were determined and government agencies had the chance to respond. ""The picture painted was one of a society where seniors are forced to cut down on the necessary and essential medication dosages simply because they cannot afford it. Implicit is also the suggestion that this state of affairs is due to a government that is not in touch with the ground or uncaring,"" he said. ""That is not a fair characterisation. And it's also not fair to the agencies on the ground,"" he said, adding that the healthcare system is designed to cater to those in need such as the elderly and low income. Responding, Ms He said the broader point she had wanted to make was that residents continue to feel that they have to jump through many hoops to get help, and feel ""demoralised"" and even ""a bit humiliated"" in the process. She emphasised that she was not casting aspersions on doctors, and at no point had suggested it was the doctors who told Mr H to take fewer medicines or reduce his dosages. ""If the systems are working, if the systems are flexible, do our residents know that they are there? How do we get the message out to our residents, rather than have them feel we are uncaring, that the system doesn't care for them, that they have to really work for it, that they have to really be humiliated? This is how they feel,"" she said. Replying, Dr Koh said it was not wrong for Ms He to appeal for and speak up on behalf of her resident. ""The point I want to make here is that as parliamentarians making speeches here, let's be clear about the facts before we make statements in Parliament, and not to tarnish the reputation or the efforts of agencies on the ground,"" he said."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/host-of-measures-set-to-be-launched-to-foil-sms-scammers-teo-chee-hean,Host of measures set to be launched to foil SMS scammers: Teo Chee Hean,"SINGAPORE - A slew of measures will be implemented by the Government to ensure that phone users in Singapore can interact with SMS messages safely, both by foiling would-be scammers and shoring up user education. In a written response to a question from MP Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC), Mr Teo Chee Hean, Coordinating Minister for National Security, outlined four measures the Government will take to prevent, detect and mitigate any SMS messages that impersonate legitimate senders. Mr Teo's response comes after the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group wrapped up its review of the use of SMS and clickable links for government agencies. The review was announced in January after a spate of online banking scams, including phishing scams that caused OCBC customers to lose $13.7 million. The four measures are: using the SMS Sender ID Registry (SSIR) to block messages sent by those that spoof the IDs of legitimate senders; screening out scam messages and calls; strengthening scam detection in government transactions and speeding up the response to scams, said Mr Teo. In his reply on Monday (July 4), Mr Teo said over 50 organisations - including government agencies and banks - have come on board the SSIR, which was established in March. He added that all government agencies will progressively join the registry. ""We are also studying the requirement for all users of alphanumeric sender IDs to be onboarded to prevent scammers from sending SMSes using alphanumeric sender IDs,"" said Mr Teo, who oversees the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group in the Prime Minister's Office. As for screening out scam messages and calls, he said the Government will work with telcos to improve their ability to block such messages and calls, including robocalls and those spoofing numbers of local Government agencies and emergency services. The ScamShield mobile application developed by the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) to filter out scam SMS messages and calls, and various education campaigns to alert citizens to different types of emerging scams, are also in place, he noted. Multi-factor authentication on Singpass, including the use of biometrics, to provide added layers of protection to Singpass accounts and to prevent them from being easily taken over by scammers, has been introduced to strengthen scam detection for government transactions. ""Like other major technology companies, we are also using and continuously improving our fraud analytics to detect and notify users of suspicious logins, such as logins from a new device or browser."" For major transactions, government agencies will check that payments are made to bank accounts owned by the correct person, he said. ""This will complement similar measures that the banks are taking to mitigate the risk of fraudulent transactions, such as enhancing fraud monitoring systems to facilitate timely detection and blocking of suspicious transactions, and alerting customers of outgoing transactions that exceed established risk thresholds so that they can report unauthorised transactions as soon as possible."" To speed up the response to scams, the NCPC will launch a WhatsApp channel by the third quarter of 2022 for citizens to quickly report suspected scams, to rapidly crowdsource information and respond to scam websites and messages, said Mr Teo. The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and the Singapore Police Force (SPF) will also work together to identify and block suspected scam websites, he said, noting that 12,000 were blocked last year. ""In addition, the SPF works with financial institutions to swiftly freeze bank accounts suspected to be involved in scams. ""Combating scams will be a constant battle as scammers' tactics will keep changing."" Other than the four measures, the Government will also use only domains ending with "".gov.sg"" when sending SMS messages with links. Any logins to government services, such as keying in Singpass credentials or scanning the Singpass QR code, should only be done at genuine Government websites with domains ending with "".gov.sg"". But Mr Teo added: ""There are some exceptions such as websites that are collaborations between government agencies and non-government entities. ""Such legitimate websites are listed on www.gov.sg/trusted-sites which users are encouraged to check if they are asked to transact on unfamiliar website domains."" Mr Teo also said that for messages delivered to citizens through SMSes, the Government will only use links where it is important to mobilise large numbers quickly and other channels are assessed to be less effective. ""We will not ask users to provide their credentials, such as passwords, through websites directly accessed through SMS links."" In his response, Mr Teo also said removing links in SMSes, e-mails or other messaging platforms does not eliminate the risk of users falling prey to phishing attempts. ""SMS can reach anyone with a mobile phone, even if they do not use a smartphone or e-mail, with nearly 100 per cent coverage,"" he said, noting that the Government has attached links in SMSes to mobilise citizens to get vaccinated during Covid-19. ""Given the above trade-offs between reach and vulnerability to spoofing, the Government will implement a number of measures in order to have safeguards and give users confidence when interacting with SMSes."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/mha-to-study-amending-law-to-make-it-easier-to-establish-renovation-fraud,MHA to study amending law to make it easier to establish renovation fraud,"SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) will look into amending the law to make it easier to establish fraud in cases involving errant renovation contractors. Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam said on Monday (July 4) that renovation fraud generally involves contractors inducing victims to make payment for promised renovation works, which are either partially completed, or not carried out at all. ""In most of these cases, the contractors become uncontactable after collecting payment, or provide excuses to explain why they are unable to complete the promised works,"" he added in a written reply to parliamentary questions. Mr Shanmugam noted that in some cases, there could be genuine business distress and the contractor may not have been able to do the work, citing how some contractors found themselves unable to fulfil their contracts during the Covid-19 pandemic. ""In each case, the question is whether there was fraudulent intent. Some cases may involve fraudulent intent but it may be very difficult to prove that in court,"" he said. Contractors who deceive victims into placing deposits for renovation works without intending to carry them out can be charged for cheating offences under the Penal Code. Mr Shanmugam, responding to Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok), said between 2019 and 2021, the police investigated 100 cases involving errant renovation contractors. So far, 72 per cent of these cases have been prosecuted in court. He added that recovery of funds can be difficult as the culprit may no longer have the money. Mr Shanmugam said home owners can consider engaging contractors with a good track record, such as those recognised under the joint accreditation between the Consumers Association of Singapore (Case) and the Singapore Renovation Contractors. Case reported that the construction industry saw 1,300 complaints last year, up from 869 in 2020. Close to one in two of the complaints was about projects not completed on time and unsatisfactory workmanship. The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore published a guide on fair trading practices for the renovation industry in May. It covers five main areas, including transparent pricing of services without any hidden costs and that consumers and contractors should have a mutually agreed timeline on the renovation work."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/ica-officers-working-247-to-process-passports-2-more-post-offices-to-offer-collection,"ICA officers working 24/7 to process passports, 2 more post offices to offer collection","SINGAPORE - At any given hour, at any second of the day - even on weekends - officers from the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) are working to process passports. So intense has been the operations in recent times that officers are being recalled on their days off and their applications for block leave have not been allowed. So while many Singaporeans are holidaying overseas with their new passports, many ICA officers are putting their own holidays on hold. But there is a limit to how sustainable this is, said Minister for Home Affairs K. Shanmugam. He was replying to a question in Parliament on Monday (July 4) from Mr Dennis Tan (Hougang SMC) about the efforts by the ICA to speed up the current processing of passport applications. ""To deal with the surge in passport applications, ICA has also re-deployed officers from other work units to process passports on a 24/7 basis,"" Mr Shanmugam said in a written reply. ICA also revealed in a video posted on Facebook on June 29 that its officers have been working extended hours and doing shift work. There have been over 500,000 passport applications since April, averaging about 6,000 applications a day compared to 2,000 a day in 2019. ""Many of those who submitted applications had passports that were expiring, or had already expired,"" said Mr Shanmugam. ""Some had also made travel plans. They were anxious to get their passports and visited ICA Building physically to request that their applications be expedited, leading to long queues and waiting times."" Delays were also caused by other issues, such as applicants submitting photos that did not meet ICA's requirements. The minister added that the public has been constantly updated on the expected processing time. He said: ""Since early April, ICA has been updating the public of the passport processing time, when it increased to at least a month, and subsequently to at least six weeks as demand continued to spike."" Since October last year, passport collection has been offered at 27 post offices with no additional fee. This was done to encourage more Singaporeans to collect their documents from these locations and reduce the queuing time at the ICA Building in Lavender. The minister said that two more post offices will also offer passport collection services from this month, while more collection counters will be added to the existing sites to cater to the demand. The Killiney Road Post Office and Novena Post Office are expected to offer passport collection services in the coming weeks."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/stiffer-maximum-fines-and-longer-maximum-jail-terms-for-illegal-wildlife-traffickers,Stiffer maximum fines and longer maximum jail terms for illegal wildlife traffickers,"SINGAPORE - A law that aims to stamp out wildlife trafficking in Singapore was strengthened on Monday (July 4), with stiffer penalties for those found guilty. Under changes to the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act, the maximum jail term for individuals involved in the illegal wildlife trade has tripled from two years to six, while the new maximum fine has increased from $50,000 per species to $100,000 per specimen. Companies found trafficking endangered species would also face higher fines and prison sentences, Senior Minister of State for National Development Tan Kiat How told Parliament on Monday. This is because corporations generally have more resources and the means to move larger quantities of illegally traded species listed under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites). Species on Appendix I of Cites - an international treaty that aims to protect endangered plants and animals - include animals on the brink of extinction, such as Asian elephants and pangolins. International trade in these creatures is permitted only in exceptional circumstances. Offenders found guilty of trafficking species listed on Cites Appendix II - which include species such as hippopotamuses - and Appendix III species, such as foxes, will also face higher fines of up to $50,000 for each specimen, up from a maximum of $50,000 for each species. Trade is allowed for wildlife species listed on Appendix II, but this is strictly controlled to ensure their survival. Wild animals and plants listed on Appendix III refer to species that are protected in at least one country. The amended law also imposes a maximum jail term of four years for such offenders, up from two. Corporations that trade Appendix II and III species face fines of up to $100,000 per specimen and imprisonment of up to six years. New safeguards will also be introduced to protect the identity of informers. This is to encourage more individuals to come forward and provide information regarding illegal wildlife trade, which will help facilitate investigations by the National Parks Board (NParks). The amendments to the law would ensure that penalties issued are proportionate to the offence, and further deter illegal trade of wildlife both internationally and domestically, said NParks in a statement on Monday. NParks' enforcement powers will also be strengthened so that it can tackle illegal wildlife trade more effectively. For instance, if NParks seizes a shipment of non-Cites timber planks with illegally traded elephant ivory concealed beneath those planks, NParks could previously seize only the elephant ivory. But with the new amendments, NParks can now also seize items used to conceal these species, in this case, the timber planks. These changes will further deter illegal wildlife trade, as would-be smugglers could lose additional cargo that was used to commit the offence, said NParks. Mr Tan said that the threat of illegal wildlife trade is constantly evolving, and that its profitability has led to smugglers constantly finding new loopholes for exploitation. ""So, beyond strengthening our research capabilities, partnerships and engagements, we must ensure that our regulations and enforcement tools remain up to date and effective,"" he said. While demand for wild animals and their parts is not as rampant in Singapore as it is elsewhere in Asia, the Republic has long been called out by the international conservation community for not doing more to control the transit of such items through the country. For example, wildlife trade monitoring network Traffic had in its 2020 report identified Singapore as a key transit hub for the rest of South-east Asia, a prominent market for illegal wildlife trade. This is because the Republic's maximum jail term of two years for wildlife crime was one of the lowest among Asean member states, with the regional average at about eight years, the report said. However, in recent years, NParks has bolstered its fight against illegal wildlife trade with the new Centre for Wildlife Forensics launched last August. It identifies and analyses specimens seized here, along with a K9 unit of dogs trained to sniff out commonly trafficked wildlife and wildlife products. While Cites governs mainly the international trade in wild animals and their parts, the amended law will also align penalties for the illegal domestic trade in Cites-listed species with international requirements, said Mr Tan. For instance, hybrid animals, which are a cross between Cites and non-Cites species, will, under the new law, be treated as full Cites species. These include the Bengal cat, which is a cross between the wild Asian leopard cat - a Cites-listed species - and a domestic cat. With the new law, domestic trade of the Bengal cat would also require permits. The three MPs who spoke up on the issue welcomed the amendments, but said the law could be further strengthened to combat the problem of illegal wildlife trade. Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC) proposed recategorising illegal wildlife trafficking as serious offences under the Organised Crime Act (OCA). This would target syndicates and masterminds behind these large-scale operations, rather than the runners, he said. He added that including wildlife trade offences under the OCA gives the authorities more tools to investigate these kingpins, who would otherwise evade punishment under the framework of the Endangered Species Act. Mr Ng noted that for an offence to be classified under the OCA, it must meet two criteria. It must pose a serious threat to public safety and security in Singapore, and be associated with organised crime in Singapore. Wildlife trafficking could introduce zoonotic diseases - such as Covid-19 and monkeypox, making it a threat to human health, and it could also introduce invasive species that threaten native wildlife, he added. Moreover, wildlife crime cases have also been connected to offences such as corruption, drug trafficking and money laundering, he said. Mr Ng also pointed out that the sheer size and value of animal-part seizures at local borders also point to the possibility of organised crime. Mr Leon Perera (Aljunied GRC) suggested using a reverse-listing model that would make ""no trade"" the default, in order to thwart illegal wildlife trade, especially as many threatened species may take years to make it into the Cites listing. A reverse-listing model would require traders to produce proof of sustainable trade, and could also incorporate a default ban on newly discovered species for a period of time, so as to allow time for the species to be listed on Cites - if the facts so warrant. Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang) called on the Government to do more to investigate and conduct enforcement measures of illegal wildlife trade in the digital realm. He added that the problem is getting more widespread on social media platforms such as Telegram, as well as the Dark Web, where wildlife trafficking syndicates have been conducting their operations. In addition, Mr Yip emphasised the need for online technology companies to be held accountable for exposing wildlife crime and thwarting the sale of exotic pets online. In response, Mr Tan said that the industry has been cooperative and committed to preventing the illegal sale of these products. He added that the National Parks Board (NParks) works closely with the Singapore Police Force to extract information from digital devices that may be helpful in their investigations. NParks also has a team of well-trained officers who can handle illegal wildlife trade, including combating cyber-enabled wildlife crime, he said."
