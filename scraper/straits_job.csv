This is after recommendations by the Tripartite Cluster for Retail Industry (TCR) were accepted by the Government on Monday (Aug 15)."

Among those leading the charge is Mr Dave Ng, group chief executive of logistics firm Bok Seng Logistics. Said Mr Ng: ""One area would be in the warehouse, let's say, the job of a stock picker, which you do not need to have fixed working hours for."" Instead, he said, technology and effective scheduling allow many people to work on picking out stock and packing shipments together whenever they can. Almost 85 per cent of the company's more than 250 employees are male. Bok Seng Logistics is one of 10 firms in the logistics and supply chain sector that signed memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with labour movement NTUC on Tuesday (Aug 16). The 10 firms, which together employ more than 650, pledged to implement progressive workplace policies, such as adopting standards on work-life harmony designed by the three-way, or tripartite, partnership of the Government, unions and employers. The companies have also committed to reviewing their flexible work arrangements, redesigning job roles and providing training for female workers to take on jobs in the sector. According to Ministry of Manpower statistics, more than 256,000 people work in transportation and storage services, and there were 6,900 vacancies in the sector as at last December. Ms Yeo Wan Ling, the director of NTUC's small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) unit, as well as its women and family unit, said there are about 80,000 females in Singapore who are not in the workforce but are looking for jobs. Ms Yeo, who is also an MP for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, added that logistics firms may attract this group to work for them by providing more conducive spaces for them, such as lactation rooms for new mothers rejoining the workforce. Also present at the signing ceremony, which included a tour of Bok Seng's warehouse in Tuas, was NTUC secretary-general Ng Chee Meng. He said in a speech that encouraging higher female labour participation is necessary to ensure the labour pool remains sufficient. He added: ""The key question is whether you can continue to import foreign augmentation of labour when there is a dwindling number of Singaporeans. ""I can tell you we have almost reached the limit,"" he said, adding that foreign labour makes up 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the workforce behind Singapore's continued economic growth. ""Even if you keep the number of foreign friends in our country at the same level, percentages will change."" He also said that although Singapore will need to continue augmenting its workforce with foreign labour in the short to medium term, companies must raise the productivity of their workforce and adopt technology more in their long-term strategy. To recognise the progressive employment practices of unionised companies and partners of NTUC's SME unit that have signed or will sign MOUs, NTUC will set up for them either a wellness corner for workers to relax and bond, or a lactation space. Said Ms Yeo: ""We want employers to join us in making their workplaces better - a nurturing environment that allows workers to juggle caregiving and work responsibilities while fulfilling their work and personal aspirations."" One woman who has decided to join the logistics sector is Ms Cindy Ng, who was hired by Bok Seng Logistics as a sales executive in June last year and sent to a nine-month career conversion programme. The hospitality sector she worked in previously was hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. Said the 33-year-old, who was in banquet sales for six years: ""Logistics companies are part of an essential industry as a lot of trade comes into Singapore, so I can foresee career progression in this industry."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/business-groups-welcome-move-to-raise-local-retail-staffs-wages-but-say-added-cost-a-concern-in-current-climate,Business groups welcome move to raise local retail staff's wages but say added cost a concern,"SINGAPORE- Raising the wages of local retail staff is a welcome move, but taking on more costs will likely be a concern amid the challenging business operating environment, business associations said on Monday (Aug 15). This comes after a slew of recommendations announced by the Tripartite Cluster for Retail Industry (TCR) on Monday under the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) in a move to boost low wages in the sector. The wage increase will see local workers in firms that hire foreign workers getting salary increases of 8.4 per cent to 8.5 per cent annually, from Sept 1 this year up to Aug 31, 2025. Singapore National Employers Federation executive director Sim Gim Guan said the wage growth may help to attract part-timers and meet the sector's manpower needs. But with the higher business costs that employers are already facing due to factors such as inflation, they would be concerned about absorbing costs or passing them on to consumers as this would affect their competitiveness, he said. Support measures from the Government, such as the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme, will hopefully help to mitigate the impact of the wage increases. The Singapore Retailers Association (SRA) said the wage increases will help to make the sector a more attractive career choice. But labour costs have risen substantially even before the implementation of the PWM, said SRA executive director Rose Tong. With employers having to pay a minimum wage, competition for local workers will also become more intense, adding to the difficulty in finding local workers. Ms Tong added: ""It will also be more expensive for smaller retailers, such as neighbourhood shops, to hire. Those who pay more with better employer branding and staff benefits will be better positioned to attract retail talents and retain existing staff."" Bigger retailers, such as fashion chain Uniqlo, have already taken steps to boost staff wages to attract and retain talent. Uniqlo Singapore's human resource director, Ms Juliana Tan, said the company had bumped up all its store employees' salary by an average of 23 per cent to 25 per cent in June. It has about 1,200 Singaporean and permanent resident employees islandwide. The PWM will help to keep the sector attractive to locals, but the fashion chain has also put in place training opportunities for its staff, she added. Singapore Business Federation chief executive Lam Yi Young said that while the recommendations by TCR are welcomed, retailers will also need to take steps to make sure these wage increases are sustainable. He said: ""Retailers need to press on with transformation efforts to increase productivity and grow and diversify their supply chains and markets. This is especially important in the face of rising inflation and cost pressures."" The current inflationary environment will continue to put pressure on wages, said Professor Lawrence Loh from the National University of Singapore Business School. While the wage growth increases are significant and commendable, wages are dynamic and will nevertheless be adjusted by market forces. He said: ""The competition for labour will continue to intensify as many markets transit out of the pandemic. Retailers may even have to consider increases over and above those offered by the PWM to attract workers."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/businesses-must-be-more-cost-efficient-as-salaries-rise-under-progressive-wage-model-zaqy,Businesses must be more cost-efficient as salaries rise under Progressive Wage Model: Zaqy,"SINGAPORE - Paying workers higher wages does not need to translate into significant price hikes for consumers, said Senior Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad. ""We want things to be cost-effective, cost-efficient, affordable, but it should not be at the expense of low-wage workers,"" he said at the Ministry of Manpower, after announcing that the Government has accepted recommendations by the Tripartite Cluster for Retail on its new Progressive Wage Model (PWM) for the sector. He urged businesses to look beyond business costs going up as a result of higher wages, and instead work towards becoming more productive and cost-efficient. “Ultimately it is not just about wage increases, but how you continue to sustain increases over time... It is important to look at business productivity, workforce productivity, as well as job redesign and how we improve work conditions too,” he said. Under the new PWM for companies that hire foreign workers, wages for local workers such as retail assistants, cashiers and assistant retail supervisors are expected to go up by 8.4 per cent to 8.5 per cent annually, from Sept 1 this year to Aug 31, 2025. To help retailers cope with the increase, the Government will co-fund 75 per cent of the salary increase for workers earning gross monthly wages of up to $2,500 in 2022 and 45 per cent for those with gross monthly wages of $2,500 to $3,000. He cited the evolution of the private security industry, which he said has seen a higher growth rate of local employees, with younger people and locals joining the sector. It implemented a PWM as a licensing condition for private security agencies in September 2016. Additionally, as part of the latest round of recommendations accepted by the Government in November last year, the basic monthly wage of security officers who are at the bottom of the ladder will more than double from $1,650 in 2023 to $3,530 by 2028. Mr Zaqy said that the industry, which had a high number of officers working overtime, has become more technologically ready, with the use of tools such as closed-circuit televisions and sensors. ""It shows that with higher salaries, that doesn't mean you have to be less productive... You can train your workers to undertake a lot more meaningful tasks and not necessarily work longer hours,"" he said. The retail PWM is part of a range of progressive wage requirements that will take effect from Sept 1. They include a new local qualifying salary requirement for all companies that hire foreign employees of $9 per hour in gross wages for part-time employees, and $1,400 for full-time employees, with additional requirements for overtime; and the extension of the PWM to in-house cleaners, security officers and landscape workers. The Tripartite Workgroup on Lower-Wage Workers also recommended the expansion of the PWM to the food services sector and occupations such as administrators and drivers next March. Beyond seeing wages rise, Mr Zaqy said he also wants to see the various sectors become attractive to locals. ""One aspect we have to think about is creating an environment where locals feel that their skills are valued and they can practise them, and that there is a future for (their chosen) sector... Then, the whole dynamics change in terms of attractiveness to many of our local workers,"" he said."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/2-in-5-workers-in-singapore-would-not-accept-a-job-if-they-cannot-work-from-home-study,2 in 5 workers in Singapore would not accept a job if they cannot work from home: Study,"SINGAPORE - Two in five workers in Singapore would not accept a job if they are not able to work from home, according to a recent study. About 80 per cent of the 1,000 employees surveyed also said that having flexible working hours is important to them, and 41 per cent of the respondents said they would not take up a job if they could not work during the hours that they want. The biannual study, conducted by human resources solutions agency Randstad, polled workers aged between 18 and 67 years old in Singapore earlier this year. About one-quarter of the respondents, or 27 per cent, said they have quit a job because it did not provide enough flexibility in terms of working hours and location. Ms Jaya Dass, managing director at Randstad Singapore and Malaysia, noted that even though flexible working arrangements are important to employees in Singapore, not all firms offer them as an option in the current endemic Covid-19 environment. Only 52 per cent of those surveyed said their employers provide them with remote working options, and 60 per cent said their jobs have flexible working hours. ""Hence, employees who value the flexibility to decide when and where they want to work may seek to work for other employers that offer these options,"" said Ms Jaya. ""Employers who want to retain their employees should consider offering more flexible work models to meet the changing talent expectations that have been brought about and exacerbated by the pandemic,"" she added. The survey also surfaced other sentiments about the local job market. Randstad’s survey is also conducted in other markets around the world, including Australia and Denmark.  Some 41 per cent of the Singapore workers polled said they would rather be unemployed than feel unhappy in their jobs, and slightly over half the respondents, or 52 per cent, said they would quit if their jobs prevented them from enjoying life. More employers here are implementing flexible work arrangements and other hybrid work perks as Singapore moves towards living with Covid-19. The public service and large corporations are adopting practices such as allowing staff to work from home on some days of the week and staggered working hours. Dr David Leong, managing director of human resources advisory firm PeopleWorldwide Consulting, said workers now have a preference to work from home, given how work habits have become entrenched during pandemic. Flexibility in work arrangements will increasingly be seen as an employee entitlement, if not normalised, he said. ""Those who would not accept a job if they cannot work from home must consider if their demand is reasonable and the work's context. In a market with more jobs than job seekers, workers can afford to be choosy,"" Dr Leong said. But he cautioned: ""The tide can turn when there are more job seekers than jobs."" Ms Lee Hui Sin, 39, who works as an administrative assistant in the transportation and logistics sector, said that while the option of remote work is not a deal-breaker for her, it has become a greater consideration over the past couple of years and is something that is ""always better to have"". Her employer allows her to work from home twice a week unless there are urgent matters that need to be dealt with on-site. ""I think what's most important is that your employer or supervisor is willing to be flexible in different situations, such as if you need to take care of your children or parents,"" said Ms Lee, who has a five-year-old daughter."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/retail-workers-to-get-pay-increases-over-next-three-years-under-progressive-wage-model,Lower-wage retail workers to get pay hikes from Sept 1,"SINGAPORE - About 19,000 full-time lower-wage retail workers who are Singaporeans or permanent residents can expect pay hikes of 8.4 per cent to 8.5 per cent annually over the next three years.  Under the Progressive Wage Model (PWM) for the retail sector, retail assistants, cashiers and assistant retail supervisors will receive these increases from Sept 1 this year up to Aug 31, 2025. From Sept 1, full-time retail assistants and cashiers in firms that also hire foreign workers will see their monthly gross salary rise to a minimum of $1,850, excluding overtime pay. This will rise to at least $1,975 next year, then no less than $2,175 in 2024. Currently, the median gross salary of this group is about $1,850, which means half of them earn less than this. Lower-wage part-time retail staff will see their hourly gross salary go up. For example, from Sept 1, assistant retail supervisors will get $11.75 per hour, rising to $12.56 from Sept 1 next year and $13.82 from Sept 1, 2024. The wage increase was one of the recommendations announced by the Tripartite Cluster for Retail Industry (TCR) on Monday (Aug 15), which the Government later accepted. Currently, about 46,000 full-time and part-time retail workers who are Singaporeans or permanent residents work in firms that also hire foreigners. Among them, about 19,000 are lower-wage workers who will benefit from the PWM.  The TCR said the wages of retail supervisors and managers are generally above the lowest 20th income percentile and so should be left to market forces. The PWM helps to increase the wages of workers through the upgrading of skills and improving productivity. Introduced in 2012, it has been implemented in sectors such as cleaning, security, landscape as well as lift and escalator maintenance. The Government will co-fund eligible salary increases under the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme to support employers in this transition. In June, it said that the co-funding share this year will increase from 50 per cent to 75 per cent for resident employees with gross monthly salaries of up to $2,500. For salaries above $2,500 and up to $3,000, the co-funding will be raised from 30 per cent to 45 per cent. The TCR said the wage model for retail will be reviewed in 2024. Labour MP Yeo Wan Ling, who chaired the TCR, said it aims to uplift the wages of retail workers and provide them with a clear career progression pathway.  “It would help them to grow along with the evolving retail industry, and help retail firms retain and attract new entrants,” said Ms Yeo, a Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC MP. Some of TCR’s key considerations were poor job image and a lack of opportunities for progression, which have put off younger people from working in retail. In announcing the Government's acceptance of the recommendations, Senior Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad described this as a “landmark” PWM. The TCR also recommended minimum training requirements for all retail job roles under the PWM and a clear career progression pathway. The retail PWM is a five-level career progression model which sees retail assistants and cashiers ultimately becoming retail managers. Employers have from Sept 1 this year to Feb 28 next year to adjust and comply with the requirements. After that, firms that hire foreign workers and do not follow the requirements for their Singaporean and PR workers could have their work pass privileges suspended. Due to seasonal fluctuations in the industry, the TCR has also recommended a three-month averaging of PWM baseline gross salaries to give employers some flexibility in meeting the PWM requirements. Ms Siti Suhaimah Sairi, 22, a retail supervisor at Iuiga, said she can save more money with the increase in salary to take her family on an overseas holiday.

Q: I am a supervisor. How do I get a team of workers of vastly different personalities to bond? A: Team-bonding activities - while perhaps useful as an ice-breaker - rarely go well, because they usually force different people to do something without first understanding what each individual can bring to the table. As a supervisor, you have to recognise that everyone contributes to your team in their own ways, say experts. After all, having a wide range of talent and traits at your disposal is a good thing. Adecco Singapore country manager Betul Genc says: ""Respecting and celebrating each other's expertise and personality through open conversations encourages collaboration."" Good leaders are often known to be excellent communicators. But the great ones listen first. ""By seeking to understand before responding, you will build trust with your workers because you are paying attention to what is important to them,"" says Ms Genc. ""Learn about the various personalities within your team, make everyone heard and know what works best for them without interrupting their productivity."" While it may be tempting to go down the rabbit hole of thinking that people are difficult, don't. Rather, be aware that everyone is motivated by different needs and wants. ""Appreciate what makes people different and try to imagine what it would be like if everyone in the world was the same,"" says Mr Praveen Nair, a psychologist and senior consultant at Raven Counselling and Consultancy. In order to get your crew to work well together, provide clearly defined roles and expectations for each member. Every now and then, remind your teammates that despite the differences, you are all working towards the same goal. Yet, clashes are unavoidable, and it is better to address them than to avoid or downplay them, says Mr Nair. ""Do not take conflict personally, but try to assess how such conflict may be harnessed for the sake of work. Do also try not to be afraid of handling conflicts directly,"" he adds. ""Remain professional at all times so that different supervisees do not misread your words or actions."" Start by listening carefully, taking notes and showing that you have heard all parties by recapping their different perspectives. Then encourage compromise and help to find common ground. Remain calm throughout and agree on a way forward. Do recognise that conflicts are unavoidable and don't avoid the issue, hoping it will go away on its own. Do keep an open mind to solutions and ensure all parties commit. Don't allow emotions to lead the discussion or focus on personality traits. Ms Genc says: ""When workers feel valued and trusted, they tend to collaborate more, producing better quality work."" Have a question? Send it to askst@sph.com.sg"
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/tapping-the-abilities-of-persons-with-autism-can-benefit-companies-and-contribute-to-growth,Tapping the abilities of persons with autism,"With the right support and tools, persons with disabilities can be integral to companies and contribute to their growth.  
 
“One of the biggest misconceptions about individuals on the autism spectrum is that they cannot work or are able to only do simple, repetitive tasks,” says Ms Jacelyn Lim, Executive Director at the Autism Resource Centre (ARC).  Since 2012, ARC has worked with some 40 companies and placed close to 400 adults with autism in a variety of jobs.  Two companies that have partnered ARC in employing persons with autism are IT services and consulting firm Avanade and Vital, Singapore’s Public Service’s Central Agency for Corporate Shared Services. Both had been accredited with the Enabling Mark by SG Enable, the focal agency for disability in Singapore.  
 
The Enabling Mark is a national-level accreditation framework that recognises organisations for their best practices and outcomes in disability-inclusive employment. “We’ve learnt that we were able to achieve positive business outcomes through inclusive hiring practices - when there is good skills-to-job matching, effective engagement and purposeful work,” says Ms Yang Wen, Director of Corporate Development at Vital.  Persons with disabilities have various strengths and can form a sizeable talent pool that should not be overlooked. They can also provide new perspectives and innovative ideas which are crucial for businesses, says Mr Tan Eng Tat, Director for Employment & Employability at SG Enable. It may take a little more time, but the strengths of persons with autism could be uncovered and tapped when employers have greater disability awareness. Indeed, employment support does not end after a person with autism is hired. 
 
“Our focus is not just about placing jobs, but having a properly supported employment process. This comprises job assessment, employability training, proper placement, as well as preparation of worksite and colleagues,” says Ms Lim. 
 
At Avanade, a joint venture of Accenture and Microsoft, employees with autism who are placed by ARC are assigned mentors to ease them into their roles.  The tech firm’s recent hire is Ms Jesselin Ong, who was employed in April as a senior associate, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solution developer. Ms Ong started by going through an eight-week course including a briefing by ARC explaining the role, an interview and a spatial test to gauge her aptitude for work related to software development. Thereafter, Avanade conducted a six-month programme, with weekly check-ins from ARC coaches. 
 
Says Ms Ong, who is settling in well: “Working at Avanade has taught me interpersonal skills like functioning in different teams, and navigating social situations as an autistic person, which is an essential workplace skill.” To raise awareness about neurodiversity, Avanade organises bi-annual autism awareness talks led by ARC for their Southeast Asia staff. And the firm sees benefits in being diverse, understanding that this is critical to sustainable growth. 
 
ARC’s Ms Lim noted that individuals with autism can thrive at work and be valuable assets. “Many have held onto their jobs for more than five years and some have even excelled in their work as the most productive workers,” she said.   Like everyone else, the profile of job-seekers with disabilities is diverse, and they have different qualifications and support needs.    SG Enable has been building up a holistic ecosystem of support for inclusive hiring. Mr Tan says: “For employers, SG Enable has a consultancy team that works closely with them to understand their specific needs and working environment. We would then work with them to identify suitable candidates for employment, as well as support employers with the necessary training and grants.”  He adds that for persons with disabilities who require support, they can reach out to SG Enable for assistance.  SG Enable works with its partners - ARC, MINDS and SPD - under the Job Placement and Job Support (JPJS) programme, which provides a suite of employment and recruitment support for persons with disabilities and employers, respectively.  The availability of JPJS services also assures employers that specialised support is available to kick-start their journey towards inclusive hiring. Since April 2014, SG Enable has placed more than 4,700 persons with disabilities in jobs.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/ntuc-launches-year-long-exercise-to-engage-singaporean-workers-discuss-their-concerns,"NTUC launches year-long exercise to engage Singaporean workers, discuss their concerns","SINGAPORE - A new year-long public engagement exercise hopes to reach out to at least 20,000 Singaporean workers to hear their concerns, priorities and aspirations. The #EveryWorkerMatters Conversations, organised by the National Trades Union Congress and launched by its secretary-general Ng Chee Meng on Thursday (Aug 11), will also examine how unions, associations and social enterprises can evolve to address the feedback gathered. The findings and subsequent recommendations will also contribute to the Forward Singapore movement, a national year-long engagement exercise led by Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, which aims to refresh Singapore's social compact. The first phase of NTUC's conversations will run till the end of the year. Members of the public aged 18 and above will be invited to share their views through surveys, focus groups and dialogues in schools or with union leaders, among others. The second phase involves a series of policy workshops with tripartite partners, institutions of higher learning, civic society organisations, human resource practitioners and other organisations to come up with recommendations and concrete suggestions on how to better support workers. In the third phase, NTUC will surface its findings from earlier stages and release its recommendations by mid-2023, while working with 4G leaders and government policymakers involved in the Forward SG exercise. The conversations aim to engage a wide spectrum of workers, including professionals, managers and executives (PMEs), the self-employed and working parents, as well as the recently launched NTUC Youth Taskforce. Mr Ng launched the engagement exercise at a closed-door dialogue with 100 union leaders, along with NTUC president Mary Liew, on Thursday evening. Speaking to reporters earlier in the day, he noted that, while NTUC has championed workers' interests and collaborated with employers as well as the Government to achieve strong employment, business and national economic outcomes, the country is now at a crossroads. Economic growth in the future will not be as rapid as in the past, while the world is also becoming more uncertain, with technological advances, intensified competition and new ways of work. Singapore's demographics and workforce profile are changing, with smaller families and an ageing population, and workers' aspirations are shifting, he said. To better respond to these changes, the NTUC wants to look at the key factors that enable workers to succeed in their careers, the assurances they need throughout various stages of their life, as well as the protections needed for vulnerable workers. Mr Ng said he would have liked to hold these engagements in 2020 when NTUC was rethinking its business and membership models, but the Covid-19 pandemic put this on hold. Mr Ng also acknowledged that at a time of greater uncertainty, workers from different age groups and different segments have different concerns - older workers are concerned about retirement adequacy, gig workers about protections, and younger workers about career progression and work-life balance. ""We think there will likely be greater job polarisation that can potentially widen income inequalities if we do not take active measures as the labour movement,"" he said. He noted that in other countries, there are already two-tier economies emerging, ""where there are the ones that have and the ones that don't"". ""NTUC believes that this is not a good thing to have in our society, because if not properly managed, this will lead to fraying in the social compact,"" he said. This could potentially occur in Singapore, he added, citing how among the PMEs, there are managers in firms along Shenton Way earning five or six figures a month at one end, and managers from fast food chains earning about $3,000 a month at the other. The challenge for the labour movement is to represent PMEs' interests in a different way, in aspects such as protection and welfare, said Mr Ng. In a personal letter sent out on Friday (Aug 12) to more than one million NTUC members, he invited them to take part in these discussions and help create solutions. He said: ""We also want to hear what each of us as working people are willing to give up to achieve our goals at work. What roles we foresee our employers, unions and government playing - today, tomorrow and the years ahead. ""And what values should guide how we evolve Singapore's social compact around work and employment."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/companies-in-singapore-in-danger-of-losing-talent-over-mental-health-and-fatigue-woes,Companies in S'pore in danger of losing talent over mental health and fatigue woes,"SINGAPORE - Companies in Singapore are at risk of losing talent over mental health and fatigue woes as dealing with these issues comes low on employers' priorities, a survey found. Only about six in 10 employers in Singapore, or 66 per cent, are actively taking steps to address mental health challenges, the study said. This number is lower than the global average of 70 per cent, as well as the average of 74 per cent in Asia. Even fewer employers, about 62 per cent, are taking steps to manage workforce exhaustion here. This is lower than the 66 per cent globally and 69 per cent in Asia. Conducted by global consultancy firm Mercer Marsh Benefits (MMB), the survey polled 2,600 human resources and risk professionals - people who evaluate business risks at workplaces - from 25 countries and across industries in March. It asked participants what they thought the top risks impacting businesses are. The survey found that about 92 per cent of companies here regard health and safety as the most serious threat to businesses, compared with 89 per cent of organisations in Asia and 87 per cent of organisations globally. Mr Neil Narale, who is the Singapore leader of MMB, said the results are worrying as half the workforce in Singapore feel stressed every day, and one in three employees is considering resigning in the next six months. This means employers will risk losing talent if they continue to put staff's mental health and workplace exhaustion issues in the backseat, he added. ""It's time for employers to prioritise these risks by creating a holistic talent strategy and realigning benefits programmes to better support employees,"" said Mr Narale. For example, he said, companies could look beyond medical insurance coverage and implement well-being programmes including therapy, exercise and financial planning. ""When organisations start to put their people first, they will not only attract and retain top talent, but also build a more resilient workforce in the long run,"" Mr Narale said. The lack of financial resources is a main reason cited by employers for not dealing with mental health and fatigue woes at the workplace. Only about 78 per cent of companies surveyed here said they have enough budget to address health and safety challenges at the workplace, as opposed to 85 per cent of companies in Asia and 83 per cent globally, the survey found. Mr Narale said this could stem from a lack of leadership support to make mental health initiatives a priority, as many do not see an immediate return-on-investment in them. Companies also need to understand that mental well-being is not a one-off initiative or programme and should be integrated into the company's culture, he added. Apart from health and safety challenges, survey respondents here also cited cyber security as a top threat to businesses."

Five organisations were designated as Skills Development Partners by SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) at a ceremony on Thursday (Aug 4) held at the Lifelong Learning Institute in Paya Lebar, and will be in charge of identifying skills that workers in their sectors require. These organisations comprise both trade associations and professional bodies and are: The Institution of Engineers Singapore, the Institute for Human Resource Professionals, Singapore Computer Society, SGTech and the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI). SSG chief executive Tan Kok Yam said this initiative is a key plank in SSG's efforts to enable lifelong learning, particularly in its mission to link the needs of individual workers with the evolving needs of businesses and jobs. The five partners will help SSG know what training programmes to provide, he added. He said: ""SSG is no expert in running engineering firms, IT companies or human resources outfits, much less to be the authority on how they should transform. ""This is where we will lean heavily on our Skills Development Partners to bring in that sectoral lens."" SSG added that it would support the partners by providing structured training programmes and personnel attachments, among other things. This will give these organisations the know-how to generate insights on the skills their sectors need, it added. The partners will also be charged with helping companies better recognise the skills and mastery attained by their employees, said SSG. Speaking to The Straits Times at the sidelines of Thursday's event, SGTech chair Wong Wai Meng said the initiative is timely and will help SGTech's efforts to position Singapore as a global digital and data hub for the quickly evolving tech industry. SGTech is an association which represents more than 1,000 technology companies here, ranging from multinationals to small and medium-sized enterprises. Mr Wong added: ""In the past, identifying the right skills for the sector was done sporadically in pockets by the Government, companies and institutes of higher learning. ""While this saw some success, as an association we can understand from our members and work systematically to communicate to SSG what skills the sector needs."" The five organisations cemented this relationship with SSG by signing memoranda of understanding on Thursday. Moving forward, SSG will explore working with more organisations to come on board as Skills Development Partners, it said. At Thursday's ceremony, Minister of State for Education and Manpower Gan Siow Huang, who was guest of honour, also gave out certificates to 18 graduates of a new programme - designed by SCCCI and Nanyang Polytechnic - meant to train trade association employees. One graduate - digital marketing and communications executive at the Singapore Furniture Industries Council Pearly Tan, 26 - said the course helped her network and gain a better understanding of the role that trade associations play in the wider economy."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/two-firms-fined-and-ordered-to-stop-construction-work-after-safety-breaches,Two firms fined and ordered to stop construction work after safety breaches,"SINGAPORE - Two companies were fined and issued stop-work orders after unsafe working conditions were found at their worksites, as the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) ramps up enforcement efforts amid a spike in workplace fatalities. In a Facebook post on Thursday (Aug 4) about the unsafe practices by the errant companies in recent inspections, MOM added that CAD Associates was fined $21,000 and KHC Development, $20,000. To lift the stop-work orders, said MOM, they must: • rectify all unsafe work conditions; • engage third-party auditors to assess their workplace safety and health management systems; • develop action plans based on the audit findings; and • install closed-circuit television cameras at places where high-risk activities are being carried out. Mr Sebastian Tan, director of MOM's occupational safety and health inspectorate, said: ""The site conditions at these two worksites are appalling and unacceptable. ""Our workers must never be subject to such imminent dangers where they risk falling from height or have materials collapsing on them. ""As construction activities pick up, contractors must step up their efforts to keep our worksites safe for our workers."" A series of seven photos depicting the unsafe practices found at the worksites were attached to the Facebook post. One photo, which MOM said was taken at KHC Development’s worksite, shows a worker erecting formwork, or temporary moulds used for casting concrete structures, at height without any harness. Fall prevention measures, such as effective barricades or proper work platforms, were absent, said MOM. ""During our inspections, the most common workplace safety contravention was working at height without effective and adequate fall prevention in place."" It added: ""Proper supervision and fall prevention measures must be implemented according to the fall prevention plan before any work-at-height activity is to be done in the workplace."" Another photo shows an elevated work area at CAD Associates’ worksite without barricades installed. An A-frame ladder was also incorrectly used to provide workers access to the area. Said MOM: ""A secured step ladder or monkey ladder with proper handholds should be used for access onto the work area instead."" Yet another photo of the same worksite shows a scaffold, seemingly at an incomplete terraced house, erected by untrained workers. The scaffold was placed in an unsafe manner on the roof, with unsecured access to the scaffold, said MOM. The ministry said scaffolds must be erected by trained workers, and that an approved scaffold contractor must be engaged for scaffolds more than 4m in height. Mr Desmond Teoh, project director at CAD Associates, told The Straits Times that work had stopped at the worksite, a 3½-storey landed property, since early July. “We are doing all the necessary rectifications and cooperating with MOM to meet their requirements, but the building will take an extra half-year to be completed,” he said, noting that the firm’s other projects have not been affected. Mr Teoh said that though the workers hired directly by the company are aware of safety requirements and have at least five years’ experience, he recognised that more supervision is needed to ensure corners are not cut. “After the incident, we hired a full-time safety supervisor to be at the site the whole day,” he said. The firm has also engaged a professional safety auditor and a workplace safety and health officer to improve safety at the site. “I think our business has definitely been affected, but we have to communicate with our clients that we are trying to improve. There is no point for us to hide anything.” KHC Development declined to comment when contacted. Singapore recorded its 31st workplace fatality this year on July 20, sparking a discussion in Parliament on Monday after Radin Mas MP Melvin Yong filed an adjournment motion on the worrying trend. To report unsafe work practices, the public is advised to use this feedback form or call 6438-5122."
https://www.straitstimes.com/business/flexi-work-becoming-more-common-in-spore-despite-shift-to-living-with-covid-19-0,Flexi-work becoming more common in S'pore despite shift to living with Covid-19,"SINGAPORE - Flexible work arrangements have become more common among organisations in Singapore despite the country's transition to living with Covid-19. Many employers have chosen to continue riding the work-from-home momentum, allowing staff to operate remotely for part of the week. All employees here have been able to return to the workplace since April 26, alongside the easing of other Covid-19 measures, including group size limits. Aside from large corporates, the public service has also been a leader in adopting flexible workplace arrangements, with the likes of the Auditor-General's Office and the Government Technology Agency allowing employees to work from home some days of the week. While flexible work is most closely associated with work from home, it includes other arrangements, such as staggered work hours and job sharing. Other than telecommuting, public service agencies also allow some staff to stagger their work hours, such as starting earlier or later than the usual time. This flexibility is seen not only to benefit those with caregiving duties, but could also help to reduce peak-hour traffic congestion. The broader adoption of hybrid work arrangements here mirrors the shifts seen globally. Financial institutions such as Citi, HSBC and UBS have flexible work plans. Citi Singapore, for one, will allow most staff to work remotely for up to two days a week by the third quarter of the year, with some teams already adopting such flexible arrangements. The American bank employs about 8,500 full-time and contract staff in Singapore. Manpower Minister Tan See Leng said at an event last week that the Government would like more companies to adopt the Tripartite Standard on Flexible Work Arrangements, which includes having a clear policy on how staff can ask for such arrangements to be put in place. Workers have noted that telecommuting has contributed to much better work-life harmony for them, said Dr Tan, adding that helping people achieve this harmony is one way in which employers can foster inclusive and progressive workplaces where employees feel valued and empowered. The White Paper on women's development released earlier this year said that the Government may introduce a new set of guidelines by 2024 that will require employers to consider staff requests for flexible work arrangements fairly and properly. The Ministry of Manpower has said that the guidelines will establish the norm that it is acceptable to request flexible work arrangements, while maintaining the employers' prerogative to decide, taking into account business needs. Consultations are expected to be held before the guidelines are finalised. In the meantime, the discourse on remote working and flexible work arrangements in Singapore remains fluid, with issues such as tax treatment, employers' obligations towards remote workers and employee mental health to be addressed."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/most-recent-workplace-deaths-were-experienced-workers-tan-see-leng,Most recent workplace deaths in S'pore were experienced workers: Tan See Leng,"SINGAPORE - Most workers who died at the workplace in the last few months were experienced staff. ""One would have intuitively thought it's because of new workers, young, inexperienced workers coming in to fill up these jobs, that is contributing to the spate of accidents,"" said Dr Tan See Leng, Minister of Manpower, in a video interview with The Straits Times on Friday (July 29). ""However, we find that actually, many of the accidents, the fatalities, actually involve people who are very experienced. ""That, in itself, tells you that it is not a function of the training or the level of experience."" He added: ""I think some of the factors could be the fact that people are ramping up (work)... They're trying to catch up for lost time."" Dr Tan, who is also Second Minister for Trade and Industry, said that monitoring in work sites has been stepped up in response to the spate of accidents. ""We are also looking at and reviewing the entire framework of monitoring, and some of the ideas that we have mooted include doing a very comprehensive pre-start worksite assessment of where some of the danger areas are."" Other ideas include a framework to take employers and supervisors to task with suspension and demerit points, and even real-time surveillance at very high-risk work sites to aid learning from potential safety lapses and near-misses. Dr Tan's comments come after the 31st work-related death this year, which was announced on Wednesday by Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council chairman John Ng during a speech at the annual WSH Awards, which was held at Resorts World Sentosa. A 55-year-old trainer, employed by consultancy services and training firm Citadelle, died on July 20 after falling off a boat at the Police Coast Guard's headquarters in Pulau Brani and was struck by the propeller of the boat's motor. In a signal of grave concern over the death toll, Radin Mas MP Melvin Yong will speak on workplace safety for up to 20 minutes in an adjournment motion at the end of next Monday's parliamentary sitting, with Senior Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad set to reply."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/higher-wage-demands-of-workers-inevitable-firms-need-to-transform-tan-see-leng,"Higher wage demands of workers inevitable, firms need to transform: Tan See Leng","SINGAPORE - The higher wage demands of workers amid surging inflation are inevitable, and companies here need to find ways of competing other than on low labour costs, said Manpower Minister Tan See Leng. ""If the only model that our businesses have is depending on low-cost labour, it is not a sustainable model,"" added Dr Tan, who was speaking to The Straits Times after visiting events management firm Aux Media Group on Friday (July 29). One possible way, in the short term, would be to ""slice and dice"" a single role into several smaller ones to attract workers in sectors which are in dire need of staff due to a faster-than-expected rebound, such as hospitality, he suggested. This would allow more flexible working arrangements that can appeal to untapped segments of Singapore's workforce, such as seniors, stay-at-home mothers and those with caregiving responsibilities. Dr Tan said: ""In the medium and long term... I think we need to think of new ways, whether it's through job redesign, productivity value-added improvements, or even using technology, to see how we can solve some of these bottlenecks."" Increasing workers' wages is a global trend, he said, and employers here are competing with other countries, not just domestically, for talent. During his trips abroad, Dr Tan said he has met many individuals who recognise the credibility of Singapore's workers. ""Because they are more assured of the calibre... they are also prepared to pay higher,"" he added. ""What's happening around the world in terms of uplifting of wages will directly have an impact on our people here as well."" On Friday, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) released advance estimates for the labour market in the second quarter. Dr Tan said his ministry is monitoring layoffs in the technology industry in the region. ""We see this as an opportunity for us to leverage this pool of talent as well,"" he added. One company that transformed itself during the Covid-19 pandemic is Aux Media Group. It previously specialised in managing real-life events, but the pandemic prompted it to shift to offering extended reality technology. The technology - which comprises special cameras, and walls and flooring made of display panels - allows presenters to visualise and interact with digital graphics that both an online and on-site audience can see, making for more immersive hybrid events. The company, a pioneer in extended reality in Singapore, has sent its staff for a customised career conversion programme that it designed together with statutory board Workforce Singapore. Extended reality production head Richard Ong, 42, who participated in the programme from last October to March, said: ""Extended reality combines the virtual environment with the physical environment, so it actually makes you think about what is real and what isn't - that's what fascinates me about it."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/spore-job-market-continues-recovery-in-q2-global-headwinds-such-as-inflation-to-dampen-demand,Job market continues recovery but faces global headwinds ,"SINGAPORE - Singapore's job market continued its recovery in the second quarter of this year but global headwinds, such as rising inflation, the Russian-Ukraine conflict and a resurgence of Covid-19 infections in major economies including China, may dampen labour demand. Resident employment - Singaporeans and permanent residents - has surpassed pre-pandemic levels by around 4 per cent since December last year and will likely see subdued growth due to the improving unemployment situation, according to advance estimates released by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).  ""Going forward, we expect non-resident employment to continue growing at a robust pace as it catches up to its pre-Covid-19 level,"" said the ministry on Friday (July 29). Non-resident employment, based on latest estimates, remains about 10 per cent lower than 2019 levels. For the second quarter, total employment - excluding migrant domestic workers - expanded by 64,400 or 1.9 per cent. Driving this growth was the services sector, which saw 27,300 employed, closely followed by 25,200 in construction and 12,200 in manufacturing. Total employment grew at a faster pace than the first quarter’s 42,000 or 1.2 per cent. Non-residents, particularly in construction and manufacturing, drove the increase as employers in these sectors hired to fill a backlog of vacancies and meet rising demand after border restrictions were eased further since April, said MOM. Its report found that more residents found employment, especially in growth sectors such as information and communications, professional services, and financial services. Meanwhile, retrenchments declined to around 1,000 for the second quarter, rewriting the record low of 1,320 set in the first quarter. The services sector accounted for the bulk of the retrenchments with about 700 workers laid off, followed by 200 in manufacturing and 100 in construction. ""As with recent quarters, business reorganisation or restructuring remained the top reason for layoffs,"" said MOM. This comes amid high-profile layoffs at technology and cryptocurrency firms, including Tesla, Shopee, Coinbase and Crypto.com last month. Meanwhile, unemployment rates, which peaked in October 2020, held steady after reaching pre-Covid-19 levels in February this year, amid a tight labour market and a record number of job vacancies available. Last month, the overall unemployment rate was 2.1 per cent, down from 2.2 per cent in May. The resident unemployment rate fell to 2.9 per cent, from 3 per cent, while that for citizens remained at 3.1 per cent. In its report, MOM said hiring is expected to remain strong in the coming months, as the proportion of companies that indicated they will increase manpower in the next three months continued to rise by 1.5 percentage points in June, compared with March. But it added: “(Wage) pressures could ease, as fewer firms (28 per cent) in June 2022 indicated that they were thinking of increasing the wages of their employees, compared with March (31 per cent).” More details, including the breakdown of resident and non-resident employment, sectoral breakdowns and re-entry rates among retrenched residents, on the labour market in the second quarter will be released in September. Remarking on the report at the sidelines of a visit to an events management firm, Minister for Manpower Tan See Leng said on Friday that total employment is 99 per cent of what it was in 2019, underscoring the strong recovery. He also noted that non-resident employment is set to increase at a faster pace as non-resident workers in construction, manufacturing and some process sectors return to fill up vacancies. The fillip that relaxed restrictions have given to small and medium-sized enterprises, especially in hospitality, exceeded expectations, he said. He added: “They are experiencing an even higher demand and supply, an even higher surge, compared with official estimates... they want to ramp up their hiring. “But there are many traditional sectors that the resident workforce cannot fill adequately - this is what’s going to drive the increase.” Mr Richard Bradshaw, managing director for Asia at executive search firm Ethos BeathChapman, said that the high number of hires in the growth sectors reflects the high number of vacancies that employers are trying to fill. Positions in these sectors that have been the hardest to fill include sustainability experts, which demand skill sets that remain scarce in the market. He added that employers are increasingly retaining talent by redeploying them to new positions within the company, adding to the crunch. “A lot of talent that would have moved have now been retained, stopping people from joining the labour market.”"
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/train-support-workers-to-bring-out-their-best-manpower-minister-tan-see-leng,"Train, support workers to bring out their best: Manpower Minister Tan See Leng","SINGAPORE - As many as eight in 10 employers here allow flexible work, but many are doing it so casually that job seekers, and even their own employees, know nothing about their flexible work option. The Government would like more companies to adopt the Tripartite Standard on Flexible Work Arrangements which, in turn, would help these firms be visual and more appealing to talent, said Minister for Manpower Tan See Leng on Monday (July 25). The tripartite standard include having a clear policy on how employees could ask for flexible work arrangements, how these requests are evaluated, and how outcomes are conveyed to workers. Firms that adopt these standards are recognised by the tripartite alliance of Government, employer and labour movements for their progressive flexible work practices. Dr Tan made his remarks at the launch of DBS Future Forward Week, the bank's annual learning event for employees at the bank's Marina Bay headquarters. In a speech peppered with humour, Dr Tan praised DBS as a ""standard-bearer"" in future proofing local workers. He commended its retraining of staff, and efforts in making its employees feel valued, engaged and empowered - a topic ""very close to my heart"", he said. In his speech, Dr Tan singled out cloud engineer Brian Chiong, 32, and wealth planning manager, Ms Parameswari Rajandiran, 48. Mr Chiong learned various IT functions, including cyber security, after joining DBS. He lost his job when his previous employer downsized during the pandemic. Ms Rajandiran started as a bank teller at DBS. Her managers encouraged her to go for part-time diploma studies before she got her current role. There are 260,000 women and 120,000 retirees outside the workforce - an untapped talent pool waiting for employers to draw upon in this tight labour market, said Dr Tan. Employers that offer work-life harmony, that support their workers to meet both career and personal aspirations, will have an edge. ""I cannot emphasis it more,"" he said. Banks in Singapore, including UOB and OCBC, have launched extensive job training and redesign programmes in recent years as swathes of bank jobs get wiped out by rapid automation and digitalisation. Flexible work options have become one of the ""ammo"" in the battle for talent, especially in tech and wealth management roles. Since February last year, DBS employees could work remotely up to 40 per cent of their work hours. Caregivers and young parents could do so completely for up to six consecutive months. DBS also allows a role to be spilt between two employees, with no halving of medical benefits and insurance coverage - a first, it says, for a local bank. Last month, employee satisfaction with their flexible work arrangements hit 92 per cent, DBS said, a surge from just over 80 per cent early this year."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/askst-jobs-i-am-not-happy-with-my-salary-how-do-i-ask-my-boss-for-a-pay-raise,askST Jobs: I am not happy with my salary. How do I ask my boss for a pay rise?,"In this series, manpower correspondent Calvin Yang offers practical answers to candid questions on navigating workplace challenges and getting ahead in your career. A: Prices of goods and services have been going up as a result of global shocks. Salaries, though, may not necessarily keep up. During uncertain times, it is not uncommon to request for a pay rise, say observers. Yet the thought of discussing money matters can be uncomfortable. Before you stomp up to your supervisor, ask yourself a few questions. Have you contributed significantly? What is the salary benchmark for your role in the current job market? Has it been a long time since the last pay review? Is your company doing well? Have you successfully wrapped up projects recently? Is it a good time now? Essentially, reflect on whether you deserve a pay rise. Adecco Singapore country manager Betul Genc says this may include the following: consistently over-exceeding your targets or having in-demand skill sets. Factors also include taking pay cuts or salary freezes during the Covid-19 pandemic. Next, research and seek opinions from others in similar fields to gauge whether your package is within acceptable market range, advises Ms Genc. ""Depending on your organisation's appraisal requirements, self-assess your key performance indicators, achievements, competency level, corporate values and development."" In other words, do your homework to support your case. There are many salary guides and calculators available online to help you learn about the rough pay range for your position. With this in mind, you can then get a better idea of how much to ask for. Depending on your reasons, this would probably be between 3 per cent and 20 per cent. The higher the percentage you want, the better your reasons should be, say observers. Mr David Blasco, general manager at recruitment firm Randstad Singapore, suggests asking a mentor from the same career and industry. ""They are more likely to give you an accurate figure of what other companies are offering for someone with similar experience and skills as you."" Next, review your recent accomplishments. Consistently hitting targets, delivering projects ahead of schedule, winning top awards or taking on extra responsibilities are often grounds for an increment. Make a list of these, with specific examples. After that, consider if it is the right time to ask your boss for a meeting. Do not ask for a pay rise when your company has just laid staff off, there are cutbacks in spending or when your boss is busy settling a personal issue. You get the idea. It is also useful to know if your company has pay increase practices. If so, is it a monthly, quarterly or yearly review? Once a private meeting with your boss is confirmed, rehearse what you are going to say. It is best to avoid personal reasons. Go into the specifics. State your desired pay, highlight the research you have done and share examples of how your work has helped the company. Go in knowing that you deserve that increment and speak with confidence. Always prepare some answers to follow-up questions and be ready to negotiate. One thing to note while negotiating for a higher salary is to remain cordial and reasonable throughout the whole process, says Mr Blasco. ""You should be mentally prepared that your expectations may not be met, and be able to keep an open mind to negotiate and align on your next steps with your managers. ""Going into the conversation with the wrong attitude or mindset could have negative consequences to your employment and your manager's perception of you as an employee and person."" It is highly unlikely that your supervisor will say yes to that increment right away, since he or she would have to raise it to the higher-ups. But it would be good to check back. Meanwhile, continue to contribute and build up your case. But what if - even after going through all that trouble - your boss still says no? Do not be disappointed. You can still negotiate for better benefits such as extended annual leave, or you could even ask for areas to improve on. If you feel you deserve more, maybe you would be better off finding another job that rewards you fairly. At the end of the day, it pays to know your worth. Have a question?

Check out the refreshed Singapore Salary Guide by The Straits Times, which allows you to explore the salary trends for your role and whether you are earning as much as your peers. You can also use it to find out where your skills can take you. A data scientist, for instance, would likely have data design, visualisation and analytics skills and can take on other roles such as operations research analysts.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/career-coaching-related-skills-in-demand-amid-business-and-job-transformation-report,Career coaching-related skills in demand amid business and job transformation: Report,"SINGAPORE - Career counselling and coaching-related skills have become more significant and in demand, with business transformation taking place in almost all industries and changes to job roles, said a SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) report on Saturday (July 23). The top skills in demand include those involving capability development and performance management as the need rises for personalised advice and coaching to help people enhance workplace performance or prepare for career pivoting. Career or workplace coaches take on the main responsibility of identifying skills gaps, bridging them, and discovering opportunities for adjacent roles with similar skill requirements, the report said. Job posting data showed that hiring demand for career coaches increased by 93 per cent from the second quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2022. Companies hiring for such roles are largely in the energy, info-communications technology, consulting and recruitment, and financial services sectors. The Jobs-Skills Quarterly Insights report published by SSG on Saturday, the first in a series, spotlighted skills for professionals involved in the training and adult education sector. Each quarterly report will focus on a specific sector or job type in the economy that is critical and/or high-growth. Saturday's report also highlighted two other trends: Education technologies and related skills are powering the training and adult education business; and there is increased recognition of the importance of workplace learning, and the need for capabilities to organise the workplace for learning. Demand for workplace learning roles has also more than doubled from the second quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2022, based on job posting data. ""Workplace learning has grown in importance as it continues to augment the organisation's learning culture while addressing other urgent issues like tackling skills gaps and preparing the workforce with skills required for changing business priorities,"" the report said. It noted that in-house training sessions, on-the-job coaching, and self-initiated learning, such as through online platforms, are among the ways workplace learning takes place. The SSG report said the role of the training and adult education sector is becoming more important as the size of the workforce participating in upskilling or reskilling is expected to increase, and the frequency of participation is likely to intensify. About 660,000 people took part in initiatives supported by SSG in 2021, higher than the 540,000 seen in 2020. The Jobs-Skills Quarterly Insights, along with the annual Skills Demand for the Future Economy report first launched last December, is part of efforts to improve SSG's sharing of insights on skills that matter to employers and the economy. The report was unveiled by Minister of State for Education and Manpower Gan Siow Huang at the SkillsFuture Festival@SUTD, held at the Singapore University of Technology and Design on Saturday. Mr Tan Kok Yam, chief executive of SSG, said its aim of improving the sharing of skills insights is to better help Singaporeans identify upskilling needs and career opportunities. He said: ""We hope that our sharing can enable individuals, companies and training providers to be more responsive to the rapid changes in skills that matter to the economy. ""We see the development of skills insights as a collective endeavour with industry experts and sector professionals, and we welcome feedback and views on how to improve."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/lazada-singapore-partners-with-ntuc-to-give-staff-brighter-advancement-prospects,Lazada S'pore partners with NTUC to give staff brighter advancement prospects,"SINGAPORE - More than 700 logistics staff under Lazada Singapore will pick up skills to prepare them for new jobs and be adept at using technology, robotics and automation at the workplace. This comes as the e-commerce company signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Food, Drinks and Allied Workers Union (FDAWU) to set up a company training committee (CTC). The union is affiliated to the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC). The eventual aim is for Lazada to put in place a road map to help its transport and warehouse workers advance in their careers and earn more, and for there to be a company-based progressive wage model, said NTUC, FDAWU and Lazada in a joint statement. NTUC secretary-general Ng Chee Meng said on Friday (July 22) that with the MOU, the labour movement wants to partner the company so that it can increase staff productivity and improve business performance. With better business, Lazada workers can enjoy better wages and better work prospects in the long term, he said during a visit to Lazada's West Fulfilment Centre in Jalan Buroh, adding that it will be a win-win for both sides. Lazada chief executive officer Loh Wee Lee said a structured career path with upskilling initiatives allows workers to switch roles or climb the career ladder. ""Progressive wages are a part of this and we intend for all our logistics colleagues to develop a meaningful career with us,"" he added. The MOU was signed during Mr Ng's visit to the Lazada centre. CTCs comprise representatives from a company's management and union leaders. Their job is to review a firm's training plans, identify skill gaps, plan for reskilling and career progression for workers, and develop new training programmes. Through the CTC, Lazada said it plans to develop a structured career pathway for e-commerce logistics. For example, a delivery representative can progress to be a route-planning manager or a supervisor of a group of delivery representatives. Staff who are expected to benefit are those in the warehouse and transport roles servicing the company's supermarket service, RedMart. Among them is Mr Muhammad Reno Abdul Rashid, a 27-year-old shift operations manager who manages the shifts for 150 staff. He looks forward to sending more staff for upskilling courses. ""I don't think anyone just wants to be stagnant at one place,"" he said. The Government is setting aside $100 million to scale up efforts to help companies implement concrete training and transformation programmes. A total of $70 million has been set aside for the NTUC CTC Grant. From Aug 1, companies that have set out concrete plans to transform their workforce, raise productivity, redesign jobs and upskill workers will be able to tap this grant. Lazada is looking to apply for the grant, which will be used to upskill its workers, among other things. FDAWU general secretary Tan Hock Soon said the union will work with Lazada to apply for the grant. ""Workers would be able to perform their work more efficiently and achieve higher productivity, allowing them to enjoy rewards through career development, progression and better salary remuneration."""

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/unfair-tender-clauses-a-systemic-harm-to-security-industry-security-association,Unfair tender clauses a systemic harm to security industry: Security Association,"SINGAPORE - Incidents of security guards being abused make headlines and spark public furore, but discriminatory clauses in service agreements are more harmful to the private security industry. That is because the clauses point to a systemic problem, said the umbrella body that represents the sector. Mr Raj Joshua Thomas, president of the Security Association Singapore (SAS): ""It is an even bigger problem than abuse - because abuse is incidental but discriminatory and unfair working conditions are systemic."" Examples of discriminatory clauses include those that specify age limits or allow officers to be sacked without good reason or avenues of appeal, said Mr Thomas, who was speaking on Thursday (July 21) at an annual awards ceremony to recognise exemplary security officers. He said: ""Such clauses in service agreements are negotiated and agreed by the service buyer and the security agency, but affect the security officer."" He added that SAS recently received notice of another tender that included a clause stipulating a maximum age for security officers. He did not name the managing agent that put out the tender. “What I shall share at this time is that this managing agent is a repeat offender,” he said. SAS has in the past publicised discriminatory tenders for condominium security officers by managing agents Savills and Knight Frank. It has not named the managing agent as it is still verifying the latest tender, Mr Thomas, who is also a nominated MP, told The Straits Times. At the event, 150 awards were presented, with the top plaudits reserved for five officers that showed exceptional performance and dedication to their role. Ms Geethaa Nalatamby and Mr Bharat Kumar Kanabathy received the Security Officer of The Year award, while Mr Pravin Manimaran, Mr Sures Perumal and Mr Neo Ah Whatt received the SAS President's Medal for Professionalism. Ms Geethaa, a 29-year-old Malaysian working for Certis, was lauded for comforting a distraught patron she stumbled upon in January while patrolling IMM mall, where she has worked for the last six years. She said: ""She was sitting on a ledge on the fourth floor at a carpark staircase, with her legs facing out. I approached her calmly, and gently grasped her hand... and spoke to her for 10 to 15 minutes."" The patron confided her relationship problems to her, she added. ""I was focused on getting her to come down from the ledge first,"" she said, before she called her superiors, who informed the police and mall management. Meanwhile, Mr Neo, 63, whose efforts to deter a white Bentley from entering Red Swastika School against the flow of traffic back in January were cited for his award, had a tip for fellow security officers. Speaking in Mandarin, he said: ""We are just doing our job, and enforcing the rules... so stay calm. if a member of the public gets agitated, just inform your superiors and don't get emotional."" Senior Minister of State for Manpower and Defence Zaqy Mohamad, who spoke at the event, commended SAS for highlighting contractual agreements that are unfair to both security officers and agencies. Mr Zaqy said the security sector has a constant demand for manpower. There are initiatives in place to improve wages, well-being and productivity, he said, and that more than 40,000 security officers have benefited from the Progressive Wage Model, which was introduced for the security sector in 2016. In-house security officers will be covered under the model from September. ""Our security officers keep us safe day in, day out and deserve our support and recognition for their commitment and professionalism,"" he said."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/pandemic-era-notification-to-mom-about-wage-cuts-to-cease-from-aug-1,Pandemic-era notification to MOM about wage cuts to cease from Aug 1,"SINGAPORE - Employers with 10 or more workers will no longer have to inform the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) of wage cuts taken in the name of cost-saving from Aug 1. This comes as average monthly notifications fell to eight on average in the first three months of this year, compared with a peak of 1,713 at the start of the circuit breaker in April 2020, MOM said. It instituted the reporting rule in March 2020 to monitor the pandemic impact on workers, as well as to provide timely aid to employers. It was a temporary measure, said MOM. On Aug 1, its advisory on retrenchment benefits owed to laid-off employees will also cease to take effect. The May 2020 advisory allowed employers leeway with payouts, such as giving lump sums to workers that they let go. This softened the financial strain on employers over norms laid out by the tripartite alliance, such as pro-rated payouts for retrenched workers' each year of service. From 198 at its highest in August 2020, the number of employers turning to this relief measure has fallen to a monthly average of eight in the first three months of this year, MOM said. Employers carrying out layoffs must still notify MOM within five days after informing affected staff, if the firm hires at least 10 workers. They can refer to the tripartite advisory on managing excess manpower and responsible retrenchment, the ministry added. In response to the report, labour MP Patrick Tay reminded employers that they should inform unions and MOM early so that retrenched workers can get help.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/fewer-pay-and-dismissal-disputes-last-year-as-singapore-economy-recovered,Fewer pay and dismissal disputes last year as S'pore economy began recovery,"SINGAPORE -  As the pandemic-stricken economy started healing, more unpaid wages were fully reclaimed from employers and fewer workers lodged complaints for wrongful dismissals.  Overall, workers took fewer disputes with their employers to the authorities last year, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) in the release of the 2021 Employment Standards Report on Monday (July 18).  Workers clawed back $8.6 million in salary claims, down from $15 million the year before. Such claims formed the bulk of total complaints at 82 per cent.  Fewer wage claims arose with the recovery in the accommodation, food services, wholesale and retail trade sectors, said MOM.  Singapore’s foreign workers also made much fewer claims, it added.  In total, 5,882 claims and appeals were made. Local workers filed 64 per cent of them, with the remainder from foreigners.  The tally translates to 1.73 claims per every 1,000 employees - excluding foreign maids - lodged last year, compared with 2.59 in 2020.  The ministry said its early interventions over the last two years have worked.  It had encouraged employers to declare upfront when they could not pay wages so they could tap aid, and workers could alert the ministry of salary arrears early via an app.  That helped ensure salaries were paid to some 24,000 foreign workers last year without the need for them to make formal claims, it added.  At the same time, the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) resolved about 84 per cent of salary claims, and referred the remaining to the Employment Claims Tribunals for adjudication.  The TADM was set up by the Ministry of Manpower, National Trades Union Congress and Singapore National Employers Federation to mediate and advise workers and employers on employment disputes. 2021 was the “best performing year” since TADM’s set-up in 2017, said its general manager Kandhavel Periyasamy.  He said the body did well in terms of the number of disputes it mediated to resolution, the speed of resolution, and the percentage of workers who sought its help and recovered their wages in full.  The number of claims rectified in two months rose drastically from 76 per cent in 2020 to 92 per cent last year, due to the drop in claims filed.  More unpaid wages were fully reclaimed from employers, from 92 per cent in 2020 to 95 per cent.  There were also fewer claims for wrongful dismissals – at 0.27 claim for every 1,000 workers last year, compared with 0.39 in 2020.  About 26 per cent of workers succeeded with their charges. In total, employers paid back $1.5 million for wrongful dismissals claims.  They also had to make redress with compensation, clarifications or facilitation of the employee’s job search.  Unsubstantiated claims, said the report, “often involved disputes over work performance or had arisen due to miscommunication between the employer and employee”. Some of these claims came through a portal, which will soon be enhanced with artificial intelligence to aid settlements in future.  The Online Dispute Resolution portal, as it is called, allows the mediator to facilitate virtual conversations between the employer and worker, and guide them to reach a resolution.  The portal has handled 430 claims since its launch in March 2021, with 32 per cent concluded among contentious parties before TADM had to step in. Another 56 per cent were resolved in virtual mediation without parties even having to meet.  Further improvements to allow remote signing of settlement agreements and a chatbot to help with claims filing and computation are being planned by next year, the report said.  Besides raising workers’ understanding of the Employment Act, MOM is also stepping up enforcement checks for errant employers, especially those hiring workers in vulnerable sectors under the Progressive Wage Model, such as cleaning and landscaping, as well as security services.   About 90 employers were found to have breached progressive wage levels and about a third of security agencies deployed their officers beyond the maximum work hours allowed under the Act last year. Here’s a look at three cases that were handled by the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management, which mediates and advises workers and employers on employment disputes. Names have been withheld for confidentiality.  Mr Lee's Singapore employer agreed to help him switch employment to a vendor after he decided to stay put in Malaysia - where he had returned home to during the pandemic - after border controls ceased. But the employer botched the paperwork, and he lodged a claim with TADM for wrongful dismissal. TADM found no conclusive evidence to back up his claim. After mediation, Mr Lee's employer compensated him for his loss of income during that period as a gesture of goodwill. Gary was owed more than $7,000 for supplies and meals that he was regularly asked to buy for other workers when his company's cash flow dried up during the pandemic. After several failed tries to get his boss to pay him, he filed a claim for unpaid salary. Under mediation, his boss agreed to settle in three instalments, with progress to be tracked by TADM. After two months, Gary got his reimbursements. Daniel took his boss to TADM for unpaid salary after working overtime for no pay, and receiving only part of his wages in his two years of employment. His boss agreed to pay less than half of what he was owed. After TADM warned that the case would be sent to the Employment Claims Tribunals for adjudication, Daniel's boss relented."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/askst-jobs-i-feel-mentally-exhausted-working-from-home-what-can-i-do,askST Jobs: I feel mentally exhausted working from home. What can I do?,"In this series, manpower correspondent Calvin Yang offers practical answers to candid questions on navigating workplace challenges and getting ahead in your career. A: You are not alone. This is one of the big downsides of working from home - being unable to properly ""knock off"" even after working hours, and finding it hard to avoid replying to late e-mail messages from the higher-ups. ""Before the Covid-19 pandemic, there were often specific physical domains where we apportioned our mental faculties. This may have led to a conditioning of sorts where we felt a certain way at work and where we felt a certain way at home,"" says Mr Praveen Nair, a psychologist and senior consultant at Raven Counselling and Consultancy. But with hybrid work, the lines between the workplace and home tend to blur and this has put pressure on many workers. For instance, an operations manager whom The Straits Times interviewed previously monitors performance trends and conducts meetings from his dining table. In between work tasks, he would grab quick meals and look after his active toddler while his accountant wife does video calls. He would log on close to midnight to clear e-mails, sometimes working until 2am. Being out of the office, he felt the need to be more plugged in and found it hard to switch off when work messages appeared on his phone. It is a plight that is being played out in countless other homes for the past two years. While the flexibility of working from home does have its benefits, one may find himself working longer hours than usual, recent studies have found. This may put a strain on mental health in the long run. An online poll of 1,200 respondents by The Straits Times in November 2020 found that 71 per cent have felt more stressed since they started working from home. A more recent study of 1076 workers commissioned by the newspaper in January found that one in two Singapore employees has been grappling with longer working hours since the Covid-19 pandemic began two years ago. The top reasons for the extended hours are difficulties drawing boundaries with work-from-home arrangements, increased tasks such as more paperwork, and covering for colleagues who have quit. The findings are not surprising, according to observers. In other parts of the world, studies have found that Covid-19 has disrupted job schedules, with people more likely to work on weekends and outside of nine-to-five hours. A relatively quick fix is to go back to the office more often. A change in scenery and having face-to-face interactions with your colleagues can offer you some mental reprieve, says Singapore Human Resources Institute president Low Peck Kem. But there could be days when you prefer to work from home due to other obligations such as childcare. What you can do while working from home is to take breaks. You could take a trip to the kitchen to make a cup of tea, chat with your family members about non-work matters, or even rest on the couch for several minutes. Reduce screen time if you can and try to avoid responding to non-urgent requests when it is time to knock off. ""Where possible, switch to audio calls instead of video conferences,"" suggests Mr Nair. ""The former may take up less neural resources thereby potentially reducing exhaustion."" If you have been mostly working from home and find the transition difficult, give yourself time to ease into hybrid work arrangements. Research has shown that working from home for two days a week is best for most people. Ms Low says: ""Find a sweet spot for yourself and discuss with your manager on what is doable and most effective."" Keep a note of necessary tasks for the day, says Mr Nair. ""The note can serve as a checklist that provides a greater sense of accomplishment at the end of the day."" Realise that you can take charge of your own time. If things get overwhelming, try speaking with a professional or career counsellor. Have a question? Send it to askst@sph.com.sg."

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/new-network-for-corporate-leaders-to-help-provide-support-and-mentorship,New network for corporate leaders to help provide support and mentorship,"SINGAPORE - A new network for corporate leaders was launched on Friday (July 15) to help equip Singaporean leaders with skills to navigate an increasingly complex business environment. One key aim of the Singapore Leaders Network (SGLN), launched by the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) and Human Capital Leadership Institute (HCLI), is to help expose Singaporeans to overseas opportunities. It will bring people at different stages of their careers together for them to leverage on one another's experiences, and help to organise activities such as dialogues and workshops. Speaking at the launch of the network at One Farrer Hotel, managing director of EDB Jacqueline Poh said business leaders have had to cope with the health and economic impacts of the pandemic, such as supply chain disruptions and rising inflation. It is in times like these that leadership in the business community will make a difference, and experience, exposure and strong networks are necessary to help tackle these uncertain times. While Singaporeans have most of the right attributes, more will need to take on overseas postings to become global leaders, she added. ""This is an area where we still have a long way to go. Companies that we deal with at EDB are telling us that doing a tour of duty in key markets overseas is necessary to progress upwards in the company,"" Ms Poh said, adding that there is still reluctance to take on such work. The network includes the SGLN Mentoring Programme, which will pair participants with more established corporate leaders. These include local senior executives who hold positions in Singapore companies and multinational corporations, or foreigners who are based here. There are currently 21 Singaporean and three foreign mentors. The programme will take place over six to nine months, with mentors expected to commit to at least three meetings with their mentees. There are no fees involved. HCLI will track the progress of these meet-ups. The SGLN currently has about 250 members, most of whom are professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs). They come from aerospace, finance, healthcare, tourism, supply chain, tech and semiconductor firms. About one third have less than five years of leadership experience while another one-third have between five and 10 years. The remainder have more than 10 years of leadership experience, including regional and global responsibilities. These members also have job titles that span from more junior roles, such as managers, to more senior ones such as chief financial officers or managing directors. There are no strict restrictions on age and career stage to join the SGLN, although those who would like to join as a mentee will need to be Singaporean. One of the mentors for the programme is Mr Rajan Krishnakumar, a vice-president and people business partner of international markets at payments giant Mastercard. Having worked in India besides Singapore, he hopes to be able to share his experiences in navigating cultural nuances in different workplaces. He said: ""I think I can share my international multicultural experiences and help individuals get out of their comfort zone, or think about ways that they can broaden their horizons."" Also present at the launch was Minister of State for Trade and Industry Alvin Tan, who shared about how he had benefited from mentorship, such as while at Goldman Sachs, a global company that provides a range of financial services. Mr Tan, who is also Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth, said: ""There is peer mentoring, and there is also reverse mentoring. I learn from junior colleagues all the time. ""I think SGLN is a wonderful platform for those in different stages of their career to keep the conversation open and to identify mentors who you think can help you in your careers."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/structured-career-planning-guide-launched-for-employers-to-better-prepare-mature-workers-for-business-transformation,New guide to help employers in career planning for mature workers,"SINGAPORE - Bosses dealing with the oft-tricky issue of career planning for older workers have a new source of advice they can turn to. The Structured Career Planning guidebook released on Wednesday (July 13) gives employers a framework to implement a process to engage staff on career and skills development. Senior Minister of State for Manpower Koh Poh Koon noted at the launch that the initiative is vital to support Singapore's ageing workforce - around 25 per cent of resident workers are over 55 - and ensure that older people are prepared for longer careers. ""If we look at a worker who starts working in his early 20s, and retires at 65 years old, by the time he is a mature worker at 45, he is only halfway through his career,"" he noted. ""So the real challenge is not in raising the retirement age, but in making sure that our workers continue to reskill themselves, in order to remain relevant to business and industry needs."" Dr Koh added that the best way to do this is for employers to talk to staff at regular points in their careers to help them develop the skills they need. This is where the guide comes in, as it helps bosses to start these conversations in a structured manner from the time a worker turns 45. It provides a checklist for workers to state their priorities as they mature, such as whether they want the same job role, expect the same income and if they have other concerns. Dr Koh said: ""The structured career planning process has also encouraged employees to adopt a growth mindset and to take ownership of their own career development. ""It is this joint initiative taken by both employers and employees that will be our secret ingredient for success as the economy transforms and businesses pivot into new growth sectors."" The guidebook was launched by the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) in partnership with the Ministry of Manpower. SNEF also collaborated with companies to pilot the guide. Several companies participated in the pilot, including St Luke's ElderCare, a healthcare provider with over 700 staff, of whom 35 per cent are over the age of 55. Chief executive Kenny Tan said: ""This guide will facilitate clear communication and add clarity on roles and responsibilities in the career progression and transition of mature workers."" The organisation already has career interest discussions with employees. Business consultancy aAdvantage Consulting Group also participated in the pilot programme. About one-third of its staff are mature employees. Director Jacqueline Gwee said: ""Structured career planning will mean that we discuss the staff's retirement plans at least five years ahead of the retirement age. This will certainly help in also getting them involved in hiring and grooming younger staff in a more structured manner. ""There is also opportunity to discuss possible changes in roles over a set timeframe and the need to pick up new skills as part of the evolving job scope."" Ms Gwee added that having early conversations with older staff members will also take away their anxiety in transitioning to retirement and for those who want to continue working. ""When the topic is not openly discussed, there is more uncertainty. This helps us in planning our manpower resources when we also have greater stability in the team supported by our mature staff,"" she said. The retirement age was raised to 63 and the re-employment age to 68 on July 1, with the goal of raising them to 65 and 70 by 2030. National Trades Union Congress deputy secretary-general Heng Chee How noted: ""We also often hear older workers worry whether they can continue working as their companies undergo big and quick changes in business models and technology. If we cannot address these well, both companies and older workers will lose out."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/askst-jobs-i-heard-a-retrenchment-exercise-is-coming-what-can-i-do,askST Jobs: I heard a retrenchment exercise is coming. What can I do?,"SINGAPORE - In this series, manpower correspondent Calvin Yang offers practical answers to candid questions on navigating workplace challenges and getting ahead in your career. A: Do not panic and jump to conclusions. You may want to tread carefully because the rumour could be unfounded. Speculation about something that may or may not happen could make it look like you are a ""problem employee"", says Mr David Blasco, senior director at recruitment firm Randstad Singapore. And if a retrenchment exercise does happen, you may actually run the risk of being let go. ""Instead of speculating, you should start evaluating your own work performance and skills. If you have recorded good work performance over the past few years, are equipped with in-demand skills, and demonstrate an ability to adapt to new changes, you may stand a better chance of staying with the organisation,"" he adds. Retrenchments - which spiked in Singapore in 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic struck, though the situation has since improved - are very structured exercises carried out by businesses. If you hear of a retrenchment exercise coming soon, try speaking to your supervisor or, if you find that difficult, a human resource colleague or union representative. Verify the news first before planning your next step. If you happen to be affected, it would help to understand your entitlements, says Ms Linda Teo, country manager at ManpowerGroup Singapore. Consider whether you are eligible to receive any retrenchment benefits, based on your employment contract or collective agreement. If you know there will be benefits and you do not yet have a confirmed job offer, it might be better to take such benefits than to resign. If you are not expecting the bad news and it hits you hard, do give yourself some time to calm down and process everything, says Ms Teo. If need be, you can also ask the person who delivered the news to explain the contents of the layoff letter personally again in a private setting. ""Confide in someone whom you trust to clear your mind and process your emotions,"" adds Ms Teo. Your family and friends, for instance. It is fine to seek help and you need not go through this journey alone. Being thrown this curveball during the pandemic can create emotional stress, points out Ms Teo, adding that workers can approach career coaches for advice to alleviate some stress if there are opportunities to do so. ""The career coach will prepare you for the next steps, such as helping you understand your strengths, recognising the hiring trends and identifying the available opportunities and finding the in-demand jobs."" Usually, affected employees would be offered career coaching services if the employer has engaged an outplacement firm to hold their retrenchment exercise. If not, check with your HR if the company is offering any career coaching services. Another way is to approach either Workforce Singapore or Employment and Employability Institute, which offer free career coaching services to retrenched Singaporeans and permanent residents, says Ms Teo. With bills to pay and perhaps a family to feed, you may be anxious to clinch a new job as quickly as possible. But note that it may do you good to take some time to review your career plans before starting the job search on a strong footing. Why not take the opportunity to update your skills and build a strong network? If you stay relevant, then your employability for the future will not be an issue, explains Singapore Human Resources Institute president Low Peck Kem. ""If you have not invested in your own training in the past, then it is never too late to start getting the relevant skills, and be prepared to take a smaller job to start from mid-level and consider a career switch if you are indeed retrenched."" As Ms Teo puts it: ""When you can't change the direction of the wind, adjust your sails."" Have a question? Send it to askst@sph.com.sg."

These amendments will provide SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) with more investigative powers, as well as strengthen enforcement actions that it can take against those who misrepresent or abuse the funding schemes, SSG said in a statement on Friday (July 8). For example, SSG, the national body for skills development funds, will be able to investigate persons, such as marketing agents, who are not directly receiving any funding. It will also have more powers in conducting searches for documents as evidence. With the changes, SSG will be able to take punitive action against errant businesses or persons. It will, for instance, be able to ask errant businesses to make refunds to people who are affected or return funding disbursed.  The amendments to the SSG Act and Skills Development Levy Act are being made in response to cases of abuse of the funding schemes. In 2021, SSG took action against 93 training providers and companies who abused SkillsFuture funding or breached its terms and conditions. Earlier in the week, it was announced that SSG would be refining its funding framework to better support training. From 2024, workers will no longer get subsidies from SSG for most non-certifiable courses. SkillsFuture credits will also no longer fund these courses. Since the launch of SkillsFuture and the Skills Development Fund in 2015 to promote continued education and training, there have been several cases of misrepresentation and abuse of the schemes. These include training providers or marketing agents falsely indicating that a course was accredited by SSG, or falsely indicating that a course was free when the fee would need to be borne by individuals' SkillsFuture credits. The changes to the Acts announced on Friday aim to strengthen the safeguards for public monies, said SSG. Other changes to the Acts include: SSG's public consultation exercise is being conducted from Friday to Aug 5. Members of the public can access the documents and give their views online via the Government's feedback unit Reach."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/expanding-roles-key-to-better-careers-pay-in-estate-facilities-management-sector,Expanding roles key to better careers in estate & facilities management sector,"SINGAPORE - Estate and facilities management workers can soon look forward to better career prospects and salaries by taking on expanded roles with the support of employers and trade associations. This forms one of the fresh recommendations by the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) and its partners to address the persistent labour constraints in the sector. To explore how to improve staff livelihoods sustainably, SBF said on Thursday (July 7) that it partnered seven companies to redesign jobs and teach workers new skills. The companies ran 10 pilot projects from March last year to this May, involving about 50 workers, in collaboration with the SBF and four trade associations, as part of an industry-led effort dubbed Lighthouse Project. For instance, security and housekeeping staff at Allgreen Properties, which owns the Great World Serviced Apartments in River Valley, learnt how to perform customer service and basic mechanical and electrical maintenance in two separate pilots by the firm. The other six companies that ran pilots are CapitaLand, CBM, Certis, Far East Organization, ISS Facilities and Pontiac Land. They manage properties from serviced apartments and industrial buildings to mixed-use developments. A skilled and motivated workforce means companies can benefit from improved productivity, while staff can enjoy better career progression and wages, said the federation. ""However, to achieve this, companies must invest in the training and development of their staff to ensure they are well-equipped to perform their expanded roles successfully. ""Mutual trust and close communication between employers and employees are also critical to the success."" Allgreen Properties shared the results of the pilot with Minister for National Development Desmond Lee during his visit to Great World Serviced Apartments on Thursday. A pilot for outcome-based contracts with clearly defined, fair and mutually agreed upon contract specifications between CapitaLand and ISS Facilities found that such contracts could serve mutually desirable outcomes. Such contracts reduce the risk of disputes, while ensuring more consistent levels of service are provided by a more streamlined and productive workforce. Both companies worked closely on a new outcome-based contract for both landscaping and cleaning services to ensure contract requirements were mutually beneficial; specific to the Galaxis building in one-north it covered; and aligned with ISS Facilities' capabilities and strengths. For instance, both companies now capture inspection data on a shared application on a tablet to mutually agree on at the end of each inspection. Mr Lam Yi Young, SBF chief executive, said: ""The pilot projects showed that with service buyers and service providers working together, the estate and facilities management sector can achieve sustainable productivity gains and uplift the skills and wages of workers."" According to Ministry of Manpower statistics, 72,600 people worked in the real estate services sector as at March this year."

These courses - which are those deemed to be non-certifiable - will also no longer receive subsidies, SSG said in a statement. They currently receive the lowest tier of subsidy from SSG, it added. With this tier removed, SSG funding will better focus on certifiable and industry-recognised courses of higher quality, it said. SSG said these changes will be implemented in phases to give affected providers the time to enhance their courses to meet the new standard. It added that it will work with them to give them guidance and support. Some non-certifiable courses that play important social or economic roles - such as courses on how to care for seniors - will still receive funds, said SSG. It added that it will work with public agencies to identify the courses and continue to fund these. SSG said: ""With this and upcoming moves, SSG aims to uplift the quality of the training and adult education sector, and better align adult learning with manpower development objectives."" An example of a course that would not meet the new standards would be a one-day advanced Microsoft Excel course, versus a similar but more robust advanced Excel certification course, SSG added. SSG also gave a list of examples of courses, run through partner agencies, which would continue to be available: Essential Digital Marketing Skills for Seniors, Mindfulness for Healthy Ageing, Dementia Care, Three-Day Basic Baking Workshop, Introduction to Home-Based Urban Gardening Workshop and Caregiver Tips for Better Caregiving."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/skillsfuture-funding-framework-to-focus-on-courses-relevant-to-industry,SkillsFuture funding framework to focus on courses relevant to industry,"SINGAPORE - SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) will refine its funding framework for training to achieve better manpower outcomes, said Education Minister Chan Chun Sing on Tuesday (July 5). From 2024, workers will no longer get subsidies from SSG for most non-certifiable courses. SkillsFuture credits will also no longer fund these courses, which currently comprise about 7 per cent of the courses the national body for skills development funds, SSG said on Tuesday. Mr Chan said the refinements to SSG’s funding framework are part of efforts to better support training with manpower outcomes. They are also meant to ensure that training is refreshed to meet the objectives of job placement, skills deepening and career advancement for individuals, as well as job redesign and business transformation for enterprises, he added.  Mr Chan, who spoke at the launch of the SkillsFuture Forum 2022 on Tuesday, also announced his road map for Singapore's adult education sector to reach his goal of retraining at least half a million working adults a year. He had announced this goal at The Straits Times Education Forum in February. Tuesday's event was held at the Lifelong Learning Institute in Paya Lebar and kicked off the SkillsFuture Festival, which runs from Tuesday until Aug 14. Mr Chan identified four key challenges that must be met for Singapore to upskill its workforce at scale. First, the country must overcome an asymmetry of information to spark the interest of working adults in reskilling and upskilling, he said. He noted that they have to juggle work, financial, family and social commitments and responsibilities. ""Many tend to apply a high discount rate towards training due to the tyranny of the 'urgent', and the 'here and now'. Bread-and-butter issues understandably occupy their minds."" He said efforts such as personalised skills advisory services have been set up. There are also plans to improve outreach to help people navigate the training ecosystem, but these are not enough on their own, the minister added. These must be complemented by three other strategies, he said, namely, articulating companies' demand for future skills, aggregating such demand in different sectors and activating a supply of such skills through quality training. On the need to articulate demand for future skills, Mr Chan said individual companies may not know what future skills they need. He added: ""This is where the Government, SSG, trade associations and chambers and our unions must come in and take the lead."" He gave the example of SSG's Skills Demand for the Future Economy report published in December. It drew on data from the global, regional and local jobs skills trends to show which skills are in demand from three sectors important for Singapore's growth: the green, care and digital economies. Mr Chan added that human resource teams must then translate the demand for specific skills into their hiring and job design processes. He said: ""This will allow companies to focus more on skills and competencies, rather than relying on only qualifications such as degrees or diplomas as a proxy of the candidate's suitability."" Beyond articulating the skills demand of its companies, Singapore needs each industry to aggregate or collate the demand for skills across its different sectors, Mr Chan added. This is where trade associations and chambers, being an important bridge between the Government and employers, must step up as intermediaries, he said. They will play a leading role to support and engage small and medium-sized enterprises in identifying the skills the SMEs need, help disseminate jobs and skills insights, and put in place structures to accredit skills acquired at the workplace. Mr Chan said: ""For a start, SSG is working with the Infocomm Media Development Authority to partner SGTech and the Singapore Computer Society as skills development partners in the information and communications technology sector."" With the support of such intermediate bodies, Singapore will improve its agility and market responsiveness to accelerate the SkillsFuture movement, Mr Chan added. Only when these conditions are met can the supply of future skills be optimised, he said. Mr Chan said: ""First, we must place more focus on how adult education is delivered. ""Our training providers and institutes of higher learning must step up to the role, to combine the currency of frontier industry knowledge with best adult education practices."" To this end, he announced that the Institute for Adult Learning will sign two separate agreements with the five polytechnics and NTUC LearningHub to enhance capability development in Singapore's training and adult education sector. He said: ""It is a worthwhile journey because if we do this well, workers and enterprises across all sectors of our economy will benefit from these investments."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/skillsfuture-forum-kicks-off-skills-upgrading-festival,SkillsFuture Forum kicks off skills upgrading festival,"SINGAPORE - Companies looking to upskill their workers will find tips and strategies on how to do so at the SkillsFuture Forum on Tuesday (July 5). The forum, titled ""Making upskilling work: By the workplace, for the workplace"", will be held at the Lifelong Learning Institute in Paya Lebar. It is organised by SkillsFuture Singapore and supported by The Business Times and SPH Media. Education Minister Chan Chun Sing will give an opening speech, which will be followed by the signing of two memorandums of understanding on raising the quality of training and adult education. This will be followed by a panel discussion with SkillsFuture Singapore's chief executive Tan Kok Yam, CapitaLand Investment's senior executive director Manohar Khiatani, Flexmech Engineering's managing director Tan Ru-Ding; and management consulting and executive search firm Egon Zehnder's managing partner Ang Wanmay. The discussion will be moderated by The Business Times' digital editor Christopher Lim. The forum is part of the SkillsFuture Festival, which will run from Tuesday until Aug 14. The festival, which includes the SkillsFuture Roadshow to be held at Suntec City from July 8 to 10, features events as well as the launch of resources to help Singaporeans upskill. Other events include the World Youth Skills Day (Asia-Pacific) main symposium from July 7 to 8 and those on a variety of skills, including kitchen skills, music, digital marketing and videography. The resources, done in collaboration with the National Library Board, compile information and courses relating to three sectors identified by SkillsFuture as important to the economy, going forward - the care, digital and green economies. Singapore's adult education system has come under the spotlight in recent years as its economy works to keep pace with rapid technological shifts hastened by the pandemic. At The Straits Times Education Forum in February, Mr Chan said Singapore must gear up to retrain about half a million adult learners each year."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/cpf-members-balances-interest-earned-hit-new-high-in-2021,"CPF members' balances, interest earned hit new high in 2021; amount withdrawn for housing rises","SINGAPORE – Central Provident Fund (CPF) members’ balances have hit a new high, exceeding half a trillion dollars as at the end of last year. Their balances grew by 9.4 per cent to $505.7 billion – from $462.1 billion in 2020 – according to the CPF Board’s annual report released on Monday (July 4).  A record $18.3 billion in interest was paid to members last year. In 2020, members received $16.8 billion in interest. Voluntary top-ups of Special and Retirement Accounts also climbed to a new high of $4.8 billion last year, up from $3 billion in 2020, said the report.  The top-ups were made by 294,000 CPF members, with about half topping up for the first time. However, the amount withdrawn for housing has gone up. Some 996,000 members used a total of $21.9 billion of their CPF savings for housing needs last year – a jump from the $17.3 billion in 2020. The improvements in the balances – and consequently the interest received – reflect Singapore’s economic performance last year, said observers. This has elevated wages earned and hence CPF contributions. The increase in interest paid is mainly driven by the larger balances held by CPF members, while the rise in amount drawn for housing is indicative of the healthy property market that has seen price growth, said Professor Lawrence Loh from the National University of Singapore Business School.  “Going forward, it is expected that the increase in CPF balances will be sustained due to the recovery of the economy, including the various pandemic-hit sectors,” he added.  In 2021, the number of CPF members increased by 2 per cent to 4.1 million. About 416,000 members received monthly CPF retirement payouts totalling $2.2 billion last year.  Of these, more than 85,000 members are on the CPF Life scheme, which provides a lifelong monthly payout that begins when the member turns 65 years old.  CPF Board chairman Yong Ying-I said in the report that it had strengthened efforts to help members in their retirement, with schemes to boost the retirement income of those with lower balances and lesser means. For instance, the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme was launched last year to help seniors who have not reached their Basic Retirement Sum to build their retirement savings through a dollar-for-dollar matching grant.  Under this scheme, the Government matches cash top-ups made to the Retirement Account of eligible Singaporeans aged 55 to 70, up to an annual cap of $600. Over 117,000 members benefited from $68 million in matching grants from the Government for cash top-ups made last year. According to the annual report, the CPF Board also assisted 8,496 members who were in financial distress amid the Covid-19 pandemic by connecting them with agencies that can provide help beyond what it can offer, under the Rejected Appeals Management Protocol initiative. The number of transactions performed on the CPF website and mobile app nearly doubled to 171 million last year, from 90 million in 2020.  Human resources firm PeopleWorldwide Consulting managing director David Leong said the CPF was a critical reserve for Singaporeans and a form of shared prosperity, with the Government conscientiously contributing to “equalise the balances for working-class Singaporeans”.  “As the Government advocates active ageing and has raised the re-employment age, the purpose and intent are to encourage active workforce participation so that their Basic Retirement Sum can be supported,” he added."

One thing is for certain: Singapore will not enact legislation like some Western countries, but will instead fall back on a set of flexible work arrangement guidelines, planned for release by the tripartite grouping of policymakers, employers and unions in 2024."

What can I do?,"In this series, manpower correspondent Calvin Yang offers practical answers to candid questions on navigating workplace challenges and getting ahead in your career. A: Take time to reflect and figure out what might have got you into this predicament. Always begin with yourself - don't point fingers, advises NeXT Career Consulting Group managing director Paul Heng. Maybe you are underperforming, or there are certain areas that you could pay more attention to at work. If it could be your fault, you could accept it as constructive criticism and ask for feedback on ways to improve. If you are unsure, try asking your co-workers for a second opinion. However, Mr Heng says: ""If it is nothing of your doing, you can try speaking to your boss, sometimes it is his or her blind side, and share how you feel when you're picked upon."" Choose to arrange for a conversation to address the issue professionally, instead of confrontation, says PeopleWorldwide Consulting managing director David Leong. When asking your boss for a meeting, frame it as work-related - and not something personal - so they would be more open and willing to talk, suggests Ms Linda Teo, country manager at ManpowerGroup Singapore. During the conversation, take note of the points shared and use those as a guide to improve your work performance. ""If you sense that your boss is picking on you due to a clash in personality or working styles, then you need to tread carefully to avoid those pitfalls. If you know that your boss has a certain working style, then it is in your best interest to accommodate it to maintain harmony at work,"" Ms Teo stresses. ""Having said so, this does not mean that you should tolerate your boss' unreasonable behaviour."" Unreasonable behaviours could include your boss throwing your work at you or shouting at you in front of your colleagues. If the matter cannot be resolved after a few sessions, it should be escalated to human resources or another superior. You can also report unfair workplace practices to the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices, which offers assistance for employees facing discrimination or harassment at work. You can report unfair workplace practices or harassment using this link. Nitpicking crosses the line when it escalates to harassment, which is a criminal offence. If you have been threatened, insulted or abused, whether by behaviour, words or other forms of communication, you are likely a victim of workplace harassment. While it is important to respect your boss, you also need to know your rights, notes Ms Teo. ""Being accommodating does not mean that you need to go to extreme lengths to satisfy your boss' whims and fancies."" Have a question? Send it to askst@sph.com.sg"

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/experimentation-and-innovation-all-in-a-days-work-at-this-public-service-agency,Experimentation and innovation all in a day's work at this public service agency,"Handling 900,000 phone enquiries from members of the public a year, the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board is a key contact point between Singaporeans and the Government.  When another government body was inundated by Covid-19 related calls in October last year, the CPF Board responded quickly to lend its expertise in call centre management, providing the use of its telephony system, the phone lines and supporting technology. Leading the team was Ms Maple Chang, Director (Customer Contact Centre).   ""At that point, we had our own operations to grapple with and we didn't have spare manpower to go around. But it was immediately clear that there was a national-level effort where we could really lend our strengths,"" she says.  Within a week, Ms Chang and her team rose to the challenge and worked with other government agencies to increase the capacity of the Ministry of Health General Enquiries hotline. Binding her and her teammates was a strong sense of purpose to serve Singapore and fellow Singaporeans during unprecedented times.  Today, eight months later and as Covid-induced pressures ease, the 2,500 CPF Board employees are returning to offices that have been renovated and refitted to meet the demands of the future of work. While most employees worked from home under a hybrid arrangement in the past two years, the Board used the time to invest in new infrastructure, systems and processes to facilitate telecommuting in the long run.  The Board’s new hybrid work arrangement is going down well with the staff. ""Personally, I love this arrangement because it provides a mix of days on which I work from home and days where I come into office for collaborative meetings,"" says Mr Mark Teo, Assistant Director (Business Incubator and Accelerator Department), about the Board's hybrid work policy. He works across departments to train colleagues and provide guidance for innovation as the Board's ""innovation coach"", a new role created around July last year.  When he joined the organisation six years ago as a manager in the Business Transformation Programme Office, his remit was to make processes more efficient and effective. As the needs of CPF members evolved, so did his work. ""Instead of just transforming our operational processes, we saw a greater need to bring in digital tools,"" says Mr Teo.  The pandemic and rapid digitalisation has resulted in CPF members expecting greater ease and personalisation when transacting with the Board. Mr Teo’s department expanded quickly as the Board turned its focus to the innovation of digital services and the building of in-house digital tools to provide the best digital experience for members. It was a steep learning curve, but Mr Teo relished the challenges and felt a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment.  ""I had to take a few courses, including product management and web design. I didn’t come from an IT background so I had to learn things like JavaScript,"" he says, adding that he studied materials engineering at university. He received invaluable support from his employer as he moved into his new role. ""The Board not only funded me for all these courses but gave me the time and space to explore them on my own,"" says Mr Teo, who was given the Exemplary Trainer Award in 2021 for his efforts. The first of the two key projects Mr Teo helped implement during the pandemic was the roll-out of the use of digital signatures for forms. The second was a more fundamental digital shift, involving the phasing out of hard-copy letters, hard-copy forms and supporting documents. These initiatives helped to provide more convenient options and an improved experience for the Board’s 4.1 million members.  ""With the heightened focus on digitalisation, we took the chance to push the bar; rather than just seeing whether people can submit forms digitally, we worked to see how we could make all our correspondences be defaulted to digital instead of sending out letters,"" he says.  In recent years, the Board has also ramped up efforts to engage its members and help them make the most of their CPF savings, using new digital content formats and popular social media platforms. To create higher quality videos and digital assets in a more agile manner, Ms Diviya Dharshini was called to head the newly-formed Digital Content Production team in 2019.  “We recognised the greater reach we could achieve with well-designed and well-timed content using the right medium,” says Ms Diviya, who joined the Board’s Media and Publicity Department eight years ago, and is currently Deputy Director (Service Excellence Management). One memorable project for her was the video featuring CPF Volunteers, which was one of the first in-house videos produced by the young team.  “The video was for the launch of the Community Paying it Forward movement in 2021, where we gathered Singaporeans from all walks of life to pay it forward by encouraging people around them to make the best use of their CPF savings,” she says. “There were only three of us in the team then, and we handled everything from pre-production, including conducting pre-interviews with the volunteers, planning the shoot, doing the actual shoot, multi-tasking as interviewer and art director, to post-production and editing,” adds Ms Diviya. The team ultimately came up with two versions of the video. One was in English and the other featured various vernacular languages so that a wider pool of audience could relate to it.  “The videos were well-received and the success gave us the confidence to pursue larger-scale productions and expand the team,” she says. As the work environment is ""collegial"" and ""nurturing"", she has never felt apprehensive experimenting and taking on new projects. At the Board, new joiners and long-serving employees attest to a supportive culture where they are encouraged to take on new roles to expand their skill sets.  ""We encourage employees to work with their supervisors to achieve their goals, or simply to find their own equilibrium – regardless of the role they play within the Board,"" says Ms Caroline Loh, Director (Human Resources) at the Board.  ""We respect that everyone has his or her own unique set of aspirations, values and personal circumstances, some of which evolve with time,"" she adds. Ms Loh says the organisation conducts regular salary benchmarking exercises to ensure its employees are paid fairly and competitively, in line with the market. But competitive pay packages are not all that keep employees like Ms Chang at the Board. She was deeply appreciative of the empathy and flexibility shown by the Board which granted her a two-year no-pay-leave arrangement when she moved to Thailand as a trailing spouse. She returned in 2016, thankful that the Board had kept her name on the payroll during her absence. ""The first two or three months back was a little bit hard. But I received support from my bosses and other fellow working moms within the Board,"" she says. More importantly, like Mr Teo, Ms Chang and Ms Diviya, employees at public service agencies are driven by a shared mission to serve – the Board’s raison d'être since its founding in 1955. ""I'm in a very privileged position and in a position of high trust,"" says Mr Teo, referring to his part in safeguarding the members' CPF funds for retirement, healthcare and housing. Ms Diviya sums it up succinctly: ""The one thing I would say I'm very proud of is that the work I do helps people. I don't think I could ask for more from my job.""

A: There are ways to make your presence felt online when you are not physically in office. Get familiar with text and video chat platforms, which allow you to connect with your colleagues and build rapport even without meeting face to face, says Ms Michele Nyrop, a senior vice-president of employee success at software giant Salesforce. ""It is important to keep your skills and knowledge fresh with continuous skills upgrading and development so you can keep up with workplace demands and expectations."" As is the case for physical meetings, it is important to be on time, prepared and engaged, says Ms Kirsty Hulston, regional director of recruitment agency Hays Singapore. But above all, it is important to stay visible online. For instance, ask questions and show you are listening by nodding at appropriate intervals. For work tasks, employees can keep their supervisors updated on what they have been doing weekly, suggests Mr Adrian Tan from the Singapore Human Resources Institute. ""Be proactive and request to take on any new task even if it is outside your scope."" Dr David Leong, managing director of PeopleWorldwide Consulting, says: ""A sense of usefulness is about adding value to the organisation, and if the person feels that he or she is feeling useless working from home, the person probably is."" He adds that contributions and performance at work, including targets, can be measured by outcomes and milestones. Labour observers say that a worker should re-evaluate his role and targets with superiors, and draw up a score sheet with these goals in black and white so that they are more trackable. Bosses, too, may have similar work from home struggles, such as being out of the loop on what their subordinates are doing.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/the-flip-side-of-the-great-resignation-having-to-work-longer-before-retiring,Flip side of the Great Resignation is having to work longer before retiring: Poll,"SINGAPORE - A wave of resignations during the Covid-19 pandemic as disgruntled employees quit unsatisfactory working conditions is expected to delay retirement for some who left their jobs in what has been dubbed ""The Great Resignation"", according to a poll by insurer Prudential Singapore. Prudential polled 1,000 Singapore residents who had resigned or intended to resign. The survey was conducted in April with respondents aged between 25 and 50. It found that one in five respondents caught in The Great Resignation wave expect to work for another six years on average, resulting in them delaying retirement at 58 years to 64 instead. This is because many people who undertake mid or late-career job switches end up taking pay cuts to start off in new roles. But Mr Will Tan, managing director of Principle Partners, a specialist financial service executive search firm, said job switches should not be considered only in dollars and cents and that such moves may well add a very fulfilling six more years of working life for some. Mr Tan said some people resign after they re-evaluate what is more important to them. One example is Mediacorp actress Felicia Chin, who is leaving the broadcaster to join a non-profit organisation, where she is likely to earn less but hopes to inspire others who are down and out. Mr Tan added that he has also seen some who quit to take on a lower paying job that gives them more flexibility and work-life balance. The Prudential survey found that one in two (52 per cent) who have resigned did so because they no longer felt engaged at work. Just over a third of the respondents also decided to make a switch to take care of their mental health or to leave a toxic work environment. Principle Partners' Mr Tan said more executives are making a mid-career switch into a new industry. ""(There are) transferable skills, no doubt, but there's also a part of your experience that's not transferable. So, you probably need to accept a lower pay,"" he said. Ms Jaya Dass, managing director of recruitment firm Randstad Malaysia and Singapore, is observing a similar trend of job seekers open to trying new work and pushing themselves beyond their comfort zone. Ms Dass said many won't be lucky the first time round and that they will have to try and fail a few times before they find a job fit. Ms Grace Tang, who is 33 and works in the entertainment tech industry, is among those who intend to quit to try something new. Ms Tang is worried about becoming stagnant in her current job and is willing to take a pay cut of 10 to 12 per cent to move into a new industry. But Principle Partners' Mr Tan said there are some professionals who are also starting to regret their decisions to switch jobs, as their quality of life drops after doing so. ""Some are actually starting to feel the pain because inflation is going up,"" he said. Many who leave their jobs also do so without proper financial planning for retirement - the Prudential survey found almost half (44 per cent) of the respondents were unprepared. Mr Dennis Tan, chief executive of Prudential Singapore, said it has become even more important for those wanting to change work to consider their retirement plans before doing so, especially as Singaporeans are living longer and will need to accumulate an even bigger nest egg so they will not outlive their savings. The problem is exacerbated by rising costs of living and healthcare expenses. The Prudential survey found that more than seven in 10 respondents (73 per cent) rely on the savings in their Central Provident Fund (CPF) account as their main income source for retirement. Prudential's Mr Tan said it is important that Singaporeans diversify their retirement funds by putting their money into different financial instruments. This helps to spread risk and smooth out volatilities during challenging market conditions. Ms Tang is looking into building enough retirement funds so she can sustain the lifestyle she wants when she retires. She has savings and investment plans and is exploring the option of investing in Singapore savings bonds to diversify her retirement nest-egg. ""Regardless of how you plan, it is important to start planning early so you have a longer runway to grow your retirement funds,"" Prudential's Mr Tan said."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/knight-frank-retracts-and-reissues-security-tender-documents-over-age-discrimination,Knight Frank retracts and reissues security tender documents over age discrimination,"SINGAPORE - Knight Frank Property Management said on Wednesday (June 22) that it has retracted and reissued tender documents for ageist hiring requirements at two condominiums, Sky @ Eleven and Spring Grove Condominium. This comes after the firm was flagged on Monday (June 20) for ageist clauses in two separate security tenders for Spring Grove condominium in Grange Road and Sky @ Eleven in Thomson Road. In both tenders, Knight Frank had stipulated a maximum age of security officers permitted to work. In the Spring Grove Condominium tender contract, workers could also be dismissed without justification. The firm said both breaches came from a staff member using an outdated template from a previous project saved on the desktop to prepare the new tender. Knight Frank said all tender templates in its central depository have been updated and more frequent site audits would be implemented to avoid a recurrence of this mistake. The property firm added that it will continue to work closely with the relevant associations and regulatory authorities to ensure operations are in adherence to the industry's best practices. It added: ""We apologise for any misunderstanding and the unnecessary stress caused to persons in the security services industry."" In a Facebook post on Monday, the Security Association Singapore said Knight Frank's tender documents for security services at both condominiums stipulated maximum ages for security officers to be hired. In the Sky @ Eleven tender, it stipulated that only security officers between the ages of 21 and 60 should be hired. For Spring Grove condominium, the tender said only those between the ages of 21 and 55 were to be hired. Additionally, a clause that permitted the immediate removal of an employee at the management's discretion was included. According to the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (Tafep) guidelines, employers are expected to select employees on the basis of merit. The guidelines also state that employers are advised to avoid using age as a selection criterion for hiring ""unless you are bound by legal or regulatory requirements. In such cases, you may state this upfront"". Failure to abide by Tafep standards could lead to companies' work pass privileges being revoked. According to The Business Times, Savills Property Management had its work pass privileges revoked by the Ministry of Manpower for discrimination against non-Mandarin speakers and older workers in its tender for security services last September. Noting the recent transgressions, the Union of Security Employees (USE) president Ardi Amir said: ""Buyers typically discriminate against officers by gender or age, and often insist on one-sided clauses to remove any officer they wish to immediately. ""USE strongly condemns such discriminatory practices which remain commonplace in outsourced security contracts despite repeated outreach and education by tripartite partners."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/workers-worried-4-day-week-will-mean-longer-hours-for-them-survey,S'pore workers worried 4-day week will mean longer hours for them: Survey,"SINGAPORE - Full-time employees in Singapore are worried that a four-day work week will mean longer hours for them, an online survey of over 1,000 workers showed. But they will support their employer implementing such an arrangement as an additional rest day would benefit their mental health, according to results of a poll by American software company Qualtrics released on Tuesday (June 21). Firms had rolled out flexible work arrangements, including a shorter work week, amid the pandemic. Ministry of Manpower employer surveys show the majority are keen to continue with these, according to Ms Gan Siow Huang, Minister of State for Manpower and Education, in Parliament last month. The survey by Qualtrics, conducted in May, involved workers in industries ranging from information technology (IT) to retail. It showed that almost eight in 10 workers expect to clock longer hours with a four-day work week. Six in 10 were also worried that with a shorter work week, customers would be left frustrated. More than half thought company performance would also suffer as a result, but nine in 10 believe it would benefit their mental health. Ms Lauren Huntington, employee experience solution strategist for South-east Asia at Qualtrics, said flexible work arrangements can be retained without hurting performance. For example, employers can create rosters so customers will still be able to resolve their issues when they need to despite the four-day work week, she added. Ms Huntington, an organisational psychologist by training, said employers will have to look at their talent to decide which flexible work arrangements are suitable. She noted that 33 per cent of workers surveyed defined flexibility as having control of their own hours, 26 per cent said it was working from any location, and 19 per cent said it was being able to choose the days in which they work. In fact, most – 64 per cent – Singapore workers said they would rather be allowed to work whenever they want over a five-day week, than have fixed hours over four work days, she added, reflecting caution over the potential trade-offs a four-day work week brings. Employers will also need to pick the right digital tools when implementing flexible work arrangements, said Mr Lindsay Brown, general manager for the Asia-Pacific and Japan for GoTo, a firm specialising in remote work technology. They will also need to consolidate the myriad of applications currently used. He noted that rapid digitalisation had increased workloads for IT departments. In a survey GoTo commissioned in February, three in 10 respondents reported facing challenges from software that was not always up to the job. Despite most workers in Singapore returning to the office, United States software company HubSpot still allows its employees to choose their preferred work arrangement. They can work remotely on most days, adopt a hybrid model, or turn up at the office in Anson Road. Ms Kat Warboys, Asia-Pacific marketing director for HubSpot, said over half of its staff in Singapore are on the flexible work arrangements, four in 10 are working from home, and just 7 per cent are working in the office. Doing away with the commute to work has benefited the staff. ""Saving up to an hour's time from the commute each day has given people a lot of time to refocus their personal life, relationships or upskilling,"" said Ms Warboys."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/how-will-spores-15b-support-package-help-residents-businesses-cope-with-global-inflation,How $1.5b support package will help S'poreans cope with inflation,"SINGAPORE - A $1.5 billion support package was announced on Tuesday (June 21) to help households and businesses in Singapore tackle the impending economic challenges resulting in higher global inflation.

The grant will support such firms to improve their energy efficiency and alleviate increasing business costs due to increased energy prices. 2. Increased loan quantum for the Enterprise Financing Scheme – Trade Loan  The maximum loan quantum will be raised to $10 million per borrower from July 1 this year to March 31, 2023, from $5 million previously. 3. Increased loan quantum for the Enterprise Financing Scheme – SME Working Capital Loan The maximum loan quantum will be increased to $500,000 per borrower from Oct 1, 2022, to March 31, 2023, after the Temporary Bridging Loan Programme expires in September. 4. One-month foreign worker levy waiver for chicken slaughterhouses One month of foreign worker levy waiver for Singapore's 11 chicken slaughterhouses will be provided. This will help preserve industry capabilities amid the export ban."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/knight-frank-apologises-retracts-tender-documents-after-discriminatory-hiring-practices-flagged-by-security-association,Knight Frank retracts tender documents after discriminatory hiring practices flagged,"SINGAPORE - Knight Frank Property Management has retracted tender documents for Spring Grove condominium's security services after the Security Association Singapore (SAS) flagged them for clauses which discriminated against workers based on age. A Knight Frank spokesman told The Straits Times on Monday (June 20) that the clauses which ""could have been perceived as unfair and discriminatory"" were from ""outdated"" documents. The spokesman said: ""We apologise for the oversight in sending tenders that contained dated clauses. Our tender documents were reviewed and updated last year according to employment best practices as laid out by the SAS."" She added that following the incident, Knight Frank has immediately recalled all relevant tender documents and will re-issue fresh copies with updated clauses to the tenderers. ""Knight Frank remains committed to be a responsible business to clients and the communities in which we operate. We apologise for any misunderstanding and inconvenience caused,"" the spokesman said, adding that the company has reached out to SAS to clarify the matter. SAS' chief of staff Mr Nicholas Lim had, in a Facebook post and a media statement earlier on Monday, highlighted clauses in Knight Frank's tender stipulating that security officers between the ages of 21 and 55 were to be hired, as well as immediate removal clauses entitling the Management Corporation Strata Title (MCST) or managing agent to remove security officers at the management's discretion. This, he said, meant that security officers could be dismissed if they were deemed ""undesirable"" without the management having to provide any form of justification or recourse. The tender for Spring Grove, which is due to end on Friday at 12pm, stated that the contract for services would start on Sept 1 this year. Mr Lim raised a similar case involving Savills Property Management in September last year in its tender for security services at Hillview Heights condominium. Then, SAS had flagged Savills for discrimination against non-Mandarin speakers and older workers in its tender for security services. Apologising for the issue, Savills said the issue stemmed from ""historical tender documentation language from 2000"" and ""had taken steps to ensure all tender documentation reflects current Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices"". The Ministry of Manpower suspended Savills' work pass privileges for this issue, according to The Business Times. Mr Lim added that there was a ""glaring gap"" in the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (Tafep), which penalises discrimination by employers - in this case security agencies - while managing agents ""appear to get off with merely a warning"". According to Tafep guidelines on the Tripartite Alliance (TAL) website: ""Employers must recruit and select employees on the basis of merit (such as skills, experience or ability to perform the job), and regardless of age, race, gender, religion, marital status and family responsibilities, or disability.""  TAL was set up by MOM, the National Trades Union Congress and the Singapore National Employers Federation. Employers are advised to avoid using age as a selection criterion for hiring ""unless you are bound by legal or regulatory requirements. In such cases, you may state this upfront"". If the work is physically demanding, ""state this requirement in the job description and avoid indicating a specific age group"", the TAL site said. While not legally binding, the guidelines set out that employers will face scrutiny from MOM and could have their work pass privileges curtailed if employment guidelines are not followed. Following the retraction of the statement by Knight Frank, Mr Lim acknowledged that the company has contacted SAS, and added: ""We are always happy to build partnerships with industry stakeholders to ensure proper and fair working conditions for our security officers."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/singapore-civil-servants-to-get-035-month-mid-year-bonus,Civil servants to get 0.35-month mid-year bonus,"SINGAPORE - All civil servants will receive a 0.35-month mid-year bonus, with junior staff getting another $200 to $400 on top of the bonus. In a statement on Monday (June 20), the Public Service Division (PSD) said the bonus takes into consideration that Singapore's gross domestic product growth in 2022 is likely to come in at the lower half of the forecast range of 3 per cent to 5 per cent. Nonetheless, it will be higher than the 0.3-month bonus given to civil servants last year. The one-time payment for junior staff, however, is lower than the $350 to $700 given in 2021. The PSD said the bonus amount was decided in close consultation with public sector unions. ""The Government deeply appreciates the hard work and contribution of all public officers."" Civil servants in grades equivalent to MX13(I) and MX14 will receive an additional one-time payment of $200. Those in grades equivalent to MX15 and MX16, and those in the Operations Support Scheme Grades III to V, will get a higher one-time payment of $400. The PSD noted that despite the economic recovery and declining unemployment off the back of a stabilising Covid-19 situation, ""significant downside risks remain ahead for Singapore"". ""The external demand outlook in 2022 has deteriorated, due in part to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has exacerbated global supply disruptions and adversely affected the growth of many economies."" It added: ""In deciding the year-end AVC (annual variable component) payments, the Government will continue to monitor the economic situation closely, and take into consideration the National Wages Council's guidelines, which will be released later in the year."" Expressing the labour movement’s support for the bonus, Ms Cham Hui Fong, deputy secretary-general of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), said the payout was ""a timely recognition of our civil servants’ dedication in serving the people during the pandemic period"". She added: “NTUC also urges employers and employees, from both the public and private sectors, to constantly transform themselves so that they remain competitive and seize opportunities. “This should lead to better business and work prospects so that in the longer term, it leads to higher productivity and better wages.” Mr Sanjeev Kumar Tiwari, general secretary of the Amalgamated Union of Public Employees, said: “Given the current economic uncertainties, geopolitical tensions and inflationary pressures, we appreciate the moderate increase in the mid-year AVC compared with last year’s mid-year AVC, with more for the junior and lower-income officers. “We hope that things will turn around so that there will be better outcomes at the end of the year.” Ms Jaya Dass, managing director of Singapore and Malaysia at recruitment firm Randstad, said that while it is highly unlikely private firms will follow suit and issue a mid-year bonus if they have not planned to already, the increase would prompt some companies to make a more robust adjustment for their year-end bonus payouts and salary revisions. “It also comes at a good time as people are managing the increasing cost of living in recent months.”"
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/askst-jobs-i-am-a-fresh-graduate-starting-an-office-job-how-do-i-survive-my-first-day-of-work,"How do you survive your first day of work as a fresh grad, especially if you make a mistake?","In this series, manpower correspondent Calvin Yang offers practical answers to candid questions on navigating workplace challenges and getting ahead in your career. A: The first day at a new job can be scary. Don't worry if you lose sleep the night before and get butterflies in your stomach when you step out of your home. It's probably normal! That said, you may not want to show up at the office totally unprepared. Try to find out as much as possible about the work culture, dress code and the colleagues you are likely to work with. It's a no-brainer that you should be punctual. Better still if you can arrive 15 to 30 minutes earlier. This gives you more time to ease into your new work environment and set up your workstation. Relax, smile and be friendly, even if you are not a morning person and don't feel like socialising. Introduce yourself to your co-workers, including the office cleaner. A simple introduction will include your name, job title and work experience. Mr Adrian Tan from the Singapore Human Resources Institute advises freshies to talk less and listen more. As National University of Singapore sociologist Tan Ern Ser suggests: ""If I am assigned a buddy, I'd let him or her introduce me to the team, and observe and use whatever information I have to navigate the social landscape. ""I'd be pleasant and friendly, yet come across as authentic, and show that I am a team player and willing to learn and pull my weight."" When you have settled in and are done with the introductions, get some basic work done. This includes knowing what you are supposed to do and reading up on past correspondences, says NeXT Career Consulting Group managing director Paul Heng, but ""nothing serious as you are still new"". Also, if you are asked to join your supervisor or colleagues for lunch, don't turn them down. You probably won't have much to do on your first day anyway. Use that opportunity to grasp your team's dynamics and get to know your fellow co-workers. Be prepared to ask questions, when necessary, to show your desire to learn. After lunch - when you have gotten to know your colleagues better and once you are clear on your duties - let them know that you are available to help. Studies have found that a worker who shows initiative and is a team player is highly valued by employers. Ms Kirsty Hulston, regional director of recruitment agency Hays Singapore, says new workers should be proactive, find out what is expected of them, and be humble and learn as much as they can, ""even during your training, even though it may seem like things you have already learnt previously"". When it is time to knock off work, check in again with your boss if there is anything you can assist with. Most likely, he or she will not have much work for you and may give you the go-ahead to leave. That said, do not appear too eager to leave the office. Take your time to tidy the work desk, save your work and pack your work bag. On your way out, acknowledge your colleagues and wish them a good evening. The above scenario is probably the kind of drama-free first day that most people will want. But life throws up surprises sometimes. Let's talk about two possible hiccups that you may encounter. With remote work becoming common, your boss could be working from home on your first day. How can you find your way around? Your boss might have assigned someone to help you ease into the job. If not, be proactive and check with him or her whether there are tasks that you can help with. It would also be useful to ask if there is a colleague in the office who can guide you through the day. What if you make a boo-boo on your first day, like spilling coffee on your colleague's desk or addressing your boss by the wrong name? First, stay calm. If you spilt coffee on your co-worker's desk, apologise for the snafu. Then offer to clean up the mess or approach the office cleaner for help. It would be a nice gesture to get your colleague another cup of coffee to make up for it. If you address your boss by the wrong name, simply be honest and admit your mistake. Apologise for it and move on. If he has a difficult name to pronounce, ask him how it should be pronounced or if there is another name that he goes by. Even if you feel things didn't go that smoothly, give yourself a pat on the back for surviving your first day of work. Things will only get busier from here. Have a question? Send it to askst@sph.com.sg."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/more-retrenched-residents-able-to-land-new-jobs-within-six-months-mom-q1-report,More retrenched S'pore residents found jobs within 6 months in Q1: MOM,"SINGAPORE - More retrenched residents here were able to land a job quickly in the first quarter of this year, a Ministry of Manpower (MOM) report has found. The proportion of retrenched Singaporeans and permanent residents who found a new job within six months hit 71.5 per cent in the first quarter, a high last seen in 2015. This is up from 66.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year. Trends were mixed by age, education and occupation, MOM said in its first quarter labour market report released on Friday (June 17). The improvement was largely observed among middle-aged workers in their 40s and 50s, those working in production and related roles, and those with qualifications lower than secondary school. For instance, eight in 10 retrenched production and transport operators, cleaners and labourers found work within six months in the first quarter, up from under seven in 10 in the previous quarter. A more modest increase - from 64.4 per cent to 69 per cent - was seen among those in professional, managerial, executive and technical (PMET) roles, while the proportion of clerical, sales and service workers who found work in six months fell more than 4 percentage points over the previous quarter. Almost eight in 10 workers aged 40 to 49 were re-employed within six months, up from under seven in 10 the previous quarter - a similar increase to that posted by workers with qualifications lower than secondary school. Meanwhile, the long-term unemployment rate among residents - which accounts for those unemployed for 25 weeks or more - declined overall in March, for the second consecutive quarter since last September. The trend was reflected in nearly all age groups and education levels, except for workers aged 50 to 59. MOM noted that recruitment and resignation rates among PMET workers have been creeping up, though still below record highs. ""By industry, information and communications, financial services, health and social services, transportation and storage, and accommodation experienced higher turnover,"" said the ministry. Its report also highlighted that retrenchments in the first quarter declined to a record low of 1,320 - or six for every 10,000 employees. These improvements across the board, however, do not take into account the high-profile layoffs at various technology and cryptocurrency firms, including Coinbase, Shopee, Crypto.com and Tesla, earlier this month. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase slashed 18 per cent of its workforce, or 1,100 people, globally on Tuesday, including 5 per cent of its staff in Singapore. The move follows a similar exercise by Crypto.com, which said last week that it would lay off 260 workers, as well as job cuts at e-commerce giant Shopee across Europe, South America and South-east Asia. Commenting on the report, National Trades Union Congress assistant secretary-general Patrick Tay said challenges remain in the form of cost pressures on employers, rising cost of living and job-skill mismatch, among others. “The outlook for the rest of the year remains uncertain in light of the ongoing situation across the globe and severe inflationary pressures. As such, it remains important for all to... (stay) ready, relevant and resilient to prepare ourselves better for any curveballs come what may.”"
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/job-vacancies-hit-new-high-for-q1-as-businesses-backfill-positions-hire-to-meet-demand-mom,"Job vacancies hit new high for Q1 as firms backfill roles, hire to meet demand","SINGAPORE - Singapore's labour market continues to tighten, with job vacancies hitting a new high in the first quarter of this year despite a slower rate of increase. This comes as some businesses post vacancies to backfill positions and hire to meet rising demand. The number of vacancies rose to 128,100 in March, up from 117,100 in December, according to a labour market report released by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Friday (June 17). The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed people also grew to 2.42 – or more than two positions available for every unemployed person. MOM attributed this – the highest since 1998 – to ""a decline in unemployed persons and increase in vacancies"". However, the 9 per cent rate of increase is slower than the 17 per cent seen in the previous quarter, said the ministry. The bulk of the vacancies were in construction and manufacturing, mainly for non-professional, managerial, executive and technical (non-PMET) roles typically held by migrant workers, as well as PMET roles in the financial services, information and communications, public administration and education, and professional services sectors. Overall, total employment, excluding migrant domestic workers, grew by 42,000 in the first quarter this year, slightly lower than the increase of 47,900 in the previous quarter. The hiring of non-resident workers formed the bulk of the total employment growth. This was driven by the progressive lifting of border restrictions and employers filling a backlog of vacancies for jobs that are more reliant on migrant workers, said MOM.  Yet, non-resident employment in March remained 15 per cent below pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, resident employment – comprising Singaporeans and permanent residents – exceeded pre-pandemic levels in December 2019 by 3.9 per cent, highlighted MOM. However, trends were mixed across sectors. ""Resident employment continued to rise in growth sectors such as financial services, information and communications, professional services, and health and social services,"" said MOM. ""On the other hand, it declined in consumer-facing sectors, mainly due to the seasonal pattern of temporary workers hired for year-end festivities leaving in the following quarter."" Elsewhere, the resident and overall unemployment rates held steady in April at 3 per cent and 2.2 per cent respectively. The citizen unemployment rate dipped slightly in April, down to 3.1 per cent from 3.2 per cent. Retrenchments also declined to a record low of 1,320 – or six for every 10,000 employees. Among retrenched residents, the percentage who re-entered employment within six months post-retrenchment rose to 71.5 per cent, a high last seen in 2015. MOM cautioned that the deterioration of the external economic environment, due in part to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, has weakened the demand outlook for some outward-oriented sectors. In a Facebook post, Manpower Minister Tan See Leng said: “With the relaxation of border restrictions, we expect the inflow of non-resident workers to continue increasing, which will help to ease the tightness in the labour market in coming months. “At the same time, the Government will continue to support companies to upskill their local workforce, to help them adapt to new growth areas and meet the labour demand.” Mr Eugene Chong, senior rewards consultant from global consultancy Mercer, said the high number of vacancies could be down to a skills mismatch, and workers looking to take a break in between jobs. The report also found higher turnover than before the pandemic among PMETs in the information and communications, financial services, and health and social services sectors, among others. Reasons include burnout, particularly among those at the front line of the pandemic, such as healthcare workers. He added: “Team-based work is also a core part of some of these sectors. “The lag between an employee leaving and hiring often results in the workload being spread among existing employees, which may then result in burnout and higher turnover.”"

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/mpa-ropes-in-young-people-as-maritime-youth-ambassadors-to-share-knowledge-about-industry,MPA ropes in young people as Maritime Youth Ambassadors to share knowledge about industry,"SINGAPORE - For Ms Lovine Tan, it was a no-brainer when it came down to what she aspired to work as. Growing up, she would listen to her father's stories about working as an engineer at the port. With opportunities that include travelling to different parts of the world, such as China, South Korea and Saudi Arabia, the now 23-year-old finds the industry to be ""extremely diverse and interesting"". Ms Tan, who moved back to Singapore at the age of 16 after being in Saudi Arabia for 6½ years to enrol in then Anderson Junior College, now called Anderson Serangoon Junior College, found her interest further fueled when she had to study for the General Paper (GP). The GP lessons often focused on the maritime industry as a topic, and she began researching the industry further, before applying to the Nanyang Technological University's (NTU) Bachelor of Science in Maritime Studies programme. During her last semester at the university, she began a weekly podcast specifically catered to those working or interested in the maritime industry. She would curate bite-sized content about the latest developments in global shipping and supply chain operations. Last month, Ms Tan was one of 18 students appointed as the Maritime and Port Authority's first batch of MaritimeSG Youth Ambassadors (MYAs). The programme provides youth leaders a platform to impart knowledge on the maritime movement to their peers and raise awareness of the industry in Singapore, dubbed MaritimeSG, through youth-to-youth advocacy. Selected from local institutes of higher learning across various academic disciplines, including maritime, business and law, the MYAs will serve for two years. Ms Tan said of her appointment: ""I think the industry is better known now than previous years, but more can definitely be done for more young people to understand it. ""I think the only time they are affected or hear about supply chains is when their Shopee parcel is delayed. With the various initiatives taken by MPA and the MYAs, I hope that can change now."" Ms Sarah Sharieff chanced upon the industry while scrolling through polytechnic websites after her O-level studies. She then joined Singapore Polytechnic, which partnered with Singapore Maritime Academy for maritime courses. The 20-year-old MYA, who is interested in working in the commercial side of the industry, hopes to reach out to secondary school students and explain more about the different ways to improve efficiency in shipping through digitalisation and the concept of decarbonisation. Another MYA, Mr Katiravan Suparmaniam, was, like Ms Tan, also influenced by a family member. The 24-year-old NTU mechanical engineering student used to eagerly listen to his brother's experience at work when he returned home as a design engineer on a ship. Mr Katiravan became interested in studying the mechanics of a ship, which led to his aspiring to be a seafarer. As an MYA, he wishes to reach out to peers who are also interested in seafaring but have little knowledge of it and how to get started on it. He urges young people to explore what the maritime field has to offer, and as an MYA, he hopes to use his networking opportunities to guide them to the right industry leader or career path. He said: ""I believe that there is something out there for everyone, and it does not have to be particularly (based on) what they have studied. I believe the youth should explore different career options and opportunities, especially for such a broad industry like the maritime one. Keep your options open."""

At a WSG job fair in Bedok on Thursday (9 June), Minister of State for Manpower Gan Siow Huang said: “Some (women) actually may, by choice, want to stay at home to take care of family members, but we think a certain proportion may want to come back (to work) when they feel ready. “We hope that in the next 10 to 20 years we will be able to see more women coming back; but we should also at the same time recognise that, at the end of the day, we have to respect women’s choices.” Asked about a target on getting women back to work, she said: “I think it is more important to focus on supporting more women who are willing to come back to work.” The number of women working has been rising in Singapore, reaching 61.2 per cent in 2020. For women who remain home, 15 per cent point to domestic duties as the main reason. In a statement on Thursday, WSG said the herCareer initiative is in line with the white paper on Singapore women’s development, which “called for a whole-of-society effort” to advance their development. herCareer also “showcases the suite of support across Government agencies, community and grassroot organisations available.” Support includes job matching trials, career conversion training and placement, as well as job search guidance and job attachments. Ms Zuria Yusope, 37, said at the job fair that women-specific programmes are helpful for women who might prefer to interact one-to-one and among women. She quit her job as an assistant general manager of a sports broadcasting consultancy in 2019 to care for her mother. To rejoin the workforce three years later, she took up the “Back to Work Women” programme run by Yayasan Mendaki in March. Last month, she started as a programme manager in the social service sector. Ms Jacqueline Tok, 47, who was also at the fair, said she left her job in 2018 when her company restructured and decided to extend her hiatus to prepare her son for his PSLE exams. Despite having been a senior executive in international media companies, when she wanted to work again in late 2019, she could not get an interview, despite having sent over 100 applications. She became a WSG Career Ambassador in 2020 and a WSG senior career coach six months later. She said having dedicated programmes is better since “men and women are very different”, adding that less “ego” and recognition of the many nuanced roles played by women make these programmes more targeted. It offers career advice, training services and names of organisations offering support services for women. Programme offering trial and part-time job opportunities for women who need flexible work arrangements. About 100 programmes over 30 sectors to train and place women in better jobs and new sectors. Self-assessment tool to guide jobseekers to relevant events and activities based on the stage of their job search. Four-to-six months' job attachment for jobseekers aged 40 and above, with the opportunity to be taken into full-time employment at the end of the attachment."

What should I do?,"In this series, manpower correspondent Calvin Yang offers practical answers to candid questions on navigating workplace challenges and getting ahead in your career. A: It can be difficult being the talk of the office. Office gossip hurts morale and relations, and can be distressing when it involves untruths about you, says Ms Rupali Gupta, talent solutions leader at Mercer Singapore. ""Not only can it damage your reputation and professional opportunities, it can also be extremely stressful on a personal level."" Unfortunately, people enjoy gossip - just look at celebrity news sites, she adds. ""As social beings, we crave connection and workplace gossip - when benign - can be cathartic and a way to bond with co-workers."" To be clear, when colleagues talk behind your back, it often says more about them than about you. That said, take a step back to calm yourself down. Adecco Singapore country manager Betul Genc says the key is to maintain composure without acting out. ""Being defensive as a first step will build roadblocks and potentially cause emotional distress,"" she adds. Start by being honest with yourself. Assess if there is any truth in what is shared before taking the next step. If it is true, consider your options. This could involve making the changes on your part, for instance putting in the extra effort at work if you haven't been delivering quality work. And you do not have to go through this alone. In the process, feel free to confide in someone you trust. Let that person know what you are going through. And if, somehow, you decide to talk it out with the colleagues involved, acknowledge the issue and share how the gossip has affected you, say experts. Then try to move on. If there is no truth to it, you could choose to ignore it and give it time to wear off. Ms Rupali explains: ""The more you try to justify it, the more fuel you may add to the fire. Let your actions and reality speak louder than the gossip."" Or you could address it politely and firmly to establish that you would prefer for this not to be discussed further, she adds. Ms Genc says: ""If the in-person conversation escalates and you feel overwhelmed, speak with your line manager, who can guide you with steps to remedy the situation. You are within your rights to report any gossip that may jeopardise your career, to the right person and done in a professional manner."" Some may not be comfortable talking to their supervisor, as it may seem like they are deliberately causing trouble. Admittedly, such situations may not be straightforward as some are afraid of jeopardising their careers. In such cases, you could talk to a trusted colleague, your HR department or even a career counsellor before deciding your next step. While you cannot control what others say, you can certainly take charge of how you respond. ""So take a deep breath and take a step back before deciding if you want to take control of the narrative and tell your side of the story, or simply let the rumour die out,"" says Ms Rupali. At the end of the day, remember that people who know you well and trust you will not be swayed by what they hear. Have a question? Send it to askst@sph.com.sg."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/about-23000-civil-servants-to-get-pay-rise-of-between-5-and-14-from-august,"About 23,000 civil servants to get pay rise of between 5% and 14% ","SINGAPORE - About 23,000 civil servants will get a pay rise of between 5 per cent and 14 per cent from Aug 1 this year. This will allow the civil service to keep pace with the market and continue to attract and retain talent, the Public Service Division (PSD) said on Sunday (June 5). Salaries for the civil service generic schemes were last adjusted in 2014, when pay increases of about 5 per cent were made for mid-level civil servants. ""Since then, salary levels in the market have gone up,"" PSD said. There are about 153,000 public officers working in 16 ministries and more than 50 statutory boards. Of these, about 87,000 are civil service workers. The adjustments benefit officers in roles such as policymaking, administration and operations work. They do not apply to civil servants in specialised schemes, such as accountants, police officers, teachers and foreign service officers. Civil servants in the management executive, management support and corporate support schemes will receive pay increases of between 5 per cent and 10 per cent, with higher adjustments for grades that have larger gaps with market benchmark. Those in the operations support scheme will receive higher adjustments of between 6 per cent and 14 per cent, in line with the Tripartite Workgroup on Lower-Wage Workers' call to uplift the salaries of lower-wage workers. The adjustments come after Minister-in-charge of the Public Service Chan Chun Sing said in Parliament in February that the public sector has seen an increase in attrition across the board. The resignation rate for the management executive scheme, the largest generic scheme in the civil service, hit a 10-year high of 9.9 per cent last year. PSD has also been working with the Amalgamated Union of Public Employees to redesign the jobs of operations support officers, improve their career progression and raise productivity in the long run. Hybrid work arrangements and flexible work options were also introduced. PSD added that it will continue to provide officers with career opportunities and support their growth and development. This includes job attachments, structured job rotations, formal training and project work. In response to queries on the salaries of civil servants in specialised schemes, a Ministry of Education (MOE) spokesman said: “MOE is working with PSD to review salaries of MOE schemes and the outcome will be made known in due course.”  A Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) spokesman said: “MHA is also reviewing our schemes of service to ensure that they remain competitive and keep pace with the market.”  Its officers will be informed of any changes to the schemes by the end of the year. Amalgamated Union of Public Employees general secretary Sanjeev Tiwari said the move to raise wages could keep public sector pay in tandem with private sector salaries amid manpower shortages. “It would also help cushion the impact of inflation, especially for the lower income group,” he added. CIMB economist Song Seng Wun said the pay rise is timely with headline inflation in Singapore having hit decade highs in March. “It sends a signal to the private sector that the Government is doing its part - that it is mindful of the higher cost of living.  “The public sector doesn’t want to lose workers to the private sector,” he added. Labour economist Walter Theseira, an associate professor at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, said that the pay rise is also a recognition that private sector wages in comparable jobs have risen significantly. “This move would also help maintain living standards especially for the lower wage civil servants, who might otherwise face significant loss of living standards,” he said. Prof Theseira added that most employers will also be factoring in inflation in making their wage adjustments this year.  “Those who cannot afford to do so may see their workers leave if the market remains tight and there are better offers out there.”  A civil servant employed under the management executive scheme who wants to be known only as Mr Chan said the pay rise provides some certainty that civil servants are being supported.  “I’m also hoping to see more opportunities for upskilling,” said the 26-year-old of PSD’s work to support development of civil service officers.

But getting through shifts that sometimes stretched for as long as 14 hours took a toll on his family time."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/graduated-with-a-business-degree-but-out-on-the-roads-10-hours-a-day-as-private-hire-driver,He's a business graduate but plies roads as private-hire driver 10 hours a day  ,"SINGAPORE - Mr Jeevan John Menon has a university degree, but for the past nine months, he has been working 10 hours a day as a private-hire driver. The 31-year-old, who graduated with a Bachelor of Business Studies (Honours) in Management from University College Dublin in 2017, is now concerned that he will not be able to return to a corporate job."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/looking-after-the-people-who-power-a-superapp,Looking after the people who power a superapp ,"Mr Johan Wu used to have to wait under the hot sun when he had to replace the iconic green Grab cooler bag or T-shirt at the company’s former service centre in Sin Ming. “You have to first make appointments at different counters. Then you register, and wait for your turn. At Sin Ming, if it was crowded, you might have to wait outside under the hot sun. And you’d register at one unit, and walk a few blocks away to collect your gear.” Now, replacing what Mr Wu calls “his gear” is a breeze at the company’s new S$3.1 million service centre that opened in Tampines in February. “At Grab@Tampines, if there are people ahead of you in the queue, you can just wait at the pantry, it’s air-conditioned everywhere and there’s sufficient seating.” There, the father of a five-month-old daughter gets to rest, enjoy free flow of drinks, and unwind with fellow Grab partners, those who provide ride-hailing and delivery services under the superapp. He has been with Grab full-time since 2020. What started out as a functional service centre in Sin Ming to help Grab partners with registration needs and common issues such as app usage difficulties has grown into a one-stop destination three times the size of the old facility. Grab invested in this 15,300 sq ft service centre to better serve its partners. Each year, the company manages around 68,000 tickets, or enquiries, on concerns ranging from onboarding and technical troubleshooting, to customer service and training. Now, it can serve 50 per cent more partners in a more efficient manner. “Most gig workers would share that any time away from driving or delivering orders means loss of income for them,” says Mr Yee Wee Tang, Grab Singapore managing director. “Hence, when we were designing Grab@Tampines, we set it up such that we will be able to offer efficient and convenient support to our partners by locating all essential services, including signing up, training and partner support, in one location,” he adds. Ms Lim, a Grab delivery partner for two years, says the new Tampines centre has centralised everything, which helps partners save time. “Previously, if I had to do something such as checking my incentive or get a new delivery outfit, I may get lost trying to locate the right place. Now, I no longer have to go back and forth, and can complete all my errands in half an hour.” For others like delivery partner Sheela Bachunalai, who lives in Jurong, staff manning the dedicated helpline for Grab partners has been her main source of support since she joined the company in 2020.  “The Grab centre hotline is always very helpful. If our phone battery is low, or heavy rain prevents us from delivering, they understand and will cancel the order on their end, which will not affect our cancellation rate that could, in turn, affect our cash incentives.” Ms Sheela, who has two primary school-going children, loves the flexibility of her gig work. She gets to plan her own schedule, accepting only deliveries that do not clash with her family responsibilities.  “It’s more fun than sitting at home, I can go out and earn money, get exercise, and free up my mind. Sitting at home the entire day can be stressful,” says Ms Sheela.  In her previous retail  job, the 44-year-old had to stick to a strict 8am to 2pm timing, making it difficult for her to return home in time to prepare lunch for her children.  Back when Ms Sheela signed up two years ago, the onboarding process was already quick and convenient. With the new centre, the onboarding process has been made even more seamless so that they can start earning as quickly as possible.  Registration and photo-taking can be done on-site; new sign-ups activated within two to three hours; and the vehicle and other equipment can be collected on the same day at one location.  To ensure that its partners receive assistance promptly, Grab set up four virtual booths manned by staff who are off-site. Explaining the thinking behind the suite of services at Grab@Tampines, Mr Yee says: “Flexibility is one key aspect of the design of Grab@Tampines. Our virtual booths allow us to scale up operations in a short period of time should we experience an influx of visitors. Such flexibility helps us ensure that we maintain efficiency without compromising on the quality of service to our partners.” He adds that the room size of the training rooms can also be customised according to training or government requirements. Apart from in-house courses on driver safety, customer service and food hygiene, Grab also works with external agencies like Ngee Ann Polytechnic to offer other in-demand training and upskilling programmes.  Ms Lim, for example, is interested in a food hygiene course. “With this expertise, I may be able to work in other roles in the food & beverage industry if I ever decide to stop working as a delivery partner,” she shares.  Grab also supports its partners in other ways. When drivers’ earnings plunged during the height of the pandemic, Mr Peh Hock Chuan took on a full-time security job to supplement his income, thanks in part to a diploma course on security that he enrolled in via the Grab driver app for Grab driver-partners.  The biggest form of support for him was the scholarships awarded to his two university-going children. “On the advice of the transport manager, who often encourages drivers and gives them advice on how to drive better, drive well, I learnt about the Grab scholarships. My children applied and received the scholarships, which helped us to save almost $20,000,” says Mr Peh, a Grab driver-partner for six years. A firm believer in lifelong learning, the 55-year-old also made use of the Grab driver app to enrol in a second diploma course on driver training. He is now a licensed security personnel trainer, a certification that would open more doors for him in the post-pandemic economy.     He says: “Grab will provide support for our educational achievements if we complete our studies, based on the number of hours, and reward us for a job well done. “Grab is also always asking us for feedback, and interacts well with us. It is a fantastic company, and it feels like Grab always has your back, and we are never left alone.” Q1: Why are Grab drivers always asking me to rate them well?
A: Rating is important for building confidence and trust among our users. It also enables Grab to ensure platform service quality. With an average driver rating of 4.9 out of 5, Grab and our partners take pride in providing passengers with the highest quality of service, and will continue to do so. We encourage passengers to provide their drivers a good rating if they have had a pleasant ride.  Q2: Can drivers cancel rides on purpose to get a better fare?
A: No. As part of our code of conduct, drivers must maintain a certain level of ride-acceptance and ride-cancellation rate, which helps our platform ensure quality service for consumers.   We also look into passengers’ reasons to cancel a ride after it has been assigned to a driver to make sure that our partners are not penalised unfairly as well.  Q3: Are driver- and delivery-partners immediately suspended whenever consumers complain?
A: Grab will conduct an internal investigation to ensure that both sides of the story are heard before making a decision. However, in cases of sexual harassment, assault and other serious offences, Grab will implement an immediate suspension. "
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/self-employed-freelancers-upskill-grow-careers-virtual-coaching-NTUC-NICA,Helping the self-employed upskill and grow their careers,"When you encounter a legal, contractual or any other issue at work as a full-time employee, chances are, you can turn to someone from your company for help or advice. But if you are one of hundreds of thousands of freelance workers in Singapore – there were about 211,000 freelancers in 2019, according to the Ministry of Manpower – seeking recourse and protection can be tougher as you are pretty much on your own.  That is, unless you are a member of one of the associations for freelance professionals set up by the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC).  Just ask Mr Ho See Kum. The anime fan has been doodling comics ever since he watched the anime Laputa The Castle In The Sky at the age of 17. It sparked his lifelong interest in comics and drawing, which then became a career. In 2002, he started ComixGuru, a cartooning and art education service provider for schools and private institutions. For 20 years, he has been teaching in more than 50 primary and secondary schools. Some of his flagship courses that are popular in schools include “Rediscover Cartoon Creation” and “Rediscover Comics Making”.  All was smooth sailing for the 46-year-old, who is married without children, until the Covid-19 pandemic hit. Schools nationwide implemented home-based learning, which meant that Mr Ho could no longer teach art in person. “There was a lot of uncertainty and I saw a sharp decline in the amount of work. I taught in only one or two schools in 2020. If it wasn’t for the pandemic, I could have taken up to five schools or more.”  Thankfully, as a member of the National Instructors & Coaches Association (NICA), one of the various associations for freelancers and self-employed persons under the NTUC umbrella, Mr Ho had no time to idle. The reason? NICA had a wide range of virtual and easily accessible training sessions to sign up for. They were part of the NICA Business Support Network and Resources which were funded by NICA to help coaches and instructors build capabilities such as producing videos so that they could pivot and coach virtually. “It wasn’t just a few sessions but a full suite of online courses, anything from digital marketing to mindfulness, and they were tailored even for people who weren’t so tech-savvy, like myself,” he says, adding that he acquired a lot of knowledge that he was lacking in during this period.  He found the courses very useful to his career as they took away his initial fear of technology and, more specifically, his fear of using it to coach his students. The bonus: enjoying a sense of community bonding with other NICA members who were going through the same challenges during the Covid-19 pandemic.  “It eased a lot of mental anxiety just to know that it is okay because everyone is also trying their best to make things work.”  Even now that things are looking up, Mr Ho, who has encouraged his peers to take up membership, is still grateful for how NICA has played a very supportive role.  “As a self-employed business owner, I am constantly at the mercy of not being kept up to date about contractual issues and my rights when I sign contracts. You need a strong support group to look out for your basic rights and make sure they are not trampled on, just because you are self-employed. At least, now I know who I can turn to.”  NTUC, through speaking with various groups of coaches and instructors, realised that these individuals faced common challenges such as getting funds to upskill themselves, income insecurity and securing more work opportunities. In 2019, NICA was formed to be the collective voice for coaches and instructors in the fields of sports, outdoor learning and adventure, visual and performing arts, fitness and wellness, as well as enrichment. The association supports these individuals through programmes and initiatives that focus on strengthening skills, standards, recognition and opportunities. “NTUC and the Freelancers and Self-Employed Unit (U FSE) recognised the need to represent workers in the gig economy and is playing an active role in advocating and advancing the interests of these workers. Through associations such as NICA, we have initiated discussions with the relevant sector government ministries and agencies on how we can work together to strengthen frameworks and put safeguards in place to support the livelihoods of freelancers under their purview,” says Ms Yeo Wan Ling, adviser to the National Taxi Association, National Private Hire Vehicles Association and National Delivery Champions Association. NICA members are engaged by the Ministry of Education, the People’s Association and the Health Promotion Board, for instance, to carry out co-curricular activities and enrichment programmes in schools or recreation activities for the public.  Members pay just $117 a year to enjoy training benefits of up to $250 per calendar year, complimentary short courses and workshops on topics such as personal data protection and student engagement. For this year’s May Day, members can also enjoy a variety of exclusive privileges, including discounts of up to 50 per cent at relevant attractions, restaurants as well as lifestyle goods and wellness outlets. Says Ms Jean See, director of U FSE and executive secretary of NICA: “Being a self-employed person or freelancer does not mean having to work alone. NTUC-affiliated associations like NICA, and NTUC departments like U FSE, are set up to provide the right resources and connections to keep your career as a self-employed person or freelancer sustainable. We would like to encourage more self-employed persons and freelancers to join our associations so that we can help them with a stronger collective voice."" It’s not just instructors and coaches who have a formal support network in the form of NICA.  As NTUC aims to support all workers, it started the U FSE back in 2015 to represent any freelancer or self-employed person in Singapore and to strengthen his or her wage, welfare and work prospects.  To do this, NTUC U FSE works closely with stakeholders such as government agencies, community groups and business solutions providers to bolster the income security, occupational safety and health, and collective interests of freelancers and self-employed persons.  Besides U FSE, which is a department in NTUC, there are various NTUC-affiliated associations such as NICA, the National Taxi Association and National Private Hire Vehicle Association for point-to-point transport drivers, the National Delivery Champions Association for food and package delivery workers, and the Visual, Audio, Creative Content Professionals Association for freelance creative professionals. 
  Apart from freelancers and self-employed workers, NTUC also supports all other groups of workers, including professionals, managers and executives, as well as rank-and-file workers, regardless of gender and age.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/robust-pay-rises-in-singapore-last-year-tempered-by-inflation,Robust pay rises in Singapore last year tempered by inflation,"SINGAPORE - Most workers saw pay hikes last year, but rising prices meant that their gains were tempered. With a large majority of companies raking in profits, 70 per cent of workers saw their pay packets expand, with resident workers who had stayed in their jobs for at least one year taking home an extra 3.9 per cent on average. But inflation ate into their gains and their spending power increased by just 1.6 per cent - less than half of their nominal pay hikes. Despite nominally bigger pay cheques, workers have fared worse only once over the past five years. That was in 2020, when real wage growth was 1.4 per cent despite prices dipping marginally. Some 59 per cent of workers saw their nominal pay increase in 2020. The biggest hikes went to junior executives, who have become the most sought-after segment of the workforce. Prospects appeared brighter last year as the economy expanded 7.6 per cent and three in four companies were profitable. But an inflation rate of 2.3 per cent diluted real gains for workers. High prices are expected to persist for the rest of the year as lockdowns in China and the Ukraine war worsen supply bottlenecks, said Dr Hong Ru, assistant professor of banking and finance at Nanyang Business School. “The key is how fast we can get out of this supply chain issue and to really increase productivity. If we can do this fast, we will be in a good position next year,” he said. Inflation is expected to peak at 4 per cent between July and September before easing in late 2022. Recruiter Michael Page, which reported that most firms were planning to give annual increments of 3 per cent this year, expects that bigger hikes would be made after September. Its managing director, Mr Nilay Khandelwal, said: “This is when we would really know what exactly would be the AI (annual increment) and inflation rates. Generally speaking, Singapore AI is pretty much tied to the inflation rate to a large extent.” The Singapore Business Federation sees relief coming for employers in sectors where foreign workers would return in the coming months, but added that the situation remains fluid. Its executive director for advocacy and policy, Mr Albert Tsui, said: “MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) has made deliberate efforts to contain these price increases, so we can expect some easing of inflationary pressures over time. “The opening of borders to foreign labour will help ease manpower pressures partially, but there is a lag effect.” The National Trades Union Congress said it was “encouraged” by the wage growth, but urged companies to ensure that lower-wage workers’ salaries catch up with the national median. Its assistant secretary-general Desmond Choo said: “Rank-and-file workers, who generally spent a larger proportion of their wages on essentials, are particularly impacted, yet their wage growth lagged behind the industries‘ overall wage growth.”  Singapore’s 280,000 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which hire 70 per cent of the workforce, have borne the brunt of the manpower crunch and wage costs. To cope with rising wage costs, Association of Small and Medium Enterprises president Kurt Wee said SMEs could think about keeping core functions here while offshoring others. He added: “Scale regionally and globally to tap large demand.” Economist Walter Theseira from the Singapore University of Social Sciences said last year’s pay rises were largely compensating for 2020’s “conservative wage strategies”. “When firms are profitable and demand is robust, business costs are a secondary concern compared to not being able to take advantage of business opportunities,” he said. “Right now, it seems that businesses are still more concerned about getting talent... so the wage increases are a necessary price to pay for getting the talent needed.”"
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/new-ability-tests-expand-pool-of-nsfs-eligible-for-certain-saf-roles,New ability tests expand pool of NSFs eligible for certain SAF roles,"SINGAPORE - Lance Corporal Lau Kah Onn, 21, suffered from multiple kneecap dislocations in his teens while playing basketball in secondary school. A history of injuries like his previously meant a blanket exemption from serving as a transport operator in national service, his current role at the Singapore Armed Forces' Transport Hub West. But Lance Cpl Lau, who enlisted in May last year, is among a group of full-time national servicemen with certain limb conditions and past sports injuries who can now serve as transport operators. This initiative is part of the SAF's push in recent years to deploy more soldiers in more meaningful roles, while maintaining safety and operational effectiveness. This is being done by doing away with a binary mode of medically classifying soldiers into combat-fit and non-combat-fit, starting with transport operators in April last year. To ensure the soldiers' safety and capacity to serve, trained SAF physiotherapists will evaluate the servicemen for their strength, range of motion and stability on a case-by-case basis. This is done through ability tests - called functional assessment - that replicate the physical movements servicemen will need for specific roles, such as, in the case of transport operators, clambering on and off trucks. The exercises used in the assessment for transport operators were developed by the Headquarters Army Medical Services, in consultation with physiotherapists and occupational therapists from Tan Tock Seng Hospital's National Driving Assessment and Rehabilitation Programme. Upon passing the assessment, Lance Cpl Lau attended the same training as other transport operators who did not need the assessment and has been given the same duties. He said he has no symptoms lingering from his injuries, other than the occasional stiffness, which does not affect his work. The assessment helps optimise the deployment of every national serviceman by allowing servicemen of varying physical abilities to take on a wider range of operational roles. Chief of Army Brigadier-General David Neo said in an interview last Wednesday (May 25) that the army will extend such functional assessments to other vocations and redesign new jobs. This would translate into expanded deployment for 1,600 full-time national servicemen jobs across 89 vocations. Since the assessment, which targets non-combat-fit servicemen with a Physical Employment Standards (PES) of C and E, was introduced in April last year, SAF has increased its selection pool of potential transport operators by 7 per cent. ""We are now able to look at the requirements of different jobs and say that it may be doable even though by the original PES system, you would not have been allowed to do so,"" said Senior Minister of State for Defence Heng Chee How, after visiting the Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC) School V at Kranji Camp II on Monday (May 30). BMTC School V conducts basic military training for enlistees deemed non-combat-fit, such as Lance Cpl Lau. Mr Heng said the 7 per cent increase in the manpower pool was significant as the number of babies in Singapore not increasing ""is actually not going up at any fast rate"". He added: “But what is equally important is when you speak to the soldiers themselves, they really appreciate it because if I have to spend two years with you, I want my time to count for something that is functionally and operationally required.” Lance Cpl Lau has taken on his role with gusto, getting himself certified to drive eight types of vehicles, including large lorries and ambulances. It is more than double the number - three - of vehicle types a transport operator is required to manage. And there is a personal connection that drives him. He said: ""In my family, my late grandfather was the only one in the family besides me who could drive a (heavy) vehicle, which somehow... makes me feel more connected to him."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/retail-information-and-communications-among-sectors-with-largest-pay-hikes,"Retail, information and communications among sectors with largest pay hikes","SINGAPORE - All sectors saw a larger percentage increase in wages last year compared with 2020, buoyed by the impact of eased pandemic safe management measures and travel restrictions. The strong growth cut across both outward- and domestic-oriented sectors, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) in a statement accompanying its annual wage practices report on Monday (May 30). But six sectors posted particularly strong results, even outdoing the pace of wage growth in 2019, before the pandemic. They are retail trade, professional services, information and communications, wholesale trade, manufacturing and construction. Outward-oriented sectors such as information and communications, financial and services, as well as manufacturing, registered healthy expansion even in the midst of the pandemic and continued to enjoy strong wage growth in 2021, said the ministry. For instance, even at the height of the pandemic in 2020, the information and communications sector still logged total wage growth of 1.5 per cent. For 2021, the wage growth accelerated to 5.1 per cent for the sector. Retail trade clinched the highest wage increase overall, at 5.5 per cent last year, over three percentage points more than in 2020. Even stronger was wage growth specifically for rank-and-file workers, defined as those in technical, clerical, sales, service, production, transport, cleaning and related positions in retail. These employees, who do not hold managerial or executive positions, clocked 6.3 per cent in total wage growth, up from 2.2 per cent in 2020. However, much of the expansion for these workers in 2021 was down to other wage components, as basic wage rose only 2.1 per cent for them. In its statement, MOM noted that even sectors that were more affected by the pandemic recorded wage increases as demand for manpower climbed in tandem with the reopening of borders. The accommodation sector, which was the hardest hit by the pandemic, with wages cut by more than 5 per cent on average in 2020, rebounded to a 1.7 per cent increase. However, this is still short of the 3.5 per cent posted in 2019 for the sector. However, MOM cautioned: ""With recent shocks to the global supply chains, inflation is projected to stay elevated and dampen real wage growth."" Ms Rose Tong, executive director of the Singapore Retailers Association, said a reason for the high wage growth in the retail sector was the increased pressure on employers to retain workers, particularly after the exodus of Malaysian workers as border restrictions curbed commuting across the Causeway. Noting that this shortage is likely to stay for some time, she added: “Some have not returned yet and some may never return.” Ms Tong said some employers have given feedback that some former employees, when asked to return to Singapore, opted to remain in Malaysia. She also said the percentage increase in wages for rank-and-file staff was likely higher than for management staff in the retail sector, as there was a greater need to retain rank-and-file staff who generate value by clinching sales in-store. “Some could also have doubled up on job roles and been fairly compensated. A lot of retailers had to go online and retail staff actually learnt how to do sales online,” added Ms Tong. Temporary wage support schemes to support hiring during the pandemic, such as the Jobs Growth Incentive (JGI), could also have offset the expense of subsequent wage increases. Introduced in September 2020, the JGI encouraged employers to hire more locals by providing wage support of up to 50 per cent for as long as 18 months for eligible employees. “You leave a job and someone else could afford to pay you a lot more because 50 per cent would be borne by the Government,” said Ms Tong. The survey covers wage increases only for staff who have served in the same company for at least a year, and not those who got a pay rise after switching jobs. Ms Audrey Yap, honorary treasurer of the Singapore Manufacturing Federation, said wage growth in 2021 in the manufacturing sector could have been higher than before the pandemic due to an ongoing broad-based labour crunch, as well as to defray higher living expenses for foreign workers. She said the industry is “not homogeneous”, with some burgeoning sectors, such as pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and food and beverage driving demand for workers more than others and affecting the consequent wage growth. She also noted that wage growth is likely to accelerate, with the small and medium manufacturing enterprises that the federation represents likely to bear the brunt. “There is an upward trajectory, but we don’t know at what point the ceiling will be reached and we don’t know how steep the growth will be,” she added."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/wage-growth-rebounded-to-39-in-2021-from-12-in-2020-7-in-10-workers-received-raises-mom,Wage growth rebounded to 3.9% in 2021; 7 in 10 workers receive a raise,"SINGAPORE - Amid a tight labour market in 2021, more employees - seven in 10 - received wage hikes, an increase from just six in 10 the year before. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Monday (May 30) that the total wage growth last year among employees who had been with the same employer for at least one year was 3.9 per cent, a similar figure to 2019. This was an increase from the previous year. In 2020, the year the Covid-19 pandemic hit, total wage growth slowed to 1.2 per cent. MOM said the rebound in total wage growth was due to a broad-based economic recovery across industries and a tight labour market from border restrictions slowing down the inflow of non-resident labour. About 75 per cent of employers were profitable in 2021 - an increase from 63 per cent the year before - as the economy recorded an expansion of 7.6 per cent. This enabled employers to restore wage cuts that had been made in 2020, MOM said. Seventy per cent of employees received a raise last year, an increase from 60 per cent in 2020, with the extent of these increases improving from 4.5 per cent in 2020 to 6.3 per cent in 2021. The proportion of employees who experienced a wage cut was halved to just 10 per cent in 2021 compared with 23 per cent in 2020, with these cuts being less steep as well, from 6.9 per cent in 2020 to 5.2 per cent last year. The wage growth of 3.9 per cent recorded in 2021 was less than in 2010, which saw wages increase by 5.7 per cent during the recovery following the global financial crisis that hit in 2008. MOM attributed this to the longer tail of the pandemic, which might have made employers more cautious about raising wages, as well as the less severe impact that the pandemic had on wages compared with the global financial crisis. This meant that wages had less ground to recover in 2021 compared with 2010. The higher total wage growth in 2021 was experienced across all sectors, with retail trade recording the highest growth at 5.5 per cent. Outward-oriented sectors such as the information and communications industry recorded a wage growth of 5.1 per cent; financial and insurance services had a growth of 4.1 per cent; and manufacturing sector, 4 per cent. These sectors account for about 70 per cent of the economy and are projected to benefit from the pickup in external demand. Among sectors that were hit hard by the pandemic, wages rose in tandem with a return of demand for manpower as border restrictions were eased. The accommodation sector - which includes hotels, serviced apartments and dormitories - saw wages increase by 1.7 per cent last year, from a 5.3 per cent decrease in 2020. Transportation and storage saw a similar turnaround with wages increasing by 2.8 per cent, from a 3 per cent decrease the year before, while food and beverage services saw an increase of 2.6 per cent in 2021, up from 1.5 per cent in 2020. Real wage growth, which takes into account the inflation rate, was, however, dampened by higher inflation. In 2021, when the inflation rate was 2.3 per cent, real wage growth was registered at 1.6 per cent. This was slightly above the previous year's figure of 1.4 per cent, when inflation rate was negative 0.2 per cent, and less than half of the 3.3 per cent reported in 2019 that had an inflation rate of 0.6 per cent. MOM said that wage growth is expected to continue in 2022 due to the tight labour market, which would slowly be eased by the significant relaxation of border restrictions, allowing non-resident workforce numbers to recover. The ongoing Russian-Ukraine war and protracted global supply disruptions were factors cited by the ministry that could dampen demand and wage growth in 2022. Recent shocks to global supply chains meant that inflation was expected to remain high and dampen real wage growth as well, MOM added."

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/only-7-in-100-architecture-graduates-will-stay-in-the-profession-survey,Only 7 in 100 architecture graduates will stay in the profession in the long term: Survey,"SINGAPORE - Only seven in 100 architecture graduates said they will stay in the profession for the long haul, a survey conducted by the Singapore Institute of Architects (SIA) found. While those in the industry have long been aware of the talent drain, the institute's first vice-president Tiah Nan Chyuan, 45, said its survey of 536 young architecture graduates helped put a number to the situation. The majority of those surveyed were recent graduates, and SIA's newly elected president Melvin Tan said such surveys are not conducted often. Mr Tiah said about 100 candidates take the professional practice examinations yearly. The findings effectively mean that out of these, only fewer than 10 see themselves staying in the profession in the long term. Those who want to quit cited low wages and long hours, a lack of work-life balance as well as high stress and a poor work culture as reasons. Addressing the talent drain that the architecture industry is facing will be top of mind for Mr Tan, who is leading the SIA's 62nd council in the coming year. To support younger architects and help smoothen their transition from school to work, Mr Tan said the institute has expanded a mentorship programme to include young graduates entering the industry. Previously available only to architecture students in institutes of higher learning, the programme now also connects fresh graduates to experienced architects who will bring them up to speed with industry practices. Mr Tan, 47, hopes the programme will help young graduates navigate the real world, which can be overwhelming for newbies who need to be well-versed in building codes and requirements. Mr Tiah said anecdotal evidence indicates that about 10 per cent of architecture graduates stay in the profession, but what is concerning is how soon they are quitting the industry. He said architects used to stay for about 10 to 15 years before leaving, but it is now common for those with less than five years' experience to quit. ""The impact on the industry is that there's a huge capability gap, and this will affect the ability of the firms to transform, digitise,"" added Mr Tiah."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/former-financial-services-consultant-makes-mid-career-switch-for-purpose-passion,"Former financial services consultant makes mid-career switch for purpose, passion","When Singapore imposed a stringent circuit breaker in April 2020 to curb escalating Covid-19 infections, Ms Yulia Suriaatmadja, like so many others, found her world upended. Just a month earlier, the 50-year-old had also begun shouldering greater caregiving responsibilities for her ailing 81-year-old father, including attending short eldercare modules to better assist him.  The period of home confinement and added responsibilities was a turning point, one that presented an opportunity to change course.  “The time spent during the circuit breaker made me evaluate my life, and what I wanted to do in the next half of my life,” says Ms Suriaatmadja, who is married with no children. She was then working as a financial services consultant following stints in the hospitality industry and luxury fashion retail.  She yearned for a more purposeful career. So in September 2020, she left the financial industry after nearly four years. “It wasn’t easy to walk away from friends who supported me when I first joined the industry and clients whom I’ve built a good relationship with,” she disclosed.   It made sense for Ms Suriaatmadja that her great work reset would be in healthcare – her first career choice from her teenage years. But back then, her parents wanted her to study business.  More than three decades later, she decided it was the right time for her to “do something that I like and (which is also) meaningful”.  With a clear-eyed vision of the path forward, she trawled for opportunities online and found the Facebook page of healthcare training provider HMI Institute of Health Sciences. She was intrigued by details on how the HMI Institute – as part of the SGUnited Skills Programme (SGUS) – helped individuals transition to a career in the healthcare industry.  The SGUS and the accompanying SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways Programme-Company Training (SGUP-CT) were national schemes launched in 2020 to support jobseekers amid the pandemic. After speaking with the programme’s coordinator, Ms Suriaatmadja learned that she could train to be a healthcare professional through the SGUS Patient Service Associate Training Programme.  She signed up for the six-month course, a hybrid of online classes and hands-on training. Ms Suriaatmadja was initially apprehensive. “I have no prior experience in healthcare (and I) last stepped into a classroom more than 25 years ago.” But she became motivated by the industry-relevant curriculum and the trainers’ dedication and expertise. “Their guidance and selfless sharing of knowledge and real-life experience were invaluable.” Her favourite component was the clinical attachment because it was immersive. Even before she completed the course in April last year, private healthcare provider Osler Health International hired her to be a patient care assistant through a job fair organised by the National Trades Union Congress' Employment and Employability Institute. “It was quite a switch. I did have my doubts initially. But as time progressed, I got better at what I did, and began to enjoy my role.” She now oversees the six-member accident and emergency (A&E) admission department at Gleneagles Hospital.  The operational and administrative module of the course has proven to be a godsend. “It provided the basic foundation to run a clinic.” The structured experiential training boosted her confidence, leadership and teamwork skills, she says. On a daily basis, her personal effectiveness and soft-skills learning go into high gear.  “A typical day would have me start the morning checking and clearing emails before I head down to the A&E clinic to help my team with registrations and patient discharges. “I am a hands-on person. I like to feel the ground, and be there to attend to any issues, such as unhappy patients or operational matters.” The bright spot: “Interacting with patients, talking to them, making them feel at ease and seeing them leave the clinic happy.” It’s been just over a year since Ms Suriaatmadja stepped into the healthcare industry in a mid-career switch. Any misgivings? “Definitely not. I am happy in healthcare, there is so much more room to grow. This is just the beginning of the journey for me.” The pandemic may have provided the impetus to her pursuit of a career in the healthcare industry, but the training programme was pivotal.  “I was happy to know that the fee for the six-month programme was highly subsidised.” Overall, Ms Suriaatmadja felt that the course was “a well-rounded programme that equipped me technically and operationally for my foray into the healthcare industry”.  To those considering a career switch into a new industry, she has this advice: “For me, the industry I was going into was something that I wanted to pursue. Any new job is always daunting. But it gets easier once you settle down. “Most important, it (must) be something that you want to do. What matters is job satisfaction.” As of last month, the SGUS and the SGUP-CT schemes have been replaced by the SkillsFuture Career Transition Programme (SCTP). The train-and-place programme supports mid-career individuals in acquiring industry-relevant skills through a variety of subsidised modular courses to improve employability and pivot to new sectors or job roles. Courses are available in a part- or full-time format, ranging from three to 12 months. Jobseekers that have been unemployed for more than six months, require financial assistance or have disabilities may receive subsidies of up to 95 per cent of course fees, subject to eligibility criteria. The SCTP will be delivered by selected continuing education and training centres, and trainees will receive pre- and post-training coaching support such as career advisory and guidance. The SCTP is progressively rolling out new courses and aims to offer around 200 courses by 2025.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/ntuc-may-day-top-awardee-champions-increased-productivity-flexi-work-arrangements-for-workers,Recipient of top NTUC May Day Award champions fair treatment of workers,"SINGAPORE - Treating workers fairly is the cornerstone of the partnership between employers, unions and the Government, said veteran businessman Bob Tan on Thursday (May 19). Mr Tan, who is chairman of several firms, including Ascott Business Trust Management, Sentosa Development Corporation and SBS Transit, has also been a leading light in the trade union movement for many years. Indeed, it was his contributions to the labour union in the NTUC Club management council that earned him the top honour at the NTUC May Day Awards held at Fairmont Singapore on Thursday. Mr Tan, 70, has been involved with the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) for nearly 30 years and helped to develop recreational facilities for its members, such as Downtown East and Wild Wild Wet. He was also vice-president of the Singapore National Employers Federation for about 15 years. Awards were conferred on 149 union leaders, tripartite partners and model workers, the highest number of recipients on record. They include Ministry of Home Affairs Permanent Secretary Pang Kin Keong; the late Richard Magnus, who was given a posthumous award for his work as former chairman of the Public Transport Council; DBS Bank and Changi Airport Group. NTUC president Mary Liew said at the ceremony: ""Throughout the pandemic, the labour movement and our tripartite partners have worked hard together in solidarity to help our companies, keep our workplaces safe and cushion the impact of Covid-19 on our working people. ""We can and should be proud of the work that we have done to advance the cause of workers in the areas of wages, welfare and work prospects."" She hosted the ceremony alongside NTUC secretary-general Ng Chee Meng.  Mr Tan told the media that workers should always be the focus of the tripartite partnership between firms, unions and the Government: ""In the early days, it was just a matter of representing employers (for me), but then over time I realised that the cornerstone of tripartism is really the workers. ""If you don't have committed workers, you don't have a business... If your business depends on exploiting workers and paying them less than the market pay, it is not sustainable."" He added that when times are tough and pay freezes or cuts are inevitable, workers will also respond to fair employers by accepting the situation and helping the business environment to rebound. ""It's not something that we can take for granted because new generations of employers keep coming up. I think this is where the tripartite institutions can help employers to really think about how can they be fair, that they should pay competitively and look at how they can increase the productivity of the workers."" When asked about the manpower crunch that businesses are facing, Mr Tan said productivity means that employers can have fewer workers while paying them more. ""In the short term, we do have an issue because after Covid-19, many of the foreign workers have decided to go back... We will see that for six months to a year, there will be significant disruption to the availability of workers,"" he said. To resolve this, the tripartite partners have to work together to plug the gaps, which includes the Government looking into policies that make it easier for firms to get workers during this interim period, he suggested. On the side of local workers, the partners also have to look for ways to increase productivity and pay workers more, especially with the rising cost of living, he said. Meanwhile, flexible work arrangements can help to bring Singaporeans who are not working back into the labour force, Mr Tan added. ""In the old days, employers were not psychologically geared towards remote working. But in the last two to three years, we all learnt how to do that. We have to try and institutionalise some of the good things that we've done and bring some of these people on board."" He believes people still need to return to the office physically, but not every day. ""Each company will have its own way of working and will need to look at what can be done remotely and what can be done together,"" he said. ""The success of a business does not depend on whether you can see everybody physically in front of you, but on your output."""
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/nearly-1-in-3-workers-in-spore-plan-to-change-employers-in-first-half-of-2022-survey,Nearly 1 in 3 workers in S'pore plans to change employers in first half of 2022: Survey,"SINGAPORE - More workers in Singapore may change employers as the labour market continues its recovery, with more jobs being made available and incomes rebounding. A recent survey by recruitment company Randstad found that 31 per cent of the respondents, when asked in January this year if they plan to change jobs within the next six months, said they would. This marks a three-percentage point increase from the same period in 2021. Ms Jaya Dass, managing director at Randstad Singapore and Malaysia, said: ""As job vacancies abound and outnumber job seekers in the market, many employees are tempted to find better work opportunities."" She added: ""Besides wanting a higher salary, many employees are also looking for a holistic work experience, which includes flexible work schedules and a conducive environment for them to grow in their careers."" Randstad's annual employer brand research survey also showed that nearly one in five - or 18 per cent - of respondents had changed employers between July and December last year. The top three drivers motivating them to switch employers are work-life balance, salary and benefits, as well as pleasant work atmosphere, it found. When respondents were asked how worried they were about losing their job this year, two in five employees - or 41 per cent - indicated they were worried enough to change their jobs in the first half of this year. This marks a five per cent increase from 2021. This survey was conducted in January with 2,705 respondents who were based in Singapore. Commenting on the findings, Mr Sim Gim Guan, executive director of the Singapore National Employers Federation, said there could be two possible reasons why a high percentage of respondents indicated they plan to change employers. First, there were more than two job vacancies for every job seeker at the end of 2021, and as the Singapore economy reopens, there will be even more job opportunities available. The chance of finding another job is higher in a tight labour market, Mr Sim said. ""Second, there may also be 'pent-up' resignations in the first half of 2022 as employees may have delayed their plans to switch jobs over the past year, when the economy was still facing uncertainties,"" added Mr Sim. He said the actual resignation rate could be lower as their employers may be able to resolve the issues that caused employees to think of resigning. For example, the employer may be willing to offer suitable flexible work arrangement to someone who needs it. If the salary was an issue, employers could redesign jobs to improve productivity so that they can afford to pay higher salaries, Mr Sim added. Mr Alvin Goh, executive director of the Singapore Human Resources Institute, said that overall, he was not surprised that more employees are on the lookout for better career opportunities. ""With greater clarity and as we move from pandemic to endemic, economic activities around the world have picked up tremendously... Most are now moving towards hiring full-time staff rather than contracts,"" said Mr Goh."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/9-key-actions-proposed-in-policy-paper-to-transform-services-sector-and-address-manpower-crunch,9 key actions proposed in policy paper to transform service sector and address manpower crunch,"SINGAPORE - Addressing the dire manpower crunch in the service sector and the need to transform it and promote sustainable growth, the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) has proposed several actions in a policy paper published on Thursday (May 12). These include reviewing the foreign workforce quota in the service sector and collaborative efforts to allow firms access to a diverse pool of workers from various backgrounds who may be keen on service roles, such as current safe distancing ambassadors. Talent, teamwork and rules are three critical factors needed to promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth in the service sector, the policy paper said. Nine key actions - three under each factor - to tackle the present and future manpower needs of the sector can be undertaken by businesses, trade associations and chambers, government agencies, unions, and post-secondary educational institutions collaboratively. Specific policy suggestions under each action include moves frequently mooted by businesses, such as different methods of deriving a foreign workforce quota compared with manufacturing and construction. Other suggestions include stepping up existing government policies, such as encouraging more local and international firms at the forefront of their industries to become ""queen bees"" that advise small and medium-sized enterprises on the skills needed for business transformation - a scheme already put in place by SkillsFuture Singapore. Elaborating on what each factor means, SBF said talent refers to allowing access to a diverse pool of workers from various backgrounds that firms can select from, while teamwork entails a synergistic effort to improve manpower utilisation and allocation, and rules mean a more targeted and nuanced manpower policy approach. The paper, titled The Human Touch: Balancing Manpower Resilience With Productivity For Transformation, was developed in close consultation with eight trade associations, said SBF in a statement on Thursday. The actions needed relate to the present and future manpower needs of the lifestyle, environmental, and estate and facilities management services industries that the eight trade associations represent. These include the retail, hotel, waste management and recycling, as well as landscaping sectors, among others. ""The reopening of borders and resumption of tourism, social, and business activities is an opportunity for companies in the service industries to scale up and tap the demand resurgence for growth,"" said SBF. However, the tight manpower situation, a perennial struggle of the industry now magnified by pent-up demand outpacing how fast businesses can get back in gear as restrictions ease, has impacted operations, service levels and waiting times. SBF added: ""There is an urgent need to recalibrate manpower supply in the services industries to enable companies to operate at optimal capacity, so as to deliver the level of service that Singaporeans and (foreign) visitors expect. ""Addressing the manpower crunch will also help companies to plan ahead for growth and transformation."" In the paper, the SBF noted that although the reopening of borders will facilitate the inflow of foreign labour to support burgeoning demand, the ability to take on foreign manpower is constrained by the ability to grow the local workforce. For instance, The Straits Times reported early last month that some food and beverage outlets could not find sufficient local workers, which then affected the number of foreign workers they could hire. ""Many businesses in lifestyle services are currently operating below capacity, and will not be able to move to full capacity without the requisite manpower, such as wait staff to support longer opening hours or hospitality attendants to turn over rooms expediently,"" said the SBF. Restaurant Association of Singapore president Andrew Kwan said: ""In the longer-term, manpower policies will need to reflect the changing structure of the resident labour force with the growing affluence of households and higher educational qualifications of the younger workforce.""   The policy paper published by the Singapore Business Federation on Thursday covered sectors within the service industry that have faced a manpower crunch even before the Covid-19 pandemic. Eight trade associations worked closely with the federation on the paper. The associations are: - Environmental Management Association of Singapore - Landscape Industry Association (Singapore) - Restaurant Association of Singapore - Security Association Singapore - Singapore Hotel Association - Singapore Nightlife Business Association - Singapore Retailers Association - Waste Management and Recycling Association of Singapore  The paper proposed three actions for each critical success factor - talent, teamwork and rules - to overcome transient and perennial challenges. Talent: A diverse pool of players for firms to select from - The tripartite partners - the Government, unions and employers - to actively coordinate the redeployment of workforce from pandemic-related operations to lifestyle services. - Businesses to enhance the attractiveness of jobs in lifestyle services, environmental services, and estate and facilities management services. - Businesses and trade associations and chambers (TACs) to work with the National Trades Union Congress and post-secondary education institutions to strengthen workplace training and upskilling efforts Teamwork: A synergistic effort to improve manpower utilisation and allocation - TACs to facilitate cross-sector collaboration to achieve higher operational efficiency and better resource allocation. - Businesses to step up as ""queen bees"" to advise small and medium enterprises on the skills needed for business transformation, such as in branding, internationalisation and digitalisation. - Businesses to optimise estate and facilities management resources through contracts with measurable performance outcomes. Rules: A more targeted and nuanced manpower policy approach - Tripartite partners to work together to review the broad classifications of business activity, in particular for services, for purposes of manpower policies. - Tripartite partners to work together to review expansion of the list of occupations that can draw foreign workers from non-traditional source countries, as well as diversifying the list of non-traditional source countries. - The Government to support access to international students and recent graduates enrolled in training programmes related to the lifestyle, environmental, and estates and facilities management services."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/asean-in-good-position-to-seize-major-shifts-in-future-of-work-dpm-heng,Asean in good position to seize major shifts in future of work: DPM Heng,"SINGAPORE - Asean is in a good position to contribute to, as well as benefit from, major shifts affecting the future of work such as the green transition, digitalisation and resilience of supply chains, said Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat. “The future of work is intrinsically linked to the future economy,” he said, speaking virtually at the hybrid HR Tech Festival Asia 2022 and the opening of the Asean Future of Work Conference on Thursday (May 12). For instance, South-east Asia can be alternative bases for advanced manufacturing to strengthen supply chain resilience. The region's blue carbon stock also has potential to create nature-based solutions for carbon removal. DPM Heng added that there is a need for countries to ride the next skills wave to take advantage of these new business opportunities. While computer science and digital skills are part of the first wave, the next wave comprises green skills. ""In the past decade, the digital wave came upon us in a big way. The digital economy is now a key engine of growth,"" he said, adding that numerous digital tech companies have emerged, creating many good jobs and occupations, some of which were previously unheard of. Many hawkers and micro-enterprises have also gone digital, showing how digital skills are now foundational to many jobs. Countries should now seize the emerging green wave, said DPM Heng. ""Sustainability is an emerging engine of growth that is taking on greater momentum, and much more still needs to be done before countries can meet their net zero goals."" Just like digital literacy, green literacy may become a foundational skill for jobs of the future, with more green-collar jobs being created in more mature fields, such as sustainable finance and solar management. There are also green-collar jobs being created in emerging areas such as hydrogen and tidewater architecture. Green skills will continue to be defined and developed in the coming years, said DPM Heng, and it may be some time before a wider range of training pathways and appropriate salary premiums settle. To ride the different industry waves, stakeholders like companies, workers and governments need to work in collaboration, he added. The workforce will also need to collectively adapt to the changing construct of work, with evolving social norms and preferences of workers as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. While flexible workplaces are now here to stay, arriving at a hybrid work environment will require supervisors to ensure that business outcomes are not compromised and that such arrangements are not abused, said DPM Heng. ""To transition well, there needs to be mutual understanding, and some give and take between employers and workers... the shift towards greater flexible work arrangements will take time, and some iteration,"" he added. Protection and social security will also have to be improved for platform workers, whose numbers have increased significantly due to the boom in e-commerce and food delivery. For young job seekers, career guidance has to be strengthened, said DPM Heng. ""We will need to help them look beyond the more attractive take-home pay in the near term, and explore other pathways that could better nurture their skills and provide better livelihoods in the longer term,"" he said. The Asean Future Of Work Conference is now in its third run, and took place as part of the HR Tech Festival Asia, which started on Tuesday and will run till Friday. Speakers from regional governments, unions and the private sector took part in panel discussions on current work-related topics, such as the adoption of artificial intelligence, flexible work arrangements and the strengthening of labour protection for platform workers like delivery workers, private-hire car drivers and taxi drivers. The platform economy has grown significantly due in part to a boom in e-commerce and food delivery, said DPM Heng, underscoring the need to improve platform workers’ protection and social security. Dr Uma Rani, senior economist at the research department of the International Labour Organisation, said there are platforms that classify their workers as self-employed, even though they should be classified as employees. She was speaking at a panel discussion on strengthening labour protection for platform workers. “Because of that classification, a lot of labour and social protection benefits are not accrued to the platform workers,” she said.  Ms Yeo Wan Ling, director of NTUC U Women and Family and U SME, said there is also a need to ensure that employees get fair consideration for promotions and bonuses, even with flexible work arrangements. “Hopefully, through advocacy and tripartite partnerships with employers and the Ministry of Manpower, we can come up with more clarity for guidelines for measurements and key performance indicators to ensure fair treatment,” said Ms Yeo during a panel discussion on successful flexible work arrangements."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/new-career-conversion-programme-for-hr-professionals-to-launch-in-june,Career conversion programme for HR professionals to launch,"SINGAPORE - A career conversion programme for human resources (HR) professionals will launch this June, imparting them emerging skills including HR analytics, strategic workforce planning and knowledge in HR technology. Senior Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad announced on Tuesday (May 10) that statutory board Workforce Singapore will start the new Career Conversion Programme for Human Capital Professionals next month. He was giving his opening address at the HR Tech Festival Asia industry exhibition at Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre. The new initiative is the latest addition to a suite of more than 100 such programmes spearheaded by Workforce Singapore to promote lifelong learning and allow Singaporean workers to pursue new opportunities and aspirations midway in their careers. Mr Zaqy said: ""The (career conversion programme) for human capital is a follow-up measure to the... HR Jobs Transformation Map, which studied the impact of technology and mapped out HR's shift to deliver higher value work. ""It aims to reskill HR professionals for more strategic roles such as HR data analysts and people strategists."" The Singapore National Employers Federation and continuing education and training provider NTUC LearningHub will manage the programme, with know-how contributed by the Institute for Human Resource Professionals (IHRP). The new programme will pioneer a format that promises to be less disruptive for workers. Unlike many of the more than 100 existing career conversion programmes, which require a participant to take on a job at another company or go for work attachment without a guarantee of a job placement, an HR professional in the programme can receive training for a redesigned HR role in the company that employs him. The partners running the programme will assist the employer to redesign a participant's role. Mr Zaqy noted in his speech that more than 80 companies had expressed interest to place about 150 employees in the programme. Speaking to The Straits Times, IHRP chief executive Mayank Parekh said that a 2020 study by the institute on the impact of technology on HR functions catalysed discussions within the three-way, or tripartite, partnership between the Government, employers and unions. ""And when you look at HR function-specific jobs, there were a set of jobs that was going to be heavily impacted."" Giving an example, Mr Parekh said: ""You may not need HR to answer employee queries if you have a chatbot. ""So there is going to be a sector or a set of HR professionals that will have to reskill... and continue to be employable and this is the target for the conversion."" He also said the tripartite partners wanted to use the HR sector as a testbed to find out how to accelerate the reskilling and redesigning of jobs. He added that the emphasis on redesigning jobs, as well as keeping workers in their original company, was a preference that emerged from discussions among the tripartite partners and employer feedback. In his speech, Mr Zaqy also announced that the Government will work with the IHRP and the Singapore Human Resources Institute to familiarise the HR community with the new points-based framework for employment pass approvals, among other assessment tools. This will be done through advisories and workshops and details will be released later, he added. ""Now as we step out of the pandemic, there is no better time to refresh and reimagine HR strategies as employees return to a redefined workplace, as firms rehire, in tandem with economic recovery,"" said Mr Zaqy. The HR Tech Festival Asia industry exhibition, which adopts a hybrid format, is on at Hall 403 in the Suntec convention centre on May 10 and virtually till May 13."

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/mom-wsh-council-and-ntuc-urge-firms-to-take-safety-time-out-after-10-workplace-deaths-in-april,Firms urged to take safety time-out after 10 workplace deaths in April,"SINGAPORE - Companies are being urged to impose a safety time-out from Monday (May 9), on the back of a spate of workplace fatalities across several sectors. They should use the time to review safety management systems and learn from past accidents, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council, National Trades Union Congress and industry partners, in a joint statement on Sunday. There were 10 workplace fatalities last month, bringing the total number of workplace deaths in 2022 to 20 - the highest number of fatalities for the same period since 2016. Each time-out involves a firm taking a pause from work so that senior management can engage workers and unions on WSH processes, and act on any issues that may arise. Firms should also review risk assessments, and ensure that workers implement risk controls as well as have WSH training relevant to their roles. Companies have also been asked to familiarise workers with learning points from recent fatal accidents and sensitise them to hazardous situations, to avoid a repeat of these accidents. The safety time-out is expected to last two weeks, and will have two focus areas. The first is working safely at heights, which includes working on fragile surfaces and the use of ladders. The second is the safe use of equipment such as forklifts. Responding to queries, the WSH Council said there is no fixed duration for time-outs, but the council is recommending that companies hold their time-out within two weeks from Monday as it wants them to take swift action.  “We also want to avoid a situation where companies hold their time-out towards the end date if the (time-out window) is longer... and an accident happens in the meantime,” it said. The council added that time-outs are not enforceable and are meant to be industry-led. Firms can decide how long they will pause for, and on what basis they may resume work, said the council. Seven industry associations will be taking part in the time-out. They are: the Association of Process Industry, Association of Property and Facility Managers, Association of Singapore Marine Industries, Singapore Contractors Association Limited (Scal), Singapore International Facility Management Association, Singapore Logistics Association and Singapore Manufacturing Federation (SMF). Following the safety time-out, employees should be briefed on findings and on any improvements that will be implemented. The statement said: ""Of the 20 fatal cases in 2022 so far, it is very concerning that seven of them were similar in nature to cases that occurred in 2021."" Three cases involved forklifts, two involved falls from ladders and two involved falls through fragile surfaces. The statement added: ""Preliminary investigations revealed that a common factor among these fatalities was that basic safety and health control measures - such as wearing of seat belts in forklifts or fall protection gear while working at heights - were either inadequate or not in place at all. ""Lives would have been saved if these well-established control measures were taken."" NTUC assistant secretary-general Melvin Yong said in a Facebook post on Sunday that workplace safety should not take a backseat amid the rush to catch up on work that was delayed by prolonged pandemic restrictions. “Each loss of life is one too many. To the families affected, it is everything to them,” he said, urging all unionised companies to hold a safety time-out. WSH Council chairman John Ng said it is alarming and unfortunate that a number of this year's fatal cases involved basic safety lapses. Mr Silas Sng, WSH commissioner and divisional director of MOM's Occupational Safety and Health Division, said: ""Performing work activities that are routine and repetitive does not guarantee that accidents will not happen. ""We need all employers and employees to take WSH seriously and personally, and to implement the WSH measures before an accident occurs in your workplace."" Meanwhile, Scal WSH sub-committee chairman Yong Jian Rong said the association has called for immediate action from its members in response to the latest safety time-out. Separately, the association has been encouraging its members to take four planned time-outs per year, he said. Mr Yong noted that WSH in the construction industry has improved over the years, but added that accidents show that there is always room for improvement. SMF acting president Ryan Chioh said that the federation has sent a customised message to its members, which includes guides on what to do during a time-out. To encourage participation, the federation will profile members who have conducted the time-out, and share this with others.
  At the end of May, the WSH Council will also organise a safety time-out forum that will be broadcast on its Facebook page. Learning points from recent cases will be discussed, along with presentations by experts from various industries who will focus on topics such as the use of forklifts, use of ladders, working around fragile surfaces, and how to board vessels properly. The statement said that despite the worrying spate of incidents, Singapore’s workplace fatality rate over the years has decreased, from 2.3 per 100,00 workers in 2011 to 1.1 in 2021. “This is close to world-class standards, with only four OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries achieving a fatality rate of less than 1 per 100,000 workers,” it added. Companies may access safety time-out tips and other resources at this website."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/better-wages-in-aviation-within-24-months-labour-shortage-to-ease-this-year-ng-chee-meng,"S'pore's aviation sector to see better pay, more jobs: Ng Chee Meng","SINGAPORE - Aviation workers can look forward to better wages and work prospects within the next 12 to 24 months, as the sector picks up momentum, buoyed by the easing of global travel curbs that sought to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) secretary-general Ng Chee Meng expressed his hopes for the rebound of the hard-hit sector to continue during a May Day appreciation event for aviation workers organised by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) on Saturday (May 7). Mr Ng's comments come as employers in the sector, together with the CAAS and employee unions, are pulling out all the stops to ramp up manpower to support the increase in air passenger traffic in the coming months. This includes a job fair on May 27 and 28, which will see over 20 participating aviation companies engage job seekers and students on a range of job opportunities ranging from service, operations and engineering to new careers in technology and sustainability, said the CAAS in a statement after the event. Speaking to the media at the sidelines of the appreciation event, which was held at a canteen for aviation workers located in Changi Airport, Mr Ng said he was glad that flights have begun to come in with increasing frequency, after a tumultuous two years. He also said aviation workers now face a ""happy problem"" arising from the recovery, as they are ""somewhat stretched and overworked"" amid a labour shortage, which he estimated would take the sector three to six more months to recover from. Added Mr Ng: ""(When) we welcome the return of workers, I think we will have better opportunities for better businesses, and I think the aviation outlook will be so much brighter."" Mr Ng also noted that various support programmes are in place to help workers and position Singapore as an air hub. For instance, the One AirHub Community support group on messaging application Telegram is an initiative supported by the 10 unions that constitute the aviation and aerospace cluster of the NTUC. A group of 70 CAAS officers also formed a group called Friends for Aviation to support aviation workers who bore the brunt of stringent safe management measures back in June last year. In the same month it was formed, the group arranged a donation drive to give ez-link cards worth $50 each to 1,000 aviation front-line workers - especially vulnerable workers like cleaners and trolley handlers - after a Covid-19 cluster was detected at Changi Airport last May. ""We thought we could do something small, (to) just... put together some goodie bags, (and) some activities to bring some cheer to the workers,"" said Friends For Aviation co-founder Angela Ng, who is also a deputy director in CAAS' aviation industry division. ""They are a bit unseen and unheard but they are very, very critical to the running of the airport,"" she added. Ms Ng said the group wishes to continue to bring cheer to fellow airport workers, even as air traffic approaches pre-Covid-19 numbers. In fact, CAAS and the group will provide 3,000 meals and 3,000 goodie bags this week to thank aviation workers for working during the May Day-Hari Raya Puasa long weekend to support the rise in traffic. Also at the event were Mr Chee Hong Tat, Senior Minister of State for Transport and NTUC deputy secretary-general; CAAS chairman Edmund Cheng and the chief executives of Changi Airport Group, dnata, Sats and SIA Engineering Company. In its statement, the CAAS also said the job fair, titled OneAviation Careers, will be held at Suntec City Convention Centre. Organised by the civil aviation authority in partnership with the Employment and Employability Institute, NTUC and statutory board Workforce Singapore, participating firms include Singapore Airlines, airport services firm Sats, ground handler dnata, Changi Airport Group and Rolls Royce. Job seekers will be able to sign up for on-site interviews conducted by employers at the event. The event is part of a spate of good news that indicate a resurgent sector in recent months and beyond. According to the CAAS, air passenger volume hit almost 40 per cent of pre-Covid-19 figures in end-April, more than double the figures seen the previous month, as Singapore's borders were reopened to all vaccinated travellers from April 1. The basic salaries of Singapore Airlines pilots, which were first cut in the early stages of the pandemic, will also be gradually restored to pre-Covid-19 levels by next January as demand for air travel returns with the reopening of borders around the world."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/flexible-work-arrangements-gig-work-among-issues-tripartism-must-tackle-panel,Flexible work arrangements key to future: Tan See Leng,"SINGAPORE - Flexible work arrangements are the way forward, especially as they help more women and mature workers participate in the labour force, said Manpower Minister Tan See Leng at a panel discussion on Friday (May 6). He also spoke about the future of the gig economy and how it can include more diverse jobs. Dr Tan participated in a panel discussion held in conjunction with the launch of the Tripartite Collective at Parkroyal Collection Marina Bay hotel. The collective facilitates the exchange of ideas on issues faced by employers and employees. It also hopes to foster the spirit of tripartism in Singapore - that is, collaboration among the Government, employers and the labour union. Regarding the future of work, Dr Tan said: ""I think the next key disruption is going to be flexible work arrangements. The Manpower Ministry, together with the tripartite partners, has developed these standards. We hope that everyone will support this and eventually, in about a year from now, we... will be able to come up with some guidelines."" Flexible arrangements are also a good way to bring more people into the workforce, such as women with caregiving responsibilities and mature workers, he said. He noted that there are about 260,000 women aged 25 to 64 and 120,000 residents aged 65 to 69 who are outside the labour force. ""So if you add the two groups together with an emboldened, enlightened and optimised flexible work arrangement, we have potentially close to 400,000 people coming back to the workforce. Think about how that will power our economy and our industries,"" he said. Fellow panellist Robert Yap, who is president of the Singapore National Employers Federation, added that there are many forms of flexible work arrangements, and that everyone has to be open and innovative in the way they are carried out. Labour chief Ng Chee Meng noted that as a big employer, NTUC also co-created policies around flexible work arrangements, even as all workers are allowed to return to the workplace. Meanwhile, Ninja Van chief executive Lai Chang Wen said returning to the office is still vital for building relationships between people. ""One of the simpler things we've done is having everyone come to the office at a fixed time. Once (coming to the office) becomes too flexible, people are never certain who's in, and you lose that interaction. We have no clock-off time. You can come for an hour and then go home,"" he said. The panel also discussed the possibilities of gig work and the challenges it poses. Dr Tan said: ""The gig economy is seeing massive growth. One very optimistic thought is that the gig economy will go beyond logistics and transportation... it should transcend boundaries and borders where there are opportunities for a particular professional role or corporate advisory role. I see that as a very positive development."" He also noted that the issue of gig workers provides an opportunity for tripartism. He added that the tripartite members have come together to study the challenges of self-employed platform workers and see how to improve their rights. NTUC president Mary Liew said there are more than 48,000 self-employed people who are now union members. At an earlier panel in the same event, former Manpower Minister Lim Swee Say said: ""All three of us cannot live without each other. If any one of us thinks that we can solve the problems of the world all on our own, then tripartism will break down... ""What has brought us to where we are today is that we are pro-business, pro-workers and pro-future."" Mr Lim, who is also adviser to the new Tripartite Collective, said that what sets Singapore apart is the tripartite desire not just to survive, but also to build capacity so everyone can emerge stronger from times of crisis. It is not about compromising, but harmonising to create a win-win situation for the Government, employers and workers, he added. A report on tripartism presented at the event noted that such cooperation helped Singapore to navigate the Covid-19 pandemic, by supporting firms and helping them redeploy workers. But it added that challenges remain, such as an increasingly diverse workforce that includes gig workers and technological acceleration that can displace more workers. Still, tripartism remains a key enabler in facing the difficulties that lie ahead, such as rising prices and supply chain disruptions, said Minister of State for Manpower Gan Siow Huang in her closing speech. ""There is shared purpose, shared mission, shared values, and all of us moving towards a common direction,"" she added."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/six-in-10-in-singapore-prepared-to-request-pay-rise-amid-labour-crunch-inflation,"6 in 10 in S'pore plan to ask for pay rise amid labour crunch, inflation: Survey","SINGAPORE - Workers in Singapore have high expectations of being given a pay rise and are ready to push their employers to get it, as costs of living increase amid a sharp labour crunch. Human resources services company ADP said on Thursday (May 5) its annual People At Work report found six in 10 workers in Singapore are prepared to request a raise. The figure rises to seven in 10 for workers aged between 25 and 34, added ADP, which surveyed more than 1,400 workers in Singapore last November as part of a worldwide survey of almost 33,000 across 17 countries for the latest edition of the report. This explores the attitudes employees hold towards work and their hopes for their workplace in future. ADP, which is headquartered in the United States, said more than three-quarters of workers globally say they are likely to ask for a pay rise if they feel they deserve one. The findings come at a time when Singapore faces record vacancies in the job market, with a high of 114,000 job vacancies last December, more than double the figure of 53,000 in December 2020, as companies struggle to fill positions to keep up with pent-up demand, particularly for the services sector. ADP noted: ""Globally, the cost of living is rising rapidly in many parts of the world amid high global inflation, which is expected to remain elevated for some time, and (it follows) two years of pandemic-related disruption to jobs."" In its statement, ADP also said around five in 10 workers in Singapore expect to get a pay rise in the next 12 months and more than four in 10 expect to be given a bonus. ""This is despite only a third expecting to be given a promotion or any increased responsibility."" The company said one reason that workers may feel they deserve a pay rise is the number of extra hours of unpaid work many of them are doing, by starting early, staying late, or working over breaks. Four in 10 workers in Singapore reported feeling they put in between six and 10 hours of unpaid overtime work each week, said ADP. Workers surveyed in Singapore reported working unpaid overtime of eight hours on average. Globally, ADP also found pay to be the most important factor to workers in a job, with almost two-thirds saying it is a priority, followed by job security (54 per cent), flexibility over working hours (33 per cent) and enjoyment of their work (32 per cent). In Singapore, respondents place a higher-than-average importance on pay, with 71 per cent of respondents considering pay the most important factor, said ADP. ""Having worked hard through the pandemic and with more vacancies than job seekers in the current job market, many workers feel they need - and are entitled to - a raise,"" said Ms Yvonne Teo, Asia-Pacific vice-president of human resources at ADP. ""Employers should bear this in mind in today's tight labour market, where maintaining a stable and skilled workforce is paramount yet more challenging than ever."" Added Ms Teo: ""Employers have to reconcile the drive for higher wages with business continuity. ""Financial incentives alone are unsustainable in the long term and compensation can only get talent through the door. ""In addition to paying competitively and fairly, employee retention depends on many other factors."" Beyond pay, factors that can affect employee retention include the relationships that they have developed with their colleagues and the alignment of a company’s goals and objectives with employees’ personal interests and aspirations, noted Mr Mayank Parekh, chief executive of the Institute for Human Resource Professionals. He said companies often make salary adjustments to retain people with critical skills that are in short supply, while factoring in changes to the costs of living as measured by the consumer price index. He added that employers can handle employees’ requests for salary raises by having clear pay, promotion and staff development policies. “For example, pay scales for different levels should be made transparent so that individual employees have a clear understanding of their position within a range and the pace of salary progression based on seniority, performance and skill acquisition. “There should also be clear policies on promotion and internal access to job opportunities through development programmes.” Whether employers need more time to find their footing as Singapore recovers from Covid-19 before they can raise wages depends on the employers’ business performance and prospects, said Mr Sim Gim Guan, executive director of the Singapore National Employers Federation. “We also have to keep in mind that the loss in revenues in the past two years for industries like hospitality and aviation were deadweight, since they cannot sell the rooms and seats that were not filled previously, unlike some products that could make up some of the loss in revenues due to pent-up demand. “Hence, their recovery may take longer than what their employees experience on the ground, since employees can see business picking up.”"

Many veterinary nurses do not see being a nurse as a viable career path, as it has little progression and pay,"" said Dr Chow Haoting, president of the Singapore Veterinary Association (SVA). The survey findings were released as part of a veterinary sector review update on Saturday (April 30) during the 13th edition of Pets' Day Out. Minister of State for National Development Tan Kiat How, who was the guest of honour at the event, said more than half of the close to 400 respondents felt that vet paraprofessionals, such as vet technicians and nurses, could be better recognised, and have better career progression and development opportunities. Almost all had called for regular reviews of professional standards for veterinarians and for them to be benchmarked against those of other developed countries. They also want the promotion of lifelong learning for the profession. The survey was conducted by the Animal & Veterinary Service (AVS) and the SVA in early 2021 across the veterinary sector. Mr Tan said that after focus group discussions with industry players, several key areas have been identified for further study. These included the need to better define the scope of veterinary activities, recognise the critical role of vets and vet paraprofessionals, uphold professional standards, and encourage continuing education in the profession. A suggestion for the formation of a veterinary professional body will also be looked at. Dr Chang Siow Foong, group director of AVS, added that better clarity on the scope of regulated veterinary activities would mean ensuring that only a trained person can perform proper veterinary-related tasks. ""This is to protect the health and welfare of the animals in Singapore by making sure they are being taken care of by trained personnel,"" said Dr Chang. Dr Chow said the SVA is hoping that the recognition and standards of veterinary nurses can be improved with the review. ""We are working closely with multiple stakeholders to upgrade the skills of veterinary nurses to justify a higher wage and develop a sustainable career progression,"" he added. AVS said it will continue to engage stakeholders and consider their views and feedback. It will share its recommendations over the coming months. Saturday's event, which also celebrated World Veterinary Day, was held at Jurong Lake Gardens. Pets' Day Out, which started in August 2019 and is held once every two months, serves as a platform for animal welfare groups, professionals, businesses, veterinarians and pet lovers to come together. Mr Tan also launched the book Vets At Work, produced by SVA with AVS and other partners. It highlights the history of SVA and the significant contributions that Singapore's veterinary professionals have made to society over the years. ""Many in the veterinary community have shared with me how veterinary work is meaningful and fulfilling. We look forward to our vets' contributions in advancing the frontiers of veterinary science, animal health and welfare,"" said Mr Tan."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/retrenchments-hit-24-year-record-low-in-q1-of-this-year-mom,Retrenchments hit 24-year record low in Q1 amid tight labour market: MOM,"SINGAPORE - Retrenchments in Singapore hit a record low of 1,300 in the first quarter of this year amid a tight labour market, according to advance estimates published by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Thursday (April 28). The figure, which is the lowest since MOM began to collect its current series of retrenchment data in 1998, translates to six retrenched for every 10,000 employees. This is a far cry from the more than 9,000 retrenchments seen in the third quarter of 2020 at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw the service sector hit the hardest as Singaporeans stayed home and tourist numbers dropped drastically amid curbs on nightlife, dining out and foreign travel. Employers surveyed by MOM attributed most of the retrenchments, which are down from 1,500 in the previous quarter, to reorganisation or restructuring, said the ministry in a statement accompanying the results. Of the 1,300, 700 were retrenched in the service sector, 500 in manufacturing and 100 in construction. While retrenchments in the service sector declined for the sixth consecutive quarter, retrenchments in construction and manufacturing saw a moderate rise from the fourth quarter of last year - from 280 to 500 for manufacturing, and from 40 to 100 for construction. MOM also said in its statement that the labour market report for the first quarter of this year is due for release in mid-June, and will provide more details, including job re-entry rates among retrenched residents, among other information, to give a fuller picture of employment trends in Singapore for the quarter. Independent human resources consultant Adrian Tan said the decline in retrenchments in the service sector reflects its recovery amid the lifting of group size restrictions and curbs on incoming travel, among other eased measures. “Domestically, we have entered the last phase of Covid-19, and there is pent-up demand in sectors like hospitality,” said Mr Tan. He added that the rise in retrenchments in both the construction and manufacturing sectors could be due to supply chain disruptions for raw materials and parts, leading to delayed projects. “Unlike services, manufacturing and construction require a lot of inventory.
“Projects delayed would have a detrimental effect... (when businesses) miss their projections, they may cut costs by retrenching workers.” The effect of supply chain disruptions on retrenchments in both sectors could also be worsened by high inflation, and increasing commodity prices amid the war in Ukraine, he added. “It is an unfortunate situation, (that these)...  things affect construction and manufacturing the worst at once.” In a Facebook post, Mr Desmond Choo, National Trades Union Congress' assistant secretary-general, said the tight labour market is good for workers to recover from lost income or slower pace of wage growth due to the slowdown caused by Covid-19. “This will help buffer our workers from higher costs of living too,” he said. However, Mr Choo said that structural changes in technology and business processes are evident from the latest data, citing information technology and digital services driving resident employment growth as an example. “It is important for workers to persist in acquiring new skills to keep up with such changes.” Mr Choo, who is a Tampines GRC MP, said: “This is still the better security against global conflicts and supply chain crunch.” He also said those who require help could approach staff at the Employment and Employability Institute or check out the institute’s virtual career fairs.  "
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/singapore-steps-up-hiring-of-foreign-labour-in-q1-as-it-gradually-reopens-borders,Employers move to tackle labour crunch as border curbs ease ,"SINGAPORE - Faced with a manpower crunch, employers are stepping up their hiring of foreign labour in the construction sector as Singapore peels back Covid-19 border curbs. Non-resident employment picked up pace in the first quarter of this year, mainly driven by the hiring of work permit holders in the construction sector, according to advance estimates released by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Thursday (April 28). The ministry said this hiring of non-resident workers formed the bulk of Singapore's total employment growth in the first quarter. ""With the progressive lifting of border restrictions, the increase in non-resident employment was significantly greater than that of resident employment, as employers replenished their non-resident workforce,"" it added. Overall, Singapore's labour market continued its recovery in the first quarter, with total employment - excluding migrant domestic workers - expanding by 41,100. While this was slightly lower than the fourth quarter of last year, where total employment grew by 47,900, MOM said there remains ""a robust pace of growth"". For resident employment, trends were mixed across sectors. Outward-oriented sectors registered steady resident employment growth. Information and communications, for instance, saw strong demand for IT and digital solutions, while growth in the financial services was in part driven by activities such as security dealing and payments processing. In contrast, resident employment declined in domestic-facing sectors such as food and beverage services, retail trade and accommodation, highlighted the report. These sectors typically observe employment declines following seasonal hiring for the year-end festive period in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, unemployment figures held steady last month, after returning to pre-Covid-19 levels in February. The overall unemployment rate edged up slightly to 2.2 per cent last month, from 2.1 in February. However, the resident unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3 per cent, as did the citizen unemployment rate, at 3.2 per cent. The report also showed that retrenchments hit a record low of 1,300 - or 0.6 retrenched per 1,000 employees - in the first quarter, amid a tight labour market. Employers attributed most of the retrenchments to reorganisation or restructuring efforts, said MOM. More details will be shared in the fuller first quarter report in June. In the coming months, non-resident employment is expected to continue its recover with the further easing of border measures, said MOM. Resident employment is likely to see modest growth, while the resident unemployment rate is expected to stay low, it added. Manpower Minister Tan See Leng said in a Facebook post on Thursday that the economy was expected to continue improving and drive demand for workers.  The significant relaxation of border measures from this month “should alleviate some of the labour market tightness, especially for employers who are more dependent on work permit holders,” he added.  Observers believe hiring is bound to rise even more in the second quarter, especially in the construction, marine shipyard and process sectors, which have had to deal with scarce labour and delayed projects.  Dr David Leong, managing director of PeopleWorldwide Consulting, said: “Where we stand now, the hiring horizon looks promising, and workers must swing back into a new normality.” However, the downside risks to economic growth have increased due to global economic unpredictability arising from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, protracted supply disruptions, monetary policy tightening in advanced economies, and continued uncertainty over the trajectory of the Covid-19 pandemic, said MOM.  “These factors could affect business sentiments and profitability and, in turn, labour demand,” it added.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/tripartite-model-key-to-helping-workers-adapt-to-post-pandemic-changes-tan-see-leng,Tripartite model key to helping workers adapt to post-pandemic changes: Tan See Leng,"SINGAPORE - At the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, many countries experienced strikes and work stoppages, but employers and workers here came through the last two years more united without excessive regulation or litigation, said Manpower Minister Tan See Leng on Wednesday (April 27). This is the result of the strong three-way partnership among employers, workers and the Government, and this tripartite model will enable the partners to help workers adapt to changes brought about by the pandemic, said the minister in his annual May Day message. ""Globally, we see a shift in employer and employee preferences for flexible work arrangements,"" said Dr Tan, adding: ""This is why the tripartite partners will continue our efforts to support employers and workers to transition to such new modes of work."" The Ministry of Manpower (MOM), National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and Singapore National Employers Federation are committed to cover at least four in 10 workers under the Tripartite Standard on Flexible Work Arrangements by the year end, Dr Tan noted. The standard refers to a set of flexible work arrangements employers are recommended to implement, including offering flexi-work to employees and appraising these workers fairly. The partners will also work together to implement the recommendations of the Tripartite Workgroup on Lower-wage Workers, by expanding the Progressive Wage Model to more sectors and occupations, to cover up to nine in 10 lower-wage workers. ""We will ensure that no worker is left behind,"" said Dr Tan, adding that the progressive wage approach allows sustainable growth for both workers and businesses. The model is a ladder that sets out minimum pay and training requirements for workers at different skill levels. It currently covers local workers in licensed or registered firms in the security, cleaning and landscaping sectors. Between September this year and July next year, it will be expanded to the retail, food services and waste management sectors, as well as administrators and drivers next March. In his message, Dr Tan also noted that an advisory committee on platform workers, comprising representatives from the Government, labour movement, industry and academia, is reviewing how to strengthen employment protections and ensure a more balanced relationship between workers and platforms. Platform workers - mostly delivery workers, cabbies and private-hire car drivers - are those who rely on online platforms for their income. The minister added that the committee has reached out to over 20,000 platform workers, and the committee continues to shape its recommendations to improve their well-being. Dr Tan did not say when the committee would be presenting its recommendations. It was previously reported that the committee, formed after last year's National Day Rally, is looking at improving housing and retirement adequacy, providing financial protection in the event of work injury, and strengthening representation for these workers. Meanwhile, the Tripartite Committee on Workplace Fairness is working on enshrining the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices in law. ""It will send a strong signal that we do not tolerate workplace discrimination of any form, and broaden the range of actions that can be taken in the event of a breach,"" said Dr Tan. In his message, Dr Tan also thanked the National Wages Council, which is celebrating its 50th year, for convening four times in two years to provide timely guidance for businesses, while balancing the interests of both employers and workers. The tripartite national wage body, which normally meets annually, met in March and August 2020, as well as April and September last year, to formulate wage guidelines to minimise retrenchments amid the pandemic, even if temporary wage cuts were required. Said Dr Tan: ""As the labour movement expands its membership base and works towards its target of 1.5 million members by 2030, we can look forward to further entrenching the spirit of tripartism in our economy. ""We are confident that with the close cooperation between NTUC and employers, and with MOM standing ever ready to render support, we can build a resilient Singapore for everyone."""

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/spore-workers-want-bosses-to-listen-to-their-flexi-work-needs-ips-survey,S'pore workers want bosses to meet their flexi-work needs: IPS survey,"SINGAPORE- Whether it is work from home or return to the office - and for how many or on which days - Singapore workers would like employers to listen, communicate and adjust new work arrangements to suit their preferences. And if employers insist that they trot into the office on most days, those who feel strongly about having flexibility in how they work are inclined to find a new job. The findings, released on Monday (April 25) by the Institute of Policy Studies, reveal how workers' feelings towards their work routines have shifted towards autonomy amid the pandemic. The study was done over nine months, tracking respondents from July last year.  The results reinforced calls from the tripartite grouping of the Government, unions and employers, which last week urged employers to make flexi-work arrangements permanent. From Tuesday (April 26), companies can recall 100 per cent of their staff back to the office, up from the current 75 per cent, as Singapore further relaxes its Covid-19 safe management measures. Dr Mathew Mathews, who led the study, said: ""The big story that we want to tell is really that Singapore has made some kind of transition towards living with Covid-19… Some of the gains that we have got through learning to work from home in a productive manner need to be kept in mind as we think about how to get back to work."" The pandemic showed that workers not only remain productive off-site by working from home, they also get more out of their personal lives, said the research team, which also includes research assistant Fiona Phoa, associate director Mike Hou and research associate Elizabeth Lim from IPS’ social lab. The survey tracked more than 2,000 respondents drawn from an online panel from technology company Toluna. About 500 respondents were polled every two weeks over 19 fortnights to track shifts in attitudes. A follow-up report may be released next year, Dr Mathew said. The number of workers going into the office surged from more than half during the earlier phase of the survey to 74 per cent in the first 10 days of April, as the Government gradually lifted caps on workers on-site. Not that all of them wanted to, though. Around one third of those who worked from home said they felt pressured to return to the office, the report said. More women (73 per cent) than men (66 per cent) felt that home-working or flexi-work should remain the norm. More women (94 per cent) with children or caring for aged dependents at home felt so compared with their male counterparts (86 per cent), mirroring global studies that show women tended to shoulder more of the domestic burdens during pandemic lockdowns. Ms Sher-li Torrey, who started social enterprise Mums@Work to support working mothers, said firms are calling workers back to the office, reverting a two-year trend of FWAs, or flexible work arrangements. ""This is very punishing for mothers, who really thrive on FWA to help them manage work and family. I have been seeing firms cancel their FWA quite quickly - so we saw more mums coming forward to say they are looking for new jobs with more flexibility again,"" she added. Dr Mathew said: ""We found that different groups had different kinds of situations that need to be taken into account. Employers should take feedback, really understand their workers."" Workstyle consultant Hardeep Matharu said about one-third of his C-suite clients are asking their staff to return to the office unilaterally. ""For the most part, the senior leadership is seeking to maintain the longstanding status quo of the organisations they manage; working in the office was a norm for the very large majority of their tenure. ""A number of senior leaders also remain unconvinced about the viability of hybrid working, feeling that the model hinders productivity, forces an increase in unproductive virtual meetings and prompts a lack of visibility on what their teams are doing. ""As such, an easy solution is to force employees back to the office regardless of what workers want."" When his clients do so, he reminds them of the consequences. ""There are very real risks of not just losing top talent, but also reducing their ability to attract talent,'' he added."
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/jobs/flexible-work-arrangements-now-preferred-10-takeaways-from-the-ips-report,Flexible work arrangements now preferred: 10 takeaways from IPS report,"SINGAPORE - Workers now say that flexible work arrangements should be the new norm for Singapore, with four in 10 also saying that employees should be allowed to work from home three days a week. These were among the results of a paper by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) that examined attitudes towards work and workplace arrangements amid the coronavirus outbreak. Here are the top 10 takeaways from the report: 1. Flexible work arrangements should be the new norm for workplaces here, according to about half of the survey respondents. 2. Working from home on most days should be the norm, around 20 per cent to 35 per cent of those polled said. Recently, around four in 10 also felt that employees should be allowed to work from home three days a week. 3. Most women polled also wanted flexible arrangements, with 73 per cent saying that should be the new norm, especially those with dependants. 4. Employers should allow the workers to choose the days they prefer to return to the office, nearly half of the respondents said. 5. Some said they would consider looking for another job if their employer required them to return to the office on most days. 6. Some would rather work from the office for three reasons: easy access to tech systems, collaborating with colleagues and being in a conducive space for work. 7. Working from home has three benefits: workers felt they are less likely to catch Covid-19, have flexibility in balancing personal life and work schedules and are able to attend to family needs. 8. About half of the respondents said they learnt new skills during the pandemic that would help them in their careers. 9. Work aspirations have changed due to the pandemic, said nearly half of the people polled, with some considering a career switch. 10. Workers were more likely to prefer taking precautions, like taking tests, to lower their risk of getting infected with Covid-19 at the workplace."
