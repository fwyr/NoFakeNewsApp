Restrictions in the central business district of Futian and Longhua, home to a major campus of Apple iPhone assembler Foxconn, have been extended until Sunday, while residents in several areas across the city were asked to work from home if possible. Most of Shenzhen's nearly 18 million residents are now under COVID-19 controls amid the city's most serious outbreak since spring. But unlike its swift decision in March to lock down the city to fight community infections, Shenzhen has taken a more considered approach in the current flare-up since late August. Curbing activities of tens of millions of people intensifies the challenges for China to cushion the economic impact of its ""dynamic-zero"" COVID-19 policy that has kept its borders mostly shut to international visitors, and made it an outlier as other countries learn to live with the coronavirus. On Thursday evening, officials sought to quell rumours that the city would undergo a full lockdown as it did for a week in March, and said people could leave and return to their homes with a 24-hour proof of testing. So far, authorities have largely avoided shutting down offices and factories. ""We need to get the virus under control, we can't just give up like some countries,"" said a woman surnamed Tang, who has been volunteering to help food deliveries arrive at a locked down compound in Futian, Shenzhen's most severely hit district. ""But I don't know when it will end, it's really hurting businesses."" On Friday, officials reported 87 new locally transmitted COVID-19 infections in Shenzhen on Sep 1, up from 62 a day earlier. Of those, eight were outside quarantine areas. In southwestern China, the megacity of Chengdu went into lockdown late on Thursday with mass testing for COVID-19 planned through the weekend. Uncertainty remained whether the lockdown would be lifted after the testing ends on Sunday. The city of about 21 million people and capital of Sichuan province reported 150 new local cases for Sep 1, official data showed on Friday, compared with 157 infections a day earlier. In Chengdu, non-essential employees were told to work from home. Industrial firms engaged in key manufacturing and able to manage on closed campuses were exempted from work-from-home requirements. Toyota Motor's Chengdu plant, which has an annual production capacity of 105,000 vehicles, is ""operating normally"", and inside a closed loop at the request of the Sichuan government, a company official told Reuters. Sweden's Volvo Cars, majority owned by Chinese automotive company Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, has shut its plant in Chengdu, a company spokesperson said on Thursday."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/us-cdc-expert-panel-backs-use-redesigned-omicron-covid-19-boosters-2915561,US CDC expert panel backs use of redesigned Omicron COVID-19 boosters,"Advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday (Sep 1) voted to recommend the use of COVID-19 booster shots redesigned to target the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants of the coronavirus for people aged 12 years and older. The CDC's Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted 13-to-1 in favor of the updated boosters by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. The vote is one of the last steps before millions of the retooled shots roll out by the end of this weekend as part of a nationwide revaccination campaign. The agency's Director Rochelle Walensky will make the final call after the meeting. He has been supportive of a booster campaign in recent public statements. On Wednesday, the US Food and Drug Administration authorised the updated shots from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna that target the dominant BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants as well as the original virus. They are often called bivalent shots. FDA officials on Wednesday said they believe the updated shots should be available to a broader population than the previous boosters as they may help younger people avoid long COVID-19, which can leave them suffering debilitating symptoms for months. The FDA authorised the Pfizer-BioNTech shots for people ages 12 and older and the Moderna booster for those 18 and over, if they have received a primary vaccine series or a booster at least two months prior. The previously authorised monovalent vaccine will no longer be available as a booster shot in those age groups. Pfizer said on Thursday it hopes to ask the FDA for authorisation in 5- to 11-year-olds in early October. CDC and FDA officials have said they believe the shots will boost immunity against the virus ahead of the winter season, when infections tend to rise as people spend more time indoors where the virus is more easily transmitted. Currently, a second booster is restricted largely to people over age 50 and those who are immunocompromised or at high risk. During the meeting, CDC officials suggested people who have had COVID-19 should wait at least until they have completed their isolation to receive a booster and may consider waiting 3 months. Vaccine makers have yet to complete human trials for the newly authorised boosters, and some ACIP members raised reservations over the lack of data. Most of the available data on the redesigned boosters comes from lab and animal studies. ""I understand we need better vaccines because obviously we're still having a lot of COVID despite vaccination,"" said committee member Dr Pablo Sanchez, a Professor of Pediatrics at Ohio State University, who voted against the recommendation. ""But I'm struggling with making a recommendation for a bivalent vaccine that has not been studied in humans."" The FDA had in June said it would not require studies testing the shots in humans for authorization, similar to how annual changes to flu vaccines are cleared. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/eu-regulator-backs-use-novavax-covid-19-shot-booster-2916171,EU regulator backs use of Novavax COVID-19 shot as a booster,"LONDON: The European Medicines Agency (EMA) on Thursday (Sep 1) backed the use of Novavax's COVID-19 shot as a booster for adults, ahead of an anticipated rise in infections this winter. The vaccine, Nuvaxovid, is designed to target the strain of the virus that originally emerged in China. The EMA's recommendation is for people who previously were inoculated with either the Novavax shot, or any other COVID-19 vaccine. Separately on Thursday, the EMA backed two separate COVID-19 vaccine boosters updated to target the Omicron variant of the virus. Developed by Moderna and the team of Pfizer and BioNTech, the new so-called bivalent shots combat the BA.1 version of Omicron and the original virus first detected in China. Novavax's Nuvaxovid made its debut well after first set of COVID-19 shots - including those from Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson - were approved in different parts of the world. The hope was Nuvaxovid would incentivise people who were sceptical of some shots based on the newer mRNA technology to get vaccinated, given Nuvaxovid relies on technology that has been used for decades to combat diseases including hepatitis B and influenza. However, demand has been tepid. Last month, the US vaccine maker Novavax cut its annual revenue forecast by half, on limited demand for its shot as a primary course. As a booster for people who have previously received other vaccines, it could still offer the potential of a broader spectrum of protection, some experts have suggested. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/china-sichuan-chengdu-covid-19-lockdown-testing-2915026,Chengdu locks down 21.2 million people as Chinese cities battle COVID-19,"SHENZHEN: The southwestern Chinese metropolis of Chengdu announced a lockdown of its 21.2 million residents as it launched four days of citywide COVID-19 testing, as some of the country's most populous and economically important cities battle outbreaks. Residents of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, were ordered to stay home from 6pm on Thursday (Sep 1), with households allowed to send one person per day to shop for necessities, the city government said in a statement. Chengdu, which reported 157 domestically transmitted infections on Wednesday, is the largest Chinese city to be locked down since Shanghai in April and May. It remained unclear whether the lockdown would be lifted after the mass testing ends on Sunday. Other major cities including Shenzhen in the south and Dalian in the northeast have also stepped up COVID-19 restrictions this week, ranging from work-from-home requirements to the closure of entertainment businesses in some districts. The moves curtail the activities of tens of millions of people, intensifying the challenges for China to minimise the economic impact of a ""dynamic-zero"" COVID-19 policy that has kept China's borders mostly shut to international visitors and make it an outlier as other countries try to live with the coronavirus. Most of the curbs are intended to last a few days for now, although two provincial cities in northern China have extended curbs slightly beyond initial promises. Chengdu's lockdown sparked panic buying of essentials among residents. ""I am waiting in a very long queue to get in the grocery near my home,"" 28-year-old engineer Kya Zhang said, adding that she was worried about access to fresh food if the lockdown is extended. Hwabao Trust economist Nie Wen said that because Chengdu acted quickly to lock down, it was unlikely to see a repeat of Shanghai's two-month ordeal. Non-essential employees in Chengdu were asked to work from home and residents were urged not to leave the city unless needed. Residents who must leave their residential compounds for hospital visits or other special needs must obtain approval from neighbourhood staffers. Industrial firms engaged in important manufacturing and able to manage on closed campuses were exempted from work-from-home requirements. Sweden's Volvo Cars said it would temporarily close its Chengdu plant. Flights to and from Chengdu were dramatically curtailed, according to Flight Master data. At 10am local time on Thursday, it showed 398 flights had been cancelled at Shuangliu Airport in Chengdu, with a cancellation rate of 62 per cent. At Chengdu's Tianfu Airport, 79 per cent, or 725 flights, were cancelled. In Shenzhen, which has the third-highest economic output among Chinese cities, the most populous district Baoan and tech hub Nanshan suspended large events and indoor entertainment for a few days and ordered stricter checks of digital health credentials for people entering residential compounds. Nanshan is home to internet giant Tencent and the world's biggest dronemaker, DJI, among other major Chinese companies. More than half of Shenzhen's ten districts, home to over 15 million people, have ordered blanket closure of entertainment venues and halted or reduced restaurant dining for a few days, with curbs in two districts initially planned to be lifted by the end of Thursday. Shenzhen authorities have largely avoided shutting down offices and factories as they did during a week-long lockdown in March. Data on Thursday showed that Chinese factory activity contracted for the first time in three months in August amid weakening demand, while power shortages and fresh COVID-19 flare-ups disrupted production. In Shanghai, schools reopened on Thursday after being closed for months. Mainland China has reported no COVID-19 death since May, leaving the death toll at 5,226. "

Verner Chua Jun Jie, 22, was handed two new charges on Thursday (Sep 1) for cutting his GPS tag at a flat in Bukit Batok in September last year and for failing to report to Selarang Park Community Supervision Centre that same month. Chua was charged last year with two counts of exposing others to the risk of infection. He was accused of failing to stay home in August 2020 despite receiving a medical certificate ordering him to stay home for five days as he had an acute respiratory infection. Instead, he took a Grab vehicle to visit his grandmother in West Coast and another Grab vehicle to buy lunch before heading home, charge sheets stated. He is accused of repeating this offence in December 2020 while he was on medical leave for acute respiratory infection and had not yet received a negative COVID-19 test result. He allegedly took taxis to have dessert with a friend in Balestier Road and for frog porridge in Geylang. By his actions, Chua allegedly exposed his grandmother, his friend and other people at those locations to the risk of contracting COVID-19. Chua was set to plead guilty in October last year, but an arrest warrant was issued for him that month when he failed to turn up in court. He was remanded on Thursday and is set to plead guilty on Sep 13. If convicted under the Infectious Diseases Act, he could be jailed for up to six months, fined up to S$10,000, or both, per charge. For mischief, he could be jailed for up to a year, fined, or both. For failing to turn up at the supervision centre, he can be jailed for up to a month, fined up to S$1,500, or both. "

At least half of the Shenzhen's ten districts, home to more than 13 million of the city's residents, have now ordered blanket closures of entertainment venues and halted or reduced restaurant dining. Education authorities have postponed the start of the new school semester, which was largely planned to begin on Thursday. Officials urged residents not to leave the city unless on urgent matters in a statement issued late on Wednesday. It did not specify how officials would police the new requirement, but demanded government, Communist party authorities and state-owned firms make sure their employees are not making unnecessary trips outside the city. Residents who must leave have to show proof of two negative tests within 48 hours, according to the statement. Authorities have traced a cluster of cases to a dance hall in the city's central business district of Futian, and were urging recent visitors there to report themselves to local health authorities. The world's largest electronics market at Huaqiangbei remains closed after authorities shut it on Monday. Shenzhen reported 62 new locally transmitted COVID-19 infections for Aug 31, up from 37 a day earlier. "

Both vaccines also include the original version of the virus targeted by all the previous COVID-19 shots as the country prepares for another vaccination campaign in the fall season. As a single dose, Moderna's vaccine is authorised for those aged 18 and above, while Pfizer's bivalent candidate is for those aged 12 and above. The US government has purchased 175 million doses of the booster shots in an effort to stave off the worst effects of a potential surge in new infections as schools reconvene and people spend more time indoors as the weather grows colder. The FDA in June asked vaccine makers to tailor shots to the two subvariants responsible for the most recent surge in infections worldwide. The BA.5 subvariant currently accounts for more than 88 per cent of US infections. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine advisory panel is scheduled to meet on Thursday to make recommendations for use of the redesigned shots that Director Rochelle Walensky will take into consideration before making a final decision.

Several of China's biggest cities have stepped up COVID-19 restrictions this week, curtailing the activities of tens of millions of people. Authorities looking to balance economic needs with the effort to contain every outbreak said the curbs would run for just a few days, although two northern provincial capitals extended them slightly. China's so-called ""dynamic COVID zero"" policy makes it an outlier as other countries gradually do away with curbs, despite the cost to the world's second-largest economy, which already faces slower growth. Capital Economics estimates 41 cities, responsible for 32 per cent of China's gross domestic product (GDP), are grappling outbreaks - the highest number since April. ""For now, the resulting disruption appears modest, but the threat of damaging lockdowns is growing,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at the consultancy. ""And even if they are avoided, we expect growth to remain subdued going forward."" Guangzhou, a city of nearly 19 million residents near Hong Kong, reported just five locally transmitted infections for Tuesday but authorities ordered some areas in one district to halt indoor entertainment and restaurant dining until Saturday. It also ordered most school grades in the district to delay returning for the fall semester and halt any physical sessions already begun, state media said, while bus and subway services were also scaled back. In Shenzhen, at least four districts with about 9 million residents, have ordered closure of entertainment and cultural businesses and halted or reduced restaurant dining for a few days. The city's district of Yantian locked down until Sunday a few narrower areas, limiting household shopping trips to just one person every two days, and suspending businesses, although allowing restricted operations by firms in essential sectors. Shenzhen's education authorities postponed the start of the new semester of offline classes for most school grades. Shenzhen urged residents not to leave without necessary reasons in a statement issued late on Wednesday. It did not specify how officials would police the new requirement, but demanded government, Communist party authorities and state-owned firms make sure their employees are not making unnecessary trips outside the city. Residents who must leave have to show proof of two negative tests within 48 hours, according to the statement. The combined economic output of Shenzhen and Guangzhou reached 5.89 trillion yuan (US$855 billion) last year, or about half the GDP of South Korea. The northern city of Shijiazhuang, close to Beijing, the capital, extended by a day beyond an earlier target of Wednesday its work-from-home mandate covering four districts with more than 3 million people. The northwestern city of Xining, home to about 2.5 million people, extended until Sep 5 a work-from-home order for employees in key urban areas imposed from Monday, and initially meant to run until Thursday. China reported 1,675 new domestically transmitted infections for Aug 30, the National Health Commission said, down from the previous day's 1,717 new local cases. Most cases were found in the mountainous region of Tibet and the southwestern province of Sichuan. Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan, ordered the closure from Thursday of all office buildings in a district with more than a million residents. That followed the earlier citywide closure of indoor entertainment and cultural locations. Entry was limited to staff needed to ensure basic functions of those buildings, government officials in Chengdu said, a restriction to last three days for now. The commercial hub of Shanghai will restrict large gatherings and avoid unnecessary ones, a municipal official said, as two new local infections were reported on Tuesday, one of them in the community. Large conferences and events requiring extensive travel must be downsized, delayed or moved online whenever possible, Shanghai health official Wu Qianyu told a news briefing. "

The POFMA Office said on Wednesday (Aug 31) that the warning was issued to the 47-year-old woman in relation to “false claims misleading people into thinking that the COVID-19 vaccines are not effective"" in reducing transmission rates of the coronavirus. The falsehoods ran counter to efforts to combat COVID-19, it added. On Oct 24, 2021, a POFMA direction was issued to Truth Warriors to carry correction notices on its website to inform people of the falsehoods, the POFMA office said. The correction direction involved posts on the website that contained falsehoods relating to the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and for promoting ivermectin to treat the coronavirus. The Health Ministry said then that many of the materials published on the Truth Warriors website were from unverified and dubious sources, and that individuals who heed the advice on the website can endanger themselves and the people around them. Ivermectin is a prescription-only medicine registered in Singapore specifically for the treatment of parasitic worm infections. The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) ""strongly advised"" consumers against self-medicating with the drug, saying it is not an anti-viral medicine and is not approved by HSA for use in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. During the investigations, the woman claimed to have checked the credentials of the original authors of the articles, but admitted that she cannot be certain whether the information published was true, said the POFMA Office. It issued the conditional warning to the woman for the charges after considering the facts and circumstances of the case. If she reoffends during this period, the woman can be prosecuted for the original crime. An offence under Section 7 of the POFMA carries a fine of up to S$50,000, an imprisonment term of up to five years, or both.

From Sep 7, Japan will also raise its daily cap on the number of people allowed to enter the country from 20,000 to 50,000, Kishida told reporters. Japan has kept strict border restrictions in place longer than many other major economies, and only in June began allowing tourists to visit on the condition they came in tour groups accompanied by guides. ""As international exchange becomes more active worldwide, Japan will join this movement - also from the viewpoint of taking advantage of a cheap yen,"" said Kishida, who has himself just recovered from COVID-19. From the same date, ""we'll also make it possible for tourists from all countries to enter the country on package tours without tour guides, and we will proceed with making entry procedures smoother at airports"", he added. But the measures fall short of a full reopening and visitors are still required to book their trips through agents and obtain visas. Public broadcaster NHK and other local media have reported that tourists will be asked to follow isolation guidelines if they test positive for COVID-19 in Japan. Kishida said he hoped to ease border restrictions further, with industry officials keen to see the return of a waiver programme that allowed tourists from much of the world to visit without a visa. Japan hopes to eventually ""enable smooth entry"" in line with other Group of Seven countries, he added. The country has never imposed a strict lockdown, and it has recorded total deaths from the disease of around 39,000 - far lower than many other countries. Around 64 per cent of the population and more than 90 per cent of people aged 65 and over have received three vaccine shots. But the country has maintained strict border rules throughout the pandemic, barring foreign residents from re-entry for several months at the height of the first waves of infection. Group tours have been allowed since June, but only around 144,500 foreign tourists are estimated to have entered the country in July, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization. The nation welcomed a record 31.9 million foreign visitors in 2019, and had been on track to achieve its goal of 40 million in 2020 before the pandemic struck. "

The nonagenarian, who served for more than two decades as prime minister, has a history of heart problems. He has had heart attacks and bypass surgeries. Dr Mahathir has received at least three doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, with the last known shot in November 2021, according to earlier comments made by him and Malaysian government officials. He was warded at National Heart Institute in December last year for ""a full medical check-up and further observation"" before undergoing an elective medical procedure on Jan 8.  Dr Mahathir and the National Heart Institute did not say at the time what procedure the former leader had undergone, only saying that he had been admitted to the cardiac care unit at the hospital. After being in and out of hospital for several weeks, he was discharged in early February, with follow-up appointments planned ""as and when required in the near future"", the National Heart Institute said at the time.  Dr Mahathir served as prime minister for 22 years until 2003.

South Korea lifted most of its pandemic-related restrictions in May but has maintained some of the strictest border measures among major economies, requiring inbound travellers to present a negative coronavirus test result taken before departure. ""All inbound travellers, whether our nationals or foreigners, arriving aboard a plane or ship will not need to hand in a negative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test starting midnight of Sep 3,"" Second Vice Health Minister Lee Ki-il said in a virus response meeting.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/surgical-n95-mask-suppliers-shopee-lazada-mask-restrictions-indoors-2908991,Some mask manufacturers in Singapore scale back production as restrictions ease,"SINGAPORE: As Singapore eases mask restrictions, mask manufacturers are scaling back production or pivoting to corporate clients. There used to be manufacturers in Singapore that produced surgical masks but this stopped more than 10 years ago. Many of the manufacturers CNA spoke to started making them because of a global face mask shortage at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. From Monday, Singapore lifted restrictions on wearing masks indoors, except on public transport and in healthcare settings. The requirement to wear masks outdoors was lifted on Mar 29.  Technology company Razer told CNA it will be slowing down its face mask production following the easing of mask restrictions.  Razer said it started making masks during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic due to the global shortage, and ""converted existing product manufacturing lines to make and donate face masks for immediate relief"". The company also started Singapore’s first fully automated mask production and packing line.  Some companies had already scaled back production when mask requirements outdoors were lifted earlier this year.  Director of AVS Technologies Kelvin Mun told CNA that the company already stopped production of face masks earlier this year, and fully shut down its mask manufacturing line in June. Everything lined up, he said, adding that the company’s raw materials for mask manufacturing were used up at around the same time it was due to renew its mask manufacturing licence with the Health Sciences Authority.  The company, which sells printing equipment, set up its mask manufacturing line in March 2020 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic because it could not buy enough masks for its own use.  “We saw that there was a short supply and everyone was panicking and they needed the masks. We thought that we could fill the gap to help supply the shortage,” Mr Mun said.  “It was a totally different thing (from our original business). It was difficult for us because we had to learn the new lingo from the medical side, all the requirements and paperwork that we were not used to.”  AVS Technologies said it sold its masks online and in army supplies shops, selling more than S$100,000 worth of masks per month at the peak of its production. The company has managed to sell off most of its stock, with just a few cartons of kids masks remaining. It plans to donate the masks or share the masks with staff who have children.  Managing director of 3P Medical Device Joseph Ong also said his company had scaled back production by about 40 per cent over the past six months. The company started producing masks in the first quarter of 2020, on top of Mr Ong’s other businesses. The company used to produce about 300,000 to 400,000 masks per month, and produces about 200,000 now. It currently has no plans to scale operations down further, as 40 per cent of its customer base is still made up of corporate customers. It also sells its masks with traditional Chinese medicine shops, hospital pharmacies, mom-and-pop stores, as well as online resellers like Shopee and Lazada.  “That was probably (because we were) anticipating when masks are no longer needed outdoors, there would come one day that the Government might announce that masks are no longer needed indoors,” he told CNA. “But generally, after two-and-a-half years, the public has two sides, or preferences. One side, they prefer not to wear. The other side, they will still continue to wear,” he said, adding that many people still do not feel comfortable going around without a mask. Singapore Technologies Engineering, or ST Engineering began domestic production of medical-grade surgical masks in mid-February 2020, and the masks were used in Singapore’s hospitals on the frontline against COVID-19.  At the time, Singapore had to restart its domestic production capabilities when one of its foreign suppliers could not fulfill its contractual obligations recently to produce surgical masks, then-Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said.  “Our medical-grade surgical mask business was set up with a clear objective, that is to help Singapore establish local mask manufacturing capabilities and strengthen mask supply chain resilience,” said ST Engineering.  In response to queries about whether the company would be stepping down mask production, ST Engineering said: “Our focus has always been on building a sustainable supply of medical-grade surgical masks and N95 masks for our healthcare and frontline workers, as well as local communities in need, and will remain so going forward.  “We have resilient capacity utilisation and business models which well address demand pattern changes.”  Meanwhile, Vital Shield told CNA it plans to maintain mask production or even scale up production if it secures more corporate clients. The company started manufacturing masks at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, adjacent to another cleaning company run by the team. The manufacturer initially saw demand for masks drop by about 10 per cent when the outdoor restrictions were first relaxed. But demand gradually clawed back as Singapore saw infection waves from different variants of COVID-19 and monkeypox, said its sales and marketing manager Mellissa Hau.  The company sells its masks on its website as well as on Shopee and Lazada. But since corporate orders make up about 65 per cent of its demand, the team plans to continue its current level of production. Many of its corporate clients are from industries that still require employees to wear masks, like in F&B or hospitality, said Ms Hau.  “We felt that masks were very expensive and their quality was not there. So we decided to do our own,” she added. “The first year, business was good because that was the start, and people were trying to find affordable and quality masks. After about one-and-a-half years, more competition came in, especially from overseas where the cost was very low … so we got affected a little.” This year, several players decided to shut down operations and focus on their other business, said Ms Hau.  “So the pie is bigger. Our share of the pie increases because some of the players have withdrawn from this industry.”  FairPrice Group, which runs NTUC FairPrice supermarkets, Cheers outlets and Unity pharmacies, said it was currently too early to comment on mask sales, since the eased restrictions were only recently announced.  “We will continue to monitor consumer demand and adjust our supply accordingly.”  Pharmacy chain Watsons said it had already “redone” its forecasting for stocks of face masks since wearing a mask was made optional at the end of March this year. “Currently, we hold an optimal level of stock; enough for current demand while we continue to monitor onward demand with the new rules soon to take place,” said the pharmacy.  Dairy Farm Group, which runs the Giant and Cold Storage supermarkets as well as Guardian outlets, declined to comment on its plans for its current stock of masks."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/china-covid-19-lockdown-escalate-restrictions-2908906,China imposes COVID-19 lockdowns for millions,"BEIJING: Several big Chinese cities escalated COVID-19 restrictions on Tuesday (Aug 30), with authorities doubling down on efforts to contain the coronavirus ahead of a key ruling Communist Party meeting this year. Nearly 4 million people in Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing, were ordered to stay home until the end of the week as officials rush to curb a small virus flare-up. And more than 13 million in the neighbouring port city of Tianjin must undergo mass testing from 6am local time, after 51 mostly mild cases were reported. Longhua, a Shenzhen district with 2.5 million residents, on Tuesday closed various entertainment venues and wholesale marketplaces and suspended large events. People must show proof of negative test results within 24 hours to enter residential compounds, and restaurants must limit the number of customers to no more than 50 per cent of their capacity, Longhua's district authority said. The new curbs are expected to expire on Saturday. The moves followed similar measures announced on Monday covering three other districts that affected over 6 million in Shenzhen, which has fought multiple outbreaks of Omicron sub-variants this year. While city officials have not announced a blanket delay to the new school year, six parents with children in primary and middle schools said their schools had notified them of postponements, with many parents expressing anxiety over the uncertainty in parent chat groups. In Dalian, a major port in northeastern China important for soybeans and iron ore imports, the main urban areas with around 3 million residents on Tuesday entered a lockdown that is to last until Sunday. Households are allowed to send only one person out per day to shop for daily necessities. During the lockdown, non-essential workers must work from home, while manufacturing companies are to cut on-site staff and maintain basic and urgent operations only. China is the only major global economy sticking to a zero-COVID policy, and lockdowns, travel restrictions and mass testing have disrupted businesses and cooled growth. Beijing has doubled down on the policy ahead of the Communist Party's 20th National Congress, expected to take place within the next three months. The handling of the pandemic is widely seen as central to the political legacy of President Xi Jinping, who is set to be anointed for an unprecedented third term in office at the meeting. But ""the actual COVID situation in China might be worsening, as Omicron has once again spread to large cities"", Nomura analyst Ting Lu warned in a research note. Chengdu, western China's largest city, has also seen strict travel restrictions. The districts of Wuhou and Qingyang on Tuesday suspended many venues and tour groups and planned to delay the start of the fall semester for schools, after the district of Jinniu on Monday tightened curbs. The three districts have around 3.5 million residents in total.  The world's biggest electronics market in Huaqiangbei has also been closed - despite just 35 daily cases being reported in the city of over 18 million. ""The notice to close came abruptly, we only had a few hours to put our stock into warehouses and lock up,"" a trader at the Huaqiangbei tech market, who only offered his last name Chen, told AFP. In Futian, where the city government is located, cinemas, karaoke bars and parks are closed until Friday and large public events have been cancelled. Officials also sealed off Wanxia neighbourhood on the city's outskirts, which offers affordable housing for delivery drivers and migrant workers, although no cases were reported there.  In the northern city of Shijiazhuang, about three-and-a-half hours' drive from the capital Beijing, four big districts have ordered more than 3 million residents to work from home, excluding essential workers, until Wednesday afternoon. China reported 1,717 domestically transmitted COVID-19 infections for Aug 29, including 349 symptomatic ones and 1,368 asymptomatic infections, official data showed on Tuesday. Among over 20 provinces, regions and municipalities that reported cases, the region of Tibet, the province of Sichuan, of which Chengdu is the capital, and the province of Qinghai contributed the most daily cases for Monday. Qinghai's provincial capital, Xining, with 2.5 million residents, has ordered a lockdown for its main urban areas, halting public transport and restricting movement outside residential compounds. The lockdown, which started on Monday, was scheduled to be lifted on Thursday morning. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/it-felt-my-insides-were-crying-china-covid-19-curbs-hit-youth-mental-health-2908416,'It felt like my insides were crying': China COVID-19 curbs hit youth mental health,"HONG KONG: Zhang Meng had a breakdown last December. The 20-year-old found herself sobbing on the stairs of her dorm, driven to despair by repeated COVID-19 lockdowns of her university campus in Beijing. The lockdowns had meant she was mostly confined to her room and unable to meet up with friends. There were also strict curbs on when she could visit the canteen or take a shower. Describing herself as someone who craves in-person social interaction, Zhang said the restrictions had ""removed the safety net that was holding me up and I felt like my whole being was falling down"". That month, she was diagnosed with major depression and anxiety. Yao, also 20 and who asked that his first name not be used, had his first breakdown in high school where he was a boarder, unable to understand why lockdown policies were so tough. He said that one day he had to take refuge in a school toilet, crying so hard ""it felt like my insides were crying"". In early 2021 while at university in Beijing, unable to shake that depression and also unhappy he had not taken the courses he wanted to for fear of upsetting his father, Yao attempted suicide. China has employed some of the world's harshest and most frequent lockdown measures in its determination to stamp out every COVID-19 outbreak, arguing it saves lives and pointing to its low pandemic death toll of around 5,200 to date. It's an effort it has shown little sign of abandoning, but the policy's impact on mental health alarms medical experts and as Zhang's and Yao's experiences have shown, it is already taking its toll. ""China's lockdowns have had a huge human cost with the shadow of mental-ill health adversely affecting China’s culture and economy for years to come,"" argues a June editorial in the British medical journal the Lancet. In particular, experts fear for the mental health of teenagers and young adults, more vulnerable because of their age and lack of control over their lives, and who have to contend with far greater education stresses and economic pressures than earlier generations. The number of young people affected is potentially huge. About 220 million Chinese children and young people have been confined for prolonged periods due to COVID-19 restrictions, the Education Ministry estimated in 2020. It did not respond to a Reuters request for an updated figure and comment on the topic. The COVID-19 curbs have sometimes forced young people into extreme situations. During Shanghai's two-month lockdown this year, for instance, some 15 to 18-year-olds had to isolate by themselves at hotels as they were not allowed to return home. ""They had to cook for themselves and didn't have people to talk to so it was actually very hard for them,"" said Frank Feng, deputy principal at Lucton, an international school in Shanghai, told Reuters. While data examining youth mental health in China and the impact of lockdowns and the pandemic is sparse, what there is is grim. Around 20 per cent of Chinese junior and senior high school students learning remotely during lockdowns have experienced suicidal ideation, according to a survey of 39,751 pupils conducted in April 2020 that was published in the US journal Current Psychology in January. Suicidal ideation is sometimes described as when a person thinks they would be better off dead, though the person may not have at the time intent to commit suicide. More broadly across age groups, searches for ""psychological counselling"" on Chinese search engine Baidu more than tripled in the first seven months of 2022 compared to the same period a year earlier. For many teenagers, COVID-19 lockdowns have come during critical exam years. If the stigma of being infected is not enough, desperation to avoid missing a life-changing exam due to either catching COVID-19 or, much more commonly, being considered a close contact has many families isolating for months ahead of exam periods, teachers said. Exacerbating that academic pressure are dismal job prospects. While overall unemployment stands at 5.4 per cent, the rate for urban youth has soared to 19.9 per cent, the highest level on record, as corporate hiring withers due to the pandemic and regulatory crackdowns on the tech and tutoring sectors. Most students are also only children due to China's 1980-2015 one-child policy and are conscious they will have to help support their parents in the future. According to a Fudan University survey of around 4,500 young people this year, about 70 per cent expressed varying degrees of anxiety. The pandemic and lockdowns are also thought to be fuelling disaffection with the intense pressure to get ahead in life, symbolised by the so-called ""lying flat"" movement that last year gained huge social media traction in China as many young people embraced the idea of doing the bare minimum to get by. For its part, the Education Ministry has launched a raft of measures to improve mental health for students during the pandemic, including the introduction of mandatory mental health classes at colleges and a drive to ramp up the country's number of school counsellors, therapists and psychiatrists. But mental health has gained attention in China only in the last 20 years and the ministry's efforts to install counsellors in schools are relatively new. Most schools would not have had one last year. Guidelines it published in June 2021 call for a ratio of at least 1 counsellor per 4,000 students nationwide. State media have also taken up the topic. A Jun 6 article in the China Daily that focused on the mental health impact of COVID-19 curbs on vulnerable groups including teenagers quoted Lu Lin, president of Peking University's Sixth Hospital, as saying that COVID-19's ""toll on people's mental health could last over two decades"". Data from early 2020 shows that a third of residents who isolated at home had experienced conditions such as depression, anxiety and insomnia, he said. Lu estimated most would recover after an outbreak subsides but 10 per cent would be unable to completely return to normal, noting he had teenage patients who had developed gaming addiction, had trouble sleeping and continued to be downcast and reluctant to go outdoors. For Zhang, lockdowns and her subsequent depression have completely shattered her worldview. Once satisfied with her plans to study Chinese language and literature, disillusionment with how lockdowns have been managed has sparked interest in studying abroad. ""I was quite patriotic when I graduated from high school ... this feeling is slowly disappearing. It's not that I don't trust the government anymore, it's more of a feeling that the smell of masks and sanitiser has penetrated deep into my bones."" "

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-support-grant-cheat-msf-forge-retrenchment-letter-2906786,Woman jailed for forging retrenchment letter to apply for COVID-19 Support Grant,"SINGAPORE: A woman was on Monday (Aug 29) jailed for five weeks for forging a retrenchment letter to apply for the COVID-19 Support Grant. Goh Chyi Chen, 42, pleaded guilty to one charge of forgery. Another charge of attempting to cheat the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) was considered for sentencing. The court heard that Goh worked as a senior retail executive with Rigel Telecom before the offences. She was fired in May 2020 due to unsatisfactory work performance. The reasons for Goh's retrenchment were stated in a letter issued by Rigel Telecom, and her retrenchment was not related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the court was told. The COVID-19 Support Grant, administered by MSF, provided financial assistance to Singaporeans affected by the economic impact of the pandemic. For those who lost their job or were on involuntary no-pay leave for at least three consecutive months, the grant provided a monthly cash grant of up to S$800 for three months. The cash support quantum was based on the last-drawn monthly salary, capped at S$800. On Oct 1, 2020, Goh submitted an online application for the COVID-19 Support Grant that included a forged retrenchment letter. She used word processing software to amend the contents of the letter, deleting all the reasons given for her retrenchment and instead stating that it was due to COVID-19. On Oct 12, 2020, an MSF officer contacted the company to verify the letter's contents and learnt that the company did not issue the letter. When the officer contacted Goh over the phone, she continued to claim that she was retrenched due to the pandemic. MSF eventually rejected Goh's application. Deputy Public Prosecutor Norman Yew argued that Goh's actions put public funds in peril, and pointed out that she persisted in her lie when questioned by an MSF officer. He also said that Goh had related prior convictions for cheating, forgery and criminal breach of trust, although these took place in 2004 and were relatively dated. Defence lawyer Anand Nalachandran, who requested not more than a week's jail for his client, asked the court to consider the ""desperate situation"" Goh was in around the time she offended. He highlighted that after the offences, Goh was diagnosed with depression by the Institute of Mental Health. Although there was no contributory link to Goh's offences, the diagnosis showed she was facing several stressors in her life that led to her mistake, said the lawyer. Mr Nalachandran also argued that Goh's application was rejected by MSF, and no public funds were disbursed to her. The penalty for forgery is up to four years' jail, a fine or both. "

Three key buildings in the sprawling area, comprised of thousands of stalls selling microchips, telephone parts, and other components to manufacturers, will stay closed until Sep 2. Local community officials confirmed Monday's closure to Reuters, while three people working there said building managers had told them to work from home. Subway services at 24 stations in the central districts of Futian and Luohu were also halted, according to official local media. In Futian, the seat of the city government, officials announced that cinemas, karaoke bars and parks would be closed and large public events cancelled until Sep 2. COVID-19-related border closures have hurt Huaqiangbei, which before the pandemic bustled with foreign entrepreneurs looking to source components in China. On Monday, the tech hub of nearly 18 million people reported nine symptomatic and two asymptomatic cases from testing the previous day. COVID-19 testing has become a feature of daily life in the city, with most public spaces and offices needing proof of a test within 48 hours for entry, or within 24 hours in areas deemed high risk. While the city has avoided blanket closures since a week-long lockdown in March, residents of individual compounds have undergone week-long quarantines when positive cases have been detected. On Monday morning, Wanxia urban village, which provides cheap accommodation to thousands of low-wage workers like delivery drivers and labourers, was sealed off as a COVID-19 prevention measure, although no positive cases were reported there. China reported 1,696 new COVID-19 infections on Aug 28, of which 352 were symptomatic and 1,344 were asymptomatic, the National Health Commission said on Monday.  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/many-people-mask-shopping-malls-first-day-eased-restrictions-2906686,Many people still masked up in shopping malls on first day of eased restrictions,"SINGAPORE: Many people were still wearing their masks in shopping centres and malls, despite the eased restrictions from Monday (Aug 29).  Among them was Ms Aminah Johari at NEX shopping mall in Serangoon who was unaware that restrictions have lifted. Still, Ms Aminah, who does part-time administrative work, maintained that she would continue to mask up until Singapore records fewer than 100 community cases per day. The 61-year-old said she felt concerned about the announcement as the numbers could increase as the year came to an end.  “Because as it is, they said cases might go up again at the end of the year and because some people, when they sneeze or cough, they do not cover their mouths (even) before the pandemic,” she said. Others, like Ms Aminah, were not aware that restrictions have lifted. CNA observed a middle-aged man in a retail store at City Square Mall asking why an employee was not masked up while in the changing rooms. The retail staff member could be heard explaining the new restrictions. As of Monday, indoor mask restrictions have been lifted across Singapore, except on public transport and in healthcare facilities. Masks are still required on the MRT, LRT and public buses as well as in indoor public transport facilities like boarding areas at bus interchanges and MRT platforms, but are optional on private transport modes like taxis and private hire cars.  When CNA visited shopping malls across Singapore on Monday, many people were still wearing their masks indoors, with only a handful walking around unmasked. When asked, those masked said they wore it out of habit or social responsibility.  There were more people unmasked at Changi Airport at lunchtime, many with luggage in tow.  Polytechnic student Lim Meng Loek, who was waiting for his friend at Changi Airport, told CNA he wore a mask because he was used to it.  “Now there is still COVID-19, it is not totally over. So I just continue wearing,” the 20-year-old told CNA, adding that he usually takes his mask off outdoors.  “Over time slowly … more people will take off their masks. For the first day, I just continue (to wear).” Mr Lim said that he has caught the virus at least three times, so he feels he has developed some immunity against COVID-19. Since he has hearing issues and wears a hearing aid, it is easier for him to understand people when they are speaking to him without wearing a mask. “(I take it off) only outside, in open spaces. For indoor spaces, I will see how, if there are fewer people I will take it off. But now we are in Changi Airport, there are a lot of foreigners coming in,” he added.  “For me, masks are very suffocating. If we can get back to normal and take them off that would be better - I can breathe properly and we can see each others’ faces.”  Homemaker Shaleen Agrawal, who was seen seated at Jewel Changi Airport, said that she kept her mask on in the airport area as many travellers still came in from other parts of the world.  She added that she wore her mask out of habit and will continue to do so in crowded areas. “When we heard the news we were so happy and excited but yet on the day we are allowed to take it off we still have it on,” the 45-year-old noted while laughing.  That said, Mrs Shaleen felt it was better to mask up. “It is for the protection of each other. I have kids in my family and I do not know whether you have elderly in yours. It is just the more responsible thing to do.”  According to a survey by YouGov conducted on Aug 25 and Aug 26, nearly half, or 48 per cent of the 1,046 respondents said they would always wear a mask in shopping centres. Sixty per cent of respondents said they would always wear a mask on private transport modes, and 58 per cent of them said they would always wear one at the airport or in train stations. Private transport modes and the airport also emerged as the top indoor places respondents felt uncomfortable visiting, now that wearing a mask is no longer required, the survey showed.  Singapore saw 1,361 reported COVID-19 locally transmitted cases on Sunday, according to figures from the Ministry of Health (MOH).  Others who went unmasked indoors on Monday told CNA that they would still mask up if others around them expressed their discomfort, or if establishments insisted that patrons wear masks.  At NEX, interior designer Thomas Seah said that a retail assistant had “shouted” at him for failing to mask up while in a shop selling beauty products. According to the 65-year-old, the retail employee claimed that his staff would get infected because of Mr Seah and that they would only change the regulations if they received a circular from the management.  It would be in circumstances like these that he would continue wearing a mask, Mr Seah said.  “People get nervous when I don't wear a mask, so it's more for psychological reasons (that I wear a mask). I don't want people to scream and shout,” he said.  Others like entrepreneur Preeti Darbari said that COVID-19 has become a part of life and that there are medications to treat it.  “I will take life as normal, and COVID-19 is like a flu, we should take it normally ... and not make a huge thing out of it so that the next generation of kids will start behaving normally again,” the 43-year-old said while unmasked in City Square Mall. She added that she did not want children to grow up “expressionless” behind a mask. Ms Christiana Martins, who is a mother of two, said she sent both her children aged five and seven to school without masks today. Ms Martins, who is from Brazil, had just left the gym in Tampines 1 and was not wearing a mask in the shopping mall. She told CNA she was looking forward to life returning back to normal with the lifting of indoor mask restrictions and observed that most of her older son’s classmates in Primary 1 came to school with their masks still on.  “Here in Singapore, we already have boosters and everything seems all right, I don’t think there will be any problems if you don’t wear a mask. I feel more free and I can breathe better, because after using a mask for so long this is so much better,” she added.  “I just felt a little bit uncomfortable because everyone was still wearing one,” said Ms Martins. After seeing everyone with their masks on in the shopping mall, she sent a message to her husband to confirm that restrictions would be lifted from today. “I don’t judge anybody, but it is funny because you start to feel uncomfortable because you look around and you are the unique one,” she said with a chuckle.  Polytechnic students Daniel Cheong and Isaac Tan, who are friends from church, spoke to CNA while queueing to order food at Tampines 1 - both were not wearing masks.  “I think what made me decide (to take it off) is hearing about the news, hearing about how it is safe now, there aren’t any spikes in infections or things like that, so I think I’ll just take off my mask,” said Mr Cheong, 19.  “The Government is doing a good job of containing the cases, so I guess for me, I feel safe to take it off.”  The two friends also observed that many people in the mall were still wearing their masks.  “It’s also because people are not used to taking off their masks at the moment because it’s a new rule and it has just been implemented today. I think definitely within the next few days people will start to take off their masks as they feel more safe and know the new rules better,” said Mr Cheong.  When asked how not wearing a mask indoors felt after more than two years of wearing one throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, 20-year-old Mr Tan said he felt “quite comfortable”. “Especially because Singapore is so hot. So when you sweat, the feeling in your mask just does not feel very good.”  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/covid19-pandemic-good-death-home-hospital-2903766,Commentary: COVID-19 pandemic changed what it means to have a ‘good death’,"REGINA, Canada: When considering what a “good death” is, most people in North America would likely say something along the lines of living to at least 75, and painlessly passing away at home in their sleep would constitute a good life and, most importantly, a good death. One of the key features of the “good death” narrative is being at home. So, what do we mean by home and how important is the idea or feeling of “being at home” to a good death? Home is more than just a structure. It is textures, smells, sounds and atmosphere. It is a sticky table that brings you back to your first day of school when you held your brother’s hand as you both walked to the bus or a smell that reminds you of the first time you baked cookies with your grandmother and danced around the kitchen singing along to Cher. Home is nothing, but everything, especially at the end of life. Death used to be treated as a public event, but as our society has become more individualistic, it has shifted to being a matter best dealt with in private by ritual specialists - like an embalmer or funeral director - and close family members. As the home is thought of as being the most intimate private space we inhabit, it should not be surprising that most people wish to seek “home” in the dying process. To die outside of home is seen to be a failure - a bad death. The pandemic changed the lives of many people. Isolated from friends and family, away from home, many people didn’t have access to a “good death” - especially those in care homes. So it is important to reflect back on this idea of a “good death” and how we understand what home and family mean. Since the 1920s and 1930s, the government has increased its control over funerals and end-of-life treatments. This became an even greater concern in the 1950s and 1960s, when advancements in medical care meant that people who would have previously had an “uncomplicated” death now found themselves entangled in, and dependant on medicine. With an ageing population and medical advancements, the reality is that as people age, they are likely to find themselves being put in the role of “patient"", where their death will be medically mediated. This means that even if they are able to be at home, their health is being medically determined, with the end result being that the amount of control they have over their own lives and final care has become complicated. The ideal narrative of living to 75 and passing away at home quietly and painlessly while asleep is becoming increasingly difficult to realise. The fear of not having a “good death"", by dying at home among family members, has become a very real concern - especially during the pandemic. Before COVID-19, people who lived in places like care homes would still be invited to gatherings or enjoy the occasional visit from a loved one. Their social death was isolating, but not devastating. During peak restrictions, senior living and care facilities were locked down. This resulted in family members feeling helpless and those living in care facilities feeling hopeless. The shutdowns, intended to keep them safe, caused many to long for a home that wasn’t restricted - some even opted to choose medically assisted death in the face of additional lockdowns. In the Netherlands, home is thought of as not just being a physical space, but is seen as a state of being in the family. Isolated from their families during the pandemic, many individuals found themselves no longer being in the family. The social death they were experiencing was felt to be far more painful than any fear or concern they had about their own biological death. As we reflect on what life means to us in this post-pandemic shuffle, we need to also contemplate what a “good death” is. For some, that may mean opting for quality of life and control over how, when, with whom and where it ends through end-of-life programmes. The pandemic will forever change how people understand what home and family means, what their role within the family and home is, and how to be in the family and in the home, in whatever form that may be, for their passing.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/long-covid-19-symptom-cough-brain-fog-how-long-omicron-2901841,Commentary: It’s hard to tell how many people get long COVID,"OXFORD: In the weeks and months after a COVID-19 infection, some people develop a variety of symptoms, commonly referred to as long COVID. Fatigue is the most common, affecting a little over half of people with ongoing symptoms. Other common symptoms include shortness of breath, loss of smell, muscle ache and brain fog. Our understanding of why some people face ongoing symptoms after COVID-19 is still poor. And much like the varying nature of long COVID symptoms, the duration and intensity of symptoms differ from person to person. Notably, we’ve also had difficulty pinning down the precise prevalence of long COVID (that is, what proportion of people it affects). This has been a subject of considerable debate. But recently, a study published in The Lancet has been touted as providing the most reliable estimates to date on the prevalence of long COVID. Estimates of how commonly long COVID occurs generally range from about 5 per cent to 50 per cent of COVID-19 cases, depending on which study you look at. Patients who require admission to hospital for COVID-19 have tended to sit at the higher end of the spectrum. A lot of the variability in prevalence estimates earlier in the pandemic was related to inconsistent definitions of long COVID. To clarify this, and to make diagnosis easier, public health authorities including the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have introduced standardised definitions for long COVID. According to NICE, the term ""long COVID"" can be used to describe signs and symptoms that continue or develop beyond four weeks after a COVID-19 infection. This is further divided into “ongoing symptomatic COVID-19”, when symptoms last for more than four weeks but less than 12 weeks, and “post-COVID syndrome”, when symptoms continue beyond 12 weeks from infection. But in spite of these efforts, considerable variation in prevalence estimates has remained. Several other factors also likely affect reported prevalence figures across different studies. For example, results can be afflicted by a lack of consistent instruments or questionnaires to screen for long COVID. Further, not having a matched control group (a comparison group that didn’t have COVID), or information on patients’ symptoms before COVID, can be limiting. This information allows researchers to reliably link new symptoms to COVID-19 rather than other diseases. Meanwhile, vaccination status, treatments that reduce the risk of severe disease in COVID-19 patients (like antivirals) and the variant that caused the initial infection may all affect a person’s risk of long COVID. Finally, the timing of assessment also appears to be relevant. Recent data from the UK’s Office for National Statistics suggests that although four in five patients with long COVID have symptoms lasting for at least 12 weeks, only one in five continue to be symptomatic at two years. The recent study published in The Lancet includes data from more than 76,000 people in the Netherlands. The authors have made one of the first attempts to mitigate the various biases that have plagued earlier efforts to quantify long COVID prevalence. They used questionnaires which asked about a range of symptoms and gave these to participants at various time points before, during and after COVID-19 infection. They also compared participants to a control group who hadn’t been diagnosed with COVID-19 and were similar in age and sex. Of participants who had COVID-19, 21.4 per cent experienced at least one new symptom, or a symptom that had become significantly worse since before they had COVID, three to five months post-infection. Some 8.7 per cent of uninfected people followed over the same time period reported symptoms. On this basis, the authors suggest that 12.7 per cent of people who contract COVID-19, or one in eight, develop long COVID. The authors also ascertained a list of core symptoms associated with long COVID, including difficulty breathing, chest pain, heavy arms and legs, loss of sense of smell, feeling hot and cold, tingling in extremities, muscle ache and tiredness. While this study has advanced our understanding of the real-world prevalence of long COVID, there are some important limitations. The majority of patients were not vaccinated because most of the data was collected before the vaccine rollout began in The Netherlands. According to recent research, long COVID appears to be less common among people who are vaccinated. Meanwhile, most participants were infected with the Alpha variant. Studies have also reported a lower prevalence of long COVID among people recovering from infection caused by the currently dominant Omicron variant compared with the Alpha and Delta variants. So in the current context, the prevalence of long COVID in the general population may well be less than one in eight. Importantly, our understanding of the mechanisms that cause persistent symptoms and what makes people vulnerable remains fairly limited. Only additional research, dedicated funding support and greater recognition of the condition will improve the outlook for the millions of people afflicted by long COVID around the world.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/long-covid-costs-australia-millions-working-days-2901451,Long COVID costs Australia millions of working days,"SYDNEY: Long COVID has already cost the Australian economy three million working days this year, according to a government analysis seen by AFP on Friday (Aug 26), significantly worsening the country's acute labour shortages. The treasury report found that lingering effects of the coronavirus have been keeping about 31,000 Australians away from work every day. Treasurer Jim Chalmers said Friday that Australia's ""labour market has been absolutely smashed by COVID, and Long COVID increasingly"". ""The thousands of workdays the economy is losing to Long COVID is just one part of a complex picture, and gives a sense of what we are all up against,"" he said. The treasury analysis defined Long COVID as someone experiencing symptoms four weeks or more after becoming infected. This mirrors how Long COVID is characterised by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which lists a wide variety of respiratory, heart, digestive and even neurological symptoms. These include fatigue, heart palpitations, lightheadedness, stomach pain and difficulty concentrating - known as ""brain fog"". A comprehensive study published in the Lancet this month found that one in eight people who get COVID-19 develop at least one Long COVID symptom. The findings of the Australian treasury analysis were in line with this study - with 12 per cent of COVID-related absenteeism attributed to Long COVID . Australia is facing serious labour market constraints after its borders were closed to international arrivals for nearly two years during the pandemic. The nation is experiencing the second-worst labour market shortage of any developed country, trailing only Canada, according to the OECD. This and other issues - including years of stagnant wage growth - will be the subject of a ""jobs summit"" the new Labor government plans to hold next week. Chalmers said challenges with skills shortages, wages and flatlining productivity would all be ""front and centre at the summit"". "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mask-plane-flight-optional-prevent-covid-2900476,CNA Explains: Should you wear a mask on a plane if it's optional?,"SINGAPORE: From Monday (Aug 29), Singapore will no longer require masks to be worn except on public transport and in healthcare settings.  While masks are required on transport modes like the MRT and public buses, they are optional on private transport such as taxis and private bus services. They are also not necessary at the airport, and may not even be required on flights.  But should you still opt to wear a mask on a plane even if you don't have to? CNA asks some public health experts. If the country you are travelling to or arriving from has a mask mandate, you'll have to wear one on the flight. ""Where there is a mandatory requirement for masks to be worn ... the mask must be worn on the flight itself,"" said the Health Ministry's director of medical services Kenneth Mak at a press conference on Wednesday.  According to Singapore Airlines (SIA), some destinations which require passengers aged six and above to wear a mask on a flight are: Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea, Cambodia, mainland China and Canada. But many other destinations do not require masks on planes. These include Thailand, Taiwan, Japan, New Zealand, Maldives, the US and UK. SIA said it will match its internal policy with the Singapore Government's. The airline will no longer require passengers to wear face masks from Aug 29, unless mandated by the place that the flight is travelling to or from. Jetstar also said that it will ensure its mask policy ""continues to be aligned with the relevant authorities"" of the destinations it flies to. Although masks are optional on some flights, should you still wear one? Infectious diseases experts noted that ventilation standards for planes are high, and that there have been no major COVID-19 clusters originating from flights.  “Travelling in commercial aircraft is much safer than people think,” said Professor Dale Fisher, senior consultant at the National University Hospital’s Division of Infectious Diseases.  The air in a plane is changed over every three minutes, he said. About 60 per cent of the air entering the cabin is completely fresh and from outside, while the other 40 per cent is passed through hospital-grade HEPA, or high-efficiency particulate air filters, which remove 99.97 per cent of airborne particles.  “This is why there have been no major clusters on planes. It is almost impossible for COVID particles to be wafting through a plane. So I think it is reasonable to not wear a mask – unless of course you have a respiratory infection,” said Prof Fisher.  Travellers also remove their masks when eating and drinking on the plane, he noted.  By not wearing a mask throughout the flight and taking them off sometimes, they would be exposing themselves to those around them during those periods, said Prof Fisher, who is also Professor of Medicine at the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine. Another infectious diseases expert, Dr Leong Hoe Nam, said the HEPA filters are ""as good as it gets"". But Dr Leong, who runs a private practice at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, said transmission could still occur ""three rows in front of and behind your seat"". “Given that passengers in coach are packed close together, this doesn't give much comfort. Business class and first-class patients will be exposed as well. All you need is one patient,” he told CNA.  To avoid falling sick while on holiday, he advised travellers to continue wearing a mask on flights even if it is optional. Different individuals are at different levels of risk if they catch COVID-19, and this may influence their decision to wear a mask on a flight, experts said.  For example, those who are younger or who have recovered recently from COVID-19 “may brave it”, said Dr Leong.  However, some reports indicate that people could catch COVID-19 again as early as 17 days after a prior infection, he said.  Those who are more vulnerable might choose to wear a mask if their immunity is poor, Dr Leong said. This could include transplant patients who are on various immunosuppressive drugs, cancer survivors, or if they are returning home to family members who are at higher risk.  Professor Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, advocated that travellers should do ""whatever they are comfortable with"". “For people who are immunocompromised or who have not been infected before, it would probably be a good idea to wear a mask through the flight although this may be uncomfortable,” he added.  “For those who are quadruple vaccinated and previously infected, the risks of severe disease are really low, so this is up to them.” Prof Fisher agreed that vaccinated people are at very low risk of severe disease. If someone seated nearby has symptoms, travellers could opt to wear a mask, he added. It would also be ideal if the cabin crew could ask passengers with symptoms to wear a mask.  “As a matter of course, it would be reasonable to encourage mask wearing when you can't distance and you are very vulnerable. But that is not because they are on a plane,” said Prof Fisher, stressing again that the ventilation on commercial planes is superior “to almost any other setting”.  Basic hygiene on the flight is important, said Prof Tambyah. A study on H1N1 during a long-haul flight in 2009 also showed that sleeping through the flight was protective, he said. “Personally, I think that climbing over someone to get to the toilet or the snack bar is a high-risk activity,” he added. ""Having said that, not moving around on a plane puts one at risk of a deep vein thrombosis ('economy class syndrome') so we have to make some choices."" Dr Leong recommended that travellers wear a KN94, KN95 or N95 mask throughout their flights.  They could also eat their meals before or after everyone else, and wipe down their chairs and tray tables with disposable, single-use alcohol wipes, he said.  Many travellers also take their masks off in the toilet to breathe better, said Dr Leong.  “But this may be their own undoing. The previous user could have left a ton of virus in the cubicle waiting for you.”  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/million-covid-19-deaths-2022-who-2900671,Million COVID-19 deaths in 2022: WHO,"GENEVA: The World Health Organization announced on Thursday (Aug 25) that a million people had died from COVID-19 in 2022, calling it a ""tragic milestone"" when all the tools existed to prevent deaths. Nearly 6.45 million deaths have been reported to the WHO since the virus was first detected in China in late 2019. But WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus questioned whether the world was really on top of the pandemic, this far in. ""This week, we crossed the tragic milestone of one million reported deaths so far this year,"" he told a press conference. ""We cannot say we are learning to live with COVID-19 when one million people have died with COVID-19 this year alone, when we are two-and-a-half years into the pandemic and have all the tools necessary to prevent these deaths. ""We ask all governments to strengthen their efforts to vaccinate all health workers, older people and others at the highest risk, on the way to 70 per cent vaccine coverage for the whole population."" Tedros wanted all countries to have vaccinated 70 per cent of their populations by the end of June. But 136 countries failed to reach the target, of which 66 still had coverage below 40 per cent. ""It is pleasing to see that some countries with the lowest vaccination rates are now making up ground, especially in Africa,"" Tedros said Thursday. He said only 10 countries had less than 10 per cent coverage, most of which were facing humanitarian emergencies. ""However, much more needs to be done,"" said Tedros. ""One-third of the world's population remains unvaccinated, including two-thirds of health workers and three-quarters of older adults in low-income countries. ""All countries at all income levels must do more to vaccinate those most at risk, to ensure access to life-saving therapeutics, to continue testing and sequencing, and to set tailored, proportionate policies to limit transmission and save lives."" Derrick Sim of the Gavi vaccine alliance said a million deaths in 2022 was a million too many. ""Behind each statistic is a very real human tragedy, and as ... the world deals with competing priorities, we cannot become numb to the toll the pandemic is having on individuals, families, and communities,"" he said. More than 593 million cases have now been reported to the UN health agency. Despite testing rates having dropped sharply in many countries, around half of those cases were reported this year. The Omicron variant accounted for 99 per cent of virus samples collected in the last 30 days that have been sequenced and uploaded to the GISAID global science initiative. Of these, the BA.5 group of Omicron sub-variants remain globally dominant at 74 per cent. ""There is increasing diversity within BA.5 descendent lineages, with additional mutations in the spike and non-spike regions,"" the WHO said. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/vaccination-differentiated-safe-management-measures-fnb-events-nightclubs-masks-2899566,"Vaccination-differentiated rules remain for F&B outlets, large events, nightlife venues even as mask-wearing becomes optional","SINGAPORE: Vaccination-differentiated safe management measures (VDS) will remain for food and beverage (F&B) outlets, large events and nightlife venues, even as mask-wearing becomes optional for these places from next Monday (Aug 29). Speaking at a press conference held by the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong reiterated that VDS checks are currently only required for events with more than 500 participants and dining in at F&B outlets.  However, Mr Wong added that F&B outlets no longer check for vaccination status because the onus is placed on the individual, and random spot checks are conducted by the authorities. ""For now, we are retaining this approach ... there is no change to this because vaccinations are still the best way to protect ourselves against severe disease from COVID-19,"" said Mr Wong.  This means that only fully vaccinated individuals will be able to dine in at F&B outlets, attend large events with more than 500 participants at any one time or enter nightlife venues.  The Singapore Nightlife Business Association (SNBA) said it welcomed the continuation of VDS measures for nightlife establishments.  ""Keeping VDS requirements is good, as the high vaccination rates have helped Singapore ride through the last COVID-19 wave,"" said Mr Nasen Thiagarajan, president of the Singapore Nightlife Business Association. However, mask-wearing at events will be optional from next Monday, said Mr Wong adding that events are not essential services where a higher proportion of older people are more likely to be exposed to COVID-19.  Mr Wong added that event organisers and venue operators can decide on whether participants will have to wear their masks.  ""Event organisers and venue operators may well decide on a case-by-case basis, depending on the settings, depending on the event, that they would still continue with masks as a requirement,"" he said. ""Allowing optional masks indoors will help guests and staff alike make their own choices. Nightlife establishments can then focus on good customer service and their business as they will not have to keep reminding customers to mask up,"" said Mr Nasen. He also said that the move will make it a lot easier for staff not handling the preparation of food and drink, as wearing the masks and working for 6 to 8 hours in a nightlife establishment has been uncomfortable for them.  The Restaurant Association of Singapore also welcomed the easing of mask-wearing rules.  ""We are confident that customers and consumers will continue to exercise discretion and good conscience in not engaging in high-risk activities including masking off when it is inappropriate to do so,"" it said.  The association, which represents more than 800 brands that operate over 5,000 restaurants, also asked for all restaurant businesses to continue to uphold clean and safe standards such as washing hands properly and regularly sanitising high-touch surfaces.  From next Monday, people in Singapore will not be required to wear a mask except on public transport and in healthcare facilities.  Masks will still have to be worn on transport modes such as the MRT, LRT and public buses, as well as in indoor public transport facilities like boarding areas at bus interchanges and MRT platforms.  But they will not be required at airports, naturally ventilated bus interchanges and in the retail areas of bus interchanges, MRT and LRT stations. Masks will be optional on private transport modes such as taxis, school buses and private bus services, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a separate press release on Wednesday.  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/pfizer-paxlovid-covid-19-treatment-pill-showed-no-benefit-younger-adults-study-2898861,Pfizer's Paxlovid COVID-19 treatment pill showed no benefit in younger adults: Study,"WASHINGTON: Pfizer's COVID-19 pill appears to provide little or no benefit for younger adults, while still reducing the risk of hospitalisation and death for high-risk seniors, according to a large study published on Wednesday (Aug 24). The results from a 109,000-patient Israeli study are likely to renew questions about the US government's use of Paxlovid, which has become the go-to treatment for COVID-19 due to its at-home convenience. The Biden administration has spent more than US$10 billion purchasing the drug and making it available at thousands of pharmacies through its test-and-treat initiative. The researchers found that Paxlovid reduced hospitalisations among people 65 and older by roughly 75 per cent when given shortly after infection. That's consistent with earlier results used to authorise the drug in the US and other nations. But people between the ages of 40 and 65 saw no measurable benefit, according to the analysis of medical records. The study has limitations due to its design, which compiled data from a large Israeli health system rather than enrolling patients in a randomised study with a control group - the gold-standard for medical research. The findings reflect the changing nature of the pandemic, in which the vast majority of people already have some protection against the virus due to vaccination or prior infection. For younger adults, in particular, that greatly reduces their risks of severe COVID-19 complications. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently estimated that 95 per cent of Americans 16 and older have acquired some level of immunity against the virus. “Paxlovid will remain important for people at the highest risk of severe COVID-19, such as seniors and those with compromised immune systems,” said Dr David Boulware, a University of Minnesota researcher and physician, who was not involved in the study. “But for the vast majority of Americans who are now eligible, this really doesn’t have a lot of benefit."" A spokesman for Pfizer declined to comment on the results, which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The US Food and Drug Administration authorised Paxlovid late last year for adults and children 12 and older who are considered high risk due to conditions like obesity, diabetes and heart disease. More than 42 per cent of US adults are considered obese, representing 138 million Americans, according to the CDC. At the time of the FDA decision there were no options for treating COVID-19 at home, and Paxlovid was considered critical to curbing hospitalisations and deaths during the pandemic's second winter surge. The drug's results were also far stronger than a competing pill from Merck. The FDA made its decision based on a Pfizer study in high-risk patients who hadn't been vaccinated or treated for prior COVID-19 infection. “Those people do exist but they’re relatively rare because most people now have either gotten vaccinated or they’ve gotten infected,” Boulware said. Pfizer reported earlier this summer that a separate study of Paxlovid in healthy adults - vaccinated and unvaccinated - failed to show a significant benefit. Those results have not yet been published in a medical journal. More than 3.9 million prescriptions for Paxlovid have been filled since the drug was authorised, according to federal records. A treatment course is three pills twice a day for five days. A White House spokesman on Wednesday pointed to several recent papers suggesting Paxlovid helps reduce hospitalisations among people 50 and older. The studies have not been published in peer-reviewed journals. “Risk for severe outcomes from COVID is along a gradient, and the growing body of evidence is showing that individuals between the ages of 50 and 64 can also benefit from Paxlovid,” Kevin Munoz said in an emailed statement. Administration officials have been working for months to increase use of Paxlovid, opening thousands of sites where patients who test positive can fill a prescription. Last month, US officials further expanded access by allowing pharmacists to prescribe the drug. The White House recently signalled that it may soon stop purchasing COVID-19 vaccines, drugs and tests, shifting responsibility to private insurance market. Under that scenario, insurers could set new criteria for when they would pay for patients to receive Paxlovid. "

Starting next Monday, people in Singapore will not be required to wear a mask except on public transport and in healthcare facilities, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong announced on Wednesday. Masks will be optional on private transport modes such as taxis, school buses and private bus services.  ""The taxi driver can suggest, request, but there is no law to require ... This is not enforceable, there is no basis of law for the taxi driver to say you have to. It's optional,"" said Mr Wong. In response to CNA's queries, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said it encouraged drivers and passengers of taxi and private-hire operators to continue wearing masks, especially if drivers are ferrying passengers who are unwell. Some drivers plan to embrace the relaxed rules and do away with masks from Monday.   A 53-year-old Grab driver who only wanted to be known as Mark said he only wears a mask now because it is required. He takes it off after his passengers alight. With masks being optional, he does not plan to wear one.  “The reason (is) because I am vaccinated and I had COVID-19 in July. Anyway, currently out of 10 people, about six would either not wear their mask properly or pull it down. I got tired of telling them to mask up,” he told CNA.  “After I had COVID-19, I basically did not get bothered much, but if I hear them cough or have a runny nose, I do ask them to mask up.” So far, passengers have been understanding when Mark asks them to wear their masks properly. But he believes most people will not wear a mask in the car from next week.  “Personally, I am happy that we can choose not to wear them from next week,” he added. “(But) Grab (has given) us a pack of masks. So if the rider forgets to bring theirs, I do offer them a mask.”  Grab told CNA that it does not require drivers or passengers to wear masks, but strongly encouraged them to do so if they feel unwell. Another Grab driver who contracted COVID-19 before expressed similar sentiments as Mark. David Lee, 38, said he will not wear a mask since it is not mandatory inside private hire cars. He plies the road at least 12 hours a day, for six days a week.  “Firstly, I have recovered from COVID-19 and strongly believe we should live with the virus while taking great care of ourselves, especially with hygiene. Secondly, it can get really stuffy or suffocating to be wearing a mask inside a vehicle and under the treacherous weather,” he said.  “But I will still continue to sanitise the car every two to three hours or so.” Mr Lee does not expect his passengers to wear their masks since he will not be wearing one himself. But he hopes they will still practise social responsibility and wear a mask if they think they have a cough or flu, especially a bad one.  “In the case of the passenger being unwell and refusing to wear a mask, actually there’s nothing we can do about it because we will only notice it about five minutes after picking them up,” he added.  “Given the guidelines, we can’t (drop) passengers as and where we deem fit, apart from their chosen location, unless in extreme cases of bodily threat. So for me, in this case, I will wear a mask if the passenger is unwell and refuses to wear one.”  As for 45-year-old William Tan, a private hire driver of a luxury vehicle, he is looking forward to driving without a mask.  “As I am driving a luxury vehicle, the distance between me and my passengers is (quite a bit). Thus it wouldn’t be an issue or be hazardous to health if I'm not wearing a mask,"" he added. Mr Tan suggested that taxi drivers who prefer their passengers to mask up should put up a sticker to inform them. In the case of private hire vehicle drivers, they can send the passenger a “courtesy message” before picking them up.  “This way, it would minimise the unhappiness between drivers and passengers,” he said. Not all drivers plan to remove their masks on the job, even if they are happy for their passengers to do so. “I will continue to wear (my mask) when inside my taxi. I am used to wearing a mask everywhere I go, except during meal times,” said Mr Toh Swee Bin, who has been a taxi driver for almost nine years.  The 46-year-old admitted that he currently has passengers who forget their masks, but he is “okay with it”.  “Because I think it’s time for the Government to be relaxed on this issue,” he said.  Taxi driver Soh Lai Kim, 62, prefers to keep his mask on. Even though he has contracted COVID-19 and has also received his booster shot, his wife has not been infected.  Mr Toh told CNA that he cannot force his passengers to put on their masks as he knows it will be optional from Monday. “If they cough, I will just remind them, 'please can you help me ... Put on your mask'. They will usually listen to me when I ask them,” he said. "

The ride-hailing firm also encouraged driver-partners to increase the ventilation of vehicles by avoiding the use of recirculation mode of the air-conditioning system, and to regularly clean and disinfect their vehicles. ""If agreeable by the passengers and partners, wind down windows to improve air ventilation,"" it added.  ComfortDelGro, Singapore's largest taxi operator, pointed to the Land Transport Authority's (LTA) Facebook page when asked about the company's policy on mask-wearing. LTA's Facebook post reiterated the announcement by the Health Ministry that masks will be optional from Aug 29, except on public buses and trains, as well as indoor public transport settings such as boarding areas within bus interchanges and after passing through fare gates at underground MRT stations. Masks will be optional on private transport modes such as taxis, school buses and private bus services. TADA declined to comment. Besides public transport, mask-wearing will still be required in healthcare facilities, residential care homes and ambulances. Explaining the requirement for masks in these places, co-chair of the COVID-19 task force Lawrence Wong said these are ""areas where essential services are being carried out in enclosed and crowded spaces, and which are frequently used by vulnerable persons"". Responding to a reporter's question about whether employers can mandate masks at the workplace, Mr Wong said businesses have the discretion to decide.  ""That option remains because we are lifting the mandatory requirement for mask-wearing. But it is optional, employers may choose to decide. For that matter, in certain settings, industry regulators might also decide that it is a safety requirement,"" he added. For instance, food handlers will still have to wear masks or a spit guard. On flights, mask-wearing requirements will depend on the rules or laws in the destination country as well as the airline.  Singapore Airlines said on Wednesday that its passengers will not be required to wear masks on flights from Aug 29 unless they are travelling to and from destinations that mandate it.

Japan has maintained some of the strictest pandemic border measures among major economies, requiring travellers to present a negative coronavirus test taken within 72 hours of departure. ""From Sep 7, we will no longer require people who have been vaccinated three times to present proof that they are not infected,"" said Kishida, who addressed reporters online as he is recuperating from COVID-19 at his official residence. Domestic and foreign business groups have urged a greater relaxation of Japan's border controls, saying the measures risk inflicting further economic pain. Kishida said in May that he wanted to bring Japan's border measures more in line with those of other Group of Seven nations. Japan in June opened up to tourists for the first time in two years, but requirements that they apply for visas and stick to guided, package tours have kept actual numbers of inbound visitors small. Local media reported on Tuesday that Japan may raise a daily cap on inbound travellers from 20,000 to 50,000, but no decision has been made, Kishida said. ""We will continue relaxing these measures gradually,"" he said. ""We hope to announce something soon based on the quarantine setup and the situation with infections."" The border easing comes as Japan deals with a seventh wave of infections, driven by the infectious BA.4 and BA.5 variants, that have forced companies to idle production lines and driven COVID-19 deaths to a record 343 on Tuesday. All the same, Kishida is pushing a living ""with corona"" strategy of weathering the surge without imposing restrictions on businesses or mobility, and focusing medical resources on elderly and high-risk patients.

Masks will still have to be worn on transport modes such as the MRT, LRT and public buses, as well as in indoor public transport facilities like boarding areas at bus interchanges and MRT platforms. Masks will be optional on private transport modes such as taxis, school buses and private bus services. Passengers should check with private operators for additional service requirements, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said.  While it will no longer be mandatory, drivers and passengers of taxis and private-hire vehicles are encouraged to continue wearing masks, especially if they feel unwell, said the Land Transport Authority. Masks will not be required at airports, naturally ventilated bus interchanges and in the retail areas of bus interchanges, MRT and LRT stations. MOH director of medical services Kenneth Mak said during a press conference that when it comes to international flights, the requirement depends on what the rules are in the destination of choice as well as the airline. ""The carrier may have requirements imposed based on his country of origin as well, so where there's a mandatory requirement for masks to be worn ... the mask must be worn on the flight itself,"" he said. However, there are countries where mask-wearing may be optional, like in the United States, he added. ""In that setting, where countries do not enforce or will not require mask-wearing, flights to those destinations will not require mandated wearing on board the flight as long as the carrier has no such requirement as a condition for travel on that particular carrier as well,"" said Assoc Prof Mak. This means that passengers will need to wear their masks on outbound commercial flights and ferries from Singapore to destinations that require mask-wearing onboard. This also goes for inbound commercial flights and ferries into Singapore from destinations that require mask-wearing onboard, the MOH said. But masks are not required on outbound commercial flights and ferries from Singapore to destinations that do not require mask-wearing onboard, and inbound commercial flights and ferries into Singapore from destinations that do not require mask-wearing onboard. Singapore Airlines said its passengers will not be required to wear masks on flights from Aug 29 unless they are travelling to or from destinations that mandate it. The airline provided a list of destinations where masks are required. Healthcare facilities, residential care homes and ambulances will keep the mask-wearing requirement. These include welfare and sheltered homes for the aged, as well as adult disability homes.  The same goes for COVID-19 care facilities, testing centres and vaccination centres. Masks will also be needed at retail and F&B establishments and common areas located within hospital buildings, national specialty centres and polyclinics. However, masks are not required at physiotherapy and other allied health clinics for services like speech therapy and occupational therapy located outside hospitals, MOH said. Masks are also not needed at facilities providing non-residential community services like centre-based service, day care services and home care services. While the multi-ministry task force did not provide information on mask-wearing in schools during its press conference on Wednesday, the Prime Minister said earlier in his National Day Rally speech that masks should not be needed during classes. “The children do need to be able to see the facial expressions of their teachers and of each other ... It's crucial for their learning and development,” he said. Existing sector requirements on mask-wearing for food handlers continue to apply, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) said in a statement on Wednesday. SFA made it a requirement in April 2020 for all food handlers to wear masks or other forms of physical barriers. This applies to all personnel engaged in the sale and preparation of food and drinks at retail F&B establishments, including hawker centres, coffee shops, restaurants, supermarkets, trade fairs, and non-retail food establishments, including food processing establishments and slaughterhouses, SFA said. ""All food handlers will still be required to wear over his nose and mouth a mask or spit guard that is capable of preventing any substance expelled from his mouth or nose from contaminating food,"" SFA said. Face shields are not allowed because they are not considered as being effective physical barriers, due to a large gap at the bottom of the shield. Those bringing plated food to consumers, collecting payments, or who are involved in cleaning work need not wear masks, said Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment Amy Khor.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-non-fully-vaccination-travel-enter-singapore-2896746,Non-fully vaccinated travellers will soon be allowed to enter Singapore without applying for approval,"SINGAPORE: Non-fully vaccinated long-term pass holders and short-term visitors aged 13 and above travelling to Singapore from Monday (Aug 29) will no longer need to apply for entry approval, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a news release on Wednesday. They will also not be required to undergo a seven-day stay-home notice (SHN) upon arrival or take a polymerase chain reaction test at the end of the SHN period, the ministry said, pointing to the improving local and global COVID-19 situation. However, non-fully vaccinated travellers must still present a negative pre-departure test within two days before departing for Singapore, MOH said. Non-fully vaccinated short-term visitors must still buy COVID-19 travel insurance to cover the duration of their stay in Singapore. Currently, all non-fully vaccinated travellers are generally not allowed to enter Singapore except for ""compelling reasons"" like attending to a critically ill family member or if they are family members of a Singapore citizen, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority said on its website. ""As long-term pass holders are expected to stay in Singapore for a longer period of time, they will continue to be required to meet all vaccination-differentiated safe management measures requirements after their arrival in Singapore,"" MOH said. For travel to Singapore, travellers who test positive for COVID-19 should defer their travel plans and not board commercial flights or ferries, as they may infect fellow passengers and crew while infectious, MOH said. ""They should only resume their travel when they test negative, and at least 72 hours from the time they first test positive,"" it added. Those who are vaccinated should travel on or after day 7 if they continue to test positive, while non-fully vaccinated people aged 12 years and above should only resume travel on day 14 if they continue to test positive, the ministry said.  MOH also reminded all travellers entering Singapore via air or sea to also submit their electronic health declaration before they enter Singapore, using the SG Arrival Card e-service up to three days before arrival. ""Travellers are strongly encouraged to do so before departing for Singapore to facilitate a smooth arrival process in Singapore,"" it said. Those putting in new applications for long-term passes and work passes must still be vaccinated against COVID-19, MOH said. This is to sustain the high vaccination rates in the population, support safe reopening of society and economy, and minimise business disruptions, it said. Those who wish to renew their work passes will not be subjected to a vaccination requirement from Oct 1, MOH said, although this will not apply to work permit and S Pass renewals for those living in dormitories or working in the construction, marine shipyard and process sectors. These workers must still be vaccinated before renewing their passes as their worksites and dormitories are settings at higher risk of disease spread, MOH explained. When asked about the potential easing of dormitory restrictions, like requiring residents to apply for a pass before heading out to four ""popular places"" on Sundays and public holidays, COVID-19 multi-ministry task force co-chair Lawrence Wong said the authorities will continue to review whether they could be relaxed. ""But in the longer term, not just for COVID, we also want to make sure that there is a good spread, and not a high concentration of people in a few places leading to other concerns,"" the Deputy Prime Minister said. ""Not necessarily COVID, could be security, could be congestion, other issues as well. So in fact, we are looking at how we can do more with recreational centres for example, so that there will be more options for our dorm workers during the weekends."" "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-vaccination-booster-children-aged-5-11-recommended-moh-2896726,MOH to offer COVID-19 booster shot for children aged 5 to 11,"SINGAPORE: Children aged 5 to 11 are now recommended to receive one booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine, from five months after the second dose of their primary vaccination series. Preparations are under way to start inoculating the group in the fourth quarter of the year, “likely when examinations in primary schools are towards the tail end or over”, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a news release on Wednesday (Aug 24) The move comes on the recommendation of the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination. MOH said that the booster dose will sustain protection against severe illness and strengthen Singapore's preparation for the next infection wave.   Five dedicated vaccination centres will be set up to administer booster doses for these children, with more details to be announced closer to the date. ""Our local data shows that in children ... the degree of vaccine protection against hospitalisation for severe COVID infection does decline over time, as it does in adolescents and adults,"" said MOH's director of medical services Kenneth Mak at a press conference held by the multi-ministry task force on Wednesday. ""And in this age range, the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine has been shown to increase antibody levels more than twice the levels achieved after completing two primary doses."" In a local study on vaccination using the shot in children between 5 and 11 years of age, there was a ""lower incidence of adverse events following vaccination"", compared to older age groups, added Associate Professor Mak. 
Speaking in Parliament at the start of August, Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary had acknowledged that a third mRNA dose for this group of children “may be necessary at some point to keep protection levels high”.  On Wednesday, MOH also said that the Health Sciences Authority has just extended the authorisation of Moderna’s Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine via the Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR) to children, including children aged 6 months up to 5 years.  ""The vaccine will be administered as a course of two 25 microgram doses, which is a reduced dose formulation compared to that offered in older age groups,"" said Assoc Prof Mak.  ""The clinical studies have shown that the antibody levels following two doses of Spikevax administered 28 days apart as the primary vaccination regime in these children to be comparable to that seen in adults.  ""The vaccine appears to be (as) effective in preventing COVID-19 as for mRNA vaccinations in the older age groups, and we expect the vaccine to have benefit in protecting these children against severe infection."" MOH said in its news release that a decision on the recommendation for vaccination of this age group is expected soon. ""If approved, we will time it together with the booster exercise for children aged 5 to 11, and administer them at the same centres for the convenience of parents,” MOH said in its news release.  Assoc Prof Mak on Wednesday also addressed the risk of severe COVID-19 infection in children.  ""(The risk) is generally lower in children, but severe outcomes do occur for some children infected with COVID-19. For example, our pediatricians at KK Hospital and NUH have had to treat young children presenting to the hospital with breathlessness and upper airway narrowing as a result of COVID-19 infection, which can affect quite significantly the upper airways of the sick child,"" he said. ""Other children have been admitted into the ICU for severe pneumonia or following recovery from acute COVID-19 infection, for multi organ inflammatory syndrome in children or MIS-C."" Assoc Prof Mak highlighted that the risk for hospitalisation in affected children between 5 and 11 was 1.3 per cent among children who are not vaccinated against COVID-19, but 0.4 per cent among children who were vaccinated.  ""And therefore, from the risk-benefit perspective, we believe that vaccination offered to children, particularly (for those) less than five years of age, would have benefit in reducing the risk and likelihood of severe infections arising,"" he said.  Assoc Prof Mak added that adverse events seen in adolescents are similar to those in adults, and not common.  ""Most are mild in severity and similar to that (of) reported childhood vaccinations, such as injection site pain, fever, fatigue and headaches. And these symptoms are reactions, generally associated with vaccinations, and expected as part of the body's natural response to build up immunity against COVID-19. These symptoms generally resolve on their own within a few days,"" he said. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-vaccine-second-booster-elderly-60-above-2896741,Second COVID-19 booster now recommended for people aged 60 and above: MOH,"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) is expanding the age range for people recommended to receive a second COVID-19 booster shot to include those aged 60 and above, the ministry announced on Wednesday (Aug 24). The previous recommendation was for those aged 80 years and older. At a multi-ministry task force press conference, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said about 80 per cent of the population has had a booster shot. “This is a key reason why we could ride through the current BA.5 variant without tightening SMMs (safe distancing measures), without having many severe cases and without having our hospitals being overwhelmed,” he said. “So to prepare for a possible year-end wave, we will have to expand our vaccination coverage.” The first booster provides good protection against hospitalisation and severe COVID-19 in people aged 60 to 79, MOH said. However, the ministry expects the protection to gradually wane, given that it has been more than a year since the first booster was administered to this age group. “We need to keep our vaccinations up-to-date, to prepare for possible future infection waves,” it said. MOH added that the latest evidence indicates that a second booster increased vaccine effectiveness against severe diseases from 94 per cent to 97 per cent for those aged 70 to 79. For those aged 60 to 69, this effectiveness went up from 97 per cent to 98 per cent. Speaking at the press conference, MOH director of medical services Kenneth Mak said that a second mRNA booster dose reduces the number of people aged 60 years and above from getting severe infection by as much as 50 per cent. Based on the data, MOH said it agreed with the recommendation by the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V) for all people aged 60 and above to receive a second booster at least five months after their first booster. People who are medically vulnerable are also encouraged to receive their second booster, MOH said, adding that it will continue to offer the second booster to all people aged 50 to 59. All those eligible for their primary series vaccination, first booster or second booster may receive their doses by walking into any of the ten Joint Testing and Vaccination Centres located across Singapore. Appointments can also be booked at these centres, participating Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs), or polyclinics via SMS invitations. Mr Ong said at the press conference that there is ""every likelihood"" of a next infection wave. While the BA.5 variant COVID-19 wave that just subsided will give Singapore ""good protection"" for a possible year-end wave, the country should prepare for a northern hemisphere winter wave coming its way, he said.  ""When it comes, we need to be more prepared, more resilient than now,"" he said, adding that the wave may be of a different nature and be driven by a different variant. The next wave will be a ""reinfection wave"", he added.  Given that data from MOH shows that an estimated 70 per cent of the population has been infected with COVID-19 already, the next wave ""must comprise many reinfections"", Mr Ong said. MOH has been monitoring reinfection numbers closely because it will give the authorities an idea of when the next wave can happen, he added.  So far, data shows that after an infection, the probability of being infected again eight months later is ""very low"", said the Health Minister. ""Nevertheless, reinfections are increasing as a proportion of total daily cases,"" he added.  This month, the proportion is 5.5 per cent, up from the 2 to 3 per cent he stated in Parliament recently, he said. He added that with fewer and fewer COVID-naive individuals - or people who have not been infected with COVID-19 - that percentage will rise. Mr Ong also said at the press conference that a new type of facility called transitional care facilities (TCFs) may reduce the workload in hospitals if there is a surge in patients requiring hospitalisation during a COVID-19 wave.  During the recent outbreak, people who were warded were mainly patients with chronic illnesses, some of whom happened to also have COVID-19, said the Health Minister. In these cases, the TCF will become a treatment place for non-COVID patients.  During a COVID-19 wave, a TCF can become a community treatment facility for lower-risk COVID-19 patients, he added. The Health Minister cited the example of Sengkang Community Hospital, which has 164 beds and was used as a TCF a few months ago. ""It worked very well because it's next to Sengkang General Hospital and the two facilities worked hand in hand and managed to decant many patients from acute hospitals to TCF, reducing the heavy workload in Sengkang,"" he said. With Connect@Changi Hall 10 being progressively converted from a community treatment facility to a TCF,  by end-September, there will be a total of 364 TCF beds. Mr Ong also noted that general practitioners play a ""vital role"" in the fight against COVID-19. ""They look after COVID-19 patients without severe symptoms. They are also prescribing therapeutics like oral antivirals and these drugs reduce the number of infected persons who go on to develop severe illnesses and they lessen the load on hospitals,"" he said. He added that another improvement in healthcare capacity is telemedicine, which has been ""very useful"" in preserving capacity in hospitals, polyclinics and at GP clinics. Singapore will ramp up telemedicine capacity from 1,500 per day to 9,600 a day ""to prepare ourselves for any possibility of future surges"", Mr Ong said. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/masks-indoors-required-public-transport-taxis-healthcare-hospitals-clinics-2896631,"Wearing a mask to be optional from Aug 29, except on public transport and in healthcare facilities","SINGAPORE: From next Monday (Aug 29), people in Singapore will not be required to wear a mask except on public transport and in healthcare facilities, announced Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on Wednesday (Aug 24).  Masks will still have to be worn on transport modes such as the MRT, LRT and public buses, as well as in indoor public transport facilities like boarding areas at bus interchanges and MRT platforms, said Mr Wong, speaking at a press conference held by the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force.  But they will not be required at airports, naturally ventilated bus interchanges and in the retail areas of bus interchanges, MRT and LRT stations. Masks will be optional on private transport modes such as taxis, school buses and private bus services, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a separate press release on Wednesday.  ""The taxi driver can suggest, request, but there is no law to require ... This is not enforceable, there is no basis of law for the taxi driver to say you have to. It's optional,"" said Mr Wong, who is co-chair of the COVID-19 task force.  Healthcare facilities, residential care homes and ambulances will keep their mask-wearing requirement. These include welfare and sheltered homes for the aged, as well as adult disability homes.  On flights, mask-wearing requirements will depend on the rules or laws in the destination country as well as the carrier, said MOH's director of medical services Kenneth Mak.  ""Where there is a mandatory requirement for masks to be worn ... the mask must be worn on the flight itself.""  But passengers will not have to do so on flights to or from countries where mask-wearing is not mandatory – as long as the airline does not have such a requirement, he added. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong first announced the easing of Singapore's mask-wearing requirements in his National Day Rally speech last Sunday.  Mr Wong said on Wednesday that masks remain required on public transport and in healthcare facilities because these are ""areas where essential services are being carried out in enclosed and crowded spaces, and which are frequently used by vulnerable persons"".  Responding to a reporter's question about whether employers can mandate masks at the workplace, Mr Wong said businesses have the discretion to decide.  ""That option remains because we are lifting the mandatory requirement for mask-wearing. But it is optional, employers may choose to decide. For that matter, in certain settings, industry regulators might also decide that it is a safety requirement.""  For example, food handlers will still have to wear masks or a spit guard. Face shields, which are not considered an ""effective physical barrier"" due to a large gap at the bottom of the shield that can cause food contamination, are not approved for use, said the Singapore Food Agency. This applies to all workers who sell or prepare food and drinks, including hawker centres, coffee shops, restaurants and supermarkets, as well as non-retail businesses such as food processing establishments and slaughterhouses. Those serving plated food to consumers, collecting payments, or who are involved in cleaning need not wear masks, said Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment. Experts have also advised that the elderly and immuno-compromised should continue to wear masks in crowded indoor settings to reduce their risk of catching any respiratory infections, MOH said in its press release.  On mask-wearing at crowded places such as concerts, Mr Wong said it is unlikely that many vulnerable older people will be at these events. ""For these other settings, we are leaving it optional, but ... event organisers, venue operators may well decide on a case-by-case basis depending on the setting, depending on the event, that they will still continue with masks as a requirement."" Task force co-chair Gan Kim Yong noted that many people in Singapore are ""used to wearing masks"". ""Going forward even without COVID-19, when you're not feeling well, even though you've tested negative, please wear a mask if you do need to go out, if you need to go to work and interact with people,"" he said. ""This is basic public health hygiene practices, and I hope that this COVID-19 experience will help us inculcate that good habit.""  Singapore's COVID-19 infection numbers have steadily declined across all age groups since late July, and the number of daily hospitalised cases has halved from its recent peak last month, the Health Ministry said.  The country last significantly eased COVID-19 measures on Apr 26, when group size limits and safe-distancing requirements were lifted. SafeEntry and TraceTogether requirements were also removed for most settings. All employees were allowed to return to the workplace, and the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level was lowered from Orange to Yellow after more than two years.  The DORSCON framework, which gives an indication of the current disease situation, was raised to Orange on Feb 7, 2020, at the start of the pandemic. The requirement to wear masks outdoors was lifted on Mar 29, along with the doubling of social gathering group sizes from five to 10 people.  Restrictions on in-person visits to hospitals and residential care homes will also ease from Sep 1, said the Health Ministry.  Each patient and resident will be allowed two visitors at a time. Hospital visitors will have to abide by visiting hours while those at residential homes will have their visits capped at one hour. Visitors are encouraged to self-test ART negative on the day of the visit, the ministry said. People should also not visit their loved ones if they are unwell. Hospitals and homes may impose additional visitor limits or testing requirements, MOH added. They may also suspend visits if they have active COVID-19 clusters. Vaccination-differentiated measures – such as requiring diners at food and beverage outlets to be vaccinated against COVID-19 – will not change, said Mr Wong.  ""But businesses no longer check because the responsibility is placed on the individual, and we do random spot checks. For now, we are retaining this approach. So for now, there is no change to this because vaccinations are still the best way to protect ourselves against severe disease and COVID-19,"" said Mr Wong.  ""We are reviewing our vaccination policy to transit to a system where we keep our vaccinations up to date.""  The Government is studying how to define vaccinations that are up to date, and what the definition should be, he added, noting that the current policy stipulates that the first booster must be taken no later than 270 days after the primary series of COVID-19 vaccination.  ""As we transit to this new system, we will at that stage also review and update our VDS (vaccinated-differentiated safe-management measures) requirements.""  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/mask-indoors-mandate-low-risk-covid-19-ndr-2894711,Commentary: Low risk of getting COVID-19 from indoor places – even with masks off,"SINGAPORE: When Singapore first made it mandatory during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020 for people to wear masks any time they stepped out of their homes, many found it challenging to adopt the new practice.  Soon, they got used to it, and the reluctant wearing of masks became the norm – so much so that when Singapore lifted its outdoor mask mandate earlier this year, some said they felt ""awkward” taking off their masks, with many continuing to have them on out of habit. On Sunday (Aug 21), Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced in his National Day Rally speech that the mask requirement would be eased further. Masks will soon be optional indoors and required only on public transport and in healthcare settings. The decision to make mask-wearing optional in most indoor settings in this phase of the pandemic is not arbitrary. It reflects the timely recognition of the whole-of-government effort to empower the community with already well-informed risks and a high level of trust so people can make the best-informed choices for themselves and increase their sense of social responsibility to live with the virus. Community resilience during a public health crisis involves sustaining a fine balance between achieving a high level of general well-being and implementing evidence-based, targeted mandatory social restrictions to manage the public health threat. This timely empowering of trust in the community can help strengthen community resilience over time. It also serves to prepare Singapore to be stronger, together in facing future health threats. Mask-wearing has been instrumental in limiting COVID-19 transmission and outbreak clusters around the world, especially during the early phase of the pandemic when a vaccine was not yet available. Proper mask-wearing can reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection and other respiratory viruses, such as influenza, by at least 50 per cent, depending on the type of mask used and type of setting. Surgical masks and respirators (such as N95 or KN95, which are mostly used in healthcare settings) offer a greater reduction in risk of infection by up to 60 per cent and 80 per cent respectively, when well-fitted. But it is important to note that proper mask-wearing does not eliminate the risk of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, it is critical to practise multiple concurrent prevention measures, such as social distancing, frequent and proper handwashing, and vaccination to sustain a lower risk of infection. The risk of being exposed to COVID-19 in an indoor setting is highly dependent on several factors, which include ventilation, population density, duration of stay and type of activities involved. Indoor settings with a higher ratio of fresh air inflow to used air outflow, and higher flow rate into and out of the indoor setting, respectively, have been shown to lower the risk of exposure indoors. In addition, a lower density of people over a specific period of time and a shorter duration of stay (less than 15 minutes) within an indoor setting significantly reduce the risk of exposure. On the contrary, indoor settings where people interact vocally, such as through speaking, singing or cheering can increase the risk of getting the virus. With sustainable setting-specific herd immunity achieved due to the high population of vaccinees with boosters (79 per cent as of Aug 22), the risk of COVID-19 transmission in indoor settings has been significantly reduced. Accordingly, the likelihood of a susceptible individual (who has not been infected or vaccinated) being exposed indoors is also reduced. With highly accessible and available screening tools, such as antigen rapid test kits, as well as high compliance with voluntary testing and self-isolation upon testing positive among our community, the likelihood of a susceptible individual being exposed indoors will be even smaller. While the upcoming move to make mask-wearing optional in most indoor settings is very “refreshing” for many as we continue to learn to live with the disease, the risk of surges in COVID-19 incidence is still present. There is still a fundamental need to closely monitor evolving genetic variants of the virus using next-generation sequencing not just locally, but also regionally and globally. This would also provide insights into incidence trends over time to predict the transmissibility and severity of new variants so prompt action can be taken to manage and prevent future outbreaks. Epidemiologically, the risk of infection and severe COVID-19 disease would generally be higher among unvaccinated, elderly individuals with pre-existing co-morbidities or those who are immunocompromised than among young healthy adults who are vaccinated. Therefore, proper mask-wearing among these more vulnerable community groups or in settings like nursing homes, dialysis centres, community recreational centres for seniors and similar, particularly where activities involve active interaction with these highly vulnerable groups would still be highly recommended in indoor settings, in addition to the other preventive measures.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/japan-relaxing-covid-19-border-rules-pre-departure-tests-raise-arrival-caps-2894426,Japan weighs relaxing border rules on COVID-19: Report,"TOKYO: Japan may lift requirements for pre-departure COVID-19 tests for travellers and raise daily caps on entrants, domestic media have reported. Japan has some of the strictest pandemic border measures among major economies, requiring travellers to present a negative coronavirus test taken within 72 hours of departure. The government may soon waive tests for vaccinated passengers, with the change taking effect in a few weeks, Nikkei reported late on Monday (Aug 22). A daily cap of inbound travellers may be raised from 20,000 to 50,000 as early as next month, Fuji News Network said on Tuesday. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno declined to comment on the timing of any border easing, saying it would depend on COVID-19 conditions in Japan and overseas. ""Along with taking every measure to prevent contagion, we'll also promote economic activity - and with border control measures, we'll relax them in stages while keeping these two things in balance,"" Matsuno told reporters. Japan's foreign ministry said it is aware of the media reports, but deferred comment to the health ministry, which has jurisdiction over border infection controls. The health ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who is recuperating from COVID-19 at his home after testing positive on Sunday, said in May that he wanted to bring Japan's border measures more in line with those of other Group of Seven nations. Japan in June opened up to tourists for the first time in two years, though visitors must get visas and stick to guided, package tours. Domestic and foreign business groups have urged a greater relaxation of Japan's border controls, saying the measures risk causing the nation to fall behind economically. European and American business lobbies welcomed the reported easing measures, while urging that Japan reinstate visa-waiver eligibility for business and tourist travellers. ""We would like to reiterate that the need for business people to have a visa before departing for Japan is still an obstacle,"" European Business Council president Michael Mroczek said. ""This in particular for businesses that have no presence in Japan."" Om Prakash, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan, encouraged the government to align its border travel policies with other G7 countries ""to restore Japan's reputation as a welcoming and open place"".

Many women are continuing to delay their plans to marry or have children, it said, adding that rapid economic and social developments have led to ""profound changes"". Young people relocating to urban areas, more time spent on education and high-pressure working environments have also played their part, it added. Demographers have also said that China's uncompromising ""zero-COVID"" policy of promptly stamping out any outbreaks with strict controls on people's lives may have caused profound, lasting damage on their desire to have children. ""The coronavirus has also had a clear impact on the marriage and childbirth arrangements of some people,"" the commission said. The comments were sent to Reuters via fax late on Monday (Aug 22) in response to questions on the topic. New births in China are set to fall to record lows this year, demographers say, with forecasts calling for a drop below 10 million compared to last year's 10.6 million babies - a level 11.5 per cent lower than in 2020. China had a fertility rate of 1.16 in 2021, one of the lowest rates in the world and below the 2.1 rate the OECD sees as necessary for a stable population. Having imposed a one-child policy from 1980 to 2015, China has acknowledged its population is on the brink of shrinking - a potential crisis that will test its ability to pay and care for its elderly. To counter the problem, authorities at national and provincial levels have over the past year introduced measures such as tax breaks, longer maternity leave, enhanced medical insurance, housing subsidies and extra money for a third child."

The request to the Food and Drug Administration was for a so-called bivalent vaccine containing the dominant BA.4/BA.5 variants of the virus along with the original coronavirus strain. It is intended for ages 12 and above. Pfizer said it was ready to deliver doses for September under a US$3.2 billion deal in place with the US government for 105 million doses, including the Omicron-tailored shots. ""Having rapidly scaled up production, we are positioned to immediately begin distribution of the bivalent Omicron BA.4/BA.5 boosters, if authorised,"" Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said in a statement. Countries including the UK, the United States and EU members have been preparing for vaccination campaigns in the fall to protect against future surges. Britain became the first country to clear a bivalent vaccine, made by Moderna, last week. The FDA in June asked COVID-19 vaccine makers to tailor shots to target the two subvariants, and said it would not require new studies testing the shots in humans for authorization, similar to how annual changes to flu vaccines are handled. A mid-to-late-stage study of Pfizer's older BA.1-tailored vaccine has shown that the new shot generated a superior immune response against the subvariant compared with the original one. A study of the BA.4/BA.5 vaccine in people aged 12 years and older is expected to start this month. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/fauci-face-us-covid-19-response-step-down-government-posts-2893486,"Fauci, face of US COVID-19 response, to step down from government posts","Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease official who became the face of America's COVID-19 pandemic response under Presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden, announced on Monday (Aug 22) he is stepping down in December after more than five decades of public service. Fauci, whose efforts to fight the pandemic were applauded by many public health experts even as he was vilified by Trump and many Republicans, will be leaving his posts as chief medical adviser to Biden and director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health. Fauci, 81, has headed the institute since 1984. Fauci has served under seven US presidents beginning with Republican Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, focusing on newly emerging and re-emerging infectious disease threats including HIV/AIDS, Ebola, Zika, monkeypox and COVID-19. Fauci endured criticism from Trump and various conservatives and even death threats from people who objected to safeguards such as vaccination, social distancing and masking that he advocated to try to limit the lethality of the COVID-19 pandemic. ""As he leaves his position in the US Government, I know the American people and the entire world will continue to benefit from Dr Fauci's expertise in whatever he does next,"" Biden said in a statement. ""The United States of America is stronger, more resilient and healthier because of him."" In July, Fauci told Reuters he would retire by the end of Biden's first term, which runs to January 2025, adding that his departure could come much earlier than that. ""While I am moving on from my current positions, I am not retiring,"" Fauci said in a statement on Monday. ""After more than 50 years of government service, I plan to pursue the next phase of my career while I still have so much energy and passion for my field."" In the first months of the pandemic in 2020, Fauci helped lead scientific efforts to develop and test COVID-19 vaccines in record time and took part in regular televised White House briefings alongside Trump. Fauci became a popular and trusted figure among many Americans as the nation faced lockdowns and rising numbers of COVID-19 deaths, even inspiring the sale of cookies and bobblehead dolls featuring his likeness. However, Fauci drew the ire of Trump and many Republicans for cautioning against reopening the US economy too quickly and risking increased infections and for opposing the use of unproven treatments such as the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine. Democrats accused Trump of presiding over a disjointed response to the pandemic and of disregarding advice from public health experts including Fauci. Trump in October 2020, weeks before his re-election loss, called Fauci ""a disaster"" and complained that Americans were tired of hearing about the pandemic. Trump even made fun of Fauci's off-target ceremonial first pitch at a Washington Nationals baseball game. The US death toll from COVID-19 has exceeded one million, with more than 93 million recorded cases, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Asked in a July 2020 interview how he coped with the attacks on his character and allegiance to Trump as president, Fauci told Reuters, ""I don't let it bother me. What we're doing with vaccines, what we're doing with therapeutics, what we're doing with clinical trials is the real substance."" Attacks against Fauci by Republican Senator Rand Paul became a regular feature of Senate hearings on the pandemic, with heated exchanges over vaccine boosters and public funding of research. Fauci accused the senator of spreading misinformation. Paul on his website accused Fauci of ""ignoring good advice, and lying about everything from masks to the contagiousness of the virus"". At one hearing, the senator accused Fauci of smearing other scientists who disagreed with him. ""He's doing this for political reasons,"" Fauci told the hearing, citing fundraising appeals on Paul's website next to a call to have Fauci fired. Fauci will also step down as chief of the NIAID Laboratory of Immunoregulation. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/us-cdc-recommends-use-novavaxs-covid-19-vaccine-shot-adolescents-2893526,US CDC recommends use of Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine shot for adolescents,"The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Monday (Aug 22) signed off on the use of Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine for adolescents aged 12 through 17. The recommendation follows the US Food and Drug Administration's authorisation for the vaccine for the age group last week. The protein-based vaccine received emergency use authorisation in July for use among adults in the United States, with health officials hoping it would drive uptake among those skeptical of messenger RNA shots from Moderna and Pfizer. However, Novavax earlier this month halved its full-year revenue forecast, saying it does not expect further sales of its COVID-19 shot in the United States this year. The company said it was late to the US market and also pointed to softer demand in the face of a global vaccine supply glut. So far 11,990 Novavax vaccine doses have been administered in the United States, according to latest government data. The vaccine, which has already been cleared in countries such as Japan and Australia for use among adolescents, has also been plagued by manufacturing snags, regulatory delays and sluggish uptake in key markets such as Europe.

Students, all wearing face masks, queued to enter their classrooms and attended flag-raising ceremonies in their schoolyards across the country as the government phases out remote learning. ""For two years, we longed for face-to-face classes, so even if there's a flood, we will continue our lessons,"" said school teacher Mylene Ambrocio, 37, as she stood in ankle-deep water in a classroom in Pampanga province north of the capital. ""I am happy to see the children face-to-face."" Precautions such as temperature checks, mandatory masks and limits on the number of students per classroom remain in place. The country's school closures due to the pandemic were among the longest in the world, with their reopening delayed by slow vaccine roll-outs and elections earlier this year. In November 2021, the education ministry pilot tested in-person classes involving almost 300 schools but only this week broadened that out to cover all schools as the new school year got under way. The education ministry currently mandates that students learn in-person for at least three days a week. Starting on Nov 2, all schools should have transitioned to five days of in-person classes, it said. The shift to online classes, self-learning modules and educational television and radio programmes has proven extremely challenging for the country of more than 110 million where less than a fifth of households have Internet access and many lack mobile devices. Officials have underscored how important in-person learning is for the economy to achieve long-term growth. ""We are committed to pursuing the country's full reopening, including the return of face-to-face schooling to address the learning losses and increase domestic activities,"" economic and planning secretary Arsenio Balisacan said earlier this month.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/brain-fog-long-covid-19-symptoms-memory-focus-2881341,"Poor memory, can't focus: Why do some people experience brain fog after COVID-19?","Joan (not her real name) feels like she has been living in a fog since recovering from COVID-19 a month ago. A brain fog, to be exact. “The other day, I was chatting with someone over coffee. I remember looking at her face and hearing her voice. But my brain was not understanding what she was saying,” recalled the 34-year-old marketing manager. “Quite often, I can’t find the words when I want to describe something.” Changes to Joan’s routine also trip her up. “I’m usually the one to pick up my son. That day, I forgot that my husband would take him home instead,” she said. “Work held me back a little and I rushed out of the office feeling flustered. Then, when I got to the preschool, I had a mild panic attack because I couldn’t find my son.”  Most of the time, life post-COVID-19 is like ""I’ve taken cough medicine that causes drowsiness but I can’t sleep it off”, she said of the sluggishness. “I can’t think fast. I take a while to make decisions, even what to eat for dinner.”  WHAT’S CAUSING THE BRAIN FOG? You might have heard of friends, colleagues and family members complaining of (or maybe you’re experiencing it yourself) similar mental fuzziness after recovering from COVID-19 – and you might wonder: What is going on? “Brain fog is a layman term that describes slow or sluggish thinking that affects the memory, concentration and/or mental clarity. It is a self-reported symptom, and the definition can vary between individuals and clinicians,” said Associate Professor Kevin Tan, a senior consultant with the National Neuroscience Institute’s Department of Neurology.  The phenomenon isn’t limited to only COVID-19, continued Assoc Prof Tan. The so-called brain fog “can be attributed to many other reasons such as pregnancy, menopause, and recovery from other infections and minor head injuries”, he said. “Plus, it is also a known side-effect of certain medications such as some chemotherapy.” But the big question remains: Why does the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, affect cognitive capabilities such as memory, focus and functions including planning and multitasking? “This is not well understood at present,” said Assoc Prof Tan.  “There are small, preliminary studies, which demonstrate that there is ‘brain shrinkage’ after COVID-19, but these findings need to be replicated more widely and linked with other evidence of how the virus may affect the brain.” Neuropsychologist Professor Kamini Krishnan, noted on the Cleveland Clinic website, that brain fog could be the result of a cytokine storm. During an infection such as COVID-19, the body floods the bloodstream with inflammatory proteins known as cytokines to target the virus. The downside though, it can mount an exaggerated immune system response that can lead to further inflammation in organs such as the brain.  WHO IS PRONE TO BRAIN FOG AND HOW LONG CAN IT LAST? You aren’t alone in this if your memory and attention span take a beating after recovering from COVID-19. “Estimates for the rate of such cognitive dysfunction after COVID-19 infection range from 22 per cent to 32 per cent of cases,” said Assoc Prof Tan, adding that there doesn’t appear to be any likely factors such as age and gender that might contribute to the brain fog. According to this study on more than 3,000 people from 56 countries, the onset of brain fog occurred in about 31 per cent of the respondents in the first week of COVID-19 symptoms. It worsened over the first three months, peaking in almost 67 per cent of the participants, before decreasing in the following months. By the seventh month, about 55 per cent of them experienced cognitive dysfunction.  Brain fog is part of long COVID, which are symptoms that drag out over months. Furthermore, “people who have been in the ICU or required more severe forms of treatment tend to experience more brain fog,” said Prof Krishnan.  The reason could be, these patients often also experience other symptoms that can affect their mental acuity such as trouble sleeping, elevated stress levels or a significant change in their diet, she said. Still, it doesn’t mean you’re off the hook if your symptoms were mild: The memory lapses and difficulty in focusing may still occur, according to a German study that recruited 136 participants with an average age of 30 to play a brain game.  Nearly 40 per cent of them had recovered from COVID-19 but did not require hospitalisation, while the rest had not had COVID-19. It was found that the COVID-19 group did not do as well in areas that required attention as the other group. They also performed “significantly worse” on memory tasks.  The silver lining was, when the researchers followed up with the participants, their recovery in memory was noted within six months, whereas their attention improved within nine months of being infected.  “Symptoms often improve over time,” said Assoc Prof Tan. “However, this can take weeks to months because as with any infection, recovery can vary greatly between individuals.” WHAT CAN YOU DO TO LIFT THE FOG? Exercise may play a role in improving cognitive functions, especially aerobic ones such as running and cycling, according to Harvard Health. The increased capacity to transport oxygen to the brain could boost ""the number of blood vessels and synapses, increasing brain volume"". And if being social, playing games, engaging in crafting activities and reading were found to help seniors stave off mild cognitive impairment in a study, gathering some friends for a board-game night might also be the mental stimulant you need to lift the brain fog.   However, there isn't a magic formula that specifically targets the mental fuzziness caused by COVID-19, said Assoc Prof Tan, though you can't go wrong getting adequate sleep, eating a healthy, balanced diet, and avoiding smoking and stress. “Consider seeing your family doctor if your memory or cognitive issues significantly affect your daily activities and function, such as your ability to work,” said Assoc Prof Tan. “Medical help should focus on finding a cause as an individual with brain fog following COVID-19 may have other reasons for cognitive impairment to begin with.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/ndr-2022-key-takeaways-mask-requirements-377a-repeal-2891201,From reduced mask requirements to the repeal of 377A: 7 key takeaways from NDR 2022,"SINGAPORE: In his 2022 National Day Rally speech on Sunday (Aug 21), Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong addressed the COVID-19 situation in Singapore and the rising cost of living amid geopolitical tensions. The repeal of Section 377A of the Penal Code and the amendment of Singapore's Constitution to protect the definition of marriage were among the key policy and legislative announcements Mr Lee made during his speech at the Institute of Technical Education headquarters in Ang Mo Kio. A significant portion of the Prime Minister’s speech was also dedicated to upcoming infrastructure projects that will help the country retain its status as a hub for trade and aviation. Here are the key takeaways: Expressing gratitude for the public's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr Lee said Singapore has come a long way in its fight against the coronavirus. With the situation stabilising, and in an effort to “prevent people from getting tired”, the wearing of masks will soon become optional in most indoor and outdoor settings. Going forward, masks will only be required on public transport and in healthcare settings, such as clinics, hospitals and nursing homes. “But please don’t take your masks off this very moment,” Mr Lee said. “Please wait for the detailed announcement from the (COVID-19 task force).” While safe management measures have gradually been lifted, the Prime Minister said the country must learn lessons from COVID-19 and be prepared for the next pandemic. “The most important lesson is to maintain the spirit of personal and social responsibility,” Mr Lee said. “Continue to nurture trust in our society, day in, day out, during normal times, so that during the next crisis, we can again draw upon a deep reservoir of trust to see us through.” Read the full story here: Masks will be optional indoors, required only on public transport and in healthcare settings During his National Day Rally speech, Mr Lee gave several examples of how individuals and organisations have contributed to Singapore’s response to the pandemic. From a volunteer who accompanied senior citizens on their visits to vaccination centres, to companies that provided resources and industry expertise, and public officers who carried out demanding operations - sometimes at short notice. To recognise these efforts, the Government will present a special state award to those who participated directly in the fight against the pandemic: The COVID-19 Resilience Medal. Those who made “exceptional contributions” will also receive existing state awards such as the Commendation Medal, the Public Service Medal and the Public Administration Medal, Mr Lee said. “We will add a special indication to the name and the insignia, to show that, this time, the medal was presented for service fighting COVID – maybe on the ribbon for the medal we will add two red lines!” the Prime Minister added. The awards list will be released at the end of the year, with award ceremonies to be held in 2023. Addressing an issue that has been in the spotlight in recent months, Mr Lee announced that Section 377A of the Penal Code will be repealed. The controversial law criminalises sex between men in Singapore. At the same time, the Government will also amend the Constitution to protect the legal definition of marriage, so that the matter cannot be challenged in court. While describing Singapore as “by and large … a traditional society with conservative values”, Mr Lee noted that “like every human society, we also have gay people in our midst”. “They are our fellow Singaporeans. They are our colleagues, our friends, our family members. They too want to live their own lives, participate in our community and contribute fully to Singapore,” the Prime Minister said. “And we need to find the right way to reconcile and accommodate both the traditional mores of our society, and the aspiration of gay Singaporeans to be respected and accepted.” Even among those who want to retain 377A, most do not want to see it being actively enforced and criminal penalties applied, Mr Lee noted. The Prime Minister said that the repeal of 377A is “the right thing to do and something that most Singaporeans will now accept”. Acknowledging that most Singaporeans “do not want the repeal to trigger a drastic shift in our societal norms”, and that such concerns are felt by both religious and non-religious people, Mr Lee said the Government “will maintain our current family-oriented approach"". “Hence even as we repeal 377A, we will uphold and safeguard the institution of marriage,” he said, adding that under the law, only marriages between a man and a woman are recognised in Singapore.  To prevent the definition of marriage from being challenged in court on constitutional grounds, it will be protected through a constitutional amendment. “For some, (the repeal of 377A) will be too modest a step. For others, it will be a step taken only with great reluctance, even regret. But in a society where diverse groups have strongly held opposing views, everyone has to accept that no group can have things all their way,” he said. He called on all sides to exercise restraint “because that is the only way we can move forward as one nation together”. There will be a full debate on the matter when legislation is brought to Parliament, Mr Lee said in conclusion. Read the full story here: Singapore to repeal Section 377A, amend Constitution to protect definition of marriage Discussing Forward Singapore, an exercise recently launched by Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, Mr Lee highlighted what must be done to “meet the enduring aspirations of every Singaporean”, as the fourth-generation leadership team prepares to take the helm. The Prime Minister said that a key pillar is building a world-class talent pool in Singapore. While it is undeniably important for Singapore to develop its own talent and provide Singaporeans with the opportunity to reach their full potential, “we can never have enough” top talent. “We need to focus on attracting and retaining top talent, in the same way we focus on attracting and retaining investments,” he said. “In this global contest for talent, Singapore cannot afford to be creamed off, or left behind,” Mr Lee added. The Prime Minister then addressed concerns about the impact of having large numbers of non-residents living and working in Singapore. “The Government is following up to tackle the problems, and ease these concerns,” he said. “But while we manage the overall population of foreign professionals here, we must not stop seeking out top talent who can contribute to our Singapore Story.” Mr Lee used Singapore’s biomedical sciences sector to illustrate the importance of this policy. In the 1990s, a number of top biomedical scientists, researchers and engineers were persuaded to move to Singapore. These top names mentored local talents, and helped to create an ecosystem that put the country on the path to becoming a biomedical hub. Singapore’s significance on the global biomedical stage was seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, with researchers here developing test kits, facilitating the sharing of COVID-19 genomic data, and enabling the country to secure vaccines and therapeutics early. “Had we not sought out top talent 30 years ago, and then continued to build up our biomedical research teams and activities, and develop homegrown talent, all this would not have happened,” Mr Lee said. The post-pandemic world would provide a window of opportunity to bring more top talent to Singapore, said the Prime Minister. The Ministry of Manpower, the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the economic agencies will soon be unveiling new initiatives to do this, he added. Read the full story here: Develop Singaporeans while attracting foreigners to build 'world-class talent pool', says PM Lee Addressing the ongoing tensions between the United States and China, and the war between Russia and Ukraine, Mr Lee spoke of the importance of Singapore standing firm on the principles of international law. Mr Lee described the US-China tensions, particularly over Taiwan, as “worrying”, adding that the state of the two powers’ relationship “is bad news for the world”. He also reiterated Singapore’s stance on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, saying that Singapore’s security and even existence relies on countries upholding the United Nations Charter and the “fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity”. “We cannot legitimise Russia’s wrongful actions,” the Prime Minister said. Moving on to the implications of the war on the Asia-Pacific region, Mr Lee said the tensions between US-China have been further complicated by the conflict. “We can expect more geopolitical contestation in the Asia Pacific,” Mr Lee said. “Some countries will choose a side. Others, like Singapore, will try our best to avoid being caught up in major power rivalry.” Mr Lee outlined steps that Singapore can take to be on guard against “external dangers”. The first step is to stand firm on the fundamental principles of international law. “Taking cover and keeping quiet will hurt us in the long term,” he said. The second step is to take National Service seriously. “If we do not defend ourselves, no one is going to defend us on our behalf,” Mr Lee said. Thirdly, and most importantly, Singaporeans must remain united and be wary of attempts to sow division. “Never allow ourselves to be divided – whether by race, religion, income, social differences or place of birth,” he said. “Stay alert against foreign actors who are looking out to exploit our vulnerabilities and to influence our people for their own interests.” Mr Lee reminded Singaporeans not to believe everything they read online. “If we are taken in and we're divided, we will stand no chance,” he said. “But united, we can deal with any problems that come our way.” Read the full story here: Singapore must guard against hostile foreign influence, remain vigilant on social media While most sectors in Singapore are recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, including tourism and aviation, the war in Ukraine has “clouded our outlook”, Mr Lee said. The pandemic disrupted supply chains and necessitated large spending packages in developed countries, which stoked inflation. The war has also exacerbated this. With oil and gas supplies from Russia disrupted, energy prices have been pushed up. The price of grain has also spiked as supplies from Russia and Ukraine – two major exporters – cannot be shipped out. To combat the rising cost of living in Singapore brought about by these challenges, the Government is “doing everything necessary to support Singaporeans, especially middle- and lower-income families”, Mr Lee said. Illustrating this, the Prime Minister said that a middle-income family with two young children, staying in a four-room Housing Board (HDB) flat, can expect an additional S$2,200 in support this fiscal year. A lower-income family staying in a three-room HDB flat, meanwhile, can expect about S$3,700 in support. “This will not cover fully every cost increase, but it will help lighten the burden on Singaporean households,” Mr Lee said. “And if the situation worsens, we stand ready to do more.” Mr Lee noted that the Monetary Authority of Singapore has also tightened the country’s exchange rate policy, making overseas travel more affordable and reducing the prices of imported goods, in Singapore dollar terms. While some economic issues can be attributed to the pandemic and the war, Mr Lee said that conditions have also “fundamentally changed”. He described several trends that are bringing costs up and pushing up inflation, including in Singapore. Among them are: The slowing of China’s growth and exports; countries raising tariffs against each other; and countries reviewing their supply chains. “We don't have much influence over this global inflation picture,” Mr Lee said. “But what is within our power is to make ourselves more productive and competitive.” To do this, Singapore must “press on with economic upgrading and restructuring; redouble our transformation efforts; (and) encourage workers to upgrade their skills at every opportunity”, Mr Lee added. Read the full story here: Government ready to do more if cost of living rises further, says PM Lee In giving an update on major infrastructure developments, Mr Lee said Singapore’s progress with the Tuas Port and Changi Airport Terminal 5 have signalled to the world that the country is emerging stronger post-pandemic.   Tuas Port is now up and running, Mr Lee said, announcing that phase one of the project has been completed. The new port is automated and digitalised, and makes use of artificial intelligence to coordinate operations. When fully completed in about two decades’ time, “we will have the world’s largest fully automated port, and that should make us a leading global player in the maritime space”, Mr Lee said. Moving on to Changi Airport, the Prime Minister said that work on T5 has restarted after a two-year pause brought about by the pandemic. The terminal has, however, been redesigned with resilience in mind, allowing it to operate more safely and flexibly during a pandemic, Mr Lee said. It has also been made greener and more energy-efficient. A business and lifestyle destination called the Changi East Urban District will be developed next to T5, he added. The Prime Minister also provided more details on the planned relocation and redevelopment of Paya Lebar Airbase. Set to start in the middle of the next decade, the redevelopment may see the runway developed into a “central spine” of the future town at the site. It could be turned into a green connector or community space, Mr Lee said. Both public and private housing will be built in the town, with the Ministry of National Development estimating that about 150,000 new homes can be built there.  Reflecting on concerns shared by Singaporeans that the country might run out of space, the Prime Minister said: “No need to worry.” “We have done our studies and planning. We will have enough space for future generations,” he said. “Our problem is not finding the space to build enough flats, nor keeping homes affordable for Singaporeans. We know how to do that. Our problem is having enough babies to grow up and live in them!” Read the full stories here: Tuas Port will be world's largest fully automated port when completed in 20 years Changi Airport's Terminal 5 project redesigned to be pandemic-ready, more energy-efficient"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/masks-not-required-indoors-covid-only-public-transport-healthcare-hospitals-clinics-ndr2022-2891281,"NDR 2022: Masks will be optional indoors, required only on public transport and in healthcare settings","SINGAPORE: As Singapore’s COVID-19 situation stabilises, masks will soon be optional indoors and required only on public transport and in healthcare settings, announced Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Sunday (Aug 21).  “Our safe management measures have protected us well throughout the pandemic,” said Mr Lee during his National Day Rally speech. “With our situation stabilising, we will reduce the mask requirements further to prevent people from getting tired.” Masks will be required only on public transport, where people are in prolonged close contact in a crowded space, and in healthcare settings like clinics, hospitals and residential and nursing homes where there are vulnerable people.  “Everywhere else, outdoors or indoors, masks will be optional.” In schools, masks should not be needed in class, said Mr Lee.  “The children do need to be able to see the facial expressions of their teachers and of each other ... It's crucial for their learning and development,” he continued.  “But please don't take your masks off this very moment,” said Mr Lee, adding that the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force will make a detailed announcement. Singapore has come a long way in its fight against COVID-19, and is now learning to live with the virus, the Prime Minister said.  “With each infection wave, we have managed the impact better,” he said, adding that the latest wave is now subsiding.  “In many other countries, when a wave happens, cases shoot up furiously and then crash down suddenly, like a rollercoaster. And when cases shoot up like that hospitals come under a lot of pressure. “In Singapore, our waves grow as well as tail off more gradually. And this suggests we have been effective in slowing down disease transmission. We have spread out the impact and prevented our hospitals from being overwhelmed,” said Mr Lee, noting that Singapore has had fewer than 1,600 COVID-19 related deaths.  “Every death is one too many. But if our mortality rates had been like other countries, we could easily have suffered 10,000 COVID-19 deaths or more by now.”  The key to Singapore’s success in managing the pandemic is the “high level of trust” in society, said the Prime Minister. “In some countries, a precaution as simple and essential as mask-wearing became a heated point of contention. But in Singapore, people worked with and not against one another,” he added.  “You trusted your Government. You patiently endured rounds of easing and tightening measures despite the inconvenience,” Mr Lee added.  “The Government upheld your trust by being open and transparent. We spoke directly to you, shared information readily and gave you the full facts even when things didn't look good.” People in Singapore also practised personal and social responsibility, getting themselves vaccinated against COVID-19 and keeping their masks on indoors, said Mr Lee.  Those who tested positive isolated themselves to protect others, he said, adding that many people went out of their way to help others.  “Healthcare workers, through their care and professionalism, ensured that the rest of us could carry on safely with our daily lives. Public officers, especially those on the frontlines, carried out many demanding operations, often at short notice.”  Private companies provided resources to tackle problems and other community groups made special efforts to take care of those who needed more help, he added.  “Your actions were critical in our fight against COVID-19. And the nation is grateful to all of you,” said Mr Lee.  To recognise the efforts of those who participated directly in fighting COVID-19 during the pandemic, the Government will be presenting these individuals and teams with a special state award - the COVID-19 Resilience Medal.  In addition, those who made exceptional contributions will receive existing state awards such as the Commendation Medal, the Public Service Medal and the Public Administration Medal, said Mr Lee. A “special indication” will be added to the name and insignia, to show that the medal was presented for service fighting COVID-19. The awards list will be announced at the end of the year.  “Meanwhile, we must be prepared to encounter more variants and waves, because COVID-19 will remain with us for quite some time,” said Mr Lee.  Singapore last significantly eased COVID-19 measures on Apr 26, when group size limits and safe distancing requirements were lifted. SafeEntry and TraceTogether requirements were also removed for most settings. All employees were allowed to return to the workplace, and the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level was lowered from Orange to Yellow after more than two years.  The DORSCON framework, which gives an indication of the current disease situation, was raised to Orange on Feb 7, 2020, at the start of the pandemic. Beyond adjustments to safe management measures, Singapore must learn the lessons from COVID-19, the Prime Minister said. “One day, the next pandemic will come,” he said. “A new virus will emerge, more transmissible, more adaptable and more dangerous than COVID-19. And we must be ready for it.”  The most important lesson is to maintain the spirit of personal and social responsibility, said Mr Lee.  “Continue to nurture the trust in our society, day in, day out, during normal times. So that during the next crisis we can again draw upon a deep reservoir of trust to see us through, just like we have done during COVID-19.”  "

Kishida, who has just returned from a week-long vacation, will work from his residence from Monday and will join the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD) online, the source said, asking not to be identified because he is not authorised to talk to the media. The prime minister developed a cough and fever on Saturday and took a PCR test on Sunday morning, which confirmed the positive result in the afternoon, a Cabinet office spokesperson said separately. The eighth TICAD and the first since 2019 is being co-hosted with the United Nations, the World Bank, and the African Union Commission. Among discussion on measures to bolster development, the gathering will look at ways to help the continent tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. Kishida's infection comes as Japan experiences a record resurgence in coronavirus cases through July and August, hitting businesses in the world's third-biggest economy, although deaths remain relatively low and the disruptions have been milder than in some other advanced economies. Japan's economy grew an annualised 2.2 per cent in the second quarter, a slower-than-expected rebound from a COVID-19 induced slump as uncertainty remains over whether consumption can bolster a fragile recovery. The authorities have eschewed strict lockdowns used in China and other nations throughout the pandemic, relying on broad usage of mask wearing and social distancing to curb infections. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/covid-flu-rsv-children-sick-cough-virus-2889066,Commentary: COVID-19 has created an ‘immunity debt’ towards common infections in our children,"SINGAPORE: COVID-19 has been a big disruption to the world. Pandemic response measures not only helped keep the coronavirus at bay, but also had the effect of curbing the spread of other respiratory illnesses like the common cold and influenza.  But as restrictions are relaxed or lifted with the widespread use of vaccines and antivirals, several viruses and bacteria are now making a comeback. It makes sense that measures targeted at preventing COVID-19 reduced the spread of infections transmitted via respiratory droplets. People stopped travelling, worked from home, wore masks and stayed in when unwell. Combined data from KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH), Singapore General Hospital and National University Hospital showed that most non-COVID-19 respiratory viruses nearly disappeared by April and May 2020, when Singapore went into a ""circuit breaker"" period. With the reopening in phases in late 2020, some respiratory viruses gradually returned, though not at pre-pandemic levels, since mask-wearing in public continued.  Amid concerns about the Delta and Omicron variant waves in the second half of 2021 and early months of 2022, healthcare professionals saw non-COVID respiratory illness levels drop again after response measures were tightened and subsequently come up when eased. Similar effects were seen overseas. Also, the usual flu seasons were absent.  The return of respiratory viruses is not surprising to healthcare experts.  The first ones to return, in late 2020, were the rhinoviruses and enteroviruses which usually cause mild common colds. Then, early 2021 saw a reappearance of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and some parainfluenza viruses, both of which may cause more serious illness in young children, such as bronchiolitis or croup, which has a distinctive barking cough. What is surprising is the unusual pattern of activity of viruses that usually have a predictable seasonality.  In Australia, the United States and Europe, waves of RSV infections were recorded outside the traditional winter months. Several countries, at some point, reported that RSV waves were stretching the capacity of children’s hospitals that were already under pressure from COVID-19. Another observation was that RSV infections occurred in older children, whereas before the pandemic, children less than one-year-old were mostly affected. In some locations, the numbers of RSV infections even surpassed those of COVID-19 paediatric infections at times. What might explain these changes? Due to all the pandemic response measures, young children, including those born during the pandemic, have had much less exposure to common respiratory viruses than same-age children in pre-pandemic years.  This created an “immunity debt” towards previously common infections, meaning that the lack of exposure to viruses and bacteria during the pandemic left children more susceptible to various infections.  Can we expect to see other respiratory illnesses make a comeback? Probably. Influenza viruses (there are A and B strains) nearly disappeared during the pandemic, and only a small number of influenza infections were observed again in the first half of 2022, according to data from KKH. These numbers are expected to rise in the second half of 2022; Australia is currently experiencing a substantial rise in influenza infections, and international travel is likely to bring this to Singapore soon. Before the pandemic, KKH regularly diagnosed bacterial respiratory infections, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae (which causes pneumonia predominantly in children) and Bordetella pertussis (the agent of classical whooping cough). These infections also disappeared during the 2020 circuit breaker and have not reappeared up until mid-2022. Parents may also be concerned about children getting multiple infections. In June, Singapore recorded the first paediatric COVID-19 death in a one-and-a-half-year-old boy who had COVID-19, RSV and enterovirus infections. With Singapore recording a seven-day moving average of 3,750 COVID-19 cases (as of Aug 18) and yet another Omicron subvariant, various respiratory viruses are also returning with relaxation of some of the earlier pandemic measures. What does this all mean for us in Singapore? Respiratory viruses have been with us for a very long time and are part of what helps train our immune systems and those of our children. It is their absence, rather than presence, that is an unusual state. Their return after the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic should be seen as part of the return to normality. But we should still take precautionary measures and stay vigilant, due to the possibility of severe illnesses in some children and vulnerable adults. This means we should take good care of ourselves and our children and seek medical care if infections look to become more serious. Signs to look out for in children are worsening or persistent fever, lethargy or drowsiness, persistent cough, breathlessness, chest pain, poor oral intake, poor urine output, or seizures.  It is also recommended that we keep our influenza vaccinations up to date. Anyone above six months of age can obtain their influenza vaccination at their local general practitioner (GP) clinic or polyclinic. COVID-19 may have changed the way we think of and live with viruses, and we should keep up some of the habits we have picked up along the way.

Thousands of medics of the Korean People's Army, who had been dispatched to the ""emergency anti-epidemic front"", were discharged after Kim declared victory over COVID-19 and eased restrictions last week. Kim held the event at the Apr 25 House of Culture in Pyongyang on Thursday to celebrate the medics' ""heroic feats"" on the frontline of the COVID-19 battle in the country's most populated city. ""Noting that the army medics took the greatest trouble to defuse the anti-epidemic crisis in the capital city, he gave warm thanks ... to them who displayed the indefatigable spirit and the invincible combat strength of our army,"" the official KCNA news agency said. ""He specially called and congratulated medics who performed distinguished feats in the capital's anti-epidemic struggle."" KCNA said this week that the medics had returned to their units on Sunday without a sending-off ceremony, but Kim said he had felt ""empty and sorry"" that he had not done enough to publicly recognise their sacrifice, the report said. North Korea has never confirmed how many people caught COVID-19, apparently lacking the tools to conduct widespread testing. Infectious disease experts have cast doubts on North Korea's claims of progress, and the World Health Organization said the COVID-19 situation there could be getting worse, not better, citing an absence of independent data.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/man-refuse-wear-mask-defiance-authority-covid-19-rules-2887696,'Deliberate defiance of authority': Man fined for not wearing mask in fast food outlet,"SINGAPORE: A man who refused to wear a mask in a fast food outlet was fined S$8,000 on Thursday (Aug 18), with the prosecutor saying he showed ""deliberate defiance of authority"". Philip Richard Mockridge, 55, pleaded guilty to one charge under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations, with two similar charges taken into consideration for sentencing. Mockridge, a permanent resident, conducted his own defence. After sentencing, he asked for time to consider whether to appeal. His fine was deferred by one week for him to make his decision. The court heard that the police received a call about a person refusing to wear his mask at City Square Mall on the night of May 16, 2021. Two police officers responded and saw Mockridge sitting in a fast food restaurant in the mall's basement at about 9.10pm. Mockridge's mask was pulled down to his chin, exposing his mouth and nose. He did not have any food or drink with him at the time. A police sergeant told Mockridge that he had to put his mask on if he was not eating or drinking. Mockridge then asked to see the officers' identification, and they presented it. The officer repeated that Mockridge had to wear his mask, and he said: ""Are you sure about that? I'm not so sure."" A few minutes later, Mockridge walked away from the officers to collect his food at the counter, still unmasked. A member of the public stood next to him at the counter. Five minutes later, Mockridge received his food and went to stand with the officers at the restaurant's entrance. He did not eat or drink at any time. The sergeant asked Mockridge if he had an issue with wearing a mask, to which he replied: ""Which law are you referring to?"" Mockridge then took out his phone and started recording the exchange. When the sergeant repeated his question, Mockridge challenged him again, asking: ""Which law are you referring to?"" The sergeant referred to the COVID-19 regulations and repeated that Mockridge was supposed to wear his mask over his mouth and nose. He then replied: ""And if I don't, what will you do?"" When the officer informed Mockridge of the penalties for flouting the regulations, he said: ""So you're threatening to put me in a cage?"" Around 9.25pm, as Mockridge persistently refused to wear his mask despite instructions to do so, the sergeant told him that he would have to answer to any follow-up action. Mockridge then walked away with his mask still on his chin, his mouth and nose exposed. At the time of this incident, Mockridge was already being investigated for two previous occasions when he did not wear a mask outside his home. The earlier incidents took place at Sengkang MRT station on Nov 26, 2020, and at Serangoon MRT station on Dec 19, 2020. Deputy Public Prosecutor Wu Yu Jie sought a fine of S$10,000, pointing out that Mockridge stayed unmasked for no reason for at least 15 minutes in the restaurant. His responses to the officers ""clearly demonstrate his defiance, despite having gone through two prior incidents with the police"", said the prosecutor. In mitigation, Mockridge said that his responses to the officers were ""genuine and legitimate questions"" as he was uncertain about the law. ""I was overly persistent, I accept that, and that's what constituted the breach, your honour,"" he told District Judge Soh Tze Bian. He also claimed he had ""no reason whatsoever to be aware"" of the investigations against him for the prior incidents, and had ""completely forgotten"" about them. Mr Wu contended that this was not believable as Mockridge had been interviewed by police about the prior incidents in March 2021. The prosecutor also disagreed that Mockridge's questions to the officers were genuine and legitimate, saying he had no reason to doubt their answers. ""He was not genuinely intending to accept the responses of the police, as evidenced by his escalating questions about what the police would do if he failed to comply with their directions,"" said Mr Wu. Mockridge asked for a fine of S$1,000. Judge Soh said that while he did not agree with the prosecution's position to impose the maximum fine, S$1,000 was too low. Mockridge could have been jailed for up to six months, fined up to S$10,000, or both, for an offence under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations. "

The 71-year-old first lady tested negative earlier on Monday as part of her regular testing routine, but a PCR test taken after she developed cold-like symptoms came back positive, her spokesperson Elizabeth Alexander said. President Biden will wear a mask for 10 days when indoors and when in close proximity to others because he is considered a close contact of the first lady, according to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. He plans to return to Washington on Tuesday to sign a landmark climate change and healthcare Bill in the afternoon, before continuing to his home in Wilmington, Delaware. ""We will also increase the president's testing cadence and report those results,"" Jen-Pierre said. The president recovered from a rebound case of the virus on Aug 7. Jill Biden, who like her husband, has been vaccinated twice and boosted twice with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, has been prescribed a course of Paxlovid and will isolate in her vacation home for at least five days, her spokeswoman said. The first lady is currently in South Carolina where the Bidens have been on vacation, and will return home after she receives two consecutive negative COVID-19 tests, her spokeswoman said. "

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/londons-heathrow-airport-extends-passenger-cap-october-2882266,London's Heathrow Airport extends passenger cap to October,"LONDON: London's Heathrow Airport said Monday (Aug 15) it will extend its cap on daily passenger numbers until the end of October as part of its efforts to cope with soaring demand for air travel amid staffing shortages. The airport, one of Europe's busiest, said a maximum of 100,000 travellers can depart each day until Oct 29. The daily cap was initially expected to be lifted on Sep 11. Heathrow imposed the temporary limit in July and told airlines to stop selling tickets during the peak summer travel season, saying the expected passenger traffic was more than airport ground staff could handle. The airport said its temporary cap had resulted in “fewer last-minute cancellations” and “shorter waits for bags"". It added the capacity limits would be kept under review and “could be lifted earlier should there be a sustained picture of better resilience and a material increase in resourcing levels."" Scores of summer flights into and departing from Heathrow have already been cancelled in recent months, and passengers have reported long waits at security, lost luggage and lengthy flight delays. Booming demand for summer travel after two years of COVID-19 travel restrictions have overwhelmed European airlines and airports, which had laid off tens of thousands of pilots, cabin crew, check-in staff, ground crew and baggage handlers as the industry ground to a halt during the pandemic.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/uk-drug-regulator-approves-updated-moderna-vaccine-omicron-covid-19-variant-2881656,UK approves new Moderna vaccine targeting Omicron variant,"LONDON: The UK's drug regulator said on Monday (Aug 15) it had approved an updated Moderna vaccine against the coronavirus that targets the Omicron variant as well as the original form. The Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said in a statement said it had approved the vaccine for adult booster doses ""after it was found to meet the UK regulator's standards of safety, quality and effectiveness"". It was the first such ""bivalent"" COVID-19 vaccine to be approved by the British regulator. The MHRA's chief executive June Raine said data from a clinical trial had shown it prompted a ""strong immune response"" against the original virus and Omicron and would provide a ""sharpened tool in our armoury"" as the virus kept evolving. Moderna's CEO Stephane Bancel said in a statement that the US biotech company was ""delighted"" by the decision, ""the first authorisation of an Omicron-containing bivalent vaccine"". While vaccines have helped lower hospitalisations and deaths from COVID-19, which first emerged in China in late 2019, the current jabs are mainly aimed at the earlier strains of the disease. The World Health Organization warned in July that the pandemic was ""nowhere near over"", due to the spread of Omicron subvariants and to the lifting of control measures. Half of the Moderna vaccine, called Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron, targets the original 2020 virus and half the Omicron variant (BA.1). The MHRA said the vaccine was also found to generate a ""good response"" against two Omicron subvariants, BA.4 and BA.5, which have partly driven a wave of new cases of the disease in Europe and the United States. The vaccine had the same ""typically mild"" side effects as the original Moderna jab, it added. Moderna said in June that its ""bivalent"" vaccine performed better against both Omicron and the original virus compared to its original COVID-19 vaccine, called Spikevax. The EU's medicines watchdog said that month it had started to review the new vaccine. The European agency is also studying a rival adapted jab developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, which it has said it aims to approve this autumn. The Pfizer-BioNTech jab is adapted for the BA.4 and BA.5 types of the virus. The BA.4 and BA.5 variants were first discovered in South Africa and spread rapidly despite high population immunity conferred by prior waves and vaccinations. Like other Omicron variants, they tend to have a milder disease course as they settle less in the lungs and more in the upper nasal passages, causing symptoms like fever, tiredness and loss of smell."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/ikea-shanghai-shoppers-store-lock-down-covid-19-exposure-2881416,IKEA shoppers rush out of Shanghai store amid COVID-19 lockdown attempt,"SHANGHAI: There were chaotic scenes at an IKEA outlet in Shanghai on Saturday (Aug 13) when authorities tried to lock down the store after learning that a customer had been in close contact with a COVID-19 case. Videos circulating on Chinese social media showed customers pushing past security guards and running out of the store in panic as an announcement blared over its sound system saying the mall was being locked down due to COVID-19 contact tracing. Guards were seen closing the doors to prevent people from leaving, but a crowd forced their way through and rushed out.  IKEA customer service said on Sunday that the mall was shut due to COVID-19 curbs, Reuters reported, adding that the retailer did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. According to Bloomberg, Shanghai's health officials said they imposed a ""temporary control measure"" at the store after they discovered that a close contact of a six-year-old boy who was asymptomatic had visited.  They did not say when the close contact was in the store.  Everyone at IKEA and other affected areas will need to quarantine for two days before five days of health surveillance, Bloomberg reported, quoting Mr Zhao Dandan, deputy director of Shanghai Health Commission, who gave a briefing on Sunday.  After months of COVID-19 lockdowns, Shanghai announced on Sunday that it would reopen all schools including kindergartens, as well as primary and middle schools on Sep 1.  The city will require all teachers and students to take nucleic acid tests for the coronavirus every day before leaving campus, the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission said. It also called for teachers and students to carry out a 14-day ""self-health management"" within the city ahead of the school reopening, the commission said in a statement. Shanghai shut all schools in mid-March before the city's two-month lockdown to combat its worst COVID-19 outbreak in April and May. It allowed some students in high school and middle school to return to classrooms in June while most of the rest continued home study for the remainder of the semester."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/australias-pm-says-former-leader-morrison-took-secret-ministerial-roles-during-covid-19-pandemic-2881066,Australia's PM says former leader Morrison took on secret ministerial roles during COVID-19 pandemic,"SYDNEY: Revelations that Australia's former prime minister secretly appointed himself to several ministerial posts during the COVID-19 pandemic sparked a political firestorm on Monday (Aug 15), with his successor promising a rapid investigation. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese accused Scott Morrison of ""tin-pot activity"" after it emerged that the former leader had made himself minister of health, finance and resources, among other positions, without informing colleagues, parliament or voters. Ministers are traditionally sworn in at a ceremony by the governor-general, but that did not happen in the case of the additional roles, and Albanese said it was ""unprecedented"" that key Cabinet members were not aware of the appointments. ""This was a centralisation of power by the former prime minister,"" Albanese told reporters. ""This isn't some, you know, local footy club,"" he added. ""This is a government of Australia, where the people of Australia were kept in the dark as to what the ministerial arrangements were."" Describing Morrison's actions as ""extraordinary"", Albanese said that he had sought legal advice from the solicitor-general and would be briefed later today. ""This is a sort of tin-pot activity that we would ridicule if it was in a non-democratic country,"" Albanese said. ""Scott Morrison was running a shadow government."" In some cases, Morrison made himself a co-minister without telling the Cabinet members he had already appointed to those positions. Newspaper the Australian said that Morrison was appointed health minister in 2020, alongside health minister Greg Hunt, to avoid concentrating power in one person when biosecurity emergency powers were adopted to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. He was later also appointed finance minister and resources minister. Former resources minister Keith Pitt told broadcaster ABC the situation was ""unusual"" and he was ""concerned"" when he was told Morrison shared his responsibilities in 2021. Morrison later blocked an offshore gas project. Morrison, who was prime minister from 2018 to 2022, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The scandal has shone a light on the opaque nature of decision-making inside Australia's government - and raised questions about whether more stringent democratic safeguards are needed. Morrison's conservative coalition lost power in May elections, ending nearly a decade of centre-right rule in the country. In Australia, elected politicians are selected by the prime minister before being sworn in by the governor-general in a formal ceremony that is usually publicly recorded. In an emailed statement, the governor-general's office told Reuters that the appointments were valid under the constitution and did not require a swearing-in ceremony, adding that publicising them was a matter for the government of the day. ""It is not uncommon for ministers to be appointed to administer departments other than their portfolio responsibility,"" the spokesperson for the governor-general's secretary said. The governor-general followed normal process and acted on the government's advice in appointing Morrison to administer portfolios besides his own department and the Cabinet, the spokesperson added. Constitutional law expert Anne Twomey described the allegations as ""bizarre"" and said that it raised possible legal challenges to some of the former government's decisions. ""The secrecy involved in this is just simply bizarre. I mean, you know, you just wonder what's wrong with these people, if they have to do everything in secret,"" she said. ""It's just utterly inappropriate. We live in a democracy, which requires transparency."" David Littleproud, the leader of the National party, the coalition partner of Morrison's Liberals, told ABC that the news was ""disappointing"", and added that the Cabinet should be trusted. It was not immediately clear what the implications were for the Liberal Party's coalition with the National Party. ""These revelations do raise into question our Westminster system of government,"" said Bridget McKenzie, the National leader in the upper house. ""Who is the senior minister, what if they disagreed?"" she asked the ABC."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/pandemic-pushed-millions-more-poverty-philippines-2881226,Pandemic pushed millions more into poverty in the Philippines,"MANILA: About 2.3 million people in the Philippines were pushed into poverty between 2018 and 2021, largely due to the economic downturn caused by the pandemic, the statistics agency said on Monday (Aug 15). The number of people living in poverty in 2021 rose to a total of almost 20 million or 18.1 per cent of the population from 16.7 per cent in 2018, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) said, overshooting the government's target of 15.5 per cent to 17.5 per cent. Recently inaugurated President Ferdinand Marcos Jr aims to slash the poverty rate to 9 per cent by the end of his single six-year term in 2028 - a target that remains achievable despite soaring inflation, according to Economic Planning Secretary Arsenio Balisacan. He said the government's strategy will focus on fully reopening the economy, investing in human capital and social protection, and transforming production sectors to generate more quality jobs and competitive products. ""We can reduce poverty incidence by 5 percentage points at midterm, and another 4 percentage points by 2028,"" Balisacan told a media briefing. The PSA - which defines poverty as including those Filipinos whose per capita income cannot sufficiently meet individual basic food and non-food needs - releases these statistics every three years. Balisacan said that before the pandemic, in 2018, the country had achieved its goal of lifting 6 million Filipinos out of poverty, four years ahead of a 2022 target. But COVID-19 restrictions in 2020 and a long-running issue of poor households having limited access to regular and productive jobs had plunged many Filipinos back into difficulty, he said. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/us-employers-struggle-find-workers-shortage-covid-19-2879501,'Now hiring': US employers struggle to find enough workers,"WASHINGTON: Salespeople, food servers, postal workers - ""Help wanted"" ads are proliferating across the United States, as companies struggle to deal with a worker shortage caused by the pandemic, a rash of early retirements and restrictive immigration laws. More than 10 million openings went unfilled in June, according to government data, while fewer than 6 million people were seeking work, even as employers desperately try to boost hiring amid a frenzy of consumer spending. ""We have a lot of jobs, but not enough workers to fill them,"" the US Chamber of Commerce, which represents American companies, said in a statement. Many of those who stopped working as COVID-19 first ravaged the US economy in early 2020 have never returned. ""There would be 3.4 million more workers today if labour force participation"" - the percentage of the working-age population currently employed or actively seeking work - was at the pre-pandemic rate, the Chamber calculated. It has slipped from 63.4 per cent to 62.1 per cent. And where have all these people gone? Many simply took early retirement. ""Part of that is just the US population continues to age,"" Nick Bunker, a labour-market specialist with jobs website Indeed, told AFP. The huge cohort of ""baby boomers"" had already begun leaving the labour market, but there has been an ""acceleration in retirements"" since the pandemic struck, Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG, told AFP. Millions of people opted for early retirement, concerned for their health and with sufficient assets - thanks to a then-buoyant stock market and high real-estate prices - to leave the workplace. In the short term, Bunker said, ""We're unlikely to get back to exactly the pre-pandemic level of labour-force participation because of the ageing of the population"". Adding to this, said Swonk, ""We haven't had immigration at the pace to replace the baby boomers."" Restrictions imposed under former president Donald Trump, plus the impact of COVID-19, steeply reduced the number of foreigners entering the country. ""It has rebounded a little bit, but still not at the levels we were seeing several years ago,"" Bunker said. The Chamber of Commerce also underscored the impact of generous government assistance during the pandemic, which ""bolstered people's economic stability - allowing them to continue sitting out of the labour force"".  Large numbers of women quit their jobs in 2020, in part because extended school closings required many to stay home to care for children. Those who wanted to place children in daycare were often frustrated, as labour shortages hit the daycare sector as well. Swonk noted that not only COVID-19 infections but also the debilitating effects of long COVID have had a serious impact. It's ""really one of the most underestimated and misunderstood issues"" keeping workers sidelined, she said. To lure workers back, many employers have boosted pay and benefits. And if Americans' buying frenzy slows, analysts say, companies will need fewer workers. The labour shortage is expected to ease a bit as the Federal Reserve continues aggressively raising interest rates in its effort to combat inflation. In the meantime, wage earners have profited. Over the past year, millions have changed jobs, often lured elsewhere by higher wages and better working conditions. This ""Great Resignation"" has resulted in higher hourly wages. The private sector average is now US$32.27, up 5.2 per cent in a year, adding to inflationary pressures. The US labour market showed new signs of vitality in July. The 22 million jobs lost due to COVID-19 have returned, and the unemployment rate is a historically low 3.5 per cent."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/shanghai-china-ex-covid-19-patients-stigma-work-2873436,China's ex-COVID patients live under 'dark shadow' of stigma,"BEIJING: When Zuo tested positive for COVID-19 while working as a cleaner in one of Shanghai's largest quarantine centres, she hoped it wouldn't be long before she could pick up the mop and start earning again. But four months on, she is still fighting to get her job back - one of scores of recovering COVID-19 patients facing what labour rights activists and health experts say is a widespread form of discrimination in zero-COVID China. Using snap lockdowns and mass testing, China is the last major economy still pursuing the goal of stamping out the virus completely. Those who test positive, as well as their contacts, are all sent to central quarantine facilities, while a flare-up in a factory can grind production to a halt. Rights groups say the strict rules are feeding COVID-19-related discrimination and shutting out thousands of people from China's already bleak job market - with migrant workers and young people hit hardest. ""People are afraid they might contract the virus from us, so they shun us,"" said Zuo, who only gave her last name for fear of retribution for speaking to AFP. ""Recruiters check COVID-19 testing history going back several months during an interview."" China's strict control measures have led to stigma against not just recovered patients, but also their families, neighbours, friends and even frontline healthcare workers, said Jin Dongyan from the School of Biomedical Sciences at Hong Kong University. ""It is unscientific to think that people who were infected once will continue to carry the virus and be infectious long after recovering,"" Jin told AFP. ""Due to the lack of awareness, some fear that those who have been infected are more susceptible to being reinfected, but in reality, it's the opposite."" Zuo is now fighting a court battle with her employer, who has refused to pay her wages since she got sick, and who cites her disease history as a reason to bar her from returning to work. Her employer, a service company named Shanghai Yuanmao BPO, declined to comment citing the pending court case. He Yuxiu is a Chinese social media influencer who goes by a pseudonym and was living in Ukraine until Russia invaded. She fled the war and returned home, then found a job as a Russian-language teacher in north China's Hebei province, relieved to have left her troubles behind. But when her school learned that she had been infected with COVID-19 while in Ukraine, she was fired. ""I never imagined I'd lose my first job for this reason,"" she said in a video posted on China's Twitter-like Weibo. ""Why should we be treated like a virus when we have defeated it?"" The stigma is widespread - job ads for factory workers in Shanghai posted last month said applicants with a history of COVID-19 infection would be refused work. The story of a young woman who lived in a toilet for weeks in Shanghai's Hongqiao railway station since she was unable to find work or return to her village due to the stigma of having been infected went viral last month. And a theatre in the southern Chinese city of Foshan was forced to apologise after a notice banning recovered patients from entering sparked a public backlash. Beijing's National Health Commission and human resources ministry last month banned employers from discriminating against recovered COVID-19 patients, while Premier Li Keqiang has called for heavy punishments for those breaking the rules. But job seekers and activists are sceptical. Factories in Shanghai continued to refuse to hire recovered workers even after the city announced strict anti-discrimination rules, employment agent Wang Tao said, because they fear a mass outbreak or health inspections. ""Some factories give different excuses despite being short of workers,"" Wang added. ""But all those who are turned down have tested positive in the past."" AFP contacted eight manufacturers named by Chinese state media as having engaged in discriminatory practices - including iPhone manufacturer Foxconn - but they declined to comment. ""It's very difficult for workers to protect their rights since most employers offer different excuses and it is hard to prove that a labour law has been violated in these cases,"" said Aidan Chau, a researcher for the rights group China Labour Bulletin. ""It is important for labour unions to step up. But many small and medium factories don't have one."" Those who have tested positive are often referred to as ""little sheep people"" on Chinese social media. In Mandarin, the word for ""positive"" and ""sheep"" are pronounced the same way. ""It is very difficult for recovered patients to go back to our normal lives,"" said Zuo, the cleaner from Shanghai. ""No matter where we go, our infection history will follow us like a dark shadow."" "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/shanghai-reopen-all-schools-sep-1-lockdown-fears-persist-2879496,Shanghai to reopen all schools Sep 1 as lockdown fears persist,"SHANGHAI: China's financial hub Shanghai said on Sunday (Aug 14) that it would reopen all schools including kindergartens, primary and middle schools on Sep 1 after months of COVID-19 closures. The city will require all teachers and students to take nucleic acid tests for the coronavirus every day before leaving campus, the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission said. It also called for teachers and students to carry out a 14-day ""self-health management"" within the city ahead of the school reopening, the commission said in a statement. Shanghai shut all schools in mid-March before the city's two-month lockdown to combat its worst COVID-19 outbreak in April and May. It allowed some high school and middle school students to return to classrooms in June while most of the rest continued home study for the remainder of the semester. The announcement on schools reopening brings great relief to many residents but fears about COVID-19 lockdowns continue to persist, as China vows to stick to its dynamic zero policy which requires all positive cases and their close contacts to undergo quarantine. On Saturday, videos circulating on Chinese social media showed customers pushing past security guards and running out of an IKEA mall in central Shanghai in panic as an announcement blared over its sound system saying the mall was being locked down due to COVID-19 contact tracing. Reuters was not able to independently verify the authenticity of the videos but IKEA customer service said on Sunday the mall was shut due to COVID-19 curbs. IKEA did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. Shanghai, the most populous in China, reported five new local infections of COVID-19, all asymptomatic, for Saturday, while 2,467 domestically transmitted cases were reported nationwide. It has extended its weekly COVID-19 test requirement and extended free testing until the end of September in a bid to keep the virus in check, authorities announced on Saturday. The southern province of Hainan is now China's worst hit region, with 494 symptomatic cases and 846 asymptomatic cases reported for Saturday. Chinese Vice Premier Sun Chunlan urged Hainan to achieve zero cases at the community level as soon as possible when she inspected several places on the island, including the Sanya Phoenix International Airport on Saturday, state media reported.

Citizens without a record of a nucleic acid test from within seven days will be assigned a yellow code on Shanghai's health code system, the official notice said. A yellow code restricts access to some public venues. On Saturday health authorities in the financial hub of 25 million said they detected one symptomatic and three asymptomatic cases a day earlier. The southern province of Hainan is currently China's worst hit region, with 594 symptomatic cases and 832 asymptomatic cases reported on Saturday for 24 hours earlier. Tight restrictions and lockdowns in the popular tourist destination are expected to last over the weekend. On Saturday China's National Health Commission reported a total of 2,144 new COVID-19 infections on Aug 12, of which 704 were symptomatic and 1,440 were asymptomatic."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/north-korea-lifts-mask-mandate-covid-19-victory-2878401,North Korea lifts mask mandate after COVID-19 'victory',"SEOUL: North Korea has lifted a mask mandate and eased other virus restrictions, state media said Saturday (Aug 13), days after leader Kim Jong Un declared ""victory"" over COVID-19. The announcement comes after Pyongyang earlier this week blamed Seoul for causing the COVID-19 outbreak in the North and threatened to ""wipe out"" the South Korean authorities, if necessary. Virus restrictions were eased as ""the public health crisis created in the country was completely defused and its whole territory was turned into a clean one free from the malignant virus in the shortest period"", Pyongyang's official Korea Central News Agency (KCNA) reported. ""The step for obligatory mask-wearing was lifted in all areas except frontline areas and borderline cities and counties, given that the whole country was turned into an epidemic-free zone,"" KCNA said. North Korea declared a ""shining victory"" over COVID-19 earlier this week just months after announcing its first cases in May. Social distancing and other anti-virus measures were also lifted except for border regions. But people with symptoms of respiratory disease were recommended to wear masks and North Koreans were urged to ""remain vigilant"" against ""abnormal things"" - apparently referring to propaganda leaflets from the South. Despite a ban that took effect in 2021, South Korean activists for years have flown balloons carrying propaganda leaflets and dollars over the border, which the North has long protested against. Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of Kim Jong Un, on Wednesday blamed these activities for the North's COVID-19 outbreak, vowing ""deadly"" retaliation against Seoul. Kim Yo Jong also revealed that the top leader himself had fallen ill during the outbreak and suffered from a ""high fever"". North Korea has recorded nearly 4.8 million ""fever"" cases - while only identifying a fraction of those as COVID-19 - since late April, with just 74 deaths, according to KCNA. Experts, including the World Health Organization, have long questioned Pyongyang's COVID-19 statistics and claims to have brought the outbreak under control. North Korea has one of the world's worst healthcare systems, with poorly equipped hospitals and few intensive care units, experts say. It is not believed to have vaccinated any of its 26 million population, although it may have received some vaccines from China, Seoul-based specialist site NK News has reported."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tourism-travel-package-tours-prices-natas-fair-2022-japan-2877066,'Dying to travel': Holidaymakers willing to pay more for longer tours despite price increase,"SINGAPORE: Prices may have increased for some tour destinations but travellers are still willing to head abroad despite the cost. The National Association of Travel Agents (NATAS) travel fair, last held in 2019, returned on Friday (Aug 12) for a three-day event at the Singapore Expo. It is billed as one of Singapore's largest consumer travel fairs.  More than 40 exhibitors including travel agents, airlines, cruise operators, hotels and national tourist organisations are involved in the event. NATAS president Steven Ler said in response to CNA’s queries that the fair will “kickstart the season of safe travels"" and pivot industry players back to near full operations. “As more resources are being deployed, the entire supply chain is activated and businesses are revitalised,” he added. About 80,000 to 100,000 visitors are expected over the three days, Mr Ler said, almost on par with pre-pandemic visitorship of about 108,000. When CNA visited the fair around noon on Friday, the crowd was moderate but footfall started picking after 4pm. Some visitors were even waiting for doors to open at the start of the event at 10am, said Chan Brothers Travel’s senior marketing communications manager Jeremiah Wong. “As travel agents, we really feel like people are really dying to travel,” said Mr Wong. Director of EU Holidays, Mr Wong Yew Hoong said the current travel demand was ""even stronger"" compared to pre-pandemic peak seasons such as school holidays. While travel demand is strong, the supply has yet to catch up, he said, adding that airfares for popular destinations in December such as Japan’s Hokkaido have “tripled” compared to a few months ago. ""If they don’t travel this December, it will be next December. That will be four years (without travel) ... They do not want to wait again."" Air ticket prices have also gone up due to the increase in fuel prices worldwide, said Ms Lee Hwee Noi, senior manager of international product development at Hong Thai Travel. Station manager Mr Meswan Satin, who attended the travel fair on Friday, said that he will still opt for tour packages even if they are expensive. “We understand that the inflation rate has gone up because of the pandemic ... That (is) something that you got to live with,” said Mr Meswan who was looking at destinations such as Dubai and Turkey. “We have no choice … because we enjoy travelling.” Assistant general manager of leisure and travel at New Shan Travel, Ms Chris Tay said: “We have not been travelling for quite some time. So I believe during this period of time, they have saved enough so they don't mind (going) further.” This observation was shared by the Japan National Tourism Organisation (JNTO), which provides travel information to tourists looking to visit Japan. “Price is not a big problem,” said Ms Hatsume Nagai, JNTO’s executive director for Singapore, citing a survey conducted by the organisation. She also noted that the travel demand for Japan is “higher than expected”. Some travel agents told CNA that Japan was among the most popular destinations for the December holiday period. This is despite the country allowing only visitors on package tours as part of its first phase of reopening which began on Jun 10. In addition to seeing more people lean towards longer trips, many travel agencies also reported that more travellers were seeking tour packages that offer more included activities.  “Now when people are travelling overseas, they are more willing to pay for longer trips and better inclusion,” said EU Holidays’ Mr Wong.  Although travellers previously visited multiple countries during their holidays, Mr Wong noted that many now look for more in-depth tours. Apart from Japan, trips to see the Northern Lights and Turkey were among the popular tour options.  With destinations like Japan allowing visitors on group tour basis, agencies such as Chan Brothers Travel have observed “great interest” for such tours from repeat customers as well as first timers.  “Because they miss Japan so much and they want to travel soon … We are seeing customers switching to group tours and coming to us,” said Mr Wong. While travel hesitancy is not as strong as when the vaccinated travel lanes (VTLs) began, some still have concerns about travelling. This has led to many opting for group tours for the first time.  “They now have a chance to experience what a group tour is like in 2022 and maybe some of that mindset of what a group tour is like can be changed,” said Mr Wong. “They might be converted for their future travels.” This shift in mindset also applies to cruises which used to be seen as an activity for ""old people"", said New Shan Travel's Ms Tay. However, many younger travellers were ""converted"" after they opted for cruises during the pandemic.  She also noted an increase in travellers booking through agents. “Before COVID-19, all these people just do it online and off they go. But now they will book from agent(s) although they know there is a service fee,” said Ms Tay."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-united-divided-pandemic-handling-management-vaccines-pew-2876451,Most Singaporeans feel more united than before COVID-19 pandemic; other countries see increased division: Survey,"SINGAPORE: Three-quarters of Singaporeans in a recent survey said their country was more united than before the COVID-19 pandemic, in contrast to most people in several other countries feeling that their societies are now more divided. In a study released on Thursday (Aug 11) by American research think-tank Pew, nearly nine out of 10 Singaporean respondents also said their country has dealt with the pandemic well. Some 75 per cent said Singapore was effectively handling the coronavirus outbreak in ways that show the strengths of the political system. Among 24,525 people in 19 advanced economies that were polled, Singaporeans also stood out for having more than seven in 10 respondents see vaccination as very important for being a good member of society. The survey, conducted by Pew from Feb 14 to Jun 3, focused on attitudes toward the pandemic in countries across North America, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific.  Most people in 13 countries saw their country as more divided than before the pandemic. The United States had the highest share (81 per cent) of respondents who felt that way, followed by 80 per cent in the Netherlands and 78 per cent in Germany. On the other hand, 75 per cent of the Singaporeans polled said their country was now more united than before the pandemic. Singapore, Sweden (60 per cent) and Malaysia (58 per cent) were the only countries with majorities who felt that way. The survey also found that 88 per cent of Singaporean respondents felt that the country has done a good job dealing with the coronavirus outbreak. Singapore ""was largely successful at suppressing the spread of the virus prior to the development of effective vaccines"", said Pew in its report. Sweden came closest with 82 per cent of its respondents also rating highly their country's management of the pandemic. This was in contrast to Japan and South Korea, where 47 per cent and 43 per cent respectively felt that their country had done a bad job. Still, the majority of people in most places surveyed approved of their country’s coronavirus response. But in 11 of the 19 advanced economies polled, a majority felt that their country was failing to effectively handle the outbreak in ways that show the weaknesses of the political system.  These include the US (66 per cent), Japan (57 per cent) and Australia (55 per cent). In Singapore, however, 74 per cent per cent said the opposite - that their country was effectively handling the outbreak in ways that show the strengths of the political system.  Pew noted that in almost every country, supporters of the governing political party were much more likely to say their government was handling the outbreak well. These supporters would also say that their country was handling the pandemic effectively in ways that show the strengths of the political system. And they would also believe that their country was more united compared with before the pandemic. The Pew study also found that the perceived importance of the COVID-19 vaccine was heavily partisan in nature. In every country surveyed, those who support the governing party were much more likely to say it was very important to be vaccinated, said the research centre. Around two-thirds or more in every country surveyed saw it as somewhat important to get a vaccine to be a good member of society. Singapore topped the table with 72 per cent of respondents seeing vaccination as very important to be a good member of society, with Sweden (71 per cent) and Spain (70 per cent) following. Poland had the lowest share of respondents (33 per cent) who felt the same. Pew further noted a positive relationship between the share of the public who thought it was very important to get a vaccine to be a good member of society, and the actual population that was fully or partially vaccinated at the time it began fieldwork for the survey. As of Wednesday (Aug 10), 93 per cent of Singapore's eligible population have completed their full vaccination regimen, while 79 per cent of the total population have received their vaccine booster shots.  "

The first comprises people who lost their jobs during the pandemic and were forced to seek shelter as they could not afford to pay rent for a room on the open market. Prior to this, some used to move frequently between open market rentals and staying with family and friends but the pandemic had a direct impact on many of these arrangements. In one case highlighted in the study, a person who had been renting a bedroom in a HDB flat, had his tenancy terminated because the landlord was worried that he “might bring COVID home”. Others who had been living with their friends had been asked to leave out of fear of breaking rules on social visits during the circuit breaker period. The second group is made up of middle-aged Singaporean men who are married to Malaysian or Indonesian nationals and live in the countries but frequently travel to Singapore for higher-paying jobs. Border closures in 2020 resulted in the displacement of this group, many of whom suddenly found themselves unable to return to Malaysia and Indonesia and were forced to sleep on the streets. The study was done by Dr Ng Kok Hoe, a senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, who led a team of researchers at the school’s Social Inclusion Project to do Singapore’s second nationwide study on homelessness. Among its findings, the study found that the scale of homelessness did not change significantly between 2019 and 2021, despite intense state intervention and the far-reaching impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The combined size of the street homeless and temporary shelter populations in 2021 was 1,036, comparable to the 1,115 recorded in 2019. In addition to street counts, researchers also conducted in-depth interviews with 51 residents at a temporary shelter for homeless people, to understand their personal circumstances, housing histories and pathways into homelessness. Most of the interview participants were Singaporean men, aged 50 years and above, with the majority having only primary or secondary education. Many were working or looking for work and about half were either divorced or widowed. Besides the two groups, the study also identified another group of homeless people among its interview participants. This group, which comprises more men than women, is made up of people who have been rough sleeping even before the pandemic hit Singapore in February 2020. The long-term homeless people have been on the streets from a few months to up to 25 years, with their ages ranging from the 30s to the 70s. Many had completely lost contact with their family and had poor experiences with public rental housing. They were found while rough sleeping during the pandemic and referred to the shelter. All of them had experienced problems in their family relationships such as historical misunderstandings with parents or siblings that led to participants leaving the family at a young age or acrimonious breakups involving years of conflict, even violence. Describing their work and finances, the report said this group is made up of people who have low-wage and insecure jobs and live in extreme poverty. They had little or no savings, and had to carefully ration any money they received by cutting back on basic needs like food and toiletries, the report found. Across the three groups, there are several common factors that contributed to their homelessness. These include family conflict, insecure work and the inability to meet basic needs, and for some, physical and mental health problems. The report also highlighted the public rental housing system as a contributing factor to homelessness in some cases. Pointing to the Joint Singles Scheme which requires applicants to pair up, the report said it created barriers to access and opportunities for conflict among tenants that led to exit from rental housing. It suggested making the formal eligibility rules fairer and according priority to people who are at risk of homelessness or already homeless, while assuring basic standards of space and privacy."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/china-hainan-extend-covid-lockdown-lhasa-tibet-tightens-curbs-2876236,"Parts of China's Hainan extend COVID-19 lockdown, Lhasa in Tibet tightens curbs","SHANGHAI: A few cities in China's tourism hub Hainan extended lockdowns on Friday (Aug 12), with some of the measures expected to last through the weekend, while Lhasa in Tibet also tightened restrictions, among the latest curbs to contain COVID-19 clusters in the country. Under the ""dynamic COVID zero"" policy that aims at quickly stopping each outbreak from spreading, local governments have imposed shorter lockdowns where people were barred from unnecessary movements for a few days or weeks until clusters were contained within narrower areas. Such lockdowns were less painful than the two-month virus battle fought by Shanghai in the spring, but the growing spread of Omicron across China may lead to more cities made subject to such measures along with the potential disruption to local businesses. In the southern province of Hainan, currently, the worst-hit Chinese region, two cities, Dongfang and Chengmai, with a total population of around 900,000, said on Friday they would add days to the lockdowns on their residents, prolonging what was previously scheduled for three to four days to around a week. Hainan's provincial capital Haikou on Friday put its 2.9 population in lockdown between 7.00am and 6.00pm local time, following similar restrictions that covered main hours on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. Several million in other cities in Hainan, including Sanya, were under lockdown without clear dates of when the curbs would be lifted. In the western region of Tibet, the biggest city Lhasa told residents not to go out unless they have special and urgent matters to attend to between Friday and Monday, as COVID-19 workers carried out disinfection work in main urban areas. Outside Hainan and Tibet, small cities that told residents not to leave home unnecessarily in fresh lockdowns include Fengcheng in the southeastern province of Jiangxi and Kuqa in the western region of Xinjiang. Mainland China reported 1,851 domestically transmitted new coronavirus infections on Aug 11, of which 648 were symptomatic and 1,203 were asymptomatic, the National Health Commission said on Friday. Those new cases were reported across more than a dozen provinces, regions and municipalities, but mostly in Hainan. There were no new deaths, keeping the nation's fatalities at 5,226. The financial hub of Shanghai reported seven new local cases on Aug11, while the southern technology hub of Shenzhen reported one new local case. China's capital Beijing reported no new local cases."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/china-middle-class-zero-covid-unemployment-property-crisis-2874086,"Commentary: With growing job and housing woes, more Chinese citizens are thinking of an ‘exit’","HONG KONG: When President Xi Jinping first promoted the phrase “Chinese dream” in late 2012, one key vision was the creation of an “olive-shaped” Chinese society with a big middle class – a social structure typical in modernised countries elsewhere. In other words, the dream of becoming a fully developed nation can only be realised if the middle class keeps enlarging. This stratum of society is after all expected to drive forward China’s consumption-oriented economy. But 10 years on, COVID-19 has become the stuff of nightmares. Over the month of July, China recorded the highest number of COVID-19 cases since May, which was when the pandemic struck Shanghai. On Jul 19, the daily count for new cases breached 1,000 – an alarming number to Chinese officials firmly beholden to the zero-COVID national strategy. Now in peak summer travel season, domestic tourism hubs have been hit. On Aug 6, Chinese resort city Sanya went into lockdown after reporting 263 COVID-19 cases, up from 11 two days previously. The affected 80,000 tourists must show five negative PCR tests over seven days in order to leave. Such strict quarantines have been the new normal under the official zero-COVID policy. Top medical journal The Lancet has cautioned against the “huge human cost” of these lockdowns. A national survey found more than one-third of respondents experienced anxiety and depression, higher than the World Health Organization's figure of a 25 per cent increase in the global prevalence of such symptoms in the first year of the pandemic. Besides the toll on mental health, the economic consequences of China’s COVID-19 strategy have been drastic. Because the economy is growing at the slowest pace since China’s first outbreak, Premier Li Keqiang said the country may miss its 5.5 per cent growth target this year. Youth unemployment reached a record high of 19.3 per cent in June, while factory activity contracted in July. For the 400-million-strong Chinese middle class however, their malaise does not stop at COVID-19-related uncertainties. In 21st-century China, two things have long been markers of the much-vaunted middle-class status: Home ownership and professional jobs. Both are often perceived as pre-requisites for marriage. More importantly, they are part of the implicit social contract between the Chinese Communist Party and the broader population. In return for acquiescence to the Party’s rule, the middle class is promised an abundance of personal and economic opportunities, such as climbing the housing ladder and attaining a well-paid job. Today, they can no longer be taken for granted. Even before the coronavirus outbreak, young prospective homeowners had increasingly been priced out of the housing market in big cities. According to a government survey, in megacities like Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, the housing-price-to-income ratio was above 35 – meaning that the price of an average house is equivalent to roughly 35 years of the average household income.  The ongoing real estate downturn that has seen defaulted developers and stalled housing projects across the country only made things more dire. Strict COVID-19 policies have also dampened the appetite to purchase properties. Analysts forecast that property sales will plunge by 30 per cent this year.  Faced with the reality of unfinished homes and declining real estate values, many of these middle-class homebuyers are boycotting their mortgage payments, affecting more than 300 development projects in over 90 cities. Given that China’s middle class holds about 70 per cent of collective wealth in housing, the socio-economic stakes are high.  Apart from the real estate crisis, China’s college-to-career pipeline is also under severe strain, as the private sector has been hit particularly hard by the pandemic and regulatory scrutiny. The private sector has been the country’s biggest employer, accounting for more than half of the country’s GDP and over 80 per cent of urban employment. Yet, the already-hypercompetitive sector is now seeing mass layoffs, hiring freezes and wage slashes.  Small wonder then that more than 2 million applicants – a record high – registered for the national civil service examination last year, as they desperately seek out a more secure and stable career in the public sector. Based on this number, their chances of landing a public sector job were no more than 1.5 per cent. In other words, in addition to having to endure economic and personal pains caused by the zero-COVID policy, China’s middle class is stuck in an ever-fiercer rat race for jobs and housing. However, it is unlikely that these grievances will agglomerate into a summer of discontent. To be sure, there were sporadic instances of open dissent. Shanghai residents banged pots and pans to protest against the gruelling two-month lockdown of the city. University students in Beijing staged protests over campus restrictions on their movement.  More commonly though, some Chinese netizens have vented their frustrations via social media. Even so, state censors have been quick with taking down viral posts critical of current policies.  Indeed, the Chinese leadership has recognised these are potential seeds of social instability – something they would be eager to deter in a year when President Xi is expected to renew his leadership tenure. The government is currently contemplating extending some level of flexible treatment, if not a soft state bailout, to real estate developers. It also committed to building millions of low-cost rental housing over the next three years. Though the state still holds fast to the zero-COVID strategy, there are signs of softening. On Jun 28, the quarantine period for international travellers was cut by half. More recently, Hong Kong went further and reduced the quarantine period to three days. Equally troubling to authorities is how a sizable portion of the middle class, particularly the youth, is thinking of an exit from the relentless competition over academics and jobs, as well as a literal exit from the country itself. Recently popularised Internet expressions of “tang ping” (lying flat, or withdrawing from the rat race) and “runxue” (the art of running, or learning how to leave the country for good) capture this sentiment. In April, keyword searches related to “emigration” exceeded 100 million a day. Acknowledging the trend, state media commentators have condemned these ideas. Meanwhile, China’s top immigration authority announced it would curb “non-essential” overseas travels and tighten control over the issuance of passports to ostensibly prevent the spread of the virus.  To be sure, an exit option remains a dream for many and they will likely have to plough on. But that “exit” crossed the minds of many is an indicator of the deep sense of powerlessness among the citizens, as well as a lack of confidence in President Xi’s “Chinese dream”.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/chinese-medical-portal-censored-herbal-covid-19-remedy-lianhua-qingwen-2873721,Chinese medical portal censored after doubting herbal 'COVID-19 remedy',"BEIJING: A popular Chinese medical information site has been censored by authorities for ""violation of relevant laws and regulations"", months after its criticism of a government-backed herbal COVID-19 treatment sent shares in a pharmaceutical giant tumbling. DXY, which counts tech giant Tencent among its investors and runs a host of health-related services, previously questioned the value of Lianhua Qingwen, a herbal remedy marketed for fever and sore throats, as a COVID-19 treatment. China approved the concoction - made up of ingredients like honeysuckle and apricot seeds - as a COVID-19 treatment in 2020, and it was distributed to Shanghai residents during the city's outbreak this year. DXY's article, which has now been deleted from its website, was part of a wave of reports that caused shares in Lianhua Qingwen's producer - one of China's largest traditional medicine companies - to plunge. The website has now been banned from posting on at least five of its Weibo social media accounts, with a notice at the top of its official page saying that due to ""violation of relevant laws and regulations, this user is currently prohibited from posting"". DXY's official WeChat accounts, which typically publish multiple articles a day on medical topics, have not been updated since Monday (Aug 8). The Weibo notice did not specify which regulations had been violated by DXY, which did not immediately respond to AFP's request for comment. The Chinese government has increasingly promoted traditional medicine at home and abroad in recent years, often with nationalistic undertones. DXY's coverage prompted criticism that it was targeting traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in order to promote Western pharmaceuticals. The decision to freeze DXY's social media accounts was lauded by some Weibo users, who accused the company of working with ""anti-China forces"" and peddling false information. ""For this vicious thing eating the anti-Chinese capitalists' dog food, the best days are in the past,"" one Weibo user wrote. But others lamented the loss of a valued source of misinformation-free medical guidance and said they disagreed with the censorship. ""My mother used to be the kind of person who would make her kids eat chicken gallbladder for fevers,"" one wrote, crediting DXY with giving her parent access to modern medical information. ""You have the right to (criticise) DXY on Weibo, but you don't have the right to ban them,"" the user wrote. The United States and other countries have warned there is no evidence Lianhua Qingwen works to prevent or cure COVID-19, even as it has increasingly been promoted by government authorities in China and Hong Kong. The US Food and Drug Administration has said it has not approved Lianhua Qingwen and that coronavirus-related claims about it were ""not supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence"". Beijing issued its first white paper on TCM in 2016, laying out plans to build medicine centres and dispatch practitioners to developing countries in Africa and Southeast Asia. President Xi Jinping has described TCM as a ""treasure of Chinese civilisation"" and has said that it should be given as much weight as other treatments. Beijing's National Health Commission has also dispatched TCM practitioners as part of its medical reinforcement teams sent to fight COVID-19 outbreaks across the country."

Here's what you need to know,"From Friday (Aug 12), Hong Kong will pare down the COVID-19 hotel quarantine period for all arrivals from seven days to three, as part of measures to gradually ease some of the world’s most stringent pandemic restrictions. Previously, inbound travellers had to spend at least a week in hotel quarantine and undergo several COVID-19 tests, provide faecal samples for babies and grapple with multiple forms. Under new rules announced on Monday, inbound travellers will only need to serve a three-day quarantine at a quarantine hotel, before going home or staying in a non-quarantine hotel for the next four days. During this period, they must continue to undergo medical surveillance. They can go out and take public transport, but there are limits on the places they are allowed to enter. Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee said the new measures are a “way of striking a balance between minimising the risks of COVID-19 transmission and keeping Hong Kong a competitive city”. If you’re planning to travel to Hong Kong, note that under the new “3+4” model, you need to stay in a designated quarantine hotel for three days from your arrival date, which counts as Day 0. After obtaining a negative test result in the morning of Day 3, you may go home or move to a non-designated quarantine hotel, to complete another four days of medical surveillance. If you test negative throughout, you can complete medical surveillance in the morning of Day 7. You still need to monitor your health for the entire seven days and take daily antigen rapid tests (ARTs) until Day 10. For example, if you arrive on Aug 12, you will complete your mandatory hotel quarantine on the morning of Aug 15, and complete medical surveillance in the morning of Aug 19. These rules apply to all travellers regardless of vaccination status. Be prepared to take at least five polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and daily ARTs until Day 10. Upon arrival in Hong Kong, you must take a PCR test at the airport and then on Day 2 during your mandatory hotel quarantine.  After leaving the designated quarantine hotel, you must go to community testing centres or a mobile specimen collection station to get swabbed on Days 4, 6 and 9.  You must test negative on an ART before heading out. You can also arrange for a self-paid test by professional swab sampling at a local medical institution recognised by the Hong Kong government. Until you test negative in the morning of Day 3, no. After that, upon clearing the mandatory hotel quarantine, you will be assigned an amber code in Hong Kong’s LeaveHomeSafe mobile application, to restrict movement. With an amber code, you can go out - provided you first test negative in your daily ART. But you will be limited to ""daily essential activities"" deemed by the Hong Kong government to be of lower risks, such as taking transport, going to work and entering markets or supermarkets. You cannot enter high-risk premises that involve mask-off or group activities, such as restaurants, bars, hair salons and fitness centres.   You will also not be allowed to visit residential care homes for the elderly and people with disabilities, schools or designated healthcare premises. If you test positive for COVID-19 upon arrival, you will be issued an isolation order and transferred to a government isolation centre.  You will also be issued a red code. All positive COVID-19 cases will not be allowed to leave their isolation location. If you have received at least two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, isolation will be considered completed after receiving negative ART results on the sixth and seventh day after testing positive.  Your red code will then automatically change to blue. Those who have not been vaccinated, or have only received one vaccine dose, will need to complete a 14-day isolation period at the designated site.   According to the Hong Kong government, surveillance data shows that about 80 per cent of imported COVID-19 cases were detected by the first two PCR tests taken upon arrival.  The overall infection detection rate among arrivals after the third day of quarantine in designated hotels was also lower that the rate in the local community. With this, mandating a longer period of hotel quarantine is “neither cost-effective nor precise and targeted, causing unnecessary disruption to travellers”, said Hong Kong authorities. The decision by the government also considered Hong Kong’s position as an international financial and commercial centre, and thus the need to connect with different parts of the world to maintain business travel and economic activities.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/several-cities-china-covid-19-curbs-millions-still-under-lockdown-2873751,Several cities in China add COVID-19 curbs as millions still under lockdown,"BEIJING: Several COVID-hit Chinese cities from the country's east to west imposed fresh restrictions and lockdowns on their populations on Thursday (Aug 11) to contain flare-ups that are again threatening to disrupt local economies. Reducing people's unnecessary movement for a few days - a softer type of lockdown - as soon as dozens of new cases emerge is a key practice of China's ""dynamic COVID-zero"" strategy. The aim is to avoid turning efforts to halt an outbreak into the extended nightmares seen in Shanghai and Wuhan. The uncertainty over how long such smaller lockdowns may last - because Omicron's high transmissibility makes it harder to clear infections - has hurt business confidence and made people less willing to travel. The eastern export and manufacturing hub Yiwu said on Thursday it would enter three days of ""silent management"", with most of its residents banned from leaving designated areas and some confined to their homes. Yiwu's 1.9 million people joined millions of others across several cities whose movements are restricted largely to their residential compounds unless they have to go out for matters such as COVID-19 tests, grocery shopping or hospital visits. Companies whose employees can work on closed campuses are still allowed to operate, while all public venues in Yiwu were to be closed during the three days, excluding hospitals and other places offering essential services. In China's western region of Xinjiang, three cities in the Aksu area from Thursday allowed employees to leave their homes for work while restricting everyone else to necessary movements only. It is not clear when the measures will be lifted. Key districts in Xinjiang's capital Urumqi, meanwhile, have been in a five-day lockdown starting on Wednesday. Clusters in the tourism hotspots Hainan and Tibet continued to expand, with affected cities under lockdowns. Mainland China reported 1,993 domestically transmitted new coronavirus cases for Aug 10 - 614 symptomatic and 1,379 asymptomatic - the National Health Commission said on Thursday. There were no new deaths, keeping fatalities at 5,226. China has confirmed 232,809 cases with symptoms as of Aug 10, including local transmitted ones and those among arrivals. China's capital Beijing reported two local cases for the previous day, while financial hub Shanghai and southern technology hub Shenzhen reported zero new local infections."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/kim-jong-un-sister-warn-seoul-retaliation-over-covid-19-2873431,Kim Jong Un's sister warns Seoul of 'retaliation' over COVID-19,"SEOUL: The powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un accused the South of causing a COVID-19 outbreak in the country and warned of ""retaliation"", as Pyongyang declared ""victory"" over its outbreak, state media said on Thursday (Aug 11). North Korea has previously said that ""alien things"" near the border with the South caused the COVID-19 outbreak in the isolated country, a claim that Seoul has rejected. Despite a ban that took effect in 2021, South Korean activists have for years flown balloons containing propaganda leaflets and US dollars over the border, which Pyongyang has long protested against. On Thursday, Kim Jong Un's sister, Yo Jong, blamed these activities for the country's COVID-19 outbreak, saying they were a ""crime against humanity"", the official Korea Central News Agency (KCNA) reported. She said that many countries - and the World Health Organization - have acknowledged ""the danger of spreading an infectious disease through contacting contaminated objects"", according to the report. ""It is very worrisome that South Korea is sending leaflets, money, sloppy brochures and items into our region,"" she said. Yo Jong warned that Pyongyang was considering ""a strong retaliatory response"", adding that if the balloons continued, ""we will respond by eradicating not only the virus, but also the South Korean authorities"". Seoul last month said there have been ""no officially verified cases of COVID-19 infections via post or materials"". Kim's comments come as her brother declared a ""shining victory"" in the battle against COVID-19 after officials reported no new cases of the virus for nearly two weeks. North Korea has one of the world's worst healthcare systems, with poorly equipped hospitals, few intensive care units, and no COVID-19 treatment drugs or vaccines, experts say. Even Kim Jong Un apparently suffered from COVID-19, according to Yo Jong's comments. Kim ""was suffering from high fever during the days of this quarantine war, but he could not lie down for a moment as he was thinking about the people he was responsible for"", his sister said."

North Korea has not revealed how many confirmed infections of the virus it has found, but since Jul 29 it has reported no new suspected cases with what international aid organisations say are limited testing capabilities. Kim said North Korea's official death rate of 74 people is an ""unprecedented miracle"" compared to other countries, KCNA reported. Experts have said that the North's numbers are unlikely to show the whole picture. Its declaration of victory comes despite rolling out no known vaccine programme. Instead, the country says it relied on lockdowns, homegrown medicine treatments, and what Kim called the ""advantageous Korean-style socialist system"". He ordered the lifting of maximum anti-pandemic measures, but said that North Korea must maintain a ""steel-strong anti-epidemic barrier and intensifying the anti-epidemic work until the end of the global health crisis"". Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, said the North Korean leader himself had suffered from fever symptoms, and blamed leaflets from South Korea for causing the outbreak, KCNA reported. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/china-races-contain-covid-19-outbreaks-tourism-hubs-tibet-hainan-2868731,"China races to contain COVID-19 outbreaks in tourism hubs Tibet, Hainan","SHANGHAI: China raced on Tuesday (Aug 9) to stamp out COVID-19 outbreaks in the tourist hubs of Tibet and Hainan, with the authorities launching more rounds of mass testing and closing venues to contain the highly transmissible Omicron variant. Mainland China reported 828 new domestically transmitted cases across more than a dozen provinces and regions for Aug 8, with more than half of them in Hainan, a highly popular tourist destination, official data showed on Tuesday. Tibet, which until now had reported only one symptomatic case since the pandemic started more than two years ago, has also reported cases. Parts of Tibet were running mass COVID-19 testing on Tuesday, including its two largest cities Lhasa and Shigatse, where local authorities suspended large events, closed entertainment and religious venues, and shut some tourist sites including the Potala Palace. Tibetan authorities reported one local patient with confirmed symptoms and 21 local asymptomatic infections on Aug 8. While the caseload was very small compared with elsewhere in China and globally, the rare infections struck a nerve among some residents. ""Although my life and work aren't affected much and Lhasa took action very quickly, I was still quite shocked, as Tibet had been COVID-19 free for about 920 days,"" said Yungchen, a 26-year-old Lhasa resident, who was told by her employer to work from home. ""I was a bit worried, because we don't know when and where the infected people contracted the virus,"" she told Reuters, preferring not to give her full name. Yungchen said she doesn't expect a Shanghai-style months-long lockdown in Lhasa, but still bought rice and cooking oil. She bought enough to last four to five days in case she is unable to dine out if COVID-19 restrictions are tightened. Shigatse, a gateway city to the Everest region in Tibet, has scheduled a ""silent period"" lasting three days during which people are banned from entering or leaving, and many businesses suspended. Both Lhasa and Shigatse were conducting a fresh round of mass testing, and the second round begins on Wednesday, state television said on Tuesday. In Tibet's western Ngari prefecture, a sparsely populated region that has attracted many pilgrims to Mount Kailash, three towns have started three rounds of mass testing, while the rest have started on their first, state television said. Subvariants of Omicron are challenging China's strategy of swiftly blocking the spread of each nascent cluster. Tibet and Hainan, which have seen relatively few cases for more than two years, are now facing risks of persistent tight restrictions as the economy weakens. Their tourism-reliant economies could be particularly vulnerable if the outbreaks are prolonged. In 2019, Tibet received a record 39.6 million domestic tourists drawn to its unspoiled natural scenery and promise of adventure travel. That was comparable to the 40.9 million international tourist arrivals to the United Kingdom that year. In tropical Hainan, millions of residents are under lockdown across several cities and towns, allowed out only for necessary reasons such as COVID-19 tests, grocery shopping and essential job roles. Dongfang, a city of over 400,000 residents, entered a three-day lockdown starting on Tuesday. The provincial capital Haikou has lifted its lockdown that lasted hours on Monday. Around 178,000 tourists are also stranded on the island, according to state media reports. Hainan said on Tuesday that certain tourists are allowed to leave if they can show negative test results. Provincial authorities must adopt all measures to achieve by Friday ""COVID-zero at the community level"" where no new cases emerge in communities outside quarantined areas, Hainan's government said in a statement late on Monday. Hainan's success in containing smaller clusters in April and July has resulted in complacency among officials and residents, one provincial health official said. ""We still have many shortcomings and weaknesses in COVID-19 epidemiologic investigation, testing and treatment,"" Zhou Changqiang, the head of Hainan's health commission, told state television late on Monday.

The action underscores China’s continued adherence to its ""zero-COVID"" policy, mandating lockdowns, routine testing, quarantines and travel restrictions, even while most other countries have reopened. A notice on the palace’s Weixin social media site said the palace that was the traditional home of Tibet’s Buddhist leaders would be closed from Tuesday (Aug 9), with a reopening date to be announced later. Tibet’s economy is heavily dependent on tourism and the Potala is a key draw. China says its hard-line policy has been successful in preventing large-scale hospitalisations and deaths, while critics including the World Health Organization have decried its impact on the economy and society and said it is out of step with the changing nature of the virus and new methods of prevention and treatment. China announced 828 new cases of domestic transmission on Tuesday, 22 of them in Tibet. The majority of those cases showed no symptoms. Meanwhile, more than 80,000 travellers remain stranded on the southern resort island of Hainan under requirements that they consistently test negative for the virus in coming days before being allowed to leave."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/national-day-ndp-2022-covid-19-kindness-volunteer-community-2866316,Commentary: Has COVID-19 made us more selfish? Let’s reverse that this National Day,"SINGAPORE: I recently visited Penang with my family, who flew in from Canada. I last saw them in person two years ago, before the pandemic began. Even though we kept in touch over video calls, there is something special about spending time with loved ones in the flesh. That’s something that Singapore residents are rediscovering as COVID-19 restrictions relax. Overseas travel is in full swing with people going on long-postponed holidays or reconnecting with family abroad. Back home, live music venues are buzzing, and our roads and malls are jam-packed with people again. In the past month, my Facebook and Instagram feeds have been filled with posts of friends enjoying the National Day Parade rehearsals at the Floating Platform at Marina Bay. Amid the pomp and spectacle, there is a sense of joy and relief that things are going back to normal again. But are they? Or has life changed us in subtle ways over the pandemic that no amount of travel or revelry can reverse? When I was asked about my thoughts on Singapore’s social compact, I considered how far we’ve come from a small trading port struggling with its identity in the 1960s. As we herald the next generation of Singaporeans and their leaders, it is an opportune time to review and renew the principles that bind us together. Call it my three birthday wishes that I have for us as a nation, as Singapore celebrates its 57th year of independence. In the 50s, I grew up in a kampung in the Bartley area. We had no running water and had to draw it from a communal well. In the morning, residents would gather around the well to brush their teeth and take their share of the water. The first person who drew for himself also drew for the rest of us. We did not squabble over it. It was a precious resource that no one dared pollute or misuse.  This story shows how post-war Singapore was poor but relatively harmonious. We did not have much but took care of each other. This is not to romanticise the Singapore I grew up in. No doubt, there were challenges back then too. But my story is an account of the “kampung spirit” – mutual aid exchanged freely and graciously. Since then, we have effectively gone from Third World to First in a span of a generation, which has come at some cost to our kampung spirit. This was laid bare at the start of the pandemic, when people responded with much self-centredness, such as hoarding groceries and toilet paper out of fear of scarcity. But as we progressed deeper into the pandemic, many individuals stepped up for others. Over these two years, the Internet abounded with stories of how our heroic frontliners and volunteers went the extra mile. For instance, in May, early childhood educator Ms Huda organised a trip for her class to Punggol Fire Station. She was so touched by the kindness of the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) personnel towards one of her young students with special needs that she wrote in to thank the firefighters. This would have been a sweet story alone but what happened next took it to the next level. The SCDF personnel not only responded to her message, but organised a special visit to little Isaac Tan’s home to cheer him up after a surgery. The joy of the little boy, who has Noonan Syndrome, was infectious and a video clip of him hugging the smiling firefighters went viral on TikTok. Stories like this show how we don’t have to make grand gestures to touch someone’s life. Simply taking time to connect with someone could make their day, or even form an unforgettable memory. Besides sharing our resources and time with each other, we cannot allow those who feel sidelined by society to continue feeling that way. In a survey conducted by CNA and the Institute of the Policy Studies, more than half of respondents (56.2 per cent) believe racism is an important problem, up from 46.3 per cent in a previous 2016 survey. Even with rising awareness, incidents of casual racism such as name-calling and snide remarks still permeate our society. Minority groups say they have to adjust their behaviour and expectations according to the majority – who are often oblivious to their discomfort. This lack of awareness isn’t limited to older folks either. Just a few weeks ago on Racial Harmony Day, a junior college student dressed up in traditional Arab attire and mimed mock executions on students with black bags over their heads, prompting police investigations. Racial harmony, as Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong recently wrote in a Facebook post, is still a work in progress. He said: “Our racial harmony is not perfect, and we are still learning and growing as a nation. As long as we do not take this peace for granted and work together to protect our common space, we will get there.” Grassroots groups and campaigns have striven to enlarge the space for open and frank dialogue. When racially charged incidents are uploaded to social media, they immediately trigger reactions and comments. For instance, the viral clip of the polytechnic lecturer making racist remarks to an interracial couple sparked soul-searching of our assumptions about racial harmony. It also provided people an opportunity to voice their own stories. Mr Sharvesh Leatchmanan, co-founder and editor of Minority Voices, which serves as platform for minorities to share their experiences of discrimination, said he received more than a hundred submissions after that viral incident. Besides creating space for dialogue, we can strengthen our community by taking ownership of it. By doing so, we would feel more inclined to help the needy and vulnerable. One notable movement that was founded during the pandemic is Hey, You Got Mail!, which collects donations from members of the public to send cards to people they care about and seniors in nursing homes. The founders, who are in their early 20s, wanted to reach out to senior citizens amid the social isolation of the pandemic. From writing cards for seniors, they have moved into weekly volunteer outreach sessions. These young people don’t have much resources but have leveraged social media and their own enthusiasm to support the lonely and infirm elderly in Singapore. The Singapore story is one of material success. But in my view, the rapid progress we have made in material comfort has led to a loss of other-centredness, as many of us focus on our own financial security and prosperity. When that happens, our world view shrinks. We look at things in a quid pro quo. “What’s in it for me?” we tend to ask. As we celebrate Singapore’s 57th birthday, let’s not forget our community roots. Our social compact has always been about our connections with each other. Without it, we’re only insulated individuals driven by self-centered ambitions. My wish for Singapore and Singaporeans this National Day is to refresh our social compact: To reaffirm our shared values of ownership, appreciation and mutual aid. Dr William Wan is the General Secretary of the Singapore Kindness Movement."

Demand for the vaccine, 3.6 billion doses of which have been shipped globally, is waning as most people in the Western world have received three or four shots already. However, booster campaigns using upgraded shots specifically targeting the Omicron variant are expected to increase demand in autumn. Pending regulatory approval, BioNTech said, both of its adapted vaccines would be available in time for the campaigns. Second-quarter revenue and net profit both dropped by around 40 per cent from a year earlier, to €3.2 billion (US$3.26 billion) and €1.672 billion, respectively. The company reaffirmed its 2022 vaccine revenue guidance of €13 billion to €17 billion, down from €19 billion last year. Partner Pfizer at the end of last month forecast US$32 billion in full-year COVID-19 vaccine sales. ""With our strong performance year to date, we believe to be well on track to achieve our previous financial guidance for the ongoing financial year,"" said Jens Holstein, chief financial officer of BioNTech. ""With our initiatives around variant-adapted COVID-19 vaccine candidates, we expect an uptake in demand in our key markets in the fourth quarter of 2022, subject to regulatory approval."" BioNTech and Pfizer submitted one of the adapted vaccines, which targets the BA.1 subvariant, to the European Union drugs regulator European Medicines Agency last month, with delivery pending approval. The other, targeting the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants as recommended by the United States drug regulator, will begin clinical trials this month, with initial doses expected to be shipped also from as early as October.

The measures will be effective from Friday, the city's leader, John Lee, told a news conference on Monday (Aug 8). Arrivals will need to self-monitor for a further four days, during which they will be forbidden to enter premises such as restaurants and bars. ""We need to balance between people's livelihood and the competitiveness of Hong Kong to give the community maximum momentum and economic vitality,"" Lee said. People in quarantine will be issued a red code on a government-mandated app. This will change to a yellow code once they leave quarantine, signifying they may not enter crowded premises. Quarantine was formerly as long as three weeks. Currently, all arrivals must spend at least a week in hotel quarantine and comply with frequent testing orders, provide faecal samples for babies and fill out multiple forms. Only a select number of hotels are available for quarantine. Rooms are costly and are typically booked out months in advance. Payment is made upfront and refunds are not permitted unless there is a change in government policy or flight cancellation. Hong Kong's competitiveness has been hammered by the pandemic measures, business executives have said, hoping Lee, the city's leader since Jul 1, would scrap the quarantine rules. The city's border has been almost completely sealed since 2020, with international arrivals facing tough quarantine and testing protocols. It is one of the last places in the world still imposing quarantine for arrivals. Lee has pledged to reconnect Hong Kong with the mainland and the rest of the world. He suspended a rule in July that banned individual flights if they brought in passengers infected with the coronavirus, saying it caused unnecessary trouble and inconvenience for residents. More than 100 flights were banned this year, a major frustration for businesses and residents used to easy and efficient travel from the city. Shares in flagship carrier Cathay Pacific Airways leapt as much as 3.5 per cent after the announcement to HK$8.77, the biggest daily percentage rise since Jun 28. Cathay said on Monday that the adjustments were positive steps to help facilitate travel into Hong Kong. ""We are asking the government to urgently provide a clear roadmap showing the complete removal of all COVID-related restrictions for aircrew and passengers as soon as is feasible to protect Hong Kong's international aviation hub status."" Cathay has been battered by Hong Kong's strict pandemic rules over the past two years which led to a 98 per cent fall in passenger numbers. Hong Kong's popular international Rugby Sevens event will take place in November for the first time in more than three years. It was cancelled in 2020 and 2021 because of pandemic measures. The tournament, which is a draw for international visitors, is meant to coincide with a major banking conference that month to be attended by top global executives and will be a sign that Hong Kong can resume business as normal. Bankers have said that quarantine-free travel is a pre-condition for the event to take place. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/china-hainan-expands-covid-19-lockdowns-outbreak-2866236,China's Hainan expands COVID-19 lockdowns to more areas to quell outbreak,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI: China's Hainan, an island province dependent on tourism, locked down more areas on Monday (Aug 8), Reuters calculations based on state media reports show, as it battles its worst COVID-19 outbreak after seeing very few cases over the past two years. The island in the South China Sea, which recorded just two local symptomatic COVID-19 cases last year, has reported more than 1,400 domestically transmitted infections this month, including 982 symptomatic ones. Although that is small by global standards, it is the province's biggest outbreak since the virus was first reported in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019. The sharp increase in cases comes amid a pick-up in interest in tourism after China slightly eased curbs aimed at domestic travel, accounting for the shorter incubation period of the Omicron variant, which facilitates a shorter quarantine time. However, the curbs in Hainan, in line with China's ""dynamic COVID-zero"" policy that aims to stamp out outbreaks as soon as possible, points to the persistent uncertainty shrouding travel and may further dampen confidence in the tourism and hospitality sectors that are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 restrictions. The provincial capital city of Haikou, with about 2.9 million residents, and two smaller towns, Ledong and Chengmai, locked down its residents on Monday, according to state media reports. At least nine cities and towns, with a combined population of around 7 million, said their residents must not go beyond where they live, unless for necessary reasons such as COVID-19 tests, grocery shopping or to fulfil essential job roles. They suspended various public transport services. The measures will stay in place for varying periods, with the shortest scheduled for a few hours, state media reports show. Around 25,000 tourists were stranded in Sanya, the hardest-hit city in Hainan's outbreak and the island's key tourist hub, as of Sunday. Although cities have said tourists can leave after COVID-19 tests, many were frustrated about the disruption to their plans. ""We've had four flights cancelled. Our new one is on Sunday, hopefully,"" said Kyle, a 28-year-old teacher, whose first attempt to take a holiday after 2.5 years in China has left him stuck in Sanya, where people were lining up in the rain for COVID-19 tests on Monday. ""If you're travelling in general in China, you should kind of be aware of what could happen. If you don't consider that, then you should probably just not go in the first place,"" he told Reuters. In Qionghai city, scheduled to be locked down for three days, all flights at the Qionghai Boao Airport scheduled on Monday were cancelled on ""public security reasons"". Chinese stocks in tourism, transport and consumer staples all retreated on Monday, with China Tourism Group Duty Free Corp down 4.7 per cent. Sanya began closing duty-free malls last week. The lockdowns also dashed hopes for a quick rebound for the country's ailing aviation sector, which had counted on a summer travel boom to help trim record losses. Hainan Airlines shares fell 1.5 per cent on Monday, hovering around the lowest level since February last year, when the airline was in the midst of a restructuring to settle a multi-year liquidity crisis. The airline said in July that its first half net loss is expected to expand to 11.95 billion yuan to 12.96 billion yuan (US$1.77 billion to US$1.92 billion) from 880.9 million yuan a year earlier. Nationwide, China reported 807 locally transmitted COVID-19 infections for Aug 7, of which 324 were symptomatic and 483 were asymptomatic, the National Health Commission said. There were no new deaths, keeping the nation's fatalities unchanged at 5,226. As of Sunday, mainland China had confirmed 231,266 cases with symptoms, including both local patients and symptomatic international travellers. China's capital, Beijing, reported two new local symptomatic cases for Aug 7, while Shanghai and the southern technology hub of Shenzhen reported no new local cases. "

The move comes days after Macao started to unwind stringent anti-COVID rules, including the resumption of travel to Zhuhai without quarantine from Aug 3. The Macao government said in a statement on Sunday (Aug 7) that all of the city's 700,000 residents should take rapid antigen tests on Sunday and Monday and upload the results to a government website. Thousands of residents living near Macao's border to Zhuhai and the Taipa district, which sits alongside the city's Las Vegas-style Cotai strip, must do official nucleic acid tests, the government said. Authorities have also sealed up the infected person's apartment building and the supermarket where the person worked. Macao reopened public services and entertainment facilities and allowed the resumption of in-restaurant dining on Aug 2. The former Portuguese colony has reported around 1,800 infections since mid-June when it was hit with its worst coronavirus outbreak that forced the closure of casinos and locked down most of the city. More than 90 per cent of Macao's residents are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 but authorities have closely followed China's zero-COVID mandate which seeks to curb all outbreaks at almost any cost, contrary to much of the rest of the world which is already adjusting to living with the virus.

The North Korean Supreme People's Assembly (SPA), the state's parliament, will meet on Sep 7 to discuss law on rural development and organisational matters, according to the official KCNA. Separately, North Korea decided to hold a national meeting for emergency anti-epidemic review early August ""to confirm the new orientation"" in its policy. The COVID-19 meeting comes as North Korea has said last week all of its patients with fever have recovered, marking the end of its first wave of the coronavirus pandemic since its admission of the virus outbreak in mid-May. The reclusive country has never confirmed how many people were infected with COVID-19. But it said around 4.77 million fever patients have fully recovered and 74 have died since late April. North Korea's parliament rarely meets and usually serves to approve decisions on issues that have been created by the state's powerful Workers' Party, members of which form the vast majority of the assembly. The decision to convene the parliament came at a plenary meeting of the SPA's standing committee on Sunday, KCNA said. At the weekend meeting, the participants adopted the law on medicines to establish a ""strict system"" to promote public health, among other issues. Other matters on the table included revising the aerospace development law ""to further legalise the activities"" in the field and adopting the ""law of self-guard"" to establish what it calls ""all-people self-guard system"" to protect people's life and property, KCNA said, without elaborating. Space launches have long been a sensitive issue on the Korean peninsula, where North Korea faces international sanctions over its nuclear-armed ballistic missile programme. In March, North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un called for expanding its space rocket launch site to advance its space ambitions, after South Korea and the United States accused it of testing a new intercontinental ballistic missile under the guise of space development.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/about-4000-people-joined-aviation-sector-first-half-2022-manpower-still-below-pre-covid-levels-iswaran-2865586,"About 4,000 people joined aviation sector in first half of 2022, manpower still below pre-COVID levels: Iswaran","SINGAPORE: The manpower of Singapore’s aviation sector is still well below pre-COVID levels, despite 4,000 new recruits joining in the first half of 2022, said Transport Minister S Iswaran on Sunday (Aug 7). Speaking on the sidelines of the Nanyang 57th National Day Carnival 2022, Mr Iswaran said the aviation sector employed about 35,000 people before the COVID-19 pandemic, but that number fell to 25,000 at the end of last year. “There was about a one-third attrition, which is a significant loss of capability when we are trying to ramp up fast.  ""The significance of this is clear when you look at what is happening around the world. Many airports have ramped up quickly, but then subsequently had to make adjustments and even scale back, because of the challenge of manning levels,” said Mr Iswaran, referring to the travel chaos at major airports worldwide as they struggled to meet the demands of rebounding air travel. “We now need to sustain that and increase the manning levels going into the year-end, because we anticipate another significant increase in the year-end period.  ""We need to plan for that and make manning and operational adjustments - that is what everybody is working on right now,” said the minister. In terms of air traffic volume, Singapore was at about 56 per cent of pre-COVID levels in the month of July. With 4,000 new recruits, the aviation sector now employs about 29,000 people, but many of these recruits may be relatively new to the sector, said Mr Iswaran. “The key thing is, it is not just about bringing in the numbers … They need to enhance their knowledge of the sector and operations and level-up the skills needed to come up to speed, because it is critical for both operational efficiency, and also for safety,” he said.  “Even as our aviation partners are recruiting people for the sector, they are also investing heavily in the effort to train and bring them up to speed so that they can seamlessly fit into the operations. This is an important part of the work going forward and I would say for Singaporeans, there are good career opportunities in aviation.” Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Singapore’s airport used to serve about 70 million passengers annually. Mr Iswaran said Singapore is aiming to reach 100 per cent of pre-COVID passenger flow by the end of 2022 and that the country is making sure that Changi Airport can get back to processing and serving passenger flows at that level. However, he noted that reaching that target would depend on external factors outside of Singapore’s control, such as how quickly key markets in north-east Asia like China, Japan and South Korea are able to fully reopen their borders. “We have to keep very close tabs on that. But our preparation continues, because we need to make sure that we are ready for further improvement in the aviation sector,” said Mr Iswaran. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/national-day-home-singaporeans-overseas-2863831,National Day special: 'Home' revisited – an increasingly chaotic world prompts a rethink of where one belongs,"SINGAPORE: Singaporean Ridwan Madon was working in New York City when it became the epicentre of COVID-19 infections in the United States in early 2020. He was faced with a tough dilemma familiar to many working overseas back then — to stay put or return to the embrace of their loved ones. He described how anxiety-inducing the situation was at that time, when blaring ambulance sirens were repeatedly heard each day, as countless COVID-19 patients were being transferred to the hospital. Compounding the bleak situation were reports on how funeral companies had to store bodies in mover trucks because there were more coronavirus-related deaths than they could handle. “I felt very helpless, I couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t fly back, because I had my work commitments, and I didn’t feel safe enough to travel,” said Mr Ridwan, who is in his early 30s and a digital art director at US telecommunications company AT&T. He was finally reunited with his family in Singapore in May this year. Similarly, Ms Radhika Gurumurthy, a 32-year-old mechanical engineer working in San Francisco, contemplated flying back to Singapore to be with her parents and siblings. “I remember my father and me talking and we thought: ‘Let's not put all our eggs in the same basket.’ So maybe one of us has a job there (in Singapore), one of us has a job here (in the US). “We didn't know how bad this pandemic was going to get. If something happened, you know, at least we are in two different economies,” said Ms Gurumurthy. Though she decided to stay at that time, the Singaporean said that the conversation sparked a long introspection about how much time she spent away from her family. This led her to apply for a master’s degree programme, which she will be reading at Harvard University later this year. She hopes it would facilitate her career switch to the finance industry, which may offer more employment opportunities for her in Singapore — thus helping to make her decision to return easier. The experiences of Mr Ridwan and Ms Gurumurthy provide a glimpse into how the long-drawn pandemic has forced many people to think long and hard about where and what is ""home"".  Apart from the devastating impact on lives and livelihoods, COVID-19 had put brakes on international travel and effectively separated families for prolonged periods, nudging some to reassess where and with whom they wanted to be in times of crisis. The pandemic also brought simmering xenophobia and racism in many countries to the fore, adding to a sense of precariousness and estrangement for those who work abroad. Ahead of National Day on Tuesday (Aug 9), TODAY spoke to Singaporeans here and abroad, as well as foreign-born nationals who have come to call Singapore home, as it examines the concept of ""home"" and how it has been shaped in recent years by big global forces.  COVID-19 first emerged in late 2019. As countries scrambled to lock out the virus in the initial stages of the pandemic, shutting down their international borders became the default option. In its 2021 annual migration report, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) revealed that migration to rich countries plummeted 30 per cent from 2019 to 2020.   For Singapore, the impact could not be any clearer: In 2020, the number of non-residents fell by 2.1 per cent, followed by a 10.7 per cent tumble to 1.47 million the following year, primarily due to a reduction in foreign employment owing to travel restrictions and economic uncertainties.  Singapore's resident population in 2021 also shrank by 1.4 per cent to 3.99 million, falling for the first time since the Government began collating such data in 1970. The resident population shrank mainly because more citizens and permanent residents (PRs) remained overseas continuously for 12 months or more owing to pandemic-related travel curbs. They were thus not counted as part of Singapore’s population. One individual who felt the impact of border closures was Singapore PR Simon Kearney, who holds Australian citizenship. He did not intend to travel back Down Under during the pandemic as he has his business, wife and children here. However, when Australia closed its borders even to its own citizens, Mr Kearney was hit with a reality check.  “I’ve always looked at Australia like how you would look at your parents’ house. No matter what you do, no matter how much you screw up, you can always go home. And suddenly, I wasn't able to,” said the 51-year-old founder of content and communications agency Click2View. “So that sort of made me reassess a lot about what was home.” Experts said that migrant movement, or the lack thereof, during the pandemic was often divided according to class. Associate Professor Laavanya Kathiravelu at Nanyang Technological University’s (NTU) School of Social Sciences, said that while many were concerned about family members back home and wished to move closer to them, not many could afford to do so. “This choice to move back to countries of origin was also only available to some, usually highly skilled migrants who had savings to fall back on and the possibility of getting a job in a different location,” said Assoc Prof Kathiravelu. Dr Rebecca Grace Tan from National University of Singapore’s (NUS) College of Humanities and Sciences added: “On the other hand, many low-wage migrants have actually been less able to return home due to the uncertainty over whether they can return should they desire to do so. “Hence, when we use the term ‘global citizens’, it is vital that we understand that the freedom of movement is understood very differently, depending on which class of migrants one is speaking of.” As the pandemic was raging, xenophobic sentiments came to the fore as residents worried over their livelihoods and future, making migrants feel less than welcome. In some countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, these feelings manifested in a jump in hate crime, particularly against people of Asian descent due to the perceived link between COVID-19 and China. For example, NBC News in February reported a 339 per cent jump in anti-Asian hate crime in the United States in 2021 compared to the year before, citing a new study by the Centre for the Study of Hate and Extremism. A UK-based advocacy group, End the Virus of Racism, found a 300 per cent jump in hate crime and racism affecting East and Southeast Asian communities in the UK in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.   And while Singapore's multiracial society was able to better withstand the threat of divisions, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong during his 2021 National Day Rally drew attention to xenophobic sentiments. He reminded Singaporeans not to “turn our backs” on foreigners who had contributed to the country and were similarly enduring personal hardships during the pandemic. “We must not … give the impression that Singapore is becoming xenophobic and hostile to foreigners,” stressed Mr Lee. “It would gravely damage our reputation as an international hub. It would cost us investments, jobs and opportunities. It would be disastrous for us and most of all, it is not who we aspire to be.” During the depths of the pandemic, some countries naturally took a differentiated approach when it came to implementing coronavirus-related policies that prioritised citizens over non-resident populations. These included priority vaccination or a more relaxed quarantine arrangement for citizens who returned from overseas.  “Simply put, the differential treatment of foreigners and citizens reminds migrants that they are needed but not necessarily wanted,” said Dr Tan. She added: “To that end, their home country and the attendant benefits of being a citizen within their home country would appear increasingly attractive.” As borders shut, many expatriates and migrant workers around the world were confronted with stark choices — either they go back to their loved ones in their home countries and risk losing their jobs, or they keep their jobs and stay apart from their families for months or even years.   Many Malaysian migrant workers in Singapore who used to commute daily across the Causeway ended up being separated for about two years from their families due to the pandemic. Mr Derick Tee, a Malaysian who is a Singapore PR, was very concerned about his family in Muar, Johor. But he did not go back because he has business and other family members here. His elderly parents in Malaysia later became infected by COVID-19. “My father was hospitalised for over a month. Doctors even told us to prepare for the worst,” said Mr Tee, 45, a director at Diverse Solutions, a company that specialises in design, printing and supply of corporate gifts. “I always checked on them via video call. But that was the lowest point of my life.” Apart from health concerns, there were also worries about the economic situation, particularly so for foreigners in Singapore who are not PRs.  Mr Andrew Taruc, an employment pass holder from the Philippines, said: “We did make plans to stay long term, so we applied for PR status in Singapore a number of times and were unsuccessful. So we did have thoughts of going back.” Mr Taruc, who is in his 40s, added: “Being on employment passes and dependent passes made us feel anxious about whether we would be forced (to go back to their home countries) before the economic recovery. “There is always the question of whether our visas will get renewed or if there will be other opportunities for us, especially when the pandemic hit. We were also concerned that we might be forced to go back if my sponsor company closes down."" During the pandemic, Mr Taruc managed to find a new job here with fintech company Currencycloud, while the birth of his daughter also reaffirmed his desire to stay in Singapore for the long term. He intends to reapply for permanent residency.  Then, there are also hostilities in some societies that made people who had spent a good part of their lives there feel unwelcome — or worse, threatened.   While not victims themselves, Mr Ridwan and Ms Gurumurthy — the two Singaporeans based in the US — saw displays of hostility towards Asians, who were subject to hate crime or abuse during the pandemic. Ms Gurumurthy, who has been based in the US since her undergraduate days about a decade ago, said such incidents did not come as a shock to her. Mr Ridwan recounted how a man tried to punch his former housemate, an American with Chinese ethnicity, while she was on the way home from a morning walk. Fortunately for her, the man missed and she was unharmed.  Mr Ridwan said he was shocked that it had happened to someone he knew personally, and it made him feel unsafe. ""Honestly it felt like I don't belong despite living there for a while and contributing to the economy. It made me feel like being Asian was a problem and the racism felt more real,"" he said. Dr Nathan Peng from the Singapore Management University (SMU) said that in order to understand ""whether the exodus during the pandemic was a signal that the concept of ‘home’ for the globetrotting community has changed irrevocably, we need to look beyond why they left but why they chose to come in the first place"".  Broadly speaking, Assoc Prof Kathiravelu of NTU said that these motivations could be economic, or driven by the desire to achieve a certain lifestyle and standard of living. It could also be due to socio-political reasons, such as refugees fleeing wars and conflict, said NUS' Dr Tan, though such crises may not always be the impetus. She said: “Some migrants may move due to their desire to live in a society that better accommodates their values, lifestyles and so forth, such as members of the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer) community who move to a country that is more accepting of non-heterosexual relationships.” Fundamentally, people move to improve their lives or the lives of their families, she noted. Indeed, those whom TODAY interviewed spoke about a variety of factors that helped them decide where ""home"" is: While ""home"" means different things to different people, a common notion shared by almost all of those interviewed by TODAY was that home is where their loved ones are — regardless of whether that place is their country of birth. Ms Elaine Chan, 49, worked for about a decade overseas until 2015. She returned to Singapore after her father died to take over the family business of supplying fun food equipment and ingredients, such as popcorn, nachos and candy floss.  Ms Chan, who is currently the director of marketing communications at the Parkroyal Collection hotel chain, said that while she thoroughly enjoyed the years working overseas in the United Kingdom and in various cities in China, her priorities have shifted.  “Back then you could go ‘Mum, Dad, I’ll be back one day’ and you don't worry, because we were still young,” said Ms Chan. “But now, priorities have changed. I want to see that my mum continues to be healthy. I want to see that my nieces, my nephew continue to progress and be successful. I want to see my husband continue being happy in this environment.” Mr Ingmar Salim, a 32-year-old Indonesian citizen who is a Singapore PR, had been living here for 20 years but made the difficult choice to return to Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic to be with his loved ones. With the global pandemic situation easing, he recently came back to Singapore after spending two years in Indonesia.  “If I had been in Singapore in the last two years (during the pandemic), I wouldn’t be in a good state mentally,” he said. “It got me thinking about the distinction between a house and home ... And that is something I'm working on, a distinction I'm trying to identify."" For now, he sees both Indonesia and Singapore as ""homes"" as he feels an affinity with both countries, albeit in different ways.  Like Mr Salim, Mr Ridwan and Ms Gurumurthy also told TODAY that while they remain open to working overseas, they see themselves coming back to their families in Singapore eventually.  Before settling down for good in Singapore after her father’s death years ago, Ms Chan had lived in the United Kingdom and various cities in China. Each time she landed in a new place, she felt comfortable enough to see herself staying there for the long term and calling it a ""second home"". She attributed this to the fulfilling work and achievements that she had done there, from leading hotel operations to starting up a bilingual magazine that contributed to the local community and hospitality industry. “It was very difficult, you know, with all these achievements, being appreciated by so many whether by your team in our hotel or by the community around you. It makes it very difficult to leave,” she said of her time in China. For Mr Kearney, he admitted that the concept of home was not so straightforward for expats like himself, who would have “one foot in one country, one foot in the other”. While he saw Singapore as a short-term plan when he first arrived, he became more invested once he started a family and bought a house here. “Having been here for 14 years, marrying a Singaporean, having two Singaporean kids, living in an HDB (flat) and establishing a business here, I'm glad that it now feels more like home,” said Mr Kearney. Similarly, for Mr Tee, who initially came to work in Singapore to “benefit from the strong currency”, he started to view the country as home after he met his wife here, a naturalised citizen who came from Hong Kong. “Even though we were both not born here, whenever there are volunteer opportunities and donation drives, we will contribute. Because we feel that we are part of this community,” said Mr Tee. TODAY also spoke to some people who have found a long-term place to call home outside of their birth country. Ms Afa Asmin, 29, is a Singaporean with PR status in Australia. The senior practice nurse said she had been looking beyond Singapore’s shores even while she was a nursing student, as she felt that the state of the profession in the country leaves much to be desired. “The treatment of nurses from the public and behind the scenes, the unspoken sacrifices, the non-existent balance of work and family and so on. So I looked towards other countries which treated their healthcare workers better,” said Ms Afa, who ""enjoys"" working in Melbourne.  While Singapore continues to hold a special spot in her heart and she occasionally returns home to visit friends and family,  she said it was unlikely for her to return here for the long term unless the working conditions and remuneration of healthcare workers improve.   Chef Emily Lim, 30, found the opportunity to chase her passion in the food and beverage industry overseas, following an immersion programme with the Culinary Institute of America in California. Beyond growth opportunities, one factor that pushed her to pursue a career in the US was because she felt that California, where she is based, offers better protection against overworking for employees. The remuneration and overall working conditions are better in the US too, she said, compared to her own experience working in the F&B industry in Singapore. When she was furloughed in March 2020, it did occur to her to return to Singapore as her work visa’s validity would expire soon after she was let go. “However, I had just gotten into the swing of being an executive sous chef at the restaurant I was working at, and had a good thing going — it was hard for me to wrap my head around the idea of letting all of that go, after working for the same company for over five years,” she said. Soon after she was laid off, she decided to start her own business and now runs Dabao Singapore in San Francisco, a dining and delivery service that offers Singaporean hawker fare. For Ms Lim, who identifies as a pansexual, the strong presence of the LGBTQ community in the US also means she feels more at home there. “Home is where community is. I have never felt more secure in a country till I found my community,” she added. “Funnily enough, I didn’t even know I could feel so belonged in my non-birth country!” Another Singaporean, Mr Paris Zhuang, who works at online accounting software firm Xero, moved to New Zealand six years ago. The 36-year-old said he was attracted to New Zealand for the “lifestyle” that it offers. “I think work-life balance is one thing. And the fact that in New Zealand, it’s more of a place where you can be yourself more easily, there's no cultural boundaries. “And there is no micromanaging, both in work and life,” he added. “If you go back during Chinese New Year, for example, people will question you about what you have done, where you are in life and whether you are married. Nobody cares here (in Wellington), you do what you want!” But as the saying goes, one man's meat is another man's poison.  Mr Joseph Kim, a South Korean by birth who is a Singapore PR, said he chose Singapore as home because he believes that Singapore offers a less competitive and less stressful environment compared with South Korea. “I do not want my children to grow up in such a stressful environment, and that is also why I do not intend to move back to Korea,” said the product manager at Currencycloud, who is married with two children.  The multiculturalism here, compared to the relatively homogenous societies in other Asian countries, is also another positive attribute that attracted him to make Singapore home, he said. While speaking to TODAY over the phone, Singaporean singer and songwriter Pravin Saivi laced his Singlish sentences with frequent “lah” and “lor”, and even managed to lament about how his neighbours get mildly irked by the smell whenever his wife makes sambal belachan. The chat could have easily given the person at the other end of the line the impression that Mr Pravin was speaking from his childhood hometown in Yishun, when in fact he was calling from Chennai, India, where he has been pursuing his career as a musician for more than a decade. And while he has made conscientious efforts to maintain the Singaporean quirks and identity for himself and his family — his two children, despite receiving education in Chennai, speak Singlish, to the extent that ""sometimes my neighbours don't understand them"" — Mr Pravin was quick to dismiss the idea of him seeing Singapore as his exclusive home, preferring instead to see himself as a citizen of the world. “Home doesn’t have to be one place … And just because I’m far away from a place, doesn’t mean I don’t have a connection with it,” said the 39-year-old. He plans to continue living in Chennai due to better career opportunities, and the ability to enjoy the standard of living that he wants while working full-time as a musician. Even so, being Singaporean is a part of his identity that he is extremely proud of, said Mr Pravin, who is the son of L Krishna Samy who composed the 1966 NDP song, Engkal Singapore. When it comes to reconciling his geographically-agnostic idea of home with his intense pride in Singapore, Mr Pravin said: “I am definitely very much Singaporean in spirit, the way I am with people and everything. It's just that I feel like I serve my role and my duties better as I travel as an ambassador of the Singapore brand like this.” And Mr Pravin, it seems, is not the only one who feels that way. “Home today is now both Singapore and Manila,” said Mr Taruc, the employment pass holder from the Philippines. He added: “Singapore is where I, my wife and daughter are building memories together every day, while Manila is where I have clear video calls with our folks back home, and a place where I can work from home safely.” And for Ms Lim, despite her strong affinity for the Bay Area, she sees herself coming back to Singapore eventually to be with her family. “I feel like there are two parts of me, that call Singapore and San Francisco my homes,” she said. “Feelings of nostalgia and steadiness are tied to Singapore, whereas feelings of adventure, excitement and freedom are what I associate with San Francisco.” Dr Teo Kay Key, research fellow at IPS Social Lab at the Institute of Policy Studies, noted that with people moving around the world for work, personal and even political reasons, identifying several places as “home” is no longer unusual.  “As the world becomes more interconnected … I think we will see these multiple attachments to different places or societies become more common,” she said. At the same time, the pandemic has given rise to remote working, and this may have an impact on the need for people to travel across borders for work. “With many companies now more open to their employees working remotely, many have moved to more affordable and attractive locations to do jobs remotely,” said NTU’s Assoc Prof Kathiravelu. “Countries with high liveability standards, or where rent is cheap may benefit from such arrangements, especially for younger workers with less familial commitments and less dependent on healthcare regimes.” Dr Tan of NUS however, felt that it is too early to assess the impact of remote working on migration, given how some companies have reverted to physical attendance in office and are moving away from work-from-home arrangements. Further, there are factors such as taxation and time differences that make collaborating with colleagues across the globe less straightforward. But should remote working take off, she said: “This is likely to change the demographics of migrant flows, namely those with families are less likely to uproot than single migrants.” With the concept of ""home"" becoming more complex, it begs the question of what a country like Singapore — which relies on human capital as its only resource — can do to promote a sense of belonging among its citizens as well as others who choose to call the city-state home?  Dr Teo said in order for Singapore to build a strong connection with its residents, it “requires the individual to feel that they are free to fulfil their aspirations while staying in Singapore”. “Essentially, Singapore is the place they want to be to work, live, and build a home for themselves, literally and figuratively,” she said. Assoc Prof Kathiravelu noted the need to address structural issues including rising cost of living and long working hours, in order to to ensure that Singapore remains an inclusive and comfortable home for all. SMU’s Dr Peng pointed to the more apparent social divide that has emerged since the pandemic — such as between born and naturalised citizens — and said that Singapore’s attractiveness as a home would depend on how these divisions are managed. “If we offer a fair chance for a good life for all, local citizens would be far more willing to welcome new arrivals to our midst if they feel assured of not having got the short end of the stick, and would share in the prosperity migrants would bring,” he said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/covid-19-lockdown-turns-china-tourist-spot-sanya-nightmare-2865326,COVID-19 lockdown turns China's tourist hotspot Sanya into nightmare for stranded tourists,"BEIJING: When Chinese businesswoman Yang Jing was planning this year's summer holiday in 2021, she chose the tropical southern island of Hainan because of its nigh-perfect COVID-19 track record. The island in the South China Sea recorded just two positive symptomatic COVID-19 cases in the whole of last year. Fast forward to this month, however, and the number of cases has suddenly soared, prompting a lockdown in the city of Sanya and leaving tens of thousands of tourists like Yang stuck on the island. Sanya, the island's main tourist hub, imposed a lockdown on Saturday and restricted transport links to try to stem the outbreak, even as about 80,000 visitors were enjoying its beaches at peak season. Many are now stuck inside hotels until next Saturday, if not longer. Yang, along with her husband and child, are staying at a four-star hotel paid out of their own pocket. The family is eating pot noodles every day to avoid spending more on food. ""This is the worst holiday of my life,"" Yang, who is in her 40s and lives in Jiangxi province in southern China, told Reuters on Sunday. Sanya reported 689 symptomatic and 282 asymptomatic cases between Aug 1 and Aug 7. Other cities around Hainan province, including Danzhou, Dongfang, Lingshui, and Lingao, have all reported more than a dozen cases in the same period. On Saturday, the sale of rail tickets out of Sanya was suspended, state broadcaster CCTV reported, citing the national operator, and more than 80 per cent of flights to and from Sanya had been cancelled, according to data provider Variflight. Hainan has been closed to overseas tourists for the past two and half years since China, in response to the pandemic, stopped issuing tourist visas and implemented strict quarantine rules. Sanya's government announced on Saturday that tourists who have had their flights cancelled would be able to book hotel rooms at half price. But dozens of tourists on Sunday complained in WeChat groups that their hotels were not applying such a rule and they were still having to pay rates similar to the original prices. Two stranded tourists told Reuters they were in such a situation. ""We are now looking for ways to complain and defend our rights, but so far no official body has contacted us or taken any interest in us,"" said one of the tourists, a woman from the eastern China province of Jiangsu, who only gave her surname as Zhou. A foreign tourist who lives in China and was on honeymoon in Sanya, said that additional issues for stranded tourists included massive price hikes in food delivery fees, meal prices at hotels, as well as flight tickets out of Hainan. Food supplies in his hotel were also running low, he said, without wishing to be named. ""We just hope it won't turn into another Shanghai,"" the tourist said, referring to that city's recent two-month lockdown. The outbreak in Hainan is the latest challenge to China's zero-COVID policy, after the chaotic lockdown in Shanghai dented Beijing's narrative that its handling of the pandemic was superior to other countries like the United States, which has recorded more than 1 million COVID-19 deaths. Domestic visitors have kept the tourism industry on Hainan alive through much of the pandemic, but this sudden lockdown risks turning some tourists away for good. ""In short, we will never come back,"" said Zhou, who was on holiday with six other family members. Sanya authorities have said that stranded tourists can leave the island starting next Saturday, provided they have done five COVID-19 tests and obtained negative results for all of them. However, Yang said the waiting times for test results have been long, prompting her to get multiple tests a day. ""We don't know who to go to, the internet only has positive news about Sanya, such as ... the Sanya municipal government has properly resettled the 80,000 stranded tourists ... as if the whole country thinks that (we) are not victims, but beneficiaries,"" she said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/china-shortens-suspensions-international-flights-covid-19-2864856,China shortens suspensions for international flights linked to COVID-19 cases,"China has shortened the suspension time for inbound international flights on routes found to have COVID-19 cases starting on Sunday (Aug 7). The country's aviation regulator said in a statement on Sunday that flights on a route with an identified coronavirus case will be suspended for one week if 4 per cent of passengers test positive, and two weeks if 8 per cent of passengers test positive. Previously, the aviation regulator's policy was that if five passengers tested positive, the airline's flights for that route would be suspended for two weeks. The suspension will last for four weeks if 10 or more passengers test positive. The country reported 868 new coronavirus cases for Aug 6, of which 390 were symptomatic and 478 were asymptomatic, the National Health Commission said on Sunday. That compares with 704 new cases a day earlier - 361 symptomatic and 343 asymptomatic infections, which China counts separately. There were no new deaths, leaving the country's death toll at 5,226. As of Saturday, mainland China had confirmed 230,886 cases with symptoms. China's capital, Beijing, reported one new symptomatic case for Aug 6. Shanghai and the southern technology hub of Shenzhen reported no new cases.

The curbs came into force at 6am after authorities said the COVID-19 situation was ""very severe"" and people's movements were being restricted. Authorities did not say when the measures might be lifted but said tourists wanting to leave the city, which is on Hainan island, would have to show five negative PCR tests over seven days. ""We urge the general public and tourists to understand and give their support,"" authorities said in a statement on the city government's WeChat account. The city reported 263 COVID cases for Friday, up from 11 two days earlier. Authorities said they had detected the Omicron subvariant BA.5.1.3. The lockdown comes in the high tourist season for the city, which is also known for its duty-free shopping and is home to several high-end hotels run by international companies including IHG and Marriott International. The deputy mayor, He Shigang, told state broadcaster CCTV there were about 80,000 tourists in the city but that the cases were mainly among residents. Officials told a news conference later on Saturday that tourists would get hotels at half price if they had to extend their stays. ""It really sucks,"" said Micah Hostetter, a business consultant based in Shanghai who was scheduled to leave on Sunday after a week-long stay. ""We don’t know how long we’re going to be here, we hope it’s not that long,"" said Hostetter, who endured nearly two and half-months of lockdown in Shanghai earlier in the year. The sale of railway tickets out of Sanya was suspended, CCTV reported, citing the national operator, and more than 80 per cent of flights to and from Sanya had been cancelled, according to data provider Variflight. The city started imposing lockdown measures in some places on Thursday. More venues, including its duty-free malls which are popular with Chinese shoppers unable to travel abroad, were shut on Friday. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/north-korea-marks-end-first-covid-19-wave-risks-persist-2860471,"North Korea marks end of first COVID-19 wave, but risks persist","SEOUL: North Korea on Friday (Aug 5) said all of its fever patients have recovered, marking the end of its first wave of the coronavirus pandemic, but challenges linger with economic hardships deepening and an unvaccinated population exposed to future resurgences, analysts said. While state media said the ""anti-epidemic situation ... has entered a definite phase of stability"", rather than boasting of victory, North Korea said it would ""redouble efforts to maintain perfection in the execution of state anti-epidemic policies"". The reclusive country has never confirmed how many people caught COVID-19, apparently lacking testing supplies. But it said around 4.77 million fever patients have fully recovered and 74 died since late April. It has reported no new fever cases since Jul 30. South Korean officials and medical experts have cast doubts on those figures, especially the number of deaths. Shin Young-jeon, a professor at Hanyang University's medical school in Seoul, said while the peak of the first COVID-19 wave may have passed, the stated fatalities were nearly ""impossible"" and there could be up to 50,000 deaths. ""Their success, if any, should lie in the fact that the outbreak didn't lead to a political or social chaos. Whether their COVID-19 response was successful was another problem."" South Korea's Unification Minister Kwon Young-se, responsible for inter-Korean affairs, said this week there were ""credibility issues"" with the North's data but the COVID-19 situation seemed ""somewhat under control."" In a sign of easing outbreaks, the ruling Workers' Party hosted a large, mask-free event in late July, inviting hundreds of Korean War veterans. The national football league kicked off its season this week following a three-year halt, state media reported, as did swimming, yachting and bowling competitions. Most games appeared to be held without spectators, but a photo of a taekwondo match carried on Monday by the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper showed an audience wearing masks and sitting seats apart. Some analysts say challenges around the economy, food security and public health remain and could be further exacerbated if infections return as seen in Asian neighbours amid a spread of Omicron sub-variants. Still, leader Kim Jong Un has yet to lift strict movement restrictions, and the Chinese border remains shut, with no officials travelling abroad and diplomatic missions in Pyongyang vacant. ""Despite the weak medical infrastructure, each North Korean community has a designated doctor, and the socialist system's strict controls and concerted responses might help find out and isolate potential cases,"" said Lim Eul-chul, a professor of North Korean studies at Kyungnam University in South Korea. Cheong Seong-chang, a senior fellow at the Sejong Institute, said the North's outbreak was possibly less severe than expected, as the publicised fever cases could include large numbers from other seasonal epidemics. South Korea's spy agency said in May that some waterborne diseases such as typhoid or cholera were already widespread in the North before COVID-19 hit. Cho Han-bum, a senior fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, said Kim might have decided to seek herd immunity in the face of worsening food shortages and public sentiment due to restrictions. Experts said the pandemic and a nationwide lockdown would deepen the North's already dire food situation, and the World Health Organization said in June the COVID-19 situation there could be getting worse. ""The North could be trying to ease the restrictions to let people go out and feed themselves, as food shortages become serious and there would be more outbreaks,"" Cho said. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/biden-covid-19-positive-rebound-antiviral-paxlovid-2858171,"Commentary: Why do some people, like President Biden, who take Paxlovid get 'rebound' COVID-19?","BRISBANE: For many people with COVID-19, their recovery isn’t linear. United States President Joe Biden is one such person – he continues to test positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and has experienced the return of a “loose cough”. He returned a positive “rebound” test on Saturday (Jul 30), only days after testing negative for COVID-19. President Biden was treated with the antiviral Paxlovid, in the hope this would allow him to recover faster and reduce his risk of severe disease. Paxlovid is a combination treatment that uses two different antivirals: Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir. Nirmatrelvir works to prevent the virus replicating. It does this by stopping a viral enzyme called a protease. SARS-CoV-2, like many viruses, rely on proteases to “activate” them. Without the protease, the virus replication cycle cannot be completed and the virus can not become active. So rather than “killing” the virus, it stops new “active” virus particles from being made. Ritonavir is a “boosting agent” which prevents the metabolism of nirmatrelvir, meaning it stays in your system for longer. Ritonavir has been used in low doses to boost the effectiveness of other protease antivirals in infections such as HIV. Paxlovid treatment involves taking two nirmatrelvir 150mg tablets and one ritonavir 100mg tablet, together, every 12 hours for five days. Like all antivirals, it’s important to start the course of Paxlovid as soon as possible after a diagnosis of COVID. This needs to be within five days of the onset of symptoms, so it can reduce virus replication and therefore reduce the spread of the virus in the body. In a clinical trial, Paxlovid showed an 89 per cent reduction in the risk of hospitalisation and death. There were no recorded deaths among those who received treatment. Compared to people in the study who didn’t receive the drug, Paxlovid treatment also reduced the viral load when measured on day five of the study. Rebound is when a person appears to have recovered and “cleared” the virus, meaning they test negative on the very sensitive PCR test and have no symptoms. Then a few days later, they test positive again or symptoms return. Rebound is not specific to people who have taken Paxlovid – it can also happen to others with COVID-19 who didn’t receive any drug treatments. A study that is yet to be peer reviewed has also found that patients’ symptoms and viral load can worsen after an initial period of improvement in some cases. While this is not true “rebound” it does suggest the course of infection may not be linear. There have now been increasing reports of rebound effects in people who were treated with Paxlovid, including President Biden. Biden finished his five-day course of Paxlovid and tested negative to the virus. Three days later, he tested positive. Why and how rebound happens is still not exactly known. What we do know is Paxlovid stops the virus in a person’s body from replicating. It doesn’t kill the virus already there. For that, we need the body’s immune system. One theory is that a five-day course is not long enough to suppress the virus replication to allow the immune system to kick in and kill the virus. Or perhaps the timing of when treatment starts affects how the immune system kicks in. Another theory is the drug is not being taken as prescribed. Research into the cause of Paxlovid rebound is ongoing. A recent study of rebound after Paxlovid in 11,000 people, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, found that seven days after treatment, 3.53 per cent of participants had rebound positive PCR tests and 2.31 per cent had rebound symptoms. After 30 days, 5.4 per cent tested positive and 5.87 per cent had symptoms. So just because you’ve received SARS-CoV-2 antiviral treatment, does not automatically mean you’re “cured”. While scientists and doctors are in the early stages of investigating Paxlovid rebound, early reports indicate rebound tends to be mild. Symptoms that return are commonly sniffles, sore throat or a cough. There are very few reports of severe rebound cases requiring hospitalisation and no reports on rebound resulting in death that I’m aware of. It’s important to remember that if you still have symptoms you might still be infectious. Guidelines across Australia make it clear if you have ongoing symptoms after your isolation period, you need to take care not to spread the virus. However, a person in rebound – even if they’re symptom-free – might also be able to spread the virus. So is Paxlovid doing what we need? If your goal is to prevent severe disease, hospitalisation and death in high-risk people, then Paxlovid is doing a great job. However, if you want to shorten the duration of your symptoms, maybe Paxlovid isn’t the wonder drug we hoped for.

Australia is battling one of its worst flare-ups of the coronavirus driven by the fast-moving new Omicron sub-variants, putting severe strain on hospitals and retirement homes. But Health Minister Mark Butler flagged the worst could be over. ""That is what I'm hearing but we're not calling it yet,"" Butler told Nine News. ""We are quietly hoping that we have reached the peak earlier than we expected to."" Health officials predicted the latest wave could peak only later this month, with some states expecting the spike in infection rates and hospital admissions to ease by late August. ""It does seem clear cases are starting to peak and maybe drop off in some states and very pleasingly, hospital numbers have dropped off,"" Butler said. Hospital admissions from COVID-19 hovered near the 5,000 level on Thursday but have fallen from the record 5,571 reached a week ago, official data showed. Butler said influenza infections had passed their peak, relieving pressure on the health system. Australia has endured a tough winter with COVID-19 and the flu virus circulating. Many frontline workers in hospitals are also sick or in isolation, worsening the healthcare crisis. Data also showed a lag in people taking booster shots, with only about 71 per cent getting their third dose versus 96 per cent who have had two doses, raising concerns of a surge in hospital cases. The government said on Wednesday it would offer from September Moderna's coronavirus vaccine for children aged six months to below five years who are at higher risk of developing severe illness. Australia has reported just over 9.5 million cases and 12,072 deaths since the pandemic began, far lower than many countries helped by world-beating vaccination numbers and strict restrictions earlier in the pandemic."

They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review. The Omicron variant may be more efficient at infecting children through the nose than previous versions of the coronavirus, a small study suggests. Earlier in the pandemic, children's noses had been less welcoming to the virus that causes COVID-19 than adults' noses. Studies of the original SARS-CoV-2 and some of its variants found the virus was met with stronger immune responses in the cells lining young noses than in adults' nasal-lining cells, and it was less efficient at making copies of itself in children's noses. But recent test-tube experiments mixing the virus with nasal cells from 23 healthy children and 15 healthy adults found the antiviral defenses in kids' noses ""was markedly less pronounced in the case of Omicron,"" researchers reported on Monday in PLOS Biology. They also report that Omicron reproduced itself more efficiently in children's nasal-lining cells compared to both Delta and the original virus. ""These data are consistent with the increased number of pediatric infections observed during the Omicron wave,"" the researchers wrote, while calling for additional studies. Severity of smell dysfunction after infection with the coronavirus may be a better predictor of long-term cognitive impairment than overall severity of COVID-19, according to an Argentinian study. Researchers studied a random sample of 766 people over age 60, roughly 90 per cent of whom had been infected with the virus. Physical, cognitive and neuropsychiatric tests performed three-to-six months after infection showed some degree of memory impairment in two-thirds of the infected participants. After taking individuals' other risk factors into account, severity of loss of smell, known as anosmia, ""but not clinical status, significantly (predicted) cognitive impairment,"" the researchers reported on Sunday at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference 2022, held online and in San Diego. ""The more insight we have into what causes or at least predicts who will experience the significant long-term cognitive impact of COVID-19 infection, the better we can track it and begin to develop methods to prevent it,"" study leader Gabriela Gonzalez-Aleman of Pontificia Universidad Catolica Argentina in Buenos Aires said in a statement. In US states that mandated COVID-19 vaccines for nursing home staff, the rules achieved the desired effect and did not lead to mass resignations and or staffing shortages, a study found. In states without such mandates, however, nursing homes did experience staff shortages during the study period, researchers reported on Friday in JAMA Health Forum. Data collected from mid-June to mid-November 2021 from the National Healthcare Safety Network showed that in 12 states with COVID-19 vaccine mandates, staff vaccination coverage rates ranged from 78.7 per cent to 95.2 per cent. States without mandates ""had consistently lower staff vaccination coverage throughout the study window"" and ""higher rates of reported staff shortages throughout the study period,"" according to the report. ""The association of mandates with higher vaccination coverage stands in contrast with prior efforts to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake among nursing home staff through education, outreach, and incentives,"" the researchers said. They added that the data ""suggests that the fear of massive staffing shortfalls owing to vaccine mandates may be unfounded."""

Two of them may be allowed at the bedside at any one point in time. The duration of a visit will be limited to 30 minutes.  “In exceptional situations, such as for critically ill patients, paediatric patients, birthing or post-partum mothers, and for patients requiring additional care support, visitors may be allowed to stay beyond 30 minutes on a case-by-case basis at the hospitals’ discretion,” said the Health Ministry. “Visitors are reminded not to eat or drink in the hospital wards, or use the toilets designated for patients in the wards. They should also avoid sitting on patients’ beds."" All residents in care homes will be allowed up to four pre-designated visitors, and only one of them may visit at any one time for up to 30 minutes.  MOH said visitors should continue to schedule the visits with the home ahead of time.  ""Visitors should strictly adhere to prevailing safe management measures within the homes. This includes remaining within the designated visitor areas, outside of the wards,"" said MOH. Visits may have to be suspended if a care home is managing active COVID-19 cases, the ministry added. All visitors to hospitals and homes should ensure they are well and are ""strongly encouraged"" to test themselves with antigen rapid tests (ARTs) on the day of the visit. They must wear masks with good filtration capability at all times while visiting hospitals or residential care homes, said the ministry. These include surgical masks and reusable masks that are made of two layers of fabric. MOH said it will review and calibrate these measures regularly in line with the evolving COVID-19 situation.  “We seek the understanding and cooperation of patients, residents, their family members and loved ones as we work to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission in our healthcare institutions and residential care homes,” it added. About 60 per cent of Singapore residents have likely caught COVID-19 before, but it does not mean the country has ""herd immunity"", Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said in Parliament on Monday. People must be realistic that in a big infection wave, the healthcare system will come under stress, he added. Waiting times at private clinics, polyclinics and hospitals will ""inevitably go up"". ""We did not tighten any social restrictions during the current wave ... However life is not as normal in our hospitals. Without additional social restrictions, our healthcare system is bearing the brunt of the current wave,"" he said. ""Healthcare workers have been very busy. Polyclinics and our general practitioner clinics also saw higher patient volumes."" "

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-18-deaths-added-tally-moh-revision-2021-2850231,18 more deaths added to Singapore’s official COVID-19 tally after revision by MOH,"SINGAPORE: Eighteen more deaths have been added to Singapore’s tally of COVID-19 fatalities last year after a revision by the Ministry of Health (MOH).  MOH said on Monday (Aug 1) that the number of deaths due to COVID-19 in 2021 has been revised from 803 to 821. The adjustment follows an “annual reconciliation exercise” after the Registry of Births and Deaths finalised its report for last year, said MOH.  “Doctors are required to notify MOH of COVID-19 deaths as soon as possible. Based on the doctors’ submissions, MOH publishes the number of COVID-19 deaths on our website every day,” said the Health Ministry.  Under the Registration of Births and Deaths Act 2021, doctors are also required to report information on the cause of death to the Registry of Births and Deaths. The report on Registration of Births and Deaths for the preceding year is finalised and publicised every June. Overall, 18 deaths were added to the Health Ministry’s official COVID-19 death count for 2021 following the reconciliation exercise. This represents a 2.2 per cent increase from the previous count.  There is no difference in the number of COVID-19 deaths for 2020, said MOH. Of the 18 deaths, eight were not reported to MOH but were reported to the Registry. MOH said that it will remind doctors to report all COVID-19 fatalities to the ministry. Eleven deaths were reported to MOH, but COVID-19 was not indicated as the underlying cause of death in these notifications, as doctors report the cause of death based on available medical information at the point of reporting. These deaths were subsequently reported to the Registry with COVID-19 as the cause of death after further review by the doctors. One death was in MOH's COVID-19 count for 2021, and in the Registry’s count for 2022. This was due to differences in the date of reporting to MOH and the Registry because the death occurred on Dec 31, 2021. MOH said it will include the case in the 2022 count instead of the 2021 count. MOH added that five deaths from the report on registration of births and deaths were people diagnosed with COVID-19 while overseas, and who died after returning to Singapore.  “These deaths will not be included as MOH’s count only includes deaths from COVID-19 diagnosed in Singapore,” said the Health Ministry. “We expect to make annual adjustments to the COVID-19 death count in July, following the publication of the report on registration of births and deaths.” As of noon on Monday, Singapore has reported 1,520 COVID-19 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Health Ministry Ong Ye Kung said in Parliament on Monday that an estimated 60 per cent of Singapore residents have likely caught COVID-19 before, but this does not mean the country now has “herd immunity”. On record, there are about 1.7 million reported cases, which is about 30 per cent of the population. Mr Ong said MOH systematically monitors blood samples from routine polyclinic cases and other healthy volunteers for signs of previous infection. “From these samples, we estimate about 60 per cent of local residents are likely to have been infected with COVID-19,"" he added. By and large, however, scientists around the world do not think herd immunity is achievable because the virus will continue to mutate, escape the protection of vaccines and infect people, he said. What is achievable is “population protection against severe illness” through vaccinations, the minister added. When asked when the protection from vaccines will start to wane, Mr Ong said MOH’s empirical data showed that after 10 months, the protective effect of three doses of mRNA vaccines remains strong in preventing severe illness. That is why as of now, the recommendation is for those who are 80 years old and above to receive a second booster shot to better protect against severe disease.  While the protection for this age group is not waning, it is generally lower than younger age groups, he said. The Health Minister added that the way MOH reports the number of cases will change. “In the past, we report the number of patients who have been infected every day, so a patient who has been infected twice, we count them only once, and there are very few of them. With more reinfections, from today, we will report the infection episodes instead,” Mr Ong said. “This will be a more accurate reflection of the pandemic situation.” "

The Evusheld treatment comprises two monoclonal antibodies and is administered via intramuscular injection.  HSA said the treatment is approved for the prevention of COVID-19 in adults who have not had a known recent exposure to someone infected with the disease and are unlikely to mount an adequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination. This may be due to their immunocompromised state from a medical condition or from receiving immunosuppressive medications or treatments.  Such medical conditions or treatments include those who are in an immunocompromised state from organ, blood or bone marrow transplants, immune deficiencies, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, as well as the use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medicines. The Evusheld jab is not a substitute for vaccination in individuals for whom the COVID-19 vaccine is recommended, said HSA.  ""The treatment must be prescribed by a doctor and the suitability of use on the individual patient will require a careful clinical assessment by the prescribing doctor."" HSA said the drug's efficacy data was based on an ongoing Phase 3 study in more than 5,000 participants aged 18 to 99. The participants were all unvaccinated and either had risk factors for inadequate COVID-19 vaccination response or increased risk for coronavirus infection.  Results showed that there was a ""relative risk reduction"" of symptomatic COVID-19 illness by 77 per cent with Evusheld compared to a placebo, with a duration of protection of about six months for non-Omicron variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  ""At the time the clinical study was conducted, the circulating variants of concern included Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta,"" said HSA.  Recent in-vitro data showed that certain Omicron subvariants are less susceptible to Evusheld, hence the duration of protection against the subvariants is currently unknown, HSA added.  According to Reuters, the lab-made antibodies in Evusheld are designed to linger in the body for months to contain the virus in case of an infection.  HSA said safety data also showed that the drug was ""well-tolerated"" and the incidence of adverse events reported in the clinical study were generally low.  Common adverse events reported were mild to moderate in severity, and included headache, throat pain, runny nose, nasal congestion and muscle pain.  ""While the study reported a higher incidence of cardiovascular adverse events with Evusheld, the causal relationship has not been established based on current available data,"" said HSA, adding that it will continue to closely monitor for any ""further cardiovascular safety signal"".  The available clinical evidence ""preliminary demonstrated"" that Evusheld has a favourable benefit-risk profile for the prevention of COVID-19 in individuals who are unlikely to mount an adequate immune response to the COVID-19 vaccines or for whom COVID-19 vaccination is not recommended.  ""Emerging data on Evusheld’s effectiveness against the currently circulating Omicron variant will be required to further determine its continued benefits,"" said HSA.  As there was no clinical data on pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers and children, no recommendation could be made in these groups, the agency added.  Evusheld was granted interim authorisation under the Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR), which facilitates early access to critical novel vaccines, medicines and medical devices during a pandemic.  HSA said it will actively review the evolving effectiveness and safety data to ensure that the benefits of Evusheld continue to outweigh the known risks.  ""As a condition for the interim authorisation under PSAR, AstraZeneca is required to collect and submit the relevant safety data from ongoing clinical studies to ensure the continued safety and efficacy of Evusheld, including its efficacy against prevailing variants,"" it added.  PSAR interim authorisation may be terminated if new data suggest that the benefits of Evusheld no longer outweigh the risks.  ""To obtain full registration for Evusheld, AstraZeneca will need to submit the complete dataset based on prevailing international standards.""  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-vaccination-booster-children-5-11-years-2849506,COVID-19 vaccination booster shots for children aged 5 to 11 to be rolled out in about 2 months: MOH,"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) plans to roll out vaccination booster doses for children aged five to 11 in about two months.  Speaking in Parliament on Monday (Aug 1), Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary acknowledged that a third mRNA dose for this group of children “may be necessary at some point to keep protection levels high”.  “At present, the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine remains the only vaccine authorised for use in children aged five to 17 years in Singapore,” said Dr Puthucheary.  “Children who are not medically eligible for the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine may receive the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine under a dedicated public health programme, while Moderna’s vaccine for this age group remains under evaluation.” Meanwhile, MOH is preparing to start vaccination for children aged under five towards the fourth quarter of 2022, said Dr Puthucheary. The ministry said last week it was targetting vaccination for young children six months and above towards the end of the year. These children under five years old are currently the last group not yet protected by vaccination.  “The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) is currently reviewing data submitted by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna on their COVID-19 vaccines for this age group. We will provide an update when an assessment of the quality, effectiveness and safety of the vaccines has been completed,” said Dr Puthucheary.  Currently, children under the age of five remain “more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection and have higher rates of severe outcomes compared to older children” – but this is similar to other respiratory diseases, he added. “However, the overall incidence of severe outcomes from COVID-19 infection remains lower amongst children compared to adults and the elderly.”  Two young children in Singapore recently died from COVID-19. A four-year-old girl died in July, while a one-and-a-half-year-old boy died in June.  That said, Dr Puthucheary noted that based on local and international data, “the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants have not been observed to affect children more severely than past variants, and severe COVID-19 infection continues to be rare in children, especially amongst those who are vaccinated”.  Should children need medical attention, they should seek help from a general practitioner or polyclinic, said Dr Puthucheary.  Children with acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms will be tested using the Antigen Rapid Test (ART) by default or the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test. Children under three months old are admitted to hospital by default whereas older children under the Home Recovery Programme (HRP) are reviewed by doctors via telemedicine. This service is available round the clock, added Dr Puthucheary.  “Hospitals continue to prioritise care for children with urgent medical conditions, and those who require further observation and treatment will be admitted. MOH regularly reviews and updates the screening and review criteria with inputs from a panel of specialists.” Under the Health Science Authority’s Pandemic Special Access Route, oral antivirals are licensed for use for patients aged 18 and above only, noted Dr Puthucheary.  For children aged between 12 and 18, local and overseas treatment guidelines indicate that Paxlovid may be considered on a case-by-case basis, he said.  The Health Ministry will continue to review the evidence for the use of oral antivirals for children under 18 years old. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-herd-immunity-singapore-residents-cases-omicron-wave-2849511,"60% of Singapore residents have caught COVID-19, but this doesn't mean there is herd immunity: Ong Ye Kung","SINGAPORE: An estimated 60 per cent of Singapore residents have likely caught COVID-19 before, but this does not mean the country now has “herd immunity”, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said in Parliament on Monday (Aug 1). On record, there are about 1.7 million reported cases, which is about 30 per cent of the population. The ministry also systematically monitors blood samples from routine polyclinic cases and other healthy volunteers for signs of previous infection, Mr Ong said. “From these samples, we estimate about 60 per cent of local residents are likely to have been infected with COVID-19.” By and large, however, scientists around the world do not think herd immunity is achievable because the virus will continue to mutate, escape the protection of vaccines and infect people, he noted. What is achievable is “population protection against severe illness” through vaccinations, Mr Ong said. This is what enables the healthcare system to weather an infection wave, even with high case numbers, because the translation of infections into severe illnesses is low, he said. The minister was responding to MP Seah Kian Peng (PAP-Marine Parade) who asked for the percentage of the population that has been infected and whether Singapore has attained herd immunity with such an infection level. While Singapore is still in the middle of an infection wave driven by the Omicron variant BA.5, over the last 10 days, infection numbers have been falling, Mr Ong said. The week-on-week infection ratio has dipped below 0.9 over the last week, and “we should see the wave subsiding further this week”. During the last Omicron wave at the beginning of this year, 2.4 per cent of infected persons needed hospitalisation. During the current wave, 1.9 per cent have ended up in hospitals, Mr Ong said, adding that the actual percentages are lower because of unreported cases. While Singapore’s reinfection rate during the current wave has been low – lower than many other countries – this is likely to increase as protection of vaccines and prior infections wanes, Mr Ong said. The way the ministry reports the number of cases will change to reflect this, he said. “In the past, we report the number of patients who have been infected every day, so a patient who has been infected twice, we count them only once, and there are very few of them. With more reinfections, from today, we will report the infection episodes instead,” Mr Ong said. “This will be a more accurate reflection of the pandemic situation.” He was responding to MP Joan Pereira (PAP-Tanjong Pagar) who asked about the incidence of reinfections. He added that his ministry has been watching the reinfection numbers closely because it will inform them of the likely timing of future waves. “Our observation is that for those who were infected over the last three months, the chance of getting another infection is very rare. For those infected four to seven months ago, the probability of getting infected again is about 3 per cent that of an uninfected person.” The minister added for someone who was infected with the Delta variant last year, the probability of getting infected again is about 20 per cent that of an uninfected person. However, these probabilities will change as time goes by and the protective effect of prior infections wanes. “Having been infected by COVID-19 before should not be a reason to let your guard down totally,” he said. While MOH is promoting the use of telemedicine for mild COVID-19 cases, people must be realistic that in a big infection wave, the healthcare system will come under stress, the minister said. Waiting times at private clinics, polyclinics and hospitals will ""inevitably go up"", he added. ""We did not tighten any social restrictions during the current wave ... However life is not as normal in our hospitals. Without additional social restrictions, our healthcare system is bearing the brunt of the current wave,"" he said. ""Healthcare workers have been very busy. Polyclinics and our general practitioner clinics also saw higher patient volumes."" Mr Ong was responding to Ms Pereira, who asked about coping with the spike in the number of patients at healthcare institutions.   “In such a situation, the key is to ensure hospitals are not overwhelmed, and that those who need urgent care can be attended to promptly. Fortunately, we are generally able to achieve that,” he said. He added that the first important measure the Government took is to set aside sufficient bed capacity to cater to COVID-19 patients. There are plans to set aside up to about 1,000 hospital beds for COVID-19 patients, Mr Ong said. In the course of this infection wave, not all the beds had to be activated, he said. He was responding to MP Louis Chua (WP-Sengkang) who asked for the bed capacity in private and public hospitals for COVID-19 hospitalisations.   The Government also eased the workload of hospitals by transferring lower-risk patients to COVID-19 treatment facilities and discharging those staying long term back to community care facilities like nursing homes, Mr Ong said.  Hospitals also have to manage their own demand for beds and have cut down on ""business-as-usual"" workload by about 5 per cent, comprising mostly elective surgeries, Mr Ong added. During the current infection wave, the ministry did not suspend the leave of healthcare workers. Absenteeism in hospitals due to the current COVID-19 wave has been lower this time, at around 2 per cent. ""As far as we can determine, while there had been some transmission within hospitals, overall hospital-acquired COVID-19 infection has been low, and very likely lower than community acquired infections and this is because of good infection control measures in hospitals,"" he said. He was responding to Mr Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Yio Chu Kang), who asked if hospital-acquired COVID-19 infections are contributing to a bed crunch.  Mr Chua also asked for the number of foreign patients who come to Singapore to seek inpatient treatment or day surgery at hospitals in Singapore and for the current utilisation rates of existing bed capacity by foreign patients in hospitals. That number has “historically been small”, said Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary. Between 2017 and 2019, public and private hospitals saw about 32,000 foreign patients annually, or about 3 per cent of all inpatients and day surgery patients. These numbers have since fallen by 80 per cent compared to pre-pandemic levels, Dr Puthucheary said. ""In 2021, there were just 6,000 episodes comprising less than 1 per cent of total cases seen in hospitals,"" he added. In response to a question from MP Shawn Huang (PAP-Jurong) who asked when the protection from vaccines will start to wane, Mr Ong provided data. MOH’s empirical data shows that after 10 months, the protective effect of three doses of mRNA vaccines remains strong in preventing severe illness. That is why as of now, the recommendation is for those who are 80 years old and above to receive a second booster shot, or a fourth vaccine dose, to better protect against severe disease. While the protection for this age group is not waning, it is generally lower than younger age groups, he said. For those aged 50 to 79, although the protection continues to be strong, this is also the age when chronic illnesses start to set in, so they will be offered the second booster if they want to take it because they are travelling, or worried about their health because of underlying illnesses. “Our experts are actively studying the benefits of a fourth shot for the 60 to 79-year-olds in further reducing the likelihood of severe illness. We will announce their recommendations shortly, and once ready,” he said. As for those below 60 years old, they have the protection of both the third shot and age, and currently do not require a second booster if they are healthy, Mr Ong added. Mr Ong noted that there are about 40,000 seniors aged 60 and above who have not received their booster shots despite being eligible. Another 40,000 seniors have not completed two doses yet, he said. ""All of them are vulnerable to severe illnesses if infected, and we will continue to try to reach out to them through our mobile vaccination teams, our home vaccination teams,"" he said. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/macao-reopen-no-cases-covid-19-dining-bars-2849116,Macao to reopen city as no COVID-19 infections detected for nine days,"HONG KONG: Macao will reopen public services and entertainment facilities, and allow dining-in at restaurants from Tuesday (Aug 2), authorities said, as the world's biggest gambling hub seeks a return to normalcy after finding no COVID-19 cases for nine straight days. Beauty salons, fitness centres, and bars too will be allowed to resume operations, the government said in a statement on Monday. The announcement came as authorities also reported on Monday that July monthly casino revenues dropped 95 per cent year on year to 0.4 billion patacas (US$49.5 million), the lowest on record.
Casinos were closed for 12 days in July, reopening on Jul 23 as authorities began unwinding stringent measures which required most businesses and premises to shut. The former Portuguese colony has reported around 1,800 infections since mid-June when it was hit with its worst coronavirus outbreak that forced the closure of casinos and locked down most of the city. Despite reopening, there is likely to be no business for at least a few weeks, analysts said, due to strict restrictions still in place. Health authorities will require residents to wear masks when they go out and must show a negative coronavirus test within three days to enter most venues. ""There have been no community infection cases in Macao for nine consecutive days ... and the risk of the spread of the coronavirus has been greatly reduced,"" it said. This is the first time Macao has had to grapple with the fast spreading Omicron variant. More than 90 per cent of Macao's residents are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 but authorities have closely followed China's zero-COVID mandate which seeks to curb all outbreaks at almost any cost, contrary to the rest of the world which is already living with the virus. The city only has one public hospital which was already overburdened even before the pandemic. Sands China, Wynn Macau, MGM China, Galaxy Entertainment, SJM Holdings and Melco Resorts are the current six casino licence holders in Macao. Their licences will expire by the end of the year. They are soaking up losses as they prepare to bid for new licences in a business that generated US$36 billion in revenue in 2019, the last year before COVID-19 curbs slammed the sector. "

New Zealand's borders started reopening in February first for New Zealanders and restrictions have progressively eased. The process of reopening the borders ended last night with visitors who need visas and those on student visas now also allowed to return to New Zealand. New Zealand is now also letting cruise ships and foreign recreational yachts docks at its ports. International students were a significant contributor to New Zealand's economy and educational providers are hoping the reopening of the borders will again provide a boost to schools and universities around the country. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday during a speech at the China Business Summit in Auckland that the final staged opening of the borders had been an enormous moment.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/inside-super-secure-swiss-lab-trying-stop-next-pandemic-2847926,Inside the super-secure Swiss lab trying to stop the next pandemic,"SPIEZ, Switzerland: The setting is straight from a spy thriller: Crystal waters below, snow-capped Swiss Alps above and in between, a super-secure facility researching the world's deadliest pathogens. Spiez Laboratory, known for its detective work on chemical, biological and nuclear threats since World War II, was tasked last year by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be the first in a global network of high-security laboratories that will grow, store and share newly discovered microbes that could unleash the next pandemic. The WHO's BioHub programme was, in part, born of frustration over the hurdles researchers faced in getting samples of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, first detected in China, to understand its dangers and develop tools to fight it. But just over a year later, scientists involved in the effort have encountered hurdles. These include securing guarantees needed to accept coronavirus variant samples from several countries, the first phase of the project. Some of the world's biggest countries might not cooperate. And there is no mechanism yet to share samples for developing vaccines, treatments or tests without running afoul of intellectual property protections. ""If we have another pandemic like coronavirus, the goal would be it stays wherever it starts,"" Isabel Hunger-Glaser, head of the BioHub project at Spiez, told Reuters in a rare media interview at the lab. Hence the need to get samples to the hub so it can help scientists worldwide assess the risk. ""We have realised it's much more difficult"" than we had thought, she said. Spiez Lab's exterior provides no hint of the high-stakes work inside. Its angular architecture resembles European university buildings erected in the 1970s. At times, cows graze on the grassy central courtyard. But the biosafety officer in charge keeps his blinds shut. Alarms go off if his door is open for more than a few seconds. He monitors several screens showing security camera views of the labs with the greatest Biosafety Level (BSL) precautions. SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, is studied in BSL-3 labs, the second-highest security level. Samples of the virus used in the BioHub are stored in locked freezers, said Hunger-Glaser. A system of decreasing air pressure means clean air would flow into the most secure areas, rather than contaminated air flowing out, in a breach. Scientists working with coronavirus and other pathogens wear protective suits, sometimes with their own air supply. They work with samples in a hermetically sealed containment unit. Waste leaving the lab is super-heated at up to 1,000 degrees Celsius to kill pathogens clinging to it. To date, Spiez has never had an accidental leak, the team say. That reputation is a key part of why they were chosen as the WHO's first BioHub, said Hunger-Glaser. The proximity to WHO headquarters, two hours away in Geneva, helped too. The WHO and Swiss government are funding the annual 600,000 Swiss franc (US$626,000) budget for its first phase. Researchers have always shared pathogens, and there are some existing networks and regional repositories. But the process is ad hoc and often slow. The sharing process has also been controversial, for instance when researchers in wealthy countries get credit for the work of less well-connected scientists in developing nations. ""Often you just exchanged material with your buddies,"" said Hunger-Glaser. Marion Koopmans, head of the Erasmus MC Department of Viroscience in the Netherlands, said it took a month for her lab to get hold of SARS-CoV-2 after it emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. Chinese researchers were quick to post a copy of the genetic sequence online, which helped researchers begin early work. But efforts to understand how a new virus transmits and how it responds to existing tools requires live samples, scientists said. Luxembourg was the first country to share samples of new coronavirus variants with the BioHub, followed by South Africa and Britain. Luxembourg sent in Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants, while the latter two countries shared Omicron, WHO said. Luxembourg got Omicron samples from South Africa, via the hub, less than three weeks after it was identified, enabling its researchers to start assessing the risks of the now-dominant strain. Portugal and Germany also received Omicron samples. But Peru, El Salvador, Thailand and Egypt, all of which signalled in early 2022 that they wanted to send in variants found domestically, are still waiting, chiefly because it is unclear which official in each country should provide the necessary legal guarantees, Hunger-Glaser said. There is no international protocol for who should sign the forms providing safety details and usage agreements, she added. None of the four countries responded to requests for comment. Both WHO and Hunger-Glaser stressed the project is a pilot, and they have already sped up certain processes. Another challenge is how to share samples used in research that could lead to commercial gain, such as vaccine development. BioHub samples are shared for free to provide broad access. However this throws up potential problems if, for example, drugmakers reap profits from the discoveries of uncompensated researchers. WHO plans to tackle this longer-term, and bring labs in each global region online, but it is not yet clear when or how this will be funded. The project's voluntary nature may also hold it back. ""Some countries will never ship viruses, or it can be extremely difficult - China, Indonesia, Brazil,"" said Koopmans, referring to their stance in recent outbreaks. None of the three responded to requests for comment. The project also comes amid heightened attention on labs worldwide after unproven claims in some Western countries that a leak from a high-security Wuhan lab may have sparked the COVID-19 pandemic, an accusation China and most international scientists have dismissed. Hunger-Glaser said the thinking around emerging threats must change post-COVID-19. ""If it is a real emergency, WHO should even get a plane"" to transport the virus to scientists, she said. ""If you can prevent the spreading, it's worthwhile."" "

Biden, who tested positive for the disease nine days ago but then tested negative twice earlier this week, ""will isolate at the White House until he tests negative"" and is cancelling travel in the coming days to Delaware and Michigan, the White House said Saturday. Biden had planned the Michigan trip to tout Thursday's passage of legislation to boost the semiconductor chips industry, which the White House announced earlier Saturday. Biden's positive test is believed to be ""rebound"" positivity experienced by some COVID-19 patients, according to White House physician Dr. Kevin O'Connor. Biden tweeted about his positive case, saying it can happen to a ""small minority of folks"". ""I’ve got no symptoms but I am going to isolate for the safety of everyone around me. I’m still at work, and will be back on the road soon,"" he tweeted. O'Connor said Biden, who is 79, tested negative for the last four days, and there is no plan to reinitiate treatment given his lack of symptoms. Biden previously described his experience with COVID as mild, saying he was able to continue working while in isolation and attributed his relative ease with the disease to vaccines and other treatments. O'Connor had previously said Biden would be tested regularly to watch for a potential ""rebound"" COVID-19 case, which can be experienced by some patients who have been treated with Paxlovid, the drug the president received."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/covid19-north-korea-no-new-fever-cases-first-time-2846296,North Korea reports no new fever cases for first time since COVID-19 outbreak,"SEOUL: North Korea reported no new fever cases on Saturday (Jul 30) for the first time since its acknowledgement of a COVID-19 outbreak in the isolated country in mid-May, state-run media reported. North Korea said earlier this month it was on a path to ""finally defuse"" its first publicly declared coronavirus crisis even as Asian neighbours experience a resurgence in infections driven by Omicron subvariants. The official KCNA news agency said 99.99 per cent of its 4.77 million fever patients since late April have fully recovered, but because of an apparent lack of testing, it has not released any figures on people who tested positive for the virus. Infectious disease experts have cast doubts on North Korea's claims, with the World Health Organization saying last month it believed the situation was getting worse, not better, amid an absence of independent data. KCNA said a rapid mobile treatment force is still on high alert and efforts are under way to ""detect and stamp out the epidemic"" until the last patient is fully recovered. The state media said 204 fever patients were under treatment as of Friday. Pyongyang's possible declaration of victory against COVID-19 could be a prelude to restoring trade long hampered by the pandemic, North Korea analysts said. Trade volume plunged 17.3 per cent to US$710 million last year amid a strict closure of borders. North Korea temporarily resumed freight train operations with China early this year, but suspended them again in April over heightened fears of the coronavirus spreading."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/indonesia-jakarta-covid19-masks-air-pollution-health-2844626,"Commentary: With or without COVID-19, Jakarta should keep masks on","JAKARTA: Indonesia lifted its outdoor mask mandate in May as COVID-19 cases declined in the country considered Asia’s COVID hotspot at one point in 2021, when it recorded the highest number of daily infections in the region. But should COVID-19 be the only reason for Indonesians, especially Jakarta residents, to keep their masks on outdoors?  It’s well-known that Jakarta has an air pollution problem. According to an IQAir study, the Air Quality Index (AQI) ranks Jakarta as one of the most polluted cities in Indonesia and around the world. On Jun 20, Jakarta’s AQI reached 196, just shy of the “Very Unhealthy” category. Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan in 2020 acknowledged that “air pollution is a significant health issue in the capital, causing more than 5 million illnesses a year”.  According to the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago’s Air Quality Life Index report released in June, Jakarta residents could lose three to four years of life expectancy due to air pollution. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that nearly one in eight deaths worldwide can be attributed to air pollution.  So pandemic or not, there are clear benefits for Jakartans to stay masked when not doing so could bring serious, even deadly, health consequences. But COVID-19 has been the main reason Jakartans put on a face mask in the first place. Even after the mask mandate was lifted, the Jakarta Environment Office urged the residents to wear a mask when outdoors, in light of the worsening air pollution situation. Many Jakarta residents have kept their masks on, given the pandemic has not officially been declared over. This is one indirect positive impact of the pandemic – people still wearing a mask out of COVID-19 concerns can get some protection against air pollution, a more insidious threat.  Wearing a highly effective air pollution mask has been shown to help reduce the risk of exposure to atmospheric levels of fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, and other airborne particulates, decreasing the chance of illness and death related to air pollution. A 2018 study in China suggested that masks with filtration equivalent to N95, KN95 or FFP2 were most effective for filtering PM2.5 and diesel soot.  Though surgical face masks, more commonly and comfortably used, are less effective filters, research suggests that these still help to reduce the amount of harmful particulates breathed in. But what comes next? Pre-pandemic, few Jakarta residents wore a mask regularly despite the poor quality of the air. A popular ride-hailing operation in Indonesia used to distribute a face mask to the passengers who used its motor taxi service.  This is unlike people in major Asian cities who are no strangers to wearing masks, one of the reasons being air pollution. In Japan, for example, people have worn a face mask in 1950s as a protection against rising air pollution. In Vietnam, face masks are as common as helmets for motorcycles and scooters on the streets of Hanoi. Masks are a salve, not a cure for Jakarta’s air pollution troubles.  A dangerous level of pollution, more than 20 million motor vehicles and cigarette smoking an integral part of daily life for many, could be a lethal combination. So while urging residents to continue wearing masks is a right move, tackling the problem of air pollution more seriously should be a priority for the city government. One structural change is the improvement of the city’s notorious public transportation. With improved and more reliable public transportation, more people would be encouraged to leave their vehicles at home instead, potentially contributing to a cleaner sky.  The city has actually made headway on this front by launching new transportation modes such as the Mass Rapid Transit and the Light Rail Transit Jakarta, both of which are a lot more convenient and reliable than other modes of transportation in the city.  The TomTom Traffic Index ranked Jakarta 46th most congested city in 2021, down from 10th in 2019 (the year the MRT was launched) which suggests fewer vehicles on the road. Planting more trees can also be a good option. Jakarta might be home to dozens of shining malls and shopping centres but severely lacks green spaces. The city only has 3,131 green spaces or only about 10 per cent of the total land in the city. It is much below the requirement of 30 per cent stipulated in the prevailing Spatial Planning Law.  Learning from the pandemic, Jakarta should also invest more in healthcare facilities and healthcare workers, keeping in mind the treatment of pollution-related diseases.  Jakarta’s deteriorating air pollution is indeed not an easy problem to tackle. While the city government should address the issue through policy, residents can also take steps to protect their health in the meantime.  Wearing a mask outdoors, especially in Jakarta’s menacing heat, can be incredibly uncomfortable. However, it is a small step that can be an efficient measure to shield our body against hazardous pollution.  After wearing masks to prevent COVID-19 infection for more than two years, Jakartans would do well to continue doing so for their health in the long term.

MP Joan Pereira (PAP-Tanjong Pagar) asked if the Government has noticed a rise in reinfections amid the emergence of Omicron subvariants, and whether second booster shots will be made available to younger people.  And MP Seah Kian Peng (PAP-Marine Parade) asked the Ministry of Health (MOH) for an estimate of the proportion of Singapore’s population that has been infected with COVID-19, including unreported cases. He also asked if Singapore has attained herd immunity with that infection level. Several MPs asked questions about the AGO audit, zeroing in on lapses relating to SkillsFuture Singapore and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). MP Sylvia Lim (WP-Aljunied) asked about remedial actions being taken by SkillsFuture as a result of fraud and disbursement lapses highlighted in the AGO report. She also asked for the total amount that has been defrauded or overpaid since the introduction of the scheme; how much has been recovered; and whether anyone overseeing the grant schemes has or will be held accountable for the loss of public funds. MP Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Yio Chu Kang) asked why SkillsFuture was lax in collecting Skills Development Levy funds and why the discrepancy went undetected for more than five years. MP Tan Wu Meng (PAP-Jurong) asked about the AGO finding that GST Voucher-U-Save rebates could have been given to ineligible households, while MP Murali Pillai (PAP-Bukit Batok) asked about quotation authenticity for two development projects under MHA. Singapore's central bank will also be in the spotlight with questions filed by three MPs. MP Ang Wei Neng (PAP-West Coast) asked if the Government is prepared for MAS to continue making net losses over the next one to two years, and if Government funding will be affected by MAS’ financial position. MP Vikram Nair (PAP-Sembawang) also asked if the Government’s budget will be impacted by the loss, and whether a reconsideration of MAS contributions in the Government budget is needed. A question on the impact of the MAS loss on the Government’s strong Singapore dollar policy and overall budget position for the current financial year was filed by MP Liang Eng Hwa (PAP-Bukit Panjang). Mr Seah asked if there has been an issue of overpopulation of animals such as monkeys and otters in recent years, and asked for the Ministry of National Development’s assessment of the disadvantages of such overpopulation. Jurong MPs Mr Tan and Mr Shawn Huang asked for data on monkey attacks and the intrusion of monkeys into homes, and about MND’s strategy to manage the habitat and population of long-tailed macaques. MP Nadia Ahmad Samdin (PAP-Ang Mo Kio), meanwhile, asked about public outreach efforts to better understand sentiments regarding coexistence with wildlife. On the Sports Hub, MP Edward Chia (PAP-Holland-Bukit Timah) asked about lessons learned from its terminated public-private partnership (PPP), and about new guidelines that will apply to Government agencies and statutory boards for future PPPs. He also asked about the total cost to the Government to keep the PPP going, and the anticipated cost of having the Sports Hub run fully by the Sport Singapore (SportSG) statutory board. Dr Wan Rizal asked how SportSG will encourage better utilisation of the Sports Hub’s facilities and how it intends to attract high-level competitions and talent. Apart from his adjournment motion, Mr Yong, who is also assistant secretary-general at the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), asked about the manpower ministry’s plan to improve workplace safety and health for food delivery riders. Mr Yong highlighted that riders may endanger their lives as they are incentivised by platforms to make as many deliveries as possible during peak hours. Other topics to be discussed include sexual health and sexuality education in schools; former Sri Lankan president Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s presence in Singapore; and race- or community-based data being shared in closed-door settings with community leaders and groups."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/japan-encourage-regional-authorities-covid-19-counter-measures-new-variant-record-cases-2843871,Japan looks to regions to mount COVID-19 fight as variant spreads,"TOKYO: Japan is encouraging regional authorities to take their own counter-measures against the spread of a new coronavirus variant that has sent cases surging to record levels but there is no plan for any sweeping national measures. A seventh wave of COVID-19 pushed the daily tally of new cases in Japan to a record 233,094 on Thursday (Jul 29) as the BA.5 variant of virus spreads, putting pressure on medical services and disrupting company operations in some places. Japan has never imposed national lockdowns on the scale of some other countries, instead periodically calling on people to stay at home as much as possible and limiting the opening hours of restaurants and bars. Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiji Kihara reiterated that on Friday saying regional authorities should tailor their response to their specific situations. ""Rather than a national response, we want to support regional authorities in their efforts that are based on their local situations,"" Kihara told a regular news conference. ""What's important is to help each prefecture's social and economic activities."" The western city of Osaka recently urged elderly people to avoid non-essential outings. Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike called on residents to test frequently, including at free centres set up at city train stations, and to maintain precautions such as masks but the capital was not imposing any restrictions at this point. ""We've learned a lot from our experiences over the past few years,"" she told a regular news conference. The country of 125.8 million people has done better than some in handling the pandemic, with 32,308 deaths since it began in early 2020. But Japan had the world's highest number of new coronavirus cases in the week to Jul 24, the World Health Organization said this week. Though the number of deaths in the new wave has been low compared with previous ones, new infections are beginning to take a toll on some sectors. Train companies in some regions have had to curtail services due to a lack of staff and Toyota Motor suspended night shift operations at one production line of its Takaoka factory in central Japan this week because of COVID-19.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/work-home-return-office-employer-staff-property-2841851,Commentary: WFH debates must include what 'home' actually is,"LONDON: Coming down with COVID-19 was an unlikely source of relief last week. I did not have to weigh up whether to venture out to the 40 degrees Celsius streets of London with my laptop on my back to get to the prize: An air-conditioned office. Instead, the decision was made for me: I isolated at home in front of a fan. Some employers advised white-collar workers to stay at home. Others, such as shop workers and nurses, didn’t have the luxury of choice. The heatwave once again brought home the differences between workers’ accommodation as well as their commutes. Working in a stifling flat is a very different proposition to an airy home with shutters. As with the pandemic, the high temperatures underlined the problematic connections between work and housing. When we talk about the pressures of home on work, it’s often a euphemism for family or caring responsibilities. But there is a more literal interpretation too. In lockdowns, those who were able to work from a dedicated office in their large home or a converted shed in the garden had a very different experience from those in crowded flats. One young professional told me he had to Zoom from the bathroom of his crowded flatshare, while a student living with his parents and siblings in a cramped apartment spoke of studying for his finals in the booth where he worked as a car park attendant. Zoom gave us an inside view of our colleagues’ living arrangements. Younger people saw senior peers living in spacious homes rather than having to jostle for space on the kitchen table with flatmates. It also revealed which of their colleagues had homes financed by the Bank of Mum and Dad, an inheritance, or a wealthier partner. These insights brought new dynamics to the workplace. The pandemic made some people re-evaluate their lives. When Channel 4 moved 300 jobs out of London, 90 per cent of employees reportedly applied for redundancy instead – though a few reconsidered after lockdown. The experience showed white-collar workers didn’t need to be tethered to a location within easy reach of their workplace. Moving out of large cities in return for greater space had a knock-on effect of driving up prices in those areas. Now that the world is opening up again, employees’ decisions to move further away from work are causing tensions. One television producer complained of an employee who had moved from London to the Kent seaside in lockdown and was resisting coming into the office four times a week because his commute was more than two hours each way. It is easy for an employer to frame such a decision as an individual’s choice – and one might have some sympathy for the TV company director who pays staff wages well above the national average. But housing costs are a strain on workers, particularly during a cost of living crisis. Recent figures from the Office for National Statistics showed the increasing unaffordability of properties as prices grew faster than wages last year in 91 per cent of England’s local authorities. The average property was about 9.1 times the average full-time salary, up from 7.9 the previous year. Kensington and Chelsea was the worst area: Average house prices were 36.5 times average earnings. Some employers have stepped in to help with housing costs. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, a professional organisation, says most assistance is geared towards subsidised rental deposits or moving-in allowances. But others are taking it a step further. Meta is building 1,700 flats next to its headquarters, and Google’s San Jose development will also have some affordable housing, including for employees. Though in truth, the tech groups are helping solve a problem of their own making in Silicon Valley. In the care sector, Brexit and the pandemic have increased staff shortages. In response, Parklands Care Homes in Inverness has submitted plans to build homes to encourage workers to live nearby. Ron Taylor, managing director, said the cost of living crisis and the lack of affordable homes for rent were proving “barriers to recruitment”. Such moves could be seen as the latest iteration of an overreaching nanny employer. The risk for employees is that they are dependent on their bosses not just for wages but for housing. But the property market is in flux. As work and consumer patterns shift, some offices are empty for part of the week. UK retailer John Lewis has announced plans to create rental properties over Waitrose shops and in one of its vacant warehouses. Employers must recognise that the future of work is also about where – and how – their employees live."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/huggs-coffee-new-outlet-coffee-expansion-covid19-2822816,How Huggs Coffee went from being 'blindsided' by COVID-19 to opening its 21st outlet,"SINGAPORE: After being “completely blindsided” by the COVID-19 pandemic, local specialty coffee chain Huggs Coffee embarked on an overhaul of its business and is now in the middle of a rapid expansion. Its newest and 21st outlet opens this week at Clarke Quay Central. This comes on top of nine other new locations it has added in the past 14 months. The brand is not stopping here and intends to open another four to six outlets over the next 12 months, said managing director Lee Haoming. The company is also expecting its brand-new headquarters in Tai Seng to be up and running next month. This will house its roastery and bakery – new capabilities formed as part of its overhaul – under one roof. “Right from the start, we knew there would be many steps to take to build a future-proof and sustainable business,” Mr Lee told CNA in an interview earlier this month. “COVID-19 has been a reset button.” Huggs Coffee, which first opened its doors in 2008, took a heavy blow when COVID-19 struck. Most of its outlets were in the central business district and business parks, catering to the throngs of office workers out to grab a quick coffee. These customers disappeared overnight when the “circuit breaker” was called in April 2020, and never quite returned as people continued to work from home for most of the past two years. The homegrown coffee chain barely had any online presence then. “Huggs wasn’t digitalised at all,” Mr Lee recalled, citing how the brand, for one, was not on any food delivery platforms prior to the pandemic. “We were completely blindsided by COVID-19.” A major overhaul was needed, added the 34-year-old, whose involvement in the firm started out as “lending an extra pair of hands” to his childhood friend Ben Choo, Huggs’ second-generation leader. “Ben shared with me how much COVID-19 was affecting them ... and it felt like they could barely hold on because business in the CBD and business parks was completely dead. So I said since I had time, I can help, be it deliveries, marketing, anything.” Mr Lee was previously in the events industry and organised, for example, the Singapore edition of Bangkok’s outdoor pop-up market Artbox before deciding to take a career break in end-2019. “But the first week I came in, I knew they needed more than a one day, one week kind of help. The business had so much potential but to survive, it really needed to restructure and think out of the box,” he said. After several discussions, Mr Lee was roped in to find Huggs Coffee’s next shot at success. One decision was to expand into the heartlands. “If people are not coming to the CBD, then we go to them,” said Mr Lee. “But we weren't complacent enough to think that just because we were successful for so many years in the CBD, the brand would hold its own in the neighbourhoods.” There was also the consideration that competition is no less stiff in residential areas, from coffee shops with affordable local kopi to cafes with artisanal coffee. Customers in the suburbs also have a “different mentality” – preferring a spot where they can get their caffeine fix while hanging out with family and friends, instead of a “grab-and-go” option. This paved the way for Huggs’ new store concept in residential areas. Named Huggs Collective, the spacious outlets – the biggest being a 3,000 sq ft flagship at Maxwell Road – come with member lounges that have amphitheatre-like seating and even private pods with noise-cancelling headphones. More than just courting the work-from-home crowd, the lounges have also seen bookings for birthday parties and other private events. “We are basically elevating the customer experience to be more than just a functional place for coffee,” said Mr Lee during the interview at JEM shopping mall where one of the five Huggs Collective outlets is located. The expansion also coincides with how the pandemic has freed up some prime spaces in popular malls. Shifting consumption patterns due to work-from-home trends also threw up “hidden gems”, such as its outlet at Thomson Plaza. While some questioned the move to open at an old suburban mall, Mr Lee said the mall is frequented by nearby residents, as well as families on weekends for its variety of tuition and enrichment centres. The unit, left vacant for months before Huggs came in, is also located on the same floor as a supermarket which sees high footfall. “That’s why while COVID-19 was a challenge, it also opened up a lot of new opportunities.” Huggs also revamped its franchise model – a necessary move, Mr Lee said, after “inefficiencies” that became apparent during the thick of the pandemic. Under the previous model, franchisees operated their outlets independently. This meant that during tough times, cost-cutting decisions were made at the expense of quality and customer service.  “Everyone was only fixated on their own outlet,” recalled Mr Lee, adding that the same mindset also resulted in slow responses to ever-changing COVID-19 safety rules. “This was one of the biggest weaknesses of the old franchise model ... it had to change,” he added. “Essentially now, franchisees just have to invest and Huggs will run the show for you.” Doing so has ensured brand consistency, quality service and quick responses to evolving situations. It is also a “win-win” for franchisees as resources can now be shared and optimised, resulting in better returns, Mr Lee said. In the push to go digital, Huggs also went beyond online deliveries and cashless payments to set up its own online reward system.  Running its own roastery and bakery is a key part of its goal to become self-reliant. Huggs does not want to be “held hostage” by suppliers amid rising costs and supply chain disruptions, said Mr Lee. These in-house capabilities can also help the firm to grow its business-to-business operations. That's not all the company is doing. It is also launching a ""Huggs academy"" soon to try and tackle the F&B industry’s perennial manpower woes. Mr Lee said the academy, which will offer a variety of barista and customer service training courses, will be a key source of talent for the company. Beyond that, it also hopes to convince people that there are opportunities for career development in the industry. “Within our stores, you can work up to be head barista or manager. If not, you can be transferred back to the headquarters to be a trainer at the academy, or be involved in R&D at the roastery and bakery. There’s also the option of office roles so our employees don’t have to be stuck at the stores.” Asked how Huggs has been funding these plans, Mr Lee said franchisee investments have helped with the start-up costs of new stores. The firm also tapped on government schemes for loans. But for the most part, it has been “bootstrapping on sales revenue” and carefully timing every move. While in a better position compared to two years ago, the company is keenly aware of a still-uncertain business environment. Even as the country moves to living with COVID-19, new challenges have emerged in the form of rising costs, from food ingredients, labour and construction materials to logistics. The inflationary environment and unpredictable economic and geopolitical circumstances could mean that the year ahead may even be “more challenging” than the past two years, Mr Lee said. “Because you get less support, less relief and less leniency. There will also be a lot of unforeseen curveballs.” While Huggs is forging ahead with expansion, it is not doing so blindly. For example, it has chosen not to renew the leases of some of its outlets in the business district. “Expansion is not just about blindly opening. It’s also about strategically closing certain outlets so that we cut losses as well,” said Mr Lee. “Others have asked us too – why are you expanding so rapidly? Why are you even expanding? Surely you’d want to take on a more conservative position? “From how I see it, expansion does not just mean spending. Expansion also means adaptability and innovating. Because if you have a wait-and-see mentality and stop moving forward, you will eventually die.” The ambitious restructuring and rebranding moves it has taken on during the tough times embodied that, Mr Lee said, as he gestured to the brand’s new teal logo and bear mascot. “Do you know why the bear is looking to the side and at a certain direction? It represents our hopes to be forward-looking and be open to whatever that may come,” he told CNA. “We have redone everything to give people a new look. I see it as an opportunity to introduce ourselves all over again and a chance to get it right this time.”"

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/london-heathrow-airport-ceo-tiktok-hack-wheelchair-delays-2838191,Heathrow boss says TikTok wheelchair 'travel hack' to blame for additional airport delays: Reports,"The chief of Heathrow Airport has blamed a popular TikTok ""travel hack"" for additional delays, due to passengers pretending to be disabled or injured in order to skip queues. Speaking to LBC Radio on Monday (Jul 25), Heathrow CEO John Holland-Kaye said there has been more demand for wheelchair support at the airport compared to pre-pandemic times. “Some of this is because people are using the wheelchair support to try to get fast-tracked through the airport. That is absolutely the wrong thing to be doing.” When asked if some people were abusing the rules by pretending they needed wheelchair assistance, Mr Holland-Kaye confirmed it and pointed to supposed ""travel hacks"" that were being recommended on TikTok.  “Please don’t do that, we need to protect the service for the people who need it most.” In a TikTok video posted in June, user WolfJenko said that he pretended to be injured in order to get through airport security faster. ""Faked hurting my leg to get through security faster and onto the plane back from Ibiza,"" he wrote in a video caption.  The video also showed him being pushed on a wheelchair through airport security, bypassing snaking lines of other passengers. He also said he had an entire row of seats on the flight to himself. According to the Telegraph, the man was a 28-year-old student who had travelled from Turkey to Bristol. People with disabilities on TikTok have called out passengers who faked injuries at the airport to make use of wheelchair assistance.  A video by user disabledgirl showed a flight attendant sharing an “airport hack” where passengers fake injuries and use wheelchairs to skip queues. “There is a special place in hell for people who see wheelchair assistance as a fun quirky little airport hack,” said the user, who was on a flight from Philadelphia to Heathrow. She added that the airport was ""understaffed"" and that she was ""forgotten about"" and ""treated like cattle"".  LBC Radio also reported that 20 passengers on wheelchairs were left waiting in Heathrow Airport’s Terminal 3 for assistance to get through immigration last week. “We do have as many people now working in our Passengers Requiring Support team as we had before the pandemic. We've seen demand has gone up significantly,"" said Mr Holland-Kaye. He also added that ""half of all the people"" who requested assistance only did so once they were on the plane. ""If you really need the service, then you will be letting us know well in advance so we can make sure there are enough people there to meet your needs,"" said Mr Holland-Kaye.  According to The Guardian, Mr Holland-Kaye also said delays were partly caused by passengers “travelling with more than they normally would” and people failing to “check in all of their makeup” before going through security.  Passengers at Heathrow Airport have been plagued by long queues and baggage issues in recent weeks as demand for travel rebounds after the pandemic. Like other airports across Europe, Britain's busiest airport is struggling to cope amid staff shortages across the whole aviation sector.  Heathrow on Jul 12 said it would cap departing passengers at 100,000 a day to limit queues, baggage delays and cancellations. It also asked airlines to stop selling tickets for flights that could be curtailed, said Reuters.  According to Reuters, airlines at Heathrow had already responded to a government appeal to cut capacity, but the airport said it needed them to go further.  Heathrow's capacity cap will run from Jul 12 to Sep 11, according to Mr Holland-Kaye in an open letter.  ""We recognise that this will mean some summer journeys will either be moved to another day, another airport or be cancelled and we apologise to those whose travel plans are affected,"" he said."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/macao-no-new-daily-covid-19-cases-july-2838591,No new daily COVID-19 cases in Macao for first time in over a month,"HONG KONG: Authorities in Macao reported no new COVID-19 infections on Wednesday (Jul 27) for the first time since mid-June, after the city's worst outbreak of the disease led to a 12-day closure of casinos and locked down most of the world's biggest gambling hub. The tally of infections since Jun 18 stood at 1,816, the government said in a statement, as the city grapples with the fast-spreading Omicron variant for the first time. ""No additional positive cases were reported in Macao within 24 hours yesterday,"" it said on its website. Macao's casinos reopened last week, as it began unwinding stringent measures that had shut most businesses and premises. All casinos were shut on Jul 11 for the first time in more than two years. But cinemas, health clubs and beauty parlours remain shut, with daily coronavirus tests required of the population of more than 600,000. They must also stay home except for urgent tasks, such as work and shopping, the government has said. More than 90 per cent of residents are fully vaccinated but authorities are following China's ""zero-COVID"" programme of curbing all outbreaks at almost any cost, contrary to efforts in the rest of the world, which is living with the virus. Casinos, though open, are seeing little business as the curbs unwind slowly. They are racking up losses ahead of bidding next month for new licenses in an industry that earned revenue of US$36 billion in 2019, the last year before COVID-19 curbs.  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/new-zealand-covid-19-infection-fall-2838216,"COVID-19 infections fall in New Zealand, worst case scenario likely avoided","WELLINGTON: New Zealand's government said on Wednesday (Jul 27) new COVID-19 cases were trending down and it looked likely the country would avoid a feared worst-case scenario of 20,000 infections daily. In the last seven days there were on average 8,111 new cases daily of COVID-19, down from a seven-day rolling average of 9,367 new cases in the week prior, according to Health Ministry data released on Wednesday. Currently 808 people were in hospital with COVID-19, which was also a lower number than earlier, data showed. Ashley Bloomfield, director general of health, said case rates were trending down and this shift was supported by waste-water testing and a fall in the number of people testing positive on arrival at hospital. ""What is apparent is that the worst-case scenario that our modellers had suggested a couple of weeks ago with up to 1,200 beds occupied and over 20,000 cases a day is now highly unlikely. And I'm sure we're all relieved to see this,"" said Bloomfield. The Omicron BA.5 subvariant is driving the current wave in New Zealand, which has 5.1 million people. There have been 56,750 active cases in the past seven days, although authorities say many infections are unreported. Once regarded as a model for preventing COVID-19 infection, New Zealand's swift response to the pandemic and its geographic isolation kept it largely free from the virus until the end of last year. New Zealand has recorded a total of about 1.6 million infections in total and 1,427 deaths, according to the latest data. The deaths are roughly a third lower than previous numbers as the ministry had changed how it classifies virus-related fatalities. Under the new classification, deaths will be recorded as COVID-19-related if they are attributable to the virus, rather than a death within 28 days of testing positive for the virus. New Zealand closed its border in early 2020 as the coronavirus was spreading around the world and imposed lockdowns and strict social distancing to keep its infection low. It began reopening its border in February and will lift the last restrictions at the end of this month. The news conference was Bloomfield's last in this role. The director general, who has led New Zealand's response to COVID-19, steps down from his post on Friday. "

Photos released by state media on Wednesday (Jul 27) showed thousands of participants at the annual ceremony without masks, including senior ruling Workers' Party officials and elderly uniformed veterans. The reclusive country said earlier this month it was on a path to ""finally defuse"" its first publicly declared COVID-19 crisis, even as Asian neighbours battle a resurgence in infections driven by Omicron subvariants. The official KCNA news agency on Wednesday reported 18 new fever cases for Monday, the third straight day the tally has held below 100 after topping 390,000 in May. It said 99.99 per cent of 4.77 million fever patients since late April have fully recovered. The country has never confirmed how many people have tested positive for COVID-19, apparently lacking testing supplies. The World Health Organization said last month the situation could be getting worse. The veterans ceremony in Pyongyang on Tuesday was to commemorate the 69th anniversary of the Jul 27 Korean War armistice, which left the two Koreas technically still at war. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who gave a speech at the 2020 ceremony, did not attend the event. Kim has not been seen in state media since Jul 8, marking his longest public absence this year. Seoul and Washington officials have said North Korea has made preparations to conduct its first nuclear test since 2017.

Koh, 46, appeared in court on Wednesday and now faces a total of four charges. She was given permission to travel to Malaysia last month for cancer treatment. Her two new charges involve Jipson Quah, a doctor linked to Healing the Divide, and his assistant Thomas Chua Cheng Soon. Both men also received several new charges on Wednesday. Koh is accused of conspiring with Quah, Chua and another person, named Cedric Lim Junqi @ Mohammad Daniel Lim in charge sheets, to make false representations to MOH that Lim was vaccinated with the Sinopharm vaccine when he was not. This allegedly took place on Jan 14. According to court documents, she is accused of a similar conspiracy with Quah and another man named Gary Tho Kong Choong to defraud MOH in October last year that Tho was vaccinated with the Sinopharm vaccine. This comes on top of her two existing charges. One charge is for conspiring with Quah to defraud MOH into believing people were vaccinated with the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine between July 2021 and January this year. Koh's other existing charge is for obstructing a police inspector by refusing to sign and tearing up a copy of her statement in January. Quah, 34, and his assistant, Chua, 40, now face a total of 10 and seven charges respectively after receiving several fresh charges. Both men already faced one charge each of conspiring to make false representation to MOH that a woman was vaccinated with the Sinopharm vaccine when she was not, from December 2021 to January this year. The charge was amended on Wednesday to list the woman's full name as Mehrajunnisha Quaide Milath, and name an additional person, Milath Quaide, as part of the conspiracy. Quah is now accused of conspiring to defraud MOH by claiming that nine more people were vaccinated with the Sinopharm vaccine when they were not. Six of his charges also involve Chua. This includes the two charges where he is named as a co-conspirator with Koh and Chua. Quah and Chua allegedly conspired with David Christopher Newton, 43, to defraud MOH that he and a woman named Apinya Wonglangka were vaccinated with the Sinopharm vaccine when they were not. This allegedly took place between Dec 29, 2021 and Jan 15, court documents said. Newton was earlier charged over his alleged involvement in the false representation. According to court records, he will return to court for a pre-trial conference in August. The doctor and his assistant then allegedly engaged in another similar conspiracy to defraud MOH that a woman named Elizabeth Monica Paglar, a man named Stephen Columbus Sayson and another woman named Natalie Carmella Sayson were vaccinated when they were not on Jan 19. The charges that Quah faces alone are for conspiring with Ngo Soh Yong and Sim Hong Ow to make false representations to MOH that they were vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine when they were not, between Oct 16, 2021 and Nov 6, 2021. Deputy Public Prosecutor Etsuko Lim said it was likely that further charges would be made against Quah and Chua. She asked for a six-week adjournment for investigations to continue. Koh was represented by lawyer Mr Wee Pan Lee and Quah was represented by Mr Anand Nalachandran, while Chua was unrepresented. All three accused had their bail extended and will return to court on Sep 7. Quah has been suspended by the Singapore Medical Council for 18 months from Mar 23, or until the conclusion of his disciplinary proceedings. He was allegedly paid up to S$1,500 to inject patients with saline solution instead of a COVID-19 vaccine, and upload their false vaccination statuses to MOH's National Immunisation Registry, according to the council.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/china-wuhan-shut-businesses-transport-covid-19-cases-2838026,"China's Wuhan shuts some businesses, transport amid new COVID-19 cases","BEIJING: China's central metropolis of Wuhan temporarily shut some businesses and public transport in a district with almost a million people on Wednesday (Jul 27), as the city where the pandemic first emerged raised vigilance after several new infections. China, heavily invested in its ""dynamic COVID zero"" policy, relies on mass testing, quick restriction on business activity and people's movements and strict quarantine of cases to block nascent clusters from widening. The strategy has helped Wuhan and other areas in the country to keep the number of cases in check, but harsh lockdowns during major outbreaks and the fear of potential repeated curbs whenever new cases are reported have dented the economy, business confidence and people's willingness to travel. Wuhan's district of Jiangxia, with over 900,000 residents, said its main urban areas must enter a three-day restriction from Wednesday, during which it will ban many large group events and dining at restaurants, close various public entertainment venues, agricultural product marketplaces and small clinics and suspend bus and subway services. It also urged residents not to leave the area during the three days and encouraged travellers to avoid entry. The order came quickly after Jiangxia authorities said late on Tuesday they had detected two cases during regular testing drives and found another two from the screening of individuals who came in close contact with infection. China reported 703 new coronavirus cases for Jul 26, of which 120 were symptomatic and 583 were asymptomatic, the National Health Commission said on Wednesday. That compared with 976 new cases a day earlier - 148 symptomatic and 828 asymptomatic infections, which China counts separately. There were no new deaths, leaving the nation's fatalities at 5,226. As of July 26, mainland China had confirmed 229,066 cases with symptoms. China's capital Beijing reported no new local cases, the same as the previous day, the local government said. Shanghai reported two new local symptomatic cases, compared with four a day earlier, and 14 local asymptomatic case, versus 15 the previous day, local government data showed. One case in Shanghai was reported outside quarantined areas, compared with three a day before. The southern technology hub of Shenzhen reported four new local infections, compared with 19 a day earlier, one of which was symptomatic. All of the cases in Shenzhen were found in quarantined areas.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/china-struggle-impact-omicron-covid-inflation-economy-2836111,Commentary: China struggles to contain impact of Omicron and stabilise economy,"BEIJING: China’s gross domestic product growth rate has been falling since the first quarter of 2010. After more than 40 years of breathtaking growth, it is not surprising that China’s economy has lost some steam.  Having fallen steadily from 10.6 per cent in 2010 to 6 per cent in 2019, it remains to be seen whether China’s growth will continue to decline and at what level it will stabilise. Some in China argue that the decline in economic growth was an inevitability caused by long-term structural factors. Others argue that to avoid a financial crisis, China prioritised lowering its debt leverage ratio, even at the expense of growth.  But, while recognising the role played by structural problems, the continuous decline in China’s GDP growth rate is to a large extent attributable to China’s premature abandonment of expansionary fiscal and monetary policy due to the overblown fear of financial instability. The steady decline in the growth rate does not demonstrate the inevitability of China’s economic decline. It is actually a self-fulfilling prophecy. A lack of resolve to implement counter-cyclical policies will cause permanent damage to China’s growth potential — in turn weakening its financial stability. In the beginning of 2022, COVID-19 abated in China. The consensus is that China’s macroeconomic policy should aim to stabilise GDP growth.  For the first time in many years, the Chinese government set a GDP growth target of 5.5 per cent for 2022. The economy was off to a good start in the beginning of 2022, until the Omicron variant struck Shanghai in March. China’s consumer expenditure, measured by total retail sale of social goods, increased 6.7 per cent year on year in the first two months of 2022. But it declined by 11.1 per cent and 6.7 per cent in April and May. The growth of China’s fixed assets investment also slowed down significantly. The only comfort came from international trade. In May, the growth rate of exports was 16.9 per cent while that of imports was 4.1 per cent, implying that the growth rate of net exports was very high. But this growth pattern was neither sustainable nor desirable. In the first quarter of 2022, China registered a growth rate of 4.8 per cent year on year, which is rather disappointing. The GDP growth rate for the second quarter is an even more disappointing figure of 0.4 per cent. Compared with other economies, China’s inflation rate is still moderate. The consumer price index (CPI) rose just 2.1 per cent in May. China’s producer price index (PPI) in May is 6.4 per cent. Although this figure is still concerning, it has decreased by half from its peak in October 2021. The main challenge to China’s economic growth is recouping the loss in growth since March and achieving a growth rate not far off the 2022 target of 5.5 per cent. China has no choice but to use expansionary fiscal and monetary policy to stimulate the economy. Statistics just released show that this is just what the government is doing Given the weak consumption and investment demand and the difficulties that small- and medium-sized enterprises are facing, the Chinese government may need to adopt even more expansionary fiscal and monetary policy. But implementing this policy will involve a series of challenges. The implementation of expansionary fiscal and monetary policy is constrained by the pandemic and China’s strategy for combating COVID-19. Supply chain disruption cannot be solved by fiscal and monetary policy alone, no matter how expansionary.  The most acute challenge for China is how to balance COVID-19 pandemic control with economic growth. While the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) continues to loosen its monetary policy, the United States Federal Reserve is accelerating its monetary tightening. The narrowing of China-US benchmark interest rates has led to the increase in capital outflows and yuan depreciation despite China’s large current account surplus. Inflation could be a problem with China’s high PPI. But due to weak consumption and investment demand, PPI inflation has not yet translated to CPI inflation. Due to the Ukraine war and tightening sanctions on Russian oil and gas, energy and food prices might increase further. As the largest trading nation in the world, China’s manufacturing products are highly dependent on imported parts and components. Higher prices of intermediate products in the United States and other advanced countries will pass through into China’s price indexes. China is likely to partially regain its growth momentum. But when downward pressure on inflation created by weak aggregate demand is reduced, inflation in China might worsen quickly. China may need to learn to live with a higher inflation rate, because the top priority for the Chinese government is to bring an end to the gradual but steady decline of the GDP growth rate. Despite facing many pandemic-related setbacks in early 2022, China should be able to do better in the second half of 2022. Importantly, China’s long-term growth perspective is still bright."

They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review. An experimental chewing gum that ""traps"" SARS-CoV-2 particles in saliva holds promise for curbing transmission of new variants of the virus, according to new data, as researchers prepare to launch the first human trial. The gum contains copies of the ACE2 protein found on cell surfaces, which the coronavirus uses to break into cells and infect them. In test-tube experiments using saliva from individuals infected with the Delta or Omicron variants, the virus particles attached themselves to the ACE2 ""receptors"" in the chewing gum and the viral load fell to undetectable levels, researchers reported in Biomaterials. In the clinical trial, COVID-19 patients will each chew four ACE2 gum tablets each day for four days. The ""viral trap"" ACE2 proteins in the gum are carried within engineered lettuce cells. A second experimental chewing gum made with bean powder instead of lettuce cells not only traps SARS-CoV-2 particles in lab experiments but also influenza strains, other coronaviruses that cause common colds, and potentially other oral viruses such as human papillomavirus and herpesvirus, according to the paper. ""Because nasal transmission is negligible when compared to oral transmission ... chewing ACE2 gum and swallowing ACE2 protein should minimise infection, protect COVID-19 patients and prevent transmission,"" said research leader Dr. Henry Daniell of the School of Dental Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Add loss of hair and libido to the symptoms associated with long COVID, UK researchers warn. They compared nearly half a million people who recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infections before the middle of April 2021, without having been hospitalised, with nearly two million uninfected people of similar age, gender and health status. Overall, 62 persistent symptoms were significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection after 12 weeks, the researchers reported on Monday in Nature Medicine. Among the most common were shortness of breath, smell distortions, chest pain and fever, but the study also identified memory problems, inability to perform familiar movements or commands, bowel incontinence, erectile dysfunction, hallucinations, and limb swelling as being more common in people with long COVID. Compared to the uninfected group, those in the infected group were nearly four times more likely to report hair loss and more than twice as likely to report ejaculation difficulty or reduced libido. The odds of developing long COVID were higher in younger people, females, and racial minorities, the researchers found. ""This research validates what patients have been telling clinicians and policy makers throughout the pandemic, that the symptoms of long COVID are extremely broad and cannot be fully accounted for by other factors such as lifestyle risk factors or chronic health conditions,"" study leader Dr. Shamil Haroon of the University of Birmingham said in a statement. New technology for performing the gold-standard test for SARS-CoV-2 infection weighs just 2 pounds (0.9 kg) and gives results in 23 minutes rather than the usual 24 hours, according to researchers. PCR, or polymerase chain reaction, testing is rarely done at point-of-care settings like doctors' offices or pharmacies, because the traditional equipment is bulky and expensive and requires trained operators. PCR involves thermal cycling, a process of heating and cooling that creates the conditions necessary for identifying genetic material from the virus in the sample. The new prototype employs smaller optical components and a new way to heat the sample: so-called plasmonic thermocycling, which uses infrared radiation of metallic nanoparticles to generate heat from inside the vial instead of using standard heating methods from the outside. ""The method could rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA from human saliva and nasal specimens with 100 per cent sensitivity and 100 per cent specificity, as well as two distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants,"" the researchers reported on Monday in Nature Nanotechnology. The smaller, faster devices ""should really move the needle on delivering rapid and accurate molecular clinical diagnostics in decentralised settings,"" said study coauthor Mark Fasciano of biotech startup Rover Diagnostics, which is developing the technology in collaboration with researchers at Columbia University. ""Thermal cycling ... can now be sped up and clinicians and patients alike won't have to wait so long for results."""

Last week, Micronesia likely became the final nation in the world with a population of more than 100,000 to experience an outbreak of the disease, after avoiding it for 2 and a half years thanks to its geographic isolation and border controls. Health officials said cases were rapidly increasing. It reported 140 new cases on Monday, bringing the total to 1,261, a figure which includes some cases caught at the border before the outbreak. Eight people have been hospitalized and one older man has died, officials said. Many top lawmakers and senior officials have caught the disease, including Vice President Yosiwo George, who has been hospitalized, officials said. They said the vice president's condition was improving. Camille Movick, whose family owns Fusion Restaurant in Pohnpei State, told The Associated Press that a lot of people have been posting on Facebook asking, for instance, that others stay away from their homes. “Initially there was quite a bit of panic and worry with most people,” she said. She said her restaurant remained open although business was slow because many people were afraid to dine in. She said some other restaurants had closed their dining rooms and were only offering takeaway services. Movick said authorities had issued a directive that all people must wear masks in public — even outdoors — and that they faced fines of US$1,000 for noncompliance. She said one positive outcome was the outbreak had prompted many previously unvaccinated people to get their shots. She said many people suspected the virus might have been circulating before the first community case was confirmed last week because health authorities weren't routinely testing patients for the disease. Last year, Micronesia became one of the few countries to impose a broad mandate requiring all eligible citizens get vaccinated against the coronavirus. The government threatened to withhold federal funds from any individuals or business owners who didn’t follow the rules. Health officials said this week that 75 per cent of people aged 5 and over were fully vaccinated. Movick said many parts of society were continuing to function as before, including many people who were working from their offices. ""We're hoping things get back to normal soon,” Movick said. “Just like in other countries, over time, they’ve gotten over it, and lifted the restrictions.” "

Nearly 5,600 patients infected with COVID-19 are in hospital while 100 new deaths were reported, just short of a record 102 deaths on Saturday. Nearly 330,000 infections have been reported over the last seven days but authorities say the real numbers could be double that. ""It's time to come together again and fight - get vaccinated, use a mask in crowds and indoors, and stay home if you're sick,"" said the premier of hard-hit Queensland state, Annastacia Palaszczuk. The COVID-19 flare-up is being driven by the highly infectious BA.4/5 Omicron sub-variant, and it is putting severe pressure on hospitals and retirement homes. Queensland, battling its worst outbreak in the pandemic, expects its patient numbers to peak in around late August, modelling from the state's health department showed. Along with rising hospitalisations, many front-line workers are off sick or in isolation, worsening the crisis. Hospitals will add beds and shift more staff to front-line duties, Palaszczuk said. In Victoria state, more than 8 per cent of staff in the health sector, or about 10,000 employees, are off sick, Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters. Like many countries, Australia has ditched its toughest coronavirus precautions and has been living with the virus since early this year. Authorities are resisting the pressure to reinstate them, including calls from some doctors to make masks mandatory indoors. Instead, they have urged businesses to let staff work from home and recommended people get booster shots urgently. About 71 per cent of the eligible population have had boosters compared with 95 per cent who had two shots. In all, the country of nearly 26 million people has reported about 9.2 million COVID-19 cases and 11,300 deaths. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-ntu-team-awarded-us2-million-research-grant-2835626,NTU team awarded US$2 million research grant for COVID-19 drug development,"SINGAPORE: A US$2 million (S$2.8 million) research grant for the development of drugs that can help fend off pandemics has been awarded to a team of scientists led by the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKCMedicine) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). The competitive grant was awarded under a major research programme in the United States which is aiming to develop antiviral drugs to combat viruses that can cause pandemics, such as Sars-CoV-2 – which causes COVID-19 – dengue and Zika, NTU said in a statement on Tuesday (Jul 26). The research to be carried out by the NTU Singapore team is part of the efforts at the Midwest Antiviral Drug Discovery (AViDD) Center for Pathogens of Pandemic Concern based in the University of Minnesota to develop antiviral drugs with a grant by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in the US. ""The Midwest AViDD is one of nine new national centres newly established by the NIAID, part of the US National Institutes of Health, to conduct innovative, multidisciplinary research to develop candidate COVID-19 antivirals, especially those that can be taken in an outpatient setting, as well as antivirals targeting specific viral families with high potential to cause a pandemic in the future,"" said NTU.  The team is led by Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine associate professor of infection and immunity and provost’s chair in medicine Luo Dahai, a structural virology expert. Dr Liew Chong Wai from the NTU Institute of Structural Biology is also part of the team. “The Singapore team will leverage NTU’s state-of-the-art molecular and structural biology research platform and facility to identify new antiviral drug targets,” the university said. The AViDD team collaborating with the NTU scientists is led by Professor Reuben Harris, an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and professor and chair at the University of Texas Health San Antonio. The teams will work together “to develop small molecule drug candidates, with an aim to bring the most promising drug candidates to the clinical research stage”, NTU added. Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine dean and NTU senior vice president for health and life sciences Professor Joseph Sung said that the research will build on the university’s contributions to the fight against the coronavirus and other viruses. “NTU Singapore has been playing an important scientific role in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and other viral pathogens, with its LKCMedicine leading research projects in preclinical studies of antiviral drug discovery both in Singapore and internationally for viruses like the dengue and Zika viruses,” he said. “This latest grant award is an extension of NTU LKCMedicine’s contributions on this front, and I am confident that our scientists will do both the university and country proud in this global effort.” Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine vice dean for research Professor Lim Kah Leong said that the research done by the NTU team will help the world prepare for pandemics beyond COVID-19. “COVID-19 is a warning that we need to be prepared way ahead of future pandemics,” he said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/science-collaborate-us-china-eu-tech-security-concerns-spy-2833861,Commentary: Rising geopolitical tensions make it hard for scientists to tackle global problems,"LUND, Sweden: The United Nations and many researchers have emphasised the critical role international collaborative science plays in solving global challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss and pandemics. The rise of non-Western countries as science powers is helping to drive this type of global cooperative research. For example, Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa formed a tuberculosis research network in 2017 and are making significant advancements on basic and applied research into the disease. However, in the past few years, growing tensions among superpowers, increasing nationalism, the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine have contributed to nations’ behaving in more distrustful and insular ways overall. One result is that it is becoming increasingly difficult for researchers to collaborate with scholars in other nations. The near-global cessation of collaboration with Russian scholars following the invasion of Ukraine - in everything from humanities research to climate science in the Arctic - is one example of science being a victim of, and used as a tool for, international politics. Scientific collaboration between China and the United States is also breaking down in fields like microelectronics and quantum computing because of national security concerns on both sides. As a policy expert who studies international research collaboration as it relates to global problems and geopolitical polarisation, I understand the need for democratic countries to respond to the growing strength of authoritarian countries such as China and acute crises like the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But reducing or stopping international research comes with its own risks. It slows down the production of knowledge needed to address long-term global problems and reduces the potential for future scientific collaboration. Since the 1990s and the collapse of the Soviet Union, global collaboration in science has increased dramatically. There are several reasons for this development. First, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 led to an increased openness in global scientific exchange. In particular, there was growth in the number of students from developing and non-Western countries going to universities in the West. This movement formed networks of researchers from many countries. Second, massively collaborative scientific efforts – such as the Human Genome Project – as well as the ever-growing importance of expensive, large research laboratories and instruments have fuelled international collaboration. Finally, the digital revolution has made it much easier to communicate and share data across borders. This all resulted in collaborative and fruitful research in many fields including gene technology, climate science and artificial intelligence. While Western countries dominated the scientific landscape of the 20th century, globalisation has benefited many non-Western countries. In the latter half of the 20th century, China, India, Russia, Turkey, Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and many other nations all significantly improved their scientific capabilities. In doing so they have greatly contributed to human knowledge. China in particular has invested heavily in its scientific capabilities and today is the world’s largest producer of scientific publications. The development of scientific capacity in many parts of the world and the building of academic ties is critical when it comes to responding to a new virus or tracking changes in climate. The more countries that share data and coordinate policy responses, the easier it should be to contain a virus or understand global warming. Generally speaking, there are three global superpowers competing for scientific and technological leadership today: The US, China and the European Union. The US government and the European Union frame the loss of scientific and technological leadership as not only about diminished economic opportunities, but also as a threat to fundamental values of democracy, free market competition and rule of law. In May, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said: “China is the only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it. Beijing’s vision would move us away from the universal values that have sustained so much of the world’s progress over the past 75 years.” China’s rise in science and technology has been met with stern responses from the West. Australia passed legislation in 2020 that gave the federal government veto power over foreign agreements in research. In the US, the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 was designed to reduce dependence on China for emerging and foundational technologies. Given this framing of research as a part of international competition between China and the West, it is not surprising that science is increasingly being used as a political tool. The US government has taken significant steps to try to limit China’s scientific progress and international influence. In 2018, the US launched a large-scale anti-espionage effort called the China Initiative. Under this initiative, the FBI broadly investigated US-Chinese links within the corporate and academic sectors. The China Initiative failed to find any Chinese spies. But three US-based scholars were convicted for failing to disclose Chinese ties. The China Initiative has faced heavy criticism from researchers, university leaders and civil rights organisations because of claims of ethnic profiling. The Biden administration officially cancelled the initiative in February. But efforts to curtail China’s science and technology industries through trade sanctions on companies like Huawei restrict American companies from doing business with Chinese tech firms. The China Initiative and sanctions have also made researchers on both sides wary of collaboration. The European Union has taken a similar stance. It calls China simultaneously a partner, competitor and systemic rival. The EU has outlined goals of increasing European scientific and technological autonomy to reduce reliance on other countries, especially China, and started to implement the strategy in 2021. China is also using science, technology and scholarly research generally to serve national interests. The government has explicitly pushed the idea that research shall primarily serve national needs, and Chinese scholars are increasingly under political control. In 2021 there were 18 research centers devoted to studying and promoting Xi Jinping’s ideas on matters such as rule of law, economics and green development. Many researchers in the US, Europe and China have voiced concerns that geopolitical rivalries are curtailing international research collaboration at a time when the world needs it the most. There is a major risk that the impediments to international scientific collaboration will further increase, further harming data sharing, the quality of research and the ability to disseminate results that contributing to solving problems. I often hear researchers, university leaders and funding agencies in Europe, the US and China vent their frustration with the current situation. Many in the research community would like to see a more open and global science landscape. It is possible to work toward a future where science is more separate – but not naively isolated – from changing power dynamics. As issues like climate change increase in severity, it will become only more important that researchers build international relationships that are responsible, reciprocal, transparent and equitable.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/ukraine-war-news-fatigue-lose-support-covid-19-2833921,"Commentary: Are we tired of hearing about Ukraine, like we were with COVID-19?","SINGAPORE: Last Monday (Jul 18), Ukraine officials reported six deaths from Russian shelling in the Donbas. On Jul 14, at least 23 people were killed in Vinnytsia. Days earlier, more than 30 were killed after a rocket hit an apartment block in eastern Ukraine. Five months after Russia started its invasion, attacks and counterattacks rage on but perhaps many of us now give no more than a cursory glance at the headlines. The war dominated headlines initially – and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy became a household name – but public discussion seems to have quietened down. During the G7 Summit in June, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned about “fatigue” among Western nations in rallying support for Ukraine. This may also be the case with public attention. It’s a realistic concern when there seems to be no end in sight and matters like inflation, energy supplies and food prices fight for our attention. The worry is that decreased attention may bring down public and political support to end the war. Social scientists call this “news fatigue” - when we tire of hearing about a particular topic or issue. Studies have found that news fatigue may cause some to actively avoid the news, and this avoidance may impact one’s knowledge, attitude and behaviour toward certain issues. We don’t have to look far back for an example. In our published study, 19.3 per cent of adult respondents in Singapore reported feeling “tired of hearing about COVID-19” in March 2020,  barely two months after the first imported case was reported in Singapore. This increased to 26 per cent just a month later, when we asked the same respondents the same question in April 2020. What factors increase news fatigue? First, there is information overload—when we are exposed to far too much information than we can thoughtfully process.  At the start, news outlets around the world devoted space and time to report on it. Social media teemed with posts about the war; organisations called for donations; and some companies announced a halt to operations or engagements with Russia.  It exposed the public to information that, at some point, may have been too much for some to think about and process. Indeed, in our COVID-19 information overload study, respondents who experienced high information overload also tend to report higher levels of news fatigue. Second, misinformation, propaganda and counterpropaganda about the invasion have also spread online. These inaccurate and even manufactured claims added to the confusion, which may have also contributed to the feeling of news fatigue among some people. Of course, information sources play a role here. Decreased public attention may lead traditional media and social media influencers to lessen their coverage, which contributes to keeping the war out of public consciousness in an unfortunate cycle. Updates on Ukraine may be overtaken by more recent newsworthy events that home audiences are interested in – domestic politics, costs of living, even record-breaking heatwaves. It becomes a question of how news outlets prioritise space and resources. This presents an interesting situation: News outlets used to almost exclusively exercise an agenda-setting power. They can influence the issues the public thinks about and considers to be important.  However, with online and social media platforms, individuals can now choose where and when to get information, as well as influence topics of interest for media coverage and discussions online and offline.  Zelenskyy, likely attuned to this, has been active online since day one, to help keep Ukraine’s plight in the media and the public agenda.  Many may remember his viral video defiantly declaring “we are here” on the streets of Kyiv to debunk claims he had fled the country. Many videos followed, showing him in his now-signature military colours with world leaders and casualties. Zelenskyy and his team behind Ukraine’s official social media accounts have taken it upon themselves to prevent the war from fading from public consciousness. They showcase war posters, provide updates on Russian military losses and deftly use memes to advance their narrative.  To keep up coverage in mainstream media, Zelenskyy has addressed many governments, global leader summits, even the Grammy Awards and the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference held in Singapore.  Each time, his message is tailored to his audience. He echoed Winston Churchill when addressing the UK parliament; to the United States Congress, he invoked September 11. At the Shangri-La Dialogue, he quoted Mr Lee Kuan Yew and wore a T-shirt designed by a Singaporean teenager. He has welcomed Hollywood celebrities, from Sean Penn to Ben Stiller, who is a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. But even with his best efforts, our attention span is fleeting. We tend to get drawn to what is new or unusual. Lingering issues – the Ukraine invasion, the pandemic – drop from view unless there’s a major development. But we cannot close our eyes to what is happening. So, in the face of news fatigue, how can we sustain public attention and interest? First, we need to remind ourselves of why this is important and how it affects not just Russia and Ukraine, but the rest of the world. It must be personally relevant— from how we’ve felt the war’s impact on gas prices and supply chains to Singapore’s interest in upholding international law.  Second, we don’t like feeling helpless so we are drawn to messages about what we can do. Those posting about the ongoing invasion can include information that readers can act on, such as supporting humanitarian efforts like the Singapore Red Cross’ response. Third, we must be aware of what makes us experience news fatigue. Maybe we’ve signed up for a Telegram group that spams us with unvetted information? Maybe we’re spending more time on social media than usual, overwhelming us with information?  Taking short breaks from these continuous streams of messages may help us refocus our attention to what matters. But taking a break doesn’t mean forgetting. We must be selective and proactive in seeking out legitimate and authoritative sources on important issues, even if algorithms, influencers or news outlets have already shifted their focus, and not just get information from sources that echo our personal biases. In a period when we have more control of our own information diets, we must also exercise the responsibility of ensuring we do not lose sight of what matters.  Public memory tends to be short. But it shouldn’t be, or else societies continue repeating the same mistakes.

In a statement in response to media queries about the recent deaths of two children due to COVID-19, MOH said it is currently doing the necessary preparations to roll out the vaccines. MOH, the Health Sciences Authority and the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination said on Jul 19 they are studying the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines that have been formulated for young children under the age of five. On the issue of paediatric deaths, MOH said the pattern of COVID-19 fatalities - two deaths of children aged between 0 and 4 years old as of Jul 23, 2022 - was similar to that of other infectious diseases. ""(The two deaths) translates to three deaths per 100,000 cases in the same age group, compared to 99 deaths per 100,000 cases for the 40 and above age group this year"", said MOH. ""This is not unique to COVID-19 as we see such patterns in other infectious diseases, where children 0 to four are much more resilient than older patients, but more vulnerable compared to older children and young adults.""  The ministry added: ""Children 0-4 have also fallen victim to other diseases such as pneumonia and influenza. Before COVID-19, in 2018 and 2019, MOH recorded 3.1 deaths of children 0-4 years old per 100,000 person-years from pneumonia and influenza."" The ministry said that of the 1.7 million COVID-19 infections reported in Singapore since the start of the pandemic, 64,000 (3.9 per cent) were of children under five years old. A large majority of the 64,000 cases recover “uneventfully” at home, with 0.022 per cent requiring oxygen supplementation or intensive care unit (ICU) care, said MOH. In comparison, 0.17 per cent of patients in the 40 and above age group require ICU care. MOH also said there is currently “no clear evidence” that Omicron variants cause more severe disease. Severe cases among those aged 0 to four have been lower at 12 per 100,000 cases in 2022 compared to 41 per 100,000 cases in 2021, it added. On Jun 27, Singapore reported its first COVID-19 death of a child under 12. A one-and-a-half-year-old Singaporean boy died from encephalitis due to COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus and enterovirus infections.  He had no other past medical history and was previously well, said MOH last month. Last week, a four-year-old Singaporean girl died of the coronavirus. The cause of death was determined by the state coroner to be COVID-19 pneumonia, MOH had said. Currently, children aged five and above are eligible for the primary vaccination series. Those aged 12 and above who have completed their primary vaccination series are eligible for the first booster shot. Singapore reported 6,175 COVID-19 cases on Sunday, of which 5,950 were locally transmitted infections. As of Saturday, 96 per cent of Singapore's eligible population have completed their full vaccination regimen under the national vaccination programme. A total of 1,659,156 COVID-19 cases and 1,476 deaths have been recorded since the start of the pandemic. "

""With regards to issues of health, there is still the threat of COVID-19, especially with the discovery of new variants of the coronavirus,"" Marcos said in his first State of the Nation address. ""But we cannot afford to have another lockdown. We will no longer have lockdowns."" Marcos said that the country must balance the welfare and health of the people with the economy. He added that government agencies are cooperating with hospitals to monitor the number of COVID-19 cases to ensure that the healthcare system does not get overwhelmed. The president also announced that full face-to-face classes will soon return for all students. Classes in the Philippines have been mostly conducted online since the start of the pandemic. ""The Department of Education is now preparing for its implementation in the upcoming school year, with the utmost consideration for the safety of students as we are still in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" he said. ""We must ensure that our classrooms are safe for teachers, for students and the entire academic community when they return to face-to-face classes."" Beyond the issues brought about by COVID-19, the need for a stronger healthcare system is also evident, he said.  ""We must bring medical services to the people and not wait for them to come to the hospitals and healthcare centres,"" he said. ""We have utilised the big specialist hospitals like the Heart Centre, the Lung Centre, the Children's Hospital and the National Kidney and Transplant Institute. ""That's why it's clear that such institutions must not only be here, in the capital, but also in other parts of the country. It's clear that it is not only here in the capital that we must increase such healthcare facilities."" Healthcare services will also be deployed to hard-to-reach places a few times per week, so that people will no longer need to travel to town or regional centres to seek medical help, he added. Marcos also pledged to improve working conditions for doctors and nurses. In his speech, Marcos also promised to overhaul his country's tax system and make it a destination for investment and tourism, promising also a big agriculture overhaul to boost output and reduce its heavy import reliance. He said it was vital to implement reforms to bring in tourism and investment and maintain what was currently firm growth momentum. He said the country is targeting 6.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent gross domestic product growth this year, and that growth momentum remained firm but the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic was still ongoing. The government will put in place tax administration reforms to increase revenue collection, as well as to realign expenditure priorities and improve spending efficiency to ""immediately address the economic scarring of the COVID-19 pandemic"", said the president. He added that it was critical that the Philippines, a major importer of rice and other commodities, can boost its farm output and become more resilient to climate change. Among the measures he would introduce was a moratorium on farmers' debts to allow them to channel resources into improving output. ""It will unburden farmers of their dues and be able to focus on improving farm productivity,"" he said, while stressing the need for an ""infusion of fresh and new blood"" and the use of scientific farming by a new breed of farmers. Financial assistance to farmers and fishermen will be the ""hallmark of his administration"", Marcos said. He also promised to improve education, healthcare and working conditions for doctors and nurses and boost infrastructure, including modernising airports. More than 20,000 policemen, anti-riot contingents and troops were deployed to secure Marcos' address, which was held before a joint Congress session at the House of Representatives. About 5,000 protesters also marched along a key road away from Congress, demanding a government aid and fuel subsidy amid the soaring cost of living, as well as justice for human rights victims under Marcos Jr's father, who was ousted in 1986."

While Reuters could not independently verify the document, a notice at a Shenzhen office of oil giant CNOOC seen by Reuters said that the building would be closed for seven days until Jul 31, with staff to work from home and continue with daily COVID-19 testing. A CNOOC spokesperson did not have an immediate comment. The Shenzhen government did not respond to a request for comment. Taiwan-based Foxconn said that operations at its Shenzhen facilities were ""normal"" and that it would follow government guidelines to ensure safe production. The order attributed to Shenzhen's department for industry and information said that major companies, including BYD, Huawei Technologies, and ZTE, should minimise entry and exit into the so-called loops. Huawei did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while BYD, ZTE and Shenzhen-based dronemaker DJI Technology declined to comment. Bloomberg reported on Shenzhen's measure earlier on Monday. During its lockdown in April and May, the Chinese economic hub of Shanghai tried to keep factories open under ""closed loop"" operations, where staff live and work on-site, but businesses said the arrangements posed numerous difficulties. A technology hub of nearly 18 million people, Shenzhen reported 21 new locally transmitted COVID-19 infections on Sunday, up from 19 a day earlier. While case numbers are low by global standards, a slow uptick over the last week has pushed local authorities to step up vigilance to comply with the central government’s “dynamic zero” policy of containing outbreaks as soon as they emerge. Shenzhen has not ordered blanket closure of businesses or tough curbs on people’s movements but has sealed residential compounds and buildings identified as being at higher risk. Many offices, restaurants and public spaces required proof of a COVID-19 test from within 24-hours as of Monday. During an outbreak in March, Shenzhen adopted one week of so-called ""slow living"", when residents underwent multiple rounds of testing and largely stayed at home, with one member of each household allowed out every few days to buy necessities.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/record-number-covid-19-australians-hospital-omicron-surges-2833371,Record number of COVID-19 hit Australians in hospital as Omicron surges,"SYDNEY: The number of Australians admitted to hospitals with COVID-19 hit a record of about 5,450 on Monday (Jul 25), official data showed, as the spread of highly contagious new Omicron sub-variants strains the healthcare system nationwide. The figure has grown since late June, as the BA.4 and BA.5 strains became dominant since they can evade immune protection, whether from vaccination or prior infection, while some experts say the latter can be as infectious as measles. The number of those in hospitals is the highest since the emergence of the coronavirus, exceeding January's high of 5,390 during the first wave of Omicron infections. Daily death tolls have also risen, topping 100 on Saturday for the first time. More than 1,000 retirement homes have suffered outbreaks, the government said, as the elderly are largely affected. With several aged care centres battling a shortage of staff, the support of defence personnel in such facilities is to be extended until the end of September, Defence Minister Richard Marles said. ""It is an extreme measure and it's right to describe it as that,"" he told ABC television. ""Given the number of outbreaks that we've got right now, this is the right thing to do."" Many frontline workers in hospitals are also sick or in isolation, worsening the healthcare crisis. During a harsh winter with both COVID-19 and the flu virus circulating, authorities have recommended the use of masks indoors and urgent booster doses of vaccine, while telling businesses to allow work from home. Australia, one of the countries most heavily vaccinated against COVID-19, has given two doses to about 95 per cent of those older than 16, although just about 71 per cent have had booster shots. Still, its tally of about 9.13 million infections and 11,181 deaths was lower than many developed economies. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/centaurus-omicron-subvariant-new-ba275-2832146,"Commentary: No cause for alarm over ‘Centaurus’, the new Omicron subvariant BA.2.75","CAMBRIDGE: A new COVID-19 variant has recently been detected in several countries including the United Kingdom, United States, India, Australia and Germany. Called BA.2.75, it’s a subvariant of Omicron. You might have also heard it called “Centaurus”, the name of a constellation and given to BA.2.75 by a Twitter user. The World Health Organization has classified BA.2.75 as a variant of interest, rather than a variant of concern. This means it’s being monitored but there’s not yet evidence it will cause problems. The numbers of BA.2.75 infections are still relatively low. Most infections in the UK remain driven by the Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5. BA.5 in particular is similarly dominant in other countries where BA.2.75 has been detected. However, BA.2.75 is becoming more common in India (where it was first detected, back in May), suggesting it has advantages relative to current circulating variants. Some have noted that BA.2.75 is spreading in regions of India where it doesn’t have to compete with BA.5, but rather with the variant it evolved from, BA.2. That said, some data from India indicates that BA.2.75 may have already peaked. And importantly, there hasn’t been a big increase in hospitalisations or deaths in India from BA.2.75. Given this, BA.2.75 has quickly gained an additional nickname: a “scariant”. As most of the global population has now either been vaccinated, infected, or both, variants which can infect people despite their immunity will have an advantage. So SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is constantly evolving to gain this advantage. New variants which have mutations that evade our immunity will replicate and spread, leading to waves of infections. We’ve seen this most recently with BA.4 and BA.5. The memory immune system recognises infections based on molecular structures of viruses and other pathogens. Mutations change the molecular structure of each SARS-CoV-2 variant slightly, making it more difficult for our immune system to recognise and respond to the virus. This is often called immune evasion. Is the BA.2.75 subvariant of Omicron more transmissible?  Do existing COVID-19 vaccines protect against it? Here's what you need to know about the new subvariant, popularly known as 'Centaurus', and the concerns surrounding it. The concern around BA.2.75 is that is has picked up a number of mutations, which might indicate that this variant can evade immunity. But there’s no good evidence at this stage that BA.2.75 can evade the immune system in a significant way. Most of BA.2.75 is structurally the same as Omicron and the original Wuhan variant. Although BA.2.75 has picked up a few mutations, it isn’t fundamentally a different virus. The memory immune system will still act against BA.2.75, which is what we’ve seen with Omicron. This immunity might not be enough to stop reinfection, but should reduce the severity of a BA.2.75 infection. While there are concerns BA.2.75 could spread more quickly than other variants, we don’t have any clear evidence on this yet. It seems to have shown an increase which has levelled off or even dropped relative to a few weeks ago. If this is the case there’s a chance it might even fizzle out in another few weeks. But, if BA.2.75 does have some immune evasion properties, it could cause another wave through the UK and elsewhere. Still, this would likely spike and then fizzle out like Alpha, Delta and Omicron BA.1. Thanks to vaccination, if we did face a BA.2.75 wave, we wouldn’t expect the level of deaths and hospitalisations seen earlier in the pandemic. But we know large numbers of cases can still cause significant disruption.  And importantly, the constant wave of new variants is still a deadly threat to people who are vulnerable. So how do we overcome this? One solution could be universal COVID-19 vaccines, which would work against any COVID-19 variants. The aim of a universal vaccine is to induce immunity against a very wide range of molecular structures. It’s akin to fishing with a wider net, making it harder for the fish to swim out of the way. A pan-coronavirus vaccine is a similar concept but would likely try to induce immunity against the molecular structures common to all coronaviruses. As well providing immunity against new SARS-CoV-2 variants, a pan-coronavirus vaccine might also confer immunity against the next coronavirus pandemic. Some of these vaccines look set to move into clinical trials in the next few years. A second solution may be to produce vaccines which induce better immunity in the respiratory system. These largely involve vaccines given through your nose, training the immune system to make more antibodies in the mucus of the nose and throat. This type of immunity might help stop SARS-CoV-2 infecting and replicating at the point of entry into our cells, which could slow down the rate at which new variants have the opportunity to emerge. At least 12 of these intranasal vaccines are in clinical trials. Right now, I would put my money on BA.2.75 fizzling out without a major wave of infections. But the next omicron subvariant, and the next pandemic, will inevitably come. New vaccine approaches might make us better prepared.

Biden's cough and body aches have diminished since he tested positive for the coronavirus on Thursday and he is not experiencing any shortness of breath, the physician, Dr Kevin O'Connor, said in a memo released by the White House. ""His symptoms continue to improve significantly. His predominant symptom now is sore throat. This is most likely a result of lymphoid activation as his body clears the virus, and is thus encouraging,"" O'Connor said. Biden's pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate and temperature all were normal. ""His voice remains a bit deep,"" O'Connor said. Earlier on Sunday, White House COVID-19 coordinator Ashish Jha said in interviews on Fox News Sunday and ABC's This Week that none of Biden's 17 identified close contacts had so far tested positive for the coronavirus. Biden, 79, has had mild symptoms since his diagnosis, which came as a highly contagious subvariant of the coronavirus drives a new wave of cases in the United States. On Saturday, O'Connor said genomic sequencing found that subvariant, known as BA.5, was likely the cause of Biden's illness. Jha told CBS's Face the Nation on Sunday that Biden had an upper respiratory infection. The White House has sought to underscore Biden's ability to work through his illness. On Thursday, it released a video of him reassuring Americans he was doing fine, and on Friday he participated in virtual meetings with White House staff. The president had no public events over the weekend, and travel plans for the early part of this week have been cancelled. Biden's diagnosis came as political and economic challenges confront his presidency, with his policy agenda under threat on Capitol Hill and high inflation hurting his approval rating with voters, who will decide at polls in November whether Republicans or Democrats control Congress. Biden's Democrats currently have a slim majority in the House of Representatives and control the evenly divided Senate through Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote.  "

Shanghai lifted a two-month lockdown in June but has registered double-digit daily cases in recent weeks. Officials rely on repeated mass testing rounds to identify infections they quickly quarantine to prevent further spread, in line with China's ""dynamic zero"" strategy that demands each flare-up be contained as quickly as possible. The fresh testing drive, during which residents in the districts must go through two COVID-19 tests over the three-day period, came after several similar ones earlier this month. Citywide, residents have to get tested at least once a week to maintain access to public venues and transports. China reported 982 new COVID-19 cases for Jul 23, of which 129 were symptomatic and 853 were asymptomatic, the National Health Commission said on Sunday.

""China's state and Party leaders have all been vaccinated against COVID-19 with domestically made shots,"" said Zeng Yixin, deputy head of the National Health Commission. In China, ""state and Party leaders"" is a specific category of top officials at the national and deputy national level that would include President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang. Zeng's comment, which did not specify when officials received the jab and how many doses they have received, came about two years after the country launched its COVID-19 vaccination drive. China lags behind many other countries in informing its public about the vaccination status of their leaders. Experts and officials have warned that the lower vaccination rate for the elderly group would likely squeeze health resources if the virus spreads widely, and render China less ready to emerge from its strict ""dynamic COVID zero"" policy that demands strict quarantine requirement for international travellers and various curbs on people's movement and local businesses in domestic areas with clusters. The country has achieved a 89.7 per cent vaccination rate and given about 56 per cent of its 1.41 billion population a booster dose, but only 61 per cent of those aged above 80 have finished their primary vaccination. However, more aggressive pushes by frontline officials, including limiting access of the unvaccinated to public venues, triggered online backlash and were quickly reversed. A major concern among the unvaccinated is the safety of shots being used in China, with anecdotes of post-vaccination severe disease stirring fear online and criticism over the lack of transparency of the government and Chinese vaccine makers. ""COVID-19 vaccines do not cause leukemia or diabetes, nor do they affect genetic development, cause tumor metastasis or antibody-dependent enhancement, and those are irresponsible, false information on the Internet,"" said Wang Fusheng, an infectious disease expert at a hospital affiliated with the Chinese military. The rate of hospitalisation for diabetes and leukemia were similar during 2018-2022, Wang told a news conference. For those aged over 60, the complete primary vaccination using Chinese shots cut the risk of progressing to severe disease by 89 per cent, while a booster dose further lowered the risk to 95 per cent, compared with the unvaccinated, said Feng Zijian, an official at Chinese preventive Medicine Association. Feng said the result came from data analysis by Chinese disease control authority over Omicron infections found in mainland China mainly during March-June, without providing detailed readings. The most used Chinese shots were made by Sinovac and Sinopharm. The country has yet to approve foreign-made COVID-19 products. "

The six cases were detected through whole genome sequencing as part of MOH’s surveillance of the COVID-19 situation. MOH added that the BA.2.75 subvariant is currently not on the World Health Organization’s list of variants of concern or interest. Singapore reported its first two imported cases of the variant last week. Both individuals had recently travelled to India and had immediately self-isolated after testing positive for COVID-19, said MOH last Thursday, adding that the two cases had since fully recovered. The BA.2.75 subvariant, nicknamed Centaurus, was first detected in India in early May. A sub-lineage strain of Omicron subvariant BA.2, the subvariant was responsible for triggering outbreaks in places including the United States and Hong Kong earlier this year. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control designated the BA.2.75 variant as a ""variant under monitoring"" on Jul 7. This means there is some indication that it could be more transmissible or associated with more severe disease, but the evidence is weak or has not yet been assessed. Singapore reported 8,983 new COVID-19 cases as of noon on Friday, comprising 8,635 local infections and 348 imported cases.

Only seniors aged 80 and above can continue to walk in to receive their vaccinations at the polyclinics, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Friday (Jul 22). Over the past two weeks, daily average cases of ARI, from both COVID-19 and other infections, have increased significantly at polyclinics, said the ministry. ""To preserve our polyclinics’ capacity for patients with pressing healthcare needs, individuals who wish to receive their COVID-19 vaccinations at the polyclinics will now have to book an appointment,"" it added. Eligible individuals may also visit any of the 10 Joint Testing and Vaccination Centres (JTVCs) located across Singapore for their vaccinations. Appointments are not needed at these centres, said MOH. Public hospitals are also seeing more patients recently amid a COVID-19 wave driven by Omicron variants. Over the past two weeks, adult emergency departments at public hospitals handled about 2,500 patients a day on average, compared to the usual average load of about 2,000 daily, MOH said. Across the children’s emergency departments at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital and the National University Hospital, there were on average about 680 patients a day over the last two weeks, up from the usual average load of about 450 a day. Of these emergency department cases, about 40 per cent did not require emergency care, said MOH. ""Such cases at the emergency departments divert medical care away from patients who genuinely require emergency medical attention,"" the ministry added. ""As such, we would like to remind the public to only seek medical treatment at hospital emergency departments for serious or life-threatening emergencies, such as chest pain, breathlessness and uncontrollable bleeding. ""This allows those with severe illness in need of emergency care to be attended to quickly and helps to preserve our hospital capacity for those who truly need acute hospital care."" The ministry acknowledged that higher loads and longer wait times at the emergency departments and polyclinics may frustrate some patients and families, but reminded members of the public to treat healthcare workers with respect and not to harass or abuse them. ""Our healthcare workers continue to work very hard to ensure that patients receive the medical care they need,"" said MOH.  MOH also announced that the Novavax/Nuvaxovid vaccine will be offered at Jurong Polyclinic and Yishun Polyclinic from Aug 12. The two polyclinics currently offer Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccinations to people looking to get their second dose or booster shot, and will continue to do so until Aug 5. Eligible individuals who wish to receive the Novavax/Nuvaxovid vaccine may also continue to do so at the JTVC in Bishan as well as 20 Public Health Preparedness Clinics.

Deaths from the virus reached 151 in the seven days to Jul 16, compared with 115 in the worst week of the previous wave, in March, according to Health Ministry data. In the latest 24 hours, 26 people died from COVID-19, all aged over 60, the ministry said in a statement on Friday (Jul 22). The Omicron BA.5 sub-variant is driving the current wave in New Zealand, which has 5.1 million people. There have been 64,780 active cases in the past seven days, although authorities say many infections are unreported. Once regarded as a model for preventing COVID-19 infection, New Zealand's swift response to the pandemic and its geographic isolation kept it largely free from the virus until the end of last year. The government dropped its zero-COVID policy this year once the population was largely vaccinated. Since then the virus has been allowed to spread. Emergency departments, general practices and medical centres are under pressure. However, Health Ministry data shows hospitalisation levels remain below those seen during the March peak. The government is resisting pressure from some doctors to reinstate curbs on public gatherings or mandate the wearing of masks at schools. However, Education Ministry chief Iona Holsted said on Thursday the ministry had advised schools to enforce the wearing of masks as much as practicable when children returned from holidays next week. ""We understand that implementing mask policies can be a challenge but ask that you take action to strengthen your mask wearing policy as soon as possible,"" she said. "

First detected in India in May, the subvariant has since spread to countries in Asia, Europe, North America and Australia. Singapore reported its first two imported cases of the variant last Thursday (Jul 14). In a tweet last month, a virologist at Imperial College London said the subvariant was worth keeping a “close eye” on, due to its number of spike mutations, apparent rapid growth and wide geographical spread. But while the variant appears to be spreading quickly, scientists have said it is still too soon to know for certain if BA.2.75 is really better at evading immunity from vaccines and prior infection. Here’s what we know about the new subvariant so far: BA.2.75 is a sub-lineage strain of Omicron subvariant BA.2, which was responsible for triggering outbreaks in places including the US and Hong Kong earlier this year. If it sounds complicated, think of a tree. COVID-19 is the trunk of the tree and one of the branches is Omicron. From the Omicron branch, there are a few branches including the BA.2 subvariant. BA.2.75 branches out from BA.2. The subvariant has been nicknamed “Centaurus” but this is not its official name. It is believed to have stemmed from a Twitter user, who often uses his account to share news about COVID-19. The nickname is a reference to a galaxy which is also the name of the father of centaurs in Greek mythology. The WHO has not designated BA.2.75 its own name, similar to its treatment of other subvariants such as BA.4 and BA.5. Despite this, the nickname appears to be sticking, with media outlets around the world using it interchangeably with BA.2.75. BA.2.75 has been spreading quickly since it was detected in India, with reports saying that the subvariant is competing with the more prominent BA.5 as the dominant strain. Cases have been reported in at least 10 other countries, including the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, Germany and Canada. The two imported cases reported in Singapore caught the virus after travelling to India. Both immediately self-isolated after testing positive for COVID-19 and have since recovered, the Ministry of Health said. While there are some indications that BA.2.75 could be more transmissible or associated with more severe disease compared to its Omicron predecessors, the evidence is weak or has not been assessed yet. As such, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control designated the BA.2.75 variant as a ""variant under monitoring"" on Jul 7. According to statistics provided by the GISAID database and A*STAR, BA.2.75 has a total of nine new mutations to its spike protein compared to its parent BA.2. This refers to the part of the virus that attaches to receptors on human cells. “Although there are a few more spike changes compared to the current dominant and other variants, they are still from the same lineage family,” said Dr Sebastian Maurer-Stroh, executive director of A*STAR’s Bioinformatics Institute.  “Appearance of new lineages with this amount of mutations are expected as the virus adapts to evade immune responses.” In a tweet last month, the Bloom Lab at the Fred Hutch research institute said the variant was worth tracking due to “appreciable antigenic change” compared to its parent, BA.2. In particular, it flagged two mutations - G446S and R493Q.  The former has the potential to help the virus escape from antibodies elicited by current vaccines that still are effective against BA.2 while the latter, R493Q, seems to increase the viruses’ ability to attach to human cells. “If (the mutations) make the (spike protein) stickier, then that would mean you need less virus to cause an infection, which makes it more transmissible,” said Professor Dale Fisher, a senior consultant at the National University Hospital’s Division of Infectious Diseases. Based on figures from the Worldometer website, infectious diseases expert Paul Tambyah observed that the subvariant did not have much of an impact on the number of cases and deaths in India. “There is no indication based on the data out of India (which has the capacity to test as evidenced by their reporting of the earlier delta and omicron waves) to suggest significantly increased transmissibility although that is what one would expect at this stage of the pandemic,” said Prof Tambyah in an email interview with CNA. Drawing parallels to the 1918 Spanish flu, which slowly mutated into the most common form of seasonal influenza from 1920 to 1957, he said: “Although the two viruses are from different families, it is about the time for the SARS CoV2 to have adapted to be very highly transmissible and much less virulent.” With current vaccines and boosters mainly based on the original strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that emerged in Wuhan in late 2019, there is a concern that the large number of mutations to the new variant’s spike protein could help it to break through immune system defences and infect more people. Despite this, experts say vaccines still offer strong protection against severe COVID-19 and death. “We need to firstly monitor this new sublineage to see if it is going to have an advantage and see if it does become more dominant in terms of the number of cases and one of the explanations for that could be escaping immunity,” said Prof Fisher. “We saw BA.4 and BA.5 escape and become more infectious because it could resist some of the immune response but ... it only caused more cases, it didn't cause more severe disease,” he added. Prof Tambyah said some kind of “hybrid immunity”, which involves getting vaccinated and then getting a mild infection, would also provide the best long-term protection. “BA.2.75 is also derived from BA.2 so it is possible that prior infection may continue to provide hybrid immunity. The reality is that these viruses are very hard to avoid,” he said. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/us-president-joe-biden-says-he-doing-great-after-positive-covid-19-test-2826931,US President Joe Biden says he is 'doing great' after positive COVID-19 test,"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden said on Thursday (Jul 21) he was ""doing great"" after testing positive for COVID-19 at the age of 79, vowing to continue to work while isolating at the White House with only mild symptoms. Biden's personal physician Kevin O'Connor wrote in an official note that the US president was experiencing fatigue, a runny nose and an occasional dry cough, starting on Wednesday evening. In a series of posts crafted to show he remains at the country's helm, Biden tweeted a picture of himself working at his desk saying ""I am doing great"", and a short video clip filmed on a White House balcony. ""Hey folks, I guess you heard this morning I tested positive for COVID,"" said the president, wearing a blazer, no tie and the hint of a smile. ""Symptoms are mild, I really appreciate all your inquiries and concern ... it's going to be OK."" Announcing the diagnosis, the White House stressed that the president was fully vaccinated and twice boosted. It said Biden was taking Pfizer's Paxlovid pill, an antiviral used to minimise the severity of COVID-19. ""Consistent with CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines, he will isolate at the White House and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time,"" it added. The president tested positive in a rapid antigen test Thursday morning before the result was confirmed by a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test. He is reported to be in good general health, but as the oldest US president ever elected his age heightens concern over the impact of COVID-19. A physical exam in November last year found Biden ""fit for duty"". But facing a punishing workload, Biden - like other presidents before him - is showing the strain: his walk is stiffer, his hair thinner, and his speech less fluent than when he took office. Politically Biden is also in a tough phrase of his presidency, facing November midterm elections that are forecast to be painful for his Democratic Party, as well as declining personal approval ratings. The president had planned to spend more time on the ground in the United States in the coming weeks after a period of intense overseas travel, including a NATO summit in Spain and a controversial trip to Saudi Arabia. He is now due to stay at the White House for several days. The CDC, the leading US government health agency, says that older adults are more likely to get severely sick from COVID-19, with risk increasing with age. The highly-transmissible Omicron BA.5 subvariant is currently fuelling a new COVID-19 wave in the United States - where hospitalisations have doubled in recent months. The country is seeing some 130,000 new reported cases daily, but the figure is thought to be substantially underestimated since home tests are not typically reported to authorities. On taking office, Biden made a point of abiding by strict COVID-19 protocols, holding socially distanced meetings or Zoom gatherings, and wearing a mask to public events - in sharp contrast to his predecessor Donald Trump. While other members of Biden's family and many close advisors contracted the virus, the president had remained Covid free until now. Vice President Kamala Harris, who caught COVID-19 back in April, tested negative following Biden's diagnosis, the administration said. Biden last tested negative on Tuesday, and his officials pledged to provide a daily health update as proof of transparency, as criticism grew that he was not tested on Wednesday. White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Ashish Jha, briefing the media, sought to use Biden's case to promote vaccination jabs. ""Because the president is fully vaccinated, double boosted, his risk of serious illness is dramatically lower,"" Jha said. Briefing reporters, Biden's spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre dismissed questions about where and how he caught the virus, saying ""I don't think that matters."" Biden returned from the Middle East in the early hours of Sunday, and on Wednesday travelled to Massachusetts to deliver a speech on climate change. ""I talked to him just a few minutes ago. He's doing fine, he's feeling good,"" First Lady Jill Biden, who tested negative, told reporters Thursday morning during a visit to a school in Michigan. Good wishes poured in from US politicians across the country's sharp divide as well as from abroad. ""Wishing you ... a swift recovery from #COVID19. Stay strong!"" tweeted World Health Organization chief Tedros Ghebreyesus. ""Wishing President Biden a speedy recovery from COVID,"" said leading US Republican Lindsey Graham. Then-president Trump tested positive for coronavirus in October 2020 - in the middle of the bitterly fought election race he eventually lost to Biden. Trump, who was 74 at the time, was treated in a clinic for three days before returning to the White House. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/australia-battles-omicron-outbreak-covid-19-deaths-rise-2825646,Australia battles fresh Omicron outbreak as COVID-19 deaths rise,"SYDNEY: Australia reported one of its highest daily death tolls from the novel coronavirus on Thursday (Jul 21) while hospital admissions hovered near record levels, as authorities struggle to get ahead of highly contagious Omicron variants. The BA.4/5 variants are good at evading immune protection from vaccination or prior infection and have been driving a surge of new infections globally. Australia is reporting the highest daily numbers since the first Omicron wave earlier this year, with 89 deaths from the coronavirus on Thursday and 90 on Wednesday. Just over 55,600 new cases were recorded on Thursday, the highest since May 18. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said state leaders and federal health officials have not recommended making masks mandatory in indoor venues, despite calls by some doctors to do so. Australia avoided the high death tolls seen in other countries during the first waves of the pandemic thanks largely to high levels of public compliance with tough social distancing restrictions. But there is little public appetite for a return to such measures to defeat the latest surge in infections and Albanese has resisted pressure from some health experts to impose mask mandates. ""It's no good having a mandate unless it's enforced,"" Albanese told ABC Radio. He said health officials also had to take into account the effects of tough restrictions on mental health. The latest Omicron wave is pushing the number of people with COVID-19 in Australian hospitals close to the peak hit in January. About 5,350 patients are in hospitals, and several states are battling record admissions. Authorities have urged businesses to let staff work from home and recommended people get booster shots urgently, with only about 71 per cent of the eligible population having received their boosters. About 95 per cent of people above 16 have had two doses. Since the pandemic began, Australia has reported about 9 million COVID-19 cases and 10,968 deaths. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/china-shenzhen-vows-mobilise-all-resources-curb-covid-19-spread-2825381,China's Shenzhen vows to 'mobilise all resources' to curb COVID-19 spread,"SHENZHEN: China's southern megacity of Shenzhen vowed to ""mobilise all resources"" to curb a slowly spreading COVID-19 outbreak, ordering strict implementation of testing and temperature checks, and lockdowns for COVID-affected buildings. Shenzhen, with a population of nearly 18 million, reported 22 new locally transmitted cases for Wednesday (Jul 20), with the daily count creeping up from single digits earlier this month. Though the caseload is still negligible by global standards, the slow uptick has pushed the Shenzhen authorities to step up vigilance, in order to comply with the central government's ""dynamic zero"" policy of containing outbreaks as soon as they emerge. Shenzhen has not ordered blanket closure of businesses or tough curbs on people's movement, but has sealed residential compounds and buildings identified as being at higher risk. Officials have been told to make their virus measures more targeted to avoid unnecessary disruption to the economy. Meng Fanli, head of the city's Communist Party, said Shenzhen will ""mobilise all resources and adopt all measures to quickly eliminate the risk of a community spread in key areas, resolutely cut transmission chains, and contain the outbreak as quickly as possible"". In a statement published late on Wednesday, Meng also warned that the city government would sternly hold accountable officials responsible for any negligence that results in the virus spreading. Out of Wednesday's 22 local infections, 13 were found in Shenzhen's Nanshan district, home to tech giants Tencent and DJI. In March, when caseloads started to increase from the low double-digits, Shenzhen adopted one week of so-called ""slow living"", during which residents underwent multiple rounds of testing and largely stayed at home, with one member of each household allowed out every few days for necessities. That marked one of the shortest lockdowns among COVID-hit cities with populations exceeding 10 million, and softer than that in Wuhan in 2020. Since March, streetside queues for testing have continued daily. Shenzhen has not locked down whole districts, instead isolating residential compounds where new cases are found. But the measures have taken a mental toll on some residents. ""Every day I wake up and check the complex chat group with anxiety,"" said Ella, who runs an education business. ""I just hate how now I have to justify where I'm going, what I'm doing, and sign all this stuff just to leave and come back."" Ella said she and her husband, both US citizens, were planning to return to the United States. Including Shenzhen's latest cases, China reported 826 new local COVID-19 cases for July 20, of which 148 were symptomatic and 678 were asymptomatic, the National Health Commission said on Thursday. In the northern port city of Tianjin, another two districts, with population totalling more than 1 million, suspended various entertainment venues, following similar COVID-19 curbs announced on Monday in two districts with over 2 million residents. There were no new deaths, leaving the nation's fatalities at 5,226. As of July 20, China had confirmed 228,180 cases with symptoms - including both local ones and those among international travellers - since the pandemic first struck in December 2019.  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/covid-omicron-ba5-variant-reinfection-long-risk-symptoms-2823441,Commentary: More Omicron reinfections raise the risk of long COVID,"WELLINGTON: The latest Omicron variant BA.5 is fast becoming dominant worldwide, including in New Zealand and Australia. As it continues to surge, reinfection will become increasingly common and this in turn means more people will develop long COVID. The two most concerning aspects of long COVID are its high prevalence (up to 30 per cent of those infected) and a link between reinfection and a higher risk of harmful outcomes. American science writer Ed Yong, commenting on government responses to the pandemic, described them as a case of “debrouillez-vous”, which approximates to “you work it out – you’re on your own”. In the face of official attitudes that are increasingly laissez-faire towards the continuing pandemic, many people no longer take even those precautions over which we have individual control: Mask wearing, physical distancing and choosing carefully whether to attend crowded events. The consequences are an increase in both daily case numbers and the lurking burden of long COVID. Omicron’s first variant, BA.1, emerged in late 2021, substantially different – clinically and genetically – from earlier variants. It displaced the Delta variant and, in early 2022, was itself replaced by BA.2. The degree to which BA.2 had evolved away from BA.1 is far greater than the genetic distance between the original version of SARS-CoV-2 and the Delta variant. BA.5, a subvariant of BA.2, is now quickly overtaking other variants. Omicron variants, and BA.5 specifically, show several worrying features. They can evade immunity acquired through earlier infections and breakthrough infections in vaccinated people. BA.5 is better able to infect cells, acting more like Delta than the previous Omicron variants. SARS-CoV-2 is not unique in its ability to cause post-acute symptoms and organ damage. Unexplained chronic disability occurred in a minority of patients after Ebola, dengue, polio, the original severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and West Nile virus infections. What is different is the sheer size of this pandemic and the number of people affected by long COVID. One of the absolutely critical issues about long COVID is that we should not underestimate it. It is now clear from multiple large studies that: It is a set of syndromes; it affects multiple organs and systems; it resolves in some but remains persistent in others; it can be markedly debilitating; its risk is reduced by vaccination and its pathology is poorly understood.  We are just beginning to find ways to predict risk and monitor its course, and management is, at best, ad hoc. Perhaps most crucially, reinfection may now become a feature of the pandemic for at least the next 12 to 36 months, raising the risk of long COVID with each repeat infection. Some large studies in Denmark, England, and the United States show 20 per cent to 30 per cent of people who tested positive for COVID-19 experienced at least one post-acute symptom, up to 12 months after infection. Symptoms included loss of smell and taste, fatigue, shortness of breath, reduced limb strength, concentration difficulties, memory disturbance, sleep disturbance and mental or physical exhaustion. In England, the prevalence of persistent symptoms was higher in women and older people. Obesity, smoking or vaping, hospitalisation and deprivation were also associated with a higher probability of persistent symptoms. Those who were hospitalised with COVID-19 in the UK showed even more severe outcomes. In the US, younger survivors were at higher risk than people over 65 for heart-rhythm disturbances and musculoskeletal pain. This is consistent with other observations that long COVID is not a disorder only of older age. However, older survivors had a statistically significantly higher risk of developing certain conditions, including kidney failure, clotting disorders, cerebrovascular disease (stroke), type 2 diabetes, muscle disorders and a variety of neurologic and psychiatric conditions. A US study involving more than five million people shows the risk of long COVID increases with the number of reinfections. But vaccination consistently reduces the risk of long COVID as well as severe disease, hospitalisation, ICU and death. There are lessons from the 1918-19 influenza pandemic that we need to bring back into our repertoire, not for a month or two but for the long term. Japan adopted mask wearing as a key public-health element on a short list of available measures. As science writer Laura Spinney notes in her excellent 2017 coverage of the flu pandemic’s history, it “probably marked the beginning of the practice of mask wearing to protect others from one’s own germs”. In Japan, mask use was compulsory for some, such as the police. In some towns, people were not permitted on public transport or allowed to enter a theatre without a mask.  Japan had the lowest death rate of all Asian countries in the flu pandemic and is looking to be close to the lowest cumulative mortality in the OECD for the COVID-19 pandemic. During the 1918-19 flu pandemic, the US, unlike Europe, put considerable effort into public health interventions, which reduced total mortality. San Francisco, St Louis, Milwaukee and Kansas City had the most effective interventions, reducing transmission rates by 30 per cent to 50 per cent. In historian Geoffrey Rice’s Black November and Black Flu (together the most comprehensive coverage of the 1918-19 pandemic in New Zealand), there are some photographs of people wearing masks and a reference to “gauze masks” for shopkeepers. However, there is little evidence to suggest mask wearing was widespread or encouraged in New Zealand. The influential Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported daily death tolls during the 1918-19 flu pandemic until civil authorities asserted it was stirring up anxiety and forced it to stop. As Spinney notes, people could see the exodus of dead bodies from their neighbourhoods and the silence was provoking even more anxiety. The pandemic and the silence conspired to confuse people about the efficacy of public health measures and compliance dropped off even further. People drifted back to church and race meetings – and left masks at home. Public health infrastructure collapsed. Vaccines (not available a century ago) are almost all that stands between us and a similar collapse. We would remain stronger and healthier – and reduce the burden of long COVID – if we increased vaccination coverage and universally adopted Japanese-style regular mask use and physical distancing.

Some essential businesses and premises would be able to reopen on Jul 23, the government announced in a statement on Wednesday, that did not give details on casinos specifically. The government has wanted to keep casinos open to protect jobs and livelihoods, as most of the population in the China-ruled territory are employed directly or indirectly by the gaming resorts. The partial reopening will take place over two weeks with cinemas, fitness and health clubs as well as beauty parlours continuing to be shut. Authorities will also extend mass coronavirus testing of the city's more than 600,000 residents. Residents are still required to stay home apart from those who need to go out for ""work, shopping or other urgent reasons"", the statement said. Infections have fallen over the past week with only 10 cases reported on Tuesday. Macao shut all its casinos for the first time in more than two years on Jul 11. The former Portuguese colony has recorded around 1,800 COVID-19 infections since mid-June. This is the first time Macao has had to grapple with the fast-spreading Omicron variant. More than 90 per cent of Macao's residents are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 but authorities have closely followed China's zero-COVID mandate which seeks to curb all outbreaks at almost any cost, contrary to the rest of the world which is already living with the virus. While casinos will reopen, there will likely be no business for several weeks, executives and analysts said, with many coronavirus rules set to remain in place. Macao's casinos are soaking up losses as they prepare to bid for new licences by next month in a business that generated US$36 billion in revenue in 2019, the last year before COVID-19 curbs slammed the sector.

Australia is in the grip of a third Omicron wave driven by the highly transmissible new subvariants, BA.4 and BA.5, with more than 300,000 cases recorded over the past seven days, even as authorities flagged the actual numbers could be double. Tuesday's 50,000 cases were the highest in two months. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is resisting pressure to reinstate tough curbs to halt the spread of the virus, including making masks mandatory indoors, though he encouraged people to wear it. ""The truth is that if you have mandates, you've got to enforce them,"" Albanese told reporters on Wednesday. ""Whilst there are mandates on public transport ... not everyone is wearing a mask."" Albanese said businesses and employees must decide together on any work-from-home arrangement, as unions called for employers to do more for their staff. Employers must go beyond the government's pandemic leave payments and provide paid leave at full pay for workers who need to isolate, and offer free rapid antigen tests, Australian Council of Trade Unions President Michele O'Neil said. ""No worker should have to decide between putting food on the table or isolating with COVID-19,"" O'Neil said. Last week, Australia reinstated support payments for casual workers who have to quarantine. Australia's Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly predicted the number of people ending up in hospital will soon hit a record high, and urged businesses to let more staff work from home. Australia could see ""millions"" of new cases over the coming weeks, authorities have warned. About 5,300 Australians are currently in hospital with COVID-19, not far off the record 5,390 recorded in January during the BA.1 outbreak, official data showed. Numbers in the states of Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia are already at their highest since the pandemic began. Many frontline health workers are also sick or in isolation, further straining the health system. Australian doctors said masks must be made mandatory in indoor venues. ""We don't have optional seat belts, we don't have optional speed limits. There's a lot of limits on our freedoms that we accept because it's the right thing to do,"" Australian Medical Association President Omar Khorshid told radio station 2GB. Authorities have also warned of a lag in people taking their booster shots. So far, 95 per cent of people above 16 have had two doses, helping keep Australia's total COVID-19 cases just under 9 million and deaths at 10,884, far lower than many countries. But only about 71 per cent have received three or more doses. "

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/china-tianjin-halts-businesses-fresh-covid-19-curbs-2819721,China's Tianjin halts some businesses in fresh COVID-19 curbs,"SHANGHAI: A handful of COVID-19 infections have forced the northern Chinese port city of Tianjin to shut many entertainment venues and some kindergartens and tutoring agencies, the latest big city to fight nascent clusters. Tianjin, with a population with over 12 million and home to factories linked to Boeing and Volkswagen, reported 11 domestically transmitted infections for Monday after around a week of zero cases, official data showed on Tuesday (Jul 19). Tianjin Port, which manages the port's cargo loading and unloading businesses, is operating normally, a representative said on Tuesday. Caseloads for Tianjin and the rest of China have been low in the global context for over two years, but China has maintained a ""dynamic zero-COVID"" policy of containing outbreaks as soon as they emerge, even though its strict measures in response to the highly transmissible Omicron variant have disrupted local businesses and clouded the outlook for the world's second-largest economy. Tianjin officials said late on Monday that various indoor entertainment venues, such as chess and card parlours and bars, in two districts with a total of over 2 million residents were ordered to close, without specifying a date for their reopening. One of the districts said it also ordered a three-day closure at kindergartens and tutoring agencies. Nomura analysts said in a note on Monday that an estimated 264.1 million people in 41 cities in China are affected by full or partial lockdowns or other control measures, up from 247.5 million in 31 cities last week. Including Tianjin's cases, mainland China reported 699 new domestically transmitted infections for Jul 18, of which 199 were symptomatic and 500 were asymptomatic, the National Health Commission said on Tuesday. The majority of Monday's new cases were found in the northwestern province of Gansu and the southern region of Guangxi. In Gansu's provincial capital of Lanzhou, a district with over 100,000 residents entered a lockdown from Monday, during which each household can leave their residential compound only once each day to get groceries. A lockdown for four other major districts with around 3 million people started last week and has been extended to Jul 24. In Guangxi, the coastal city of Beihai, currently clocking over 700 local cases, has become the latest tourism city hit by travel restrictions. Beihai has told hotels and travel agencies to fully refund trips and stays booked by those who were eventually unable to come, reversing a pre-outbreak boom in demand. It is also rushing to take care of over 2,000 tourists stuck in the city, some of whom had come in close contact with infections or visited areas affected by the virus and couldn't leave without going through quarantine. Tourists who are able to leave have to show negative test results within the previous 48 hours. The financial hub Shanghai, which reported 23 new local cases for Monday, began mass testing on Tuesday in many of its 16 districts, after a similar testing drive last week. There were no new deaths, leaving the nation's fatalities at 5,226. As of Monday, mainland China had confirmed 227,830 cases with symptoms, including both local cases and infected international travellers. "

The outbreak began over the weekend, when seven positive tests were announced among the camp, including two marathon runners, four support staff and the head coach. Another four positive tests were announced yesterday, involving one marathon runner and three more coaches, and on Tuesday JAAF said three more athletes and an official were hit by infections. One of those, the 200-metre sprinter Yuki Koike, will now have to miss his preliminary race, the federation said. All of those who have tested positive will observe a five-day isolation period. The outbreak comes during a surge of infections across the United States as new variants of COVID-19 take hold. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week that 21 of Oregon's 36 counties were deemed to be at ""high"" risk of the virus. On Saturday, British athlete Morgan Lake announced she had been forced to withdraw from the World Championships after testing positive for COVID-19. "

She is the second patient under 12 to die of the disease in Singapore. The Singaporean girl had no past medical history and was previously well, said MOH in response to CNA's queries. She developed symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection and fever last Friday and tested positive for COVID-19 using an antigen rapid test (ART) on Sunday at a general practitioner clinic. The girl was prescribed medication for her symptoms but remained unwell. She collapsed on Sunday night. The cause of death was determined by the state coroner to be COVID-19 pneumonia, the ministry said. ""Children are generally more resilient to COVID-19 infections than adults and the elderly. Notwithstanding, COVID-19 infections can result in severe disease amongst children,"" MOH added. MOH, the Health Sciences Authority and the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination are studying the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines that have been formulated for young children under the age of five. Currently, children aged five and above are eligible for the primary vaccination series. Those aged 12 and above who have completed their primary vaccination series are eligible for the first booster shot. On Jun 27, a one-and-a-half-year-old Singaporean boy died of COVID-19, the first coronavirus death in a patient under 12 in Singapore. The cause of his death was encephalitis due to COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus and enterovirus infections.  He had no other past medical history and was previously well, said MOH last month. As of noon on Monday, Singapore reported 6,227 new COVID-19 cases, of whom 5,978 were local cases. Four deaths were recorded. A total of 810 people were in hospital, with 78 requiring oxygen supplementation and 16 in the intensive care unit. The week-on-week infection ratio was 1.08. A number above 1 indicates that the number of new weekly COVID-19 cases is rising. About 93 per cent of the total population in Singapore have completed their full vaccination regimen, and 78 per cent have received booster shots.  On Jul 5, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said Singapore was ""near the peak, if not at the peak"" of the current Omicron wave. At that time, about 50 per cent of infections were from the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, he said in Parliament.

""I haven't made an announcement of my retirement, but it could be anywhere from now until then,"" Fauci said in the telephone interview. ""I don't know yet."" Fauci, 81, in late November 2021 told Reuters that he was ""not even remotely contemplating"" retirement. He has been the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) since 1984, and in 2020 became the face of the United States government's efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. When he does leave government service, Fauci said that he has no intention of completely retiring. ""I'm going to continue working because I still have a lot of energy and passion about public health, and global public health,"" he said. As for the ongoing monkeypox outbreak, Fauci said that ""there is a risk"" of the virus becoming endemic in the United States, meaning it will continue to spread without being eradicated. ""That's the reason why we've got to move quickly,"" he said. Besides people who have already been exposed to the virus, Fauci said that vaccines need to be given to people who are at risk for an infection, such as those who are taking the HIV prevention therapy called PrEP. ""We want to get a much broader coverage of vaccine for pre-exposure prophylaxis as well as for post-exposure prophylaxis,” Fauci said. The US government has been working to ramp up access to those vaccines, which are in short supply, complicating efforts by already poorly funded sexual health clinics to respond to the outbreak."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/japan-travel-rules-tourist-group-covid-19-wave-vaccine-kishida-abe-2817761,Commentary: Is Japan ready to reopen its borders?,"VANCOUVER, Canada: Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s initial easing of COVID-19 restrictions was dramatically reversed following the arrival of Omicron in late November 2021. He most notably shut down the Japanese border – bucking the trend of reopening in East Asia and causing consternation abroad. Kishida has responded cautiously to domestic and foreign pressure to reopen Japan’s borders since April. Japan reopened its borders to holders of long-term visitor, business or student visas on Jun 1, as well as to tourists on authorised package tours. Independent tourists are not yet granted entry, although they can be expected to be allowed back by autumn. The Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism, Wada Kouichi, stated there had only been 1,300 entry visa requests for travel purposes in Japan as of Jun 15. This is despite Japan having its lowest exchange rate in 24 years (136 yen to US$1). Indeed, Japan’s current border rules for foreign tourists are the most restrictive in Asia with the exception of China. But Kishida’s COVID-19 policy response and his slow reopening have earned public support. This is no easy task in a country that has been sensitive to rising cases and experienced shortcomings like the government’s inability to provide enough hospital beds. The latest polls indicate broad support for Kishida’s approach – with COVID-19 becoming less of a salient issue for the now delayed Upper House elections in light of the Jul 8 shooting of former prime minister Shinzo Abe. A FNN/Sankei poll found that 65.4 per cent of respondents support the government’s COVID-19 policies. 67 per cent support its programme to encourage domestic tourism within Japan, while another 67 per cent support the loosening of COVID-19 restrictions – such as opening to foreign tourists. Thanks to his response to COVID-19 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kishida has gone against the trend of recent prime ministers and seen his cabinet support steadily rise to about 63 per cent to 69 per cent since January 2022. Japan experienced a slight uptick in COVID-19 cases after 194 new cases per million people was recorded on Jul 5. Experts attribute this to the spread of BA.5 – a new subvariant of COVID-19 – which is likely to cause a seventh wave of cases. Still, this number is lower than Australia (1,076), New Zealand (964), Taiwan (2,356) and Singapore (717) in the wake of their move away from “zero-COVID-19” towards open borders. While cumulative mortality per capita was higher in Japan in January than in most of its developed East Asian neighbours in 2020 to 2021, Japan now has the lowest death rate per capita outside of China. As of Jul 9, Japan has experienced 249 cumulative deaths per million compared with 262 in Singapore, 314 in New Zealand, 317 in Taiwan, 400 in Australia and 480 in South Korea. The increase of cases in Japan has led the government to take precautionary measures to bolster local government efforts to secure enough hospital beds. It will also re-evaluate the start of the Zenkoku Ryokou Shien program, which would have encouraged internal tourism through government subsidies. Although Japan was slow to roll out its booster shot in January, vaccine statistics show that as of Jul 8, 64 per cent of the population had received a booster shot compared to 38 per cent in the United States, 54 per cent in Australia, 59 per cent in the United Kingdom, 74 per cent in Taiwan, 74 per cent in South Korea and 78 per cent in Singapore. While international partners, businesses, tourist companies, students and travellers are counting the cost of Japan’s closure, Kishida has managed to utilise it to reverse domestic frustration with the policies of former prime ministers Shinzo Abe and Yoshihide Suga. Depending on how the seventh COVID-19 wave develops, he may soon gain the political room to open Japan’s borders more widely.

Eight riders have so far pulled out of the race after being infected with the novel coronavirus and showing symptoms as part of the teams' international testing protocol. Last year, if two members of a team tested positive for COVID-19 the whole outfit would be sent packing, which is not the case in this edition. Whether a rider who tests positive can stay in the race is decided following a meeting between race, UCI and team doctors, depending on the rider's viral load. "

The North says 99.98 per cent of its 4.77 million fever patients since late April have fully recovered, but due to an apparent lack of testing, it has not released any figures of those that proved positive. ""The anti-epidemic campaign is improved to finally defuse the crisis completely,"" KCNA said. It added that the North had reported 310 more people with fever symptoms. The World Health Organization has cast doubts on North Korea's claims, saying last month it believed the situation was getting worse, not better, amid an absence of independent data. The North's declaration could be a prelude to restoring trade long hampered by the pandemic, one analyst said. ""Under the current trend, North Korea could announce in less than a month that its COVID-19 crisis is over and that could be a prelude to resuming cross-border trade,"" said Cheong Seong-chang, director of the Sejong Institute's North Korea studies centre in South Korea. Analysts say the authoritarian North has used the pandemic to tighten already strict social controls. Pyongyang blamed its outbreak on ""alien things"" near its border with the South, urging its people to avoid anything that comes from outside. Daily new cases of fever in North Korea reported by KCNA have been declining since the reclusive country first acknowledged in mid-May that it was battling an outbreak of COVID-19. Lacking a public vaccination effort, the North said it was running intensive medical checks nationwide, with daily PCR tests on water collected in borderline areas among the measures. The North also said it has been developing new methods to better detect the virus and its variants, as well as other infectious diseases, such as monkeypox. North Korea's claim of ""anti-epidemic stability"" comes as other Asian countries grapple with a new wave of infections. China reported 691 new cases for Saturday with locally transmitted infections at a peak since May 23. In neighbouring South Korea, daily COVID-19 infections jumped on Tuesday above 40,000 for the first time in two months, with authorities and experts predicting hundreds of thousands of new cases in coming weeks. Japan also warned that a new wave of infections appeared to be spreading rapidly, as Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called for special care ahead of school summer vacations. Tokyo's 16,878 new cases on Wednesday were the highest since February, while the nationwide tally rose above 90,000, in a recent surge of infections to levels unseen since early this year. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/covid-19-china-shanghai-hold-mass-testing-exercise-2817446,Shanghai enforces new COVID-19 testing as some parts of China extend lockdown,"SHANGHAI: Several large Chinese cities including Shanghai are rolling out new mass testing or extending lockdowns on millions of residents to counter new clusters of COVID-19 infections, with some measures being criticised on the Internet. China has reported an average of around 390 local daily infections in the seven days ending on Sunday (Jul 17), higher than about 340 seven days earlier, according to Reuters calculations based on official data as of Monday. While that is tiny compared with a resurgence in other parts of Asia, China is adamant about implementing its dynamic zero-COVID policy of eliminating outbreaks as soon as they emerge. Previously when a flare-up became a major outbreak, local officials had been compelled to take tougher measures such as month-long lockdowns, even at the cost of economic growth. Persistent outbreaks and more closures could add pressure on the world's second-largest economy, which contracted sharply in the second quarter from the first after widespread COVID-19 lockdowns jolted industrial production and consumer spending. The commercial hub of Shanghai, yet to fully recover from the harsh two-month lockdown in spring and still reporting daily sporadic cases, plans to hold mass testing in many of its 16 districts and in some smaller areas where new infections had been reported recently, after similar testing last week. ""There is still an epidemic risk at the community level so far,"" the city government said in a statement. Shanghai reported more than a dozen new cases but none was found outside quarantined areas, local government data showed on Monday. ""I'm speechless,"" said a Shanghai resident surnamed Wang, already subject to testing every weekend at her residential compound. ""It sounds like a waste of resources that doesn't address the real problem."" The northern city of Tianjin, which launched multiple rounds of mass testing in recent months to curb earlier outbreaks, said on Monday it is again testing its more than 12 million residents, after two local infections were found. In the northwestern city of Lanzhou, a lockdown in four major districts with around 3 million residents that started last week has been extended to Jul 24. In the central Chinese city of Zhumadian, lockdowns for several million people in a few towns under its jurisdiction have been extended for a few days until Monday or Tuesday. The southwestern city of Chengdu said on Monday it suspended various entertainment and cultural venues, widening such curbs over the weekend that had been limited to a few districts. The capital Beijing, after a week of zero local infections, found two cases on Monday - one international flight crew member and the person's roommate. Authorities have sealed affected buildings. Authorities in the southern region of Guangxi said late on Sunday they removed two officials in the city of Beihai from their jobs for acting poorly in their COVID-19 response. Beihai, with a population of 1.9 million and currently clocking over 500 infections, has launched multiple rounds of mass testing and locked down some areas. As of Sunday, over 2,000 tourists were stuck in the city. In the southern city of Guangzhou, COVID-19 control staffers broke down the locks of apartment doors without residents' consent, stirring an outcry on social media over the weekend. Authorities in one district in Guangzhou on Monday apologised to residents. The issue was among the top trending topics on China's Twitter-like social media Weibo. ""It's too horrifying, too ridiculous,"" wrote a Weibo user. ""No humanity, no law."" In the northeastern city of Changchun, clear of local infections since mid-May, subway passengers were told to wear N95 masks throughout their rides. Many cities including Beijing only mandate surgical masks. Changchun has been clear of local cases since mid-May, while a smaller nearby town under its jurisdiction has reported fewer than 20 cases since July 15. Jin Dong-yan, a virology professor at the University of Hong Kong, said N95 respirators are able to offer better protection than surgical masks during major outbreaks, but could be of low cost-efficiency in areas of low COVID-19 risk. ""In a city without cases, N95 mask mandate would be painful and inconvenient."" "

Despite a steady fall in infections that saw just 27 new cases reported on Sunday, authorities said the city's more than 600,000 residents must stay home, with all non-essential businesses shut, until Friday. Although more than 90 per cent of residents are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, this is the first time Macao has had to grapple with the fast-spreading Omicron variant. Macao, which went into lockdown on Jul 11, has a tally of more than 1,700 infections since the middle of June, after having been largely COVID-19-free following an outbreak in October 2021. The former Portuguese colony has only one public hospital and its medical system was already stretched before the outbreak. Macao follows China's ""zero-COVID"" policy of stamping out all outbreaks at just about any cost, which runs counter to a global trend of trying to co-exist with the virus. COVID-19 testing for all will be done at least twice this week, with antigen rapid tests (ART) also required in between. The six casino operators, Sands China, Wynn Macau, MGM China, Melco Resorts, Galaxy Entertainment and SJM Holding, are racking up losses ahead of bids for new licenses by next month. Still, daily infections are fewer than elsewhere, such as neighbouring Hong Kong, where cases have jumped this month to more than 3,000 a day as curbs have started to ease. But Macao has an open border with China, and many residents live and work in the adjoining city of Zhuhai."

WHO's chief scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan said there were not yet enough samples to assess its severity, as reported by The Guardian.  The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control designated the BA.2.75 variant as a ""variant under monitoring"" on Jul 7. This means that there is some indication that it could be more transmissible or associated with more severe disease, but the evidence is weak or has not yet been assessed. Singapore reported 9,153 new COVID-19 cases as of noon on Saturday, comprising 8,691 local infections and 462 imported cases.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/covid-19-travel-test-country-requirement-art-pcr-infect-risk-2812801,Commentary: Should you still go on holiday if you have COVID-19?,"PORTSMOUTH, England: Your flights are booked, your bags are packed, and in your mind you’re already sunning yourself by the beach with a cocktail. With summer in full swing in the northern hemisphere, and most COVID-19-related restrictions behind us, travel is back on the agenda for many people. But at the same time, COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom are rising. So what if you’re unlucky enough to catch COVID-19 just before your long-awaited getaway? Given most countries have stopped requiring negative tests to enter, can you just go anyway? “Obviously not – you don’t want to go and infect another country”, my 13-year-old responded when I asked him this question. But is the answer as obvious as my teenage son seems to think? The first thing to note is that other countries may still have COVID-19 restrictions in place, so entry might be restricted altogether, or you may be prevented from travelling with COVID-19 due to testing, vaccination or quarantine rules. You can check the requirements in different countries using this map. But assuming you’ve checked the rules for the country you’re visiting, and you’re legally allowed to travel even with COVID-19, what should you do? This is clearly an ethical question, and what seems like an obvious answer to one person might not be so obvious to others. First, let’s look at the facts. The combination of vaccination and effective treatments for severe COVID-19 has changed the situation compared with 2020 or 2021. The ratio of deaths to infections continues to become more favourable, and while the potential for a new, more harmful variant is an ongoing concern, the risks from COVID are becoming increasingly similar to risks faced from many other infectious diseases. Given this, and the fact that it’s becoming harder to find a COVID test (or certainly a free one), it may be more pertinent to consider the question in relation to infectious diseases more generally. If you’re planning to travel while knowingly ill, there would seem to be risks both to you and others. For instance, people generally don’t like the idea of being sick far from home, and buy travel insurance in the hope it will ensure they’re cared for should they become unwell (or get worse) while abroad. But while taking out insurance shows one level of concern for health risks, these concerns are by definition quite self-centred. Considering risks to other people, travelling with an infectious disease clearly carries the potential of passing the disease on to others. With all diseases, certain sections of the population will be more vulnerable. So where a virus like COVID might result in only mild cold-like symptoms for you, it could be fatal for someone else. But working out who may be vulnerable so that you can then avoid them if you’re sick is very difficult. There are also plenty of people who care for vulnerable people, and could easily pass an infection on. Being careful and wearing a mask will help to a certain extent, but the obvious solution for protecting vulnerable people and their carers is to avoid mixing in large groups altogether. A second health risk is the possibility of being the cause of a new, geographically distinct outbreak. This is especially worth considering in countries with less developed healthcare systems or poorer availability of vaccines. A mild variant of a disease like COVID-19 in the UK (which has a high vaccination rate) may well be significantly more lethal in a country where a lower proportion of the population is vaccinated. A final thing to consider is that no one has a “right” to go on holiday. Broadly speaking, “rights” are socially or legally determined, and while certainly many of us are very tired of COVID-19 and the restrictions we’ve had to endure over the past couple of years, it’s difficult to argue that this frustration means we have a “right” to travel. Just because something is legal does not mean it is a right. It’s interesting to note the experience of the last couple of years – the first true pandemic in most people’s lifetime – has changed general attitudes towards infection and health risks, so that behaviour that was socially acceptable before COVID is now no longer considered appropriate. In particular, the pandemic has increased the public’s awareness of infection control. While previously many people would have perhaps drawn a moral distinction between passing on clearly severe infectious diseases like tuberculosis or Ebola, they were often more relaxed about spreading milder diseases like influenza or the common cold. The experience of COVID-19 has changed this as more people have come to realise infections that are mild in most people can be highly risky for some. So should you go on holiday if you have COVID-19? I would argue that the answer to this question is similar to considering what you should do more generally if you have COVID at home, or indeed any other infection: stay away from others and treat the illness with respect. Maybe you can achieve this if your holiday involves driving on your own, or with a small number of people you’ve previously had close contact with. Perhaps you (or your group) may also be able to stay away from others until you have recovered. But if your intention is to fly, stay in a hotel, or visit tourist hot spots, I refer you to the comment from my 13-year-old son: “Obviously not – you don’t want to go and infect another country”.

""I've said to the (state leaders) that we'll meet from time to time. And it's appropriate that we meet on Monday. We're not meeting today because I'm here,"" Albanese told reporters in Fiji on Friday (Jul 15) after a meeting of the Pacific leaders. Albanese, in power for just under two months, said an end date of Jun 30 for quarantine pay of up to A$750 (US$500) for casual workers was put in place by the previous Liberal-National coalition government. ""We inherited these decisions, but we also inherited a trillion dollars of debt. And that's something that was not our responsibility,"" Albanese said. Several state leaders have urged Albanese to bring back the income support. As of the end of last year, the government had spent almost A$13b (US$8.8b) on 2.4 million employees, according to official data, while total federal support since the pandemic began is estimated to be over A$300 billion (US$202b). Australia began living with the virus early this year having wound down tough social distancing restrictions and snap lockdowns after reaching world-beating levels of vaccinations. But the fast-moving BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants have forced authorities to warn there could be ""millions"" of new infections in the country over the next few weeks even as they ruled out any tough restrictions to contain the spread. Since the pandemic began, Australia has reported about 8.7 million cases and 10,549 deaths, far lower than many countries. Just over 4,500 are in hospitals due to COVID-19."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/china-beijing-zero-covid-quarantine-lockdown-2809936,Commentary: Experiencing quarantine as a 'high risk' family in zero-COVID Beijing,"BEIJING: It was bad enough that my father-in-law, who is staying with us, got us all locked in our small Beijing apartment after visiting a food market which the government decided was “high risk”. But then my mother-in-law started loudly praising the quarantine system that has confined tens of thousands of Beijingers to their homes or isolated in hotels over the past few months, as the Chinese capital tries to contain Omicron. “If they don’t quarantine all of us, our country’s coronavirus policies are bullshit,” she told us. For the first time since my parents-in-law arrived five months ago to help my wife and me with our newborn, I felt unfilial. It began on a Friday, when a man from our “shequ”, the committee in charge of keeping order in our neighbourhood, arrived sweating at our door to seal us inside. We were the 40th family he had put into isolation that week so he was well practised in dismissing our entreaties. No, we could not walk around the apartment complex, he said. No, we could not take our baby downstairs to play. He explained that we had been classified as a “high-risk family” needing at least four days of home quarantine. He pasted a notice on our door asking our neighbours for their co-operation, hinting that they should report us to the authorities if we tried to escape. He added a white electronic sensor and said it would alert his phone if our door opened, allowing him to monitor our compliance with the rules. We could open our door — pinging alerts to him — to bring in deliveries and put out the trash, which would be collected every afternoon and sanitised. “Make sure the deliverymen have already left before you open the door,” he warned. Government-monitored quarantine is the cornerstone of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s zero-COVID policy, which despite other countries’ transition to living with coronavirus, has only become more entrenched in the world’s most populous country. Most Chinese cities go into full, don’t-leave-home lockdown over a few handfuls of COVID-19 cases. The majority of Shanghai residents were confined inside for two months, millions without sufficient food.  Beijing has so far kept this Omicron wave in check at fewer than 100 cases a day with lower-key restrictions, inspiring some experts paraded by state media to deem us a zero-COVID success story. That’s not how it felt when I rushed to stock up on frozen chicken and cabbage alongside thousands of other frenzied Beijingers last month as rumours of an impending lockdown spread. We decided to buy an extra freezer to store more food. We were among the last of our friends to face government-ordered quarantine. Some had been put in isolation for passing an area with COVID-19 cases, others for visiting a high-risk pub or living too close to someone who had contracted COVID-19.  A friend in southern Beijing has been quarantined three separate times this year. Another had two weeks at home after a COVID-19 case visited his building for 30 minutes. We had been classified as high risk, the shequ man told us that Friday, because my father-in-law had been at a food market that was also used by a close contact of a COVID-19 case. My father-in-law had scanned the market’s QR code with his phone, making it easy for him to be tracked along with thousands of other Beijingers who had visited the market between Jun 8 and Jun 15. If the close contact remained COVID-free, we would soon be let out. The first day of quarantine was the longest. My 11-month-old daughter can’t speak but repeatedly waddled over with her shoes, her way of saying “I want to go outside”. My wife, mother-in-law and I alternated between chasing her around the flat and retreating to our own corners of it. My father-in-law spent hours on the couch with his eyes closed, headphones on. We debated making a run for a breath of fresh air, but were worried our neighbours would report us — the notice on our door gave a phone number to call. Some cities offer 1,000 yuan (US$150) or more for reporting on neighbours breaking quarantine. The collective monitoring is officially encouraged in Beijing and the local news is full of stories of residents being detained or put under police investigation for breaking the rules. Each day we removed the notice on our door in case we dared to make a break for it. But every morning a new one appeared and “don’t tear down” was scribbled on its margins. The days passed slowly. Workers in white protective gear came to the door to do COVID-19 throat swabs every other day.  The unnamed close contact remained COVID-free and we were released after four days as planned. We were lucky to escape the desperation felt by millions locked in their homes for weeks in cities like Shanghai or Jilin. After our quarantine, my mother-in-law began to spend her mornings reviewing the latest COVID-19 controls in her hometown in China’s north-east. For months her city had been mandating a two-week quarantine for any traveller from Beijing. But, in July, it finally dropped the requirement and she hastened to book the next ticket home."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/lawrence-wong-best-4g-leader-lead-singapore-post-covid-world-ips-study-2810116,6 in 10 Singaporeans trust that Lawrence Wong is best 4G leader to steer country in post-pandemic era: IPS study,"SINGAPORE: Around six in 10 Singaporeans trust that Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong is the ""best possible 4G leader"" to navigate Singapore through the post-pandemic era, according to a study conducted by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS). This includes trust in the handling of divisions within society, dealing with other countries and helping Singapore through the economic recovery. This was among several findings released on Thursday (Jul 14) from IPS' study on the well-being of Singaporeans over the past two years of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was based on responses from more than 2,000 people in a poll conducted online. Given that the coronavirus outbreak was a test of governance, coming at a time of leadership transition, researchers said they assessed if respondents trusted the Government’s leadership to bring Singapore forward through the pandemic. Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister, was named leader of the People's Action Party's fourth generation (4G) team on Apr 14. About two months later, he was promoted to Deputy Prime Minister. According to IPS' research paper, better-educated respondents, ""who traditionally have been more sceptical about government policies"", were more likely to trust that the Government has the best possible 4G leader.  Around 59 per cent of those who have at least a university degree had greater trust that the Singapore Government has the best possible 4G leader, as compared to 44 per cent to 49 per cent of those without a degree. During a media briefing, associate director of IPS Social Lab Mike Hou, one of the authors of the paper, suggested that Mr Wong may have connected with this particular demographic in his role as co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force.  ""We think that it is in particular because DPM Wong has been quite effective in addressing some of the considerations and concerns of this demographic,"" he said.  This included social cohesion issues such as race and religion, which Dr Hou described as ""dormant challenges"" that emerged more during the pandemic.  ""This demographic group may be more aligned with our Government's scientific approach in trying to deal with the pandemic,"" Dr Hou added.  Those who were more satisfied with the Government’s management of the pandemic, those who were less worried about the rise in the cost of living, as well as those who were more receptive towards endemic living were more likely to trust that the Government has the best possible 4G leader, the study found. Around 83 per cent of those who had high satisfaction in how the Government handled the pandemic had greater trust that it has the best possible 4G leader. This is compared to 14 per cent of those who had low satisfaction, and 54 per cent of those who had moderate satisfaction.  Although a ""substantial proportion"" of respondents generally expressed “healthy levels” of trust and confidence in the 4G leadership, more will need to be done to address Singaporeans’ livelihood concerns such as the proposed Goods and Services Tax (GST) hike, the paper said. Researchers also asked if respondents had trust in Singapore’s recovery and government in light of the impact of COVID-19. More than half of them trusted that the Government is serious about developing a strong Singaporean core of highly skilled talents on the issue of jobs. A majority also trusted that the Government will be able to create new jobs and training opportunities. However, about 49 per cent felt that Singaporeans will become less welcoming of skilled professionals from overseas who work here. A majority, almost three-quarters of the respondents, trusted that Singapore would remain economically competitive. A large proportion also trusted that the Government knows how to navigate the global economy so that the country will be able to bounce back."

This was among the findings of a working paper by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) that reviewed the well-being of Singaporeans during the past two years, as well as looking at whether respondents trusted the Government’s leadership to bring Singapore forward through the pandemic. Respondents aged 21 to 29 reported declining mental and emotional health. The pandemic may have driven youths to re-evaluate their life priorities and question their life choices amid an uncertain future, according to the paper. ""The stressors from their fledgling careers and adjusting to workplace dynamics in the face of new workplace arrangements may have further contributed to their lower sense of mental well-being,"" the paper said. The pandemic may have also curtailed many activities which had been commonplace for young adults at this stage of their development, such as travel, said Dr Mathew Mathews at a media briefing on the findings of the study. For instance, it is common for young adults to travel after graduating from university, said Dr Mathews, principal research fellow at the IPS Social Lab. Other aspects of young adulthood that could have taken a backseat are dating and marriage, he said. This ultimately took a toll on these younger respondents, the paper found. Respondents aged 60 and above, however, found their mental or emotional health steadily improve through the course of the pandemic. Earlier in the pandemic, the impact of COVID-19 infection among older persons was known to be much more serious with daily reports showing that a number of older persons had succumbed to the virus, which is ""more likely""  to have affected the mental and emotional well-being of those who were older, the paper said. However, as treatment options progressed, especially with the availability of vaccination and with social support provided to this group, the more positive outlook may have bolstered their self-reports of mental and emotional well-being. Another group that reported a decline similar to those aged 21 to 29 were respondents aged 40 to 49. The authors of the paper attributed the “steady decline” in the rating of their mental and emotional health to them being sandwiched between attending to the needs of their parents and school-going children over the pandemic period. They noted that this came on top of job disruptions and rising costs of living. The self-reporting of a decline in mental and emotional health was despite the drop in the proportion of respondents who felt stressed from the pandemic since its earlier stages in 2020. The proportion of those who felt stressed fell from 50 per cent in the period between Apr 21 and Apr 23, 2020, to 31 per cent in the period between Jun 24 and Jul 4 this year. ""Despite the fact that things have obviously gotten better, the upward positivity hasn't sort of cancelled out all kinds of declines, difficulties, disadvantages that people experience,"" Dr Mathews said. More than 2,000 Singaporeans and Permanent Residents were polled online in the fifth edition of the series of papers, which are co-written by Dr Mathews, associate director at IPS Social Lab Mike Hou and their colleague, research assistant Fiona Phoa. Given that the COVID-19 outbreak was a test of governance, and ""especially important to Singapore at the moment given our leadership transition phase"", the researchers assessed if respondents trusted the Government’s leadership to bring Singapore forward through the pandemic. Following Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's announcement that now Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong would lead the fourth generation (4G) team of the People’s Action Party, respondents were asked whether they trusted that the Government has the best possible 4G leader. Around six in 10 (57 to 60 per cent) trusted that the Singapore Government has the best possible 4G leader to navigate divisions within the society, to navigate Singapore’s dealing with other countries and to help it navigate post-COVID-19 economic recovery,"" the paper stated. Although a ""substantial proportion"" of respondents generally expressed “healthy levels” of trust and confidence in the 4G leadership, more will need to be done to address Singaporeans’ concerns about specific areas of their lives, in particular, their livelihood concerns like the proposed Goods and Services Tax (GST) hike, the paper said. Although Singaporeans have in general, demonstrated resilience in the face of COVID-19 and have adapted reasonably well to living with COVID-19, the “insidious effects of the pandemic on individuals’ psychological well-being especially in the longer-term must not be neglected”, the paper noted. The paper found that what would help the Government’s “ultimate goal” of Singapore being able to live with COVID-19 was encouraging individuals to “keep the end in mind”. This effectively increases readiness towards endemic living especially among the more hesitant, the paper said. “Keeping the end in mind entails a clear articulation of the national goal of being able to overcome (though not necessarily eradicate) the virus by being able to live life that much more ‘normally’,” the paper said. “It entails embracing the spirit of resilience, rather than fear, and a vision of possibility – that it is possible to live life as before.” The researchers added that it also requires people to wean themselves off a “narrowly focused attention on (COVID-19) case numbers”, which is unhelpful in the broader scheme of things. This is especially since the vast majority of the population, including the more vulnerable, have been sufficiently inoculated against the disease. It is hoped that this aspect of the study provides useful insights to enhance public communication efforts related to COVID-19, the paper said. “COVID-19 is a defining moment in our nation’s collective history. Looking back, much may have been lost. But, looking ahead, we hope that more will be gained as we learn from this experience and move forward together through COVID-19,” it added.  "

There has been a significant jump in the number of new COVID-19 cases in New Zealand in the past couple of week and authorities are forecasting that this wave of Omicron might be worse than the first. The hospital system is already struggling with increases in wait times and surgeries having to be cancelled. ""There's no question the combination of a spike in COVID-19 cases and hospitalisations, the worst flu season in recent memory and corresponding staff absences are putting health workers and the whole health system under extreme pressure,"" Ayesha Verrall, Minister for COVID-19 Response, said in a statement. New Zealand, which has a population of 5.1 million, recorded 11,382 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday, with a total of 68,737 currently infected with the virus. Of those 765 cases are currently in hospital. A one-time poster child for tackling the coronavirus, New Zealand's swift response to the pandemic and its geographic isolation kept the country largely COVID-19 free until the end of last year. The government, however, retired its zero-COVID policy earlier this year once the population was largely vaccinated and the virus has been allowed to spread. Verrall said while COVID-zero was no longer a possibility as people did need to wear masks, to get tested and to isolate if either they or someone in their home tests positive to the virus. The government is making free masks and tests more widely available, allowing pharmacies to sell COVID-19 medicines and is expanding the criteria for who is eligible for antiviral medication. ""Now's not the time to stop wearing masks. Evidence tells us wearing a mask halves your chance of being infected with COVID-19. It also helps protect you against influenza and other winter illnesses so if you don't wear a mask for yourself, please wear one for healthcare workers,"" said Verrall. "

Tokyo's 16,878 new cases on Wednesday were the highest since February, while the nationwide tally rose above 90,000, in a recent surge of COVID-19 infections to levels unseen since early this year. The Japanese capital marked 16,662 new cases on Thursday. In his first news conference since former prime minister Shinzo Abe was killed and after the ruling coalition won an election on Sunday, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the highest level of caution was needed. ""The coronavirus is spreading throughout the nation and through all age groups,"" he said, urging people to make sure they got their booster shots - especially those in their 20s and 30s, whose vaccination rate is lagging. ""With summer vacations coming up, interaction between all generations will be increasing."" Additional steps included making fourth shots available to a wider range of people and establishing free testing sites at railway stations and airports, he said. But he added that the number of people who were seriously ill and deaths still remained low, and that no restrictions on movement were needed at this time. The capital, Tokyo, raised its alert level to the highest tier. The BA.5 variant accounts for more than half of the new cases. ""Tomorrow, we will hold a meeting ... to decide on measures to be taken this summer,"" Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike told a meeting earlier on Thursday, adding that the gathering would weigh expert opinion and the nationwide trend. Kishida also paid tribute to Abe, assassinated at an election campaign rally last Friday by an unemployed man with a homemade gun, adding that he felt there were faults in the security for Abe. ""Abe has many great legacies to his name across a wide variety of issues,"" he said. ""This includes taking on the heavy responsibility of being premier for our country with outstanding leadership and action over the course of eight years and eight months - the longest in modern history - when in the midst of domestic and global tension."" He said Japan would hold a state funeral for him in the autumn. The last state funeral for a former prime minister was for Shigeru Yoshida in 1967. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/covid-avoid-reinfection-how-long-immune-protection-vaccination-2807026,Commentary: It will be hard to outrun COVID-19 infection or reinfection in years to come,"CANBERRA: My glorious two and a half year run of negative COVID-19 tests came to a shuddering halt last week, after receiving a text confirming I was among the pandemic’s latest catch. My case adds to the rising slope of the third Omicron wave in seven months, currently rolling across Australia. While shivering through my mild bout, I’d optimistically thought that at least I would have several months’ reprieve from isolation precautions and testing. But emerging evidence suggests the possibility of reinfection within a shorter timeframe for newer subvariants. Experts have reduced the protective window of prior infection from 12 weeks to 28 days. This week, the New South Wales, Western Australia and Australian Capital Territory governments all announced those who’ve had COVID-19 before will need to test after 28 days if they experience symptoms. If positive, they’ll be treated as new cases. Reinfection – testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) after having recovered from a prior infection – is on the way up. Reinfection made up 1 per cent of all cases in the pre-Omicron period in England, but in recent weeks it comprised more than 25 per cent of daily cases there and 18 per cent in New York City. We do not yet have comparative Australian data, but it will likely be a similar story, given the emergence of BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants here. These are more easily transmitted and able to cause breakthrough infection in those previously vaccinated or infected. Understanding our risk of reinfection at an individual level is easier if we break it down into four key factors: The virus, each person’s immune response to past infection, vaccination status, and personal protective measures. There is not much we can do about the first two factors, but we can take action on the latter two. Much has been written about the immune system evading characteristics of the Omicron subvariants due to multiple new mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Pre-Omicron, infection with one variant (Alpha, Beta, Delta) gave long-lasting cross-variant immunity. This also gave effective protection against symptomatic infection. However, all that changed with the emergence of the Omicron BA.1 subvariant in late 2021, with studies demonstrating reduced cross-protection from prior infection that was linked to less robust antibody responses. Fast forward several months, and we can see even infection with early Omicron subvariants (BA.1, BA.2) does not necessarily protect us from their newer siblings (BA.4, BA.5). How our immune system dealt with the previous COVID-19 infection can influence how it negotiates a future exposure. We know immune-suppressed individuals are at increased risk of reinfection (or indeed relapse from a persistent infection). The large UK COVID Infection Survey shows that in the general population, people who report no symptoms or have lower concentrations of virus on their polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swabs with their prior infection are more likely to be reinfected than those with symptoms or higher viral concentrations. This indicates that when the body mounts a more robust immune response to the first infection, it builds defences against reinfection. Perhaps a slim silver lining for those who shivered, coughed and spluttered through COVID-19. When COVID-19 vaccinations were being rolled out in 2021, they provided both excellent protection against severe disease (resulting in hospitalisation or death) and symptomatic infection. Importantly, protection from severe disease still holds, due to our immune system responses against the parts of the virus that have not mutated from the original strain. But Omicron variants can infect people even if they’re vaccinated as the variants have found ways to escape “neutralisation” from vaccine antibodies. A new study shows six months after the second dose of an mRNA vaccination (such as Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna), the antibody levels against all Omicron subvariants are markedly reduced compared with the original Wuhan strain. That is, the vaccine’s ability to protect against infection with the subvariants drops off more quickly than it does against the original strain of the virus. Antibody levels across all variants rose again two weeks after participants had a booster shot, but BA.4 and BA.5 showed the smallest incremental gains. Interestingly in this study (and relevant to our highly immunised population), there were higher antibody levels in subjects who had been both infected and vaccinated. Again, the gains were smaller for the newer Omicron subvariants. Most of the discussion of late has been about the immune-evading prowess of the coronavirus. But don’t forget the virus still has to get into our respiratory tract to cause reinfection. SARS-CoV-2 is spread from person to person in the air by respiratory droplets and aerosols, and by touching contaminated surfaces. We can disrupt transmission by doing all the things we have been taught over the past two years – social distancing and wearing a mask when we can’t (preferably not a cloth one), regularly washing our hands, improving ventilation by opening windows and using an air purifier for poorly ventilated spaces. And we can isolate when we’re sick. There is some hopeful recent data that shows while reinfection might be commonplace, it is rarely associated with severe disease. It also shows booster shots provide some modest protection. While some (unlucky) individuals have become reinfected within a short time frame (less than 90 days), this appears to be uncommon and related to being young and mostly unvaccinated. Plans for the rollout of mRNA booster vaccines to target the Omicron spike protein mutations offer the promise of regaining some immunological control of these variants. That said, it will only be a matter of time before further mutations develop. The bottom line is it will be hard to outrun becoming infected or reinfected with a COVID variant in the years to come. We can’t do much about the evolution of the virus or our own immune systems, but we can dramatically reduce the risk of severe infection in ourselves (and our loved ones) and disruption to our lives, by staying up to date with vaccinations and following simple infection-control practices.

There were three fatalities, taking the death toll from coronavirus complications to 1,440. The cases reported on Wednesday were nearly three times that of Tuesday, when 5,979 COVID-19 infections were reported. “The increase in the number of cases today is due to the spike we typically see following a long weekend. The 7-day moving average number of local cases has remained stable over the past week, at about 8,400,” said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on its website. The last time Singapore reported more daily infections than Wednesday was on Mar 9, when 17,051 COVID-19 new cases were reported. Singapore's daily COVID-19 tally had remained under 10,000 between late March and late June. Since Jun 28, there have been three instances where more than 10,000 COVID-19 cases were reported in a day, two of which were on Tuesdays. Cases tend to increase on Tuesdays, with Health Minister Ong Ye Kung previously referring to such a pattern, writing on Facebook in October 2021 that numbers would ""always spike after the weekends"". The authorities have previously cautioned of a new Omicron wave in July or August, as COVID-19 antibodies start to wane. During Parliament last Tuesday, Mr Ong said the current COVID-19 wave will not be as severe as the Omicron wave earlier this year. He added that authorities had anticipated this wave when they learnt of the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. On Wednesday, a total of 734 patients were in hospital, according to the latest infection statistics on the MOH website. Ninety patients require oxygen supplementation. Fourteen patients were in the intensive care unit. Among the local cases reported on Wednesday, 15,072 cases tested positive via antigen rapid tests (ARTs) and have been assessed by doctors to have mild symptoms and are of low risk, said MOH. The remaining 906 local COVID-19 cases were confirmed via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Of the imported cases, 854 were tested with ARTs, and 38 were with PCR tests. The week-on-week infection ratio was 1.01. A number above 1 indicates that the number of new weekly COVID-19 cases is rising. Singapore has recorded 1,557,648 COVID-19 cases since the start of the pandemic. As of Tuesday, 96 per cent of Singapore's eligible population have completed their full vaccination regimen under the national vaccination programme.

The European Medicines Agency has not yet expressed a clear preference for the subvariant - BA.1 or BA.4/BA.5 - that these shots should be based on. BioNTech and Pfizer have also proposed a shot based on one Omicron subvariant only.     "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/shanghai-sweats-over-small-nagging-covid-19-outbreak-damaging-economy-2806556,Shanghai sweats over small but stubborn COVID-19 outbreak already hampering economy,"SHANGHAI: Anxiety levels rose along with temperatures in Shanghai on Wednesday (Jul 13), as medical workers sweated beneath their hazmat suits while administering compulsory mass testing for COVID-19 in a city that recently emerged from a painful two-month lockdown. China's commercial hub is battling an outbreak that has seen dozens of new infections recorded daily for the past week, and though the numbers are relatively low it has unnerved many among the city's 25 million people, who suffered during the lockdown in April and May. And daytime temperatures of around 40 degrees Celsius added to the febrile atmosphere among a population that dreads the psychological and financial costs of another such ordeal. Ying Jie, a personal trainer, said that even if Shanghai avoids another lockdown, he intends to close his gym for good, just one year after opening it, as he can no longer cope with the uncertainty. Gyms in some areas of the city, including Ying's, were ordered to suspend operations this week due to the outbreak. ""We were open from Jul 1 to Jul 10,"" Ying said. ""I can't not pay rent, but I can't open. If I open in secret and there are positive cases connected to my gym, I'll lose my licence. The risk of getting fined is too great."" While most other major countries are choosing to live with the virus, China has adhered to a ""dynamic zero-COVID"" policy that aims to eradicate outbreaks early, but its economy is paying a price. The authorities' hopes of success lie in relentless screening and targeted isolation orders, which have so far been issued to hundreds of residential buildings and business venues. Lockdowns in Shanghai and elsewhere earlier this year have battered the world's second-largest economy, with ripples felt across global supply chains and international trade. China's exports grew sharply in June, as earlier shipping bottlenecks eased, but subdued import growth pointed to weak domestic demand. Data on Friday is likely to show China's economy grew only 1 per cent in the second quarter, according to a Reuters poll, which shows full-year growth is expected at 4 per cent, far below China's roughly 5.5 per cent official target. ""The current outbreak in Shanghai and some other cities has again cast uncertainty over the economic recovery in Q3,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. City authorities have repeatedly dismissed talk of broader curbs, even as they warned about risks posed by the highly-transmissible Omicron BA.5.2.1 subvariant. All the 55 new local cases reported for Jul 12 were discovered among people already under isolation orders. But many residents are stocking up on basic supplies, preparing for the worst. ""There are no signs that they will lock down our neighbourhood right now. But there were also no signs the first time,"" said Omri Hephner, an Israeli business consultant. ""I will escape Shanghai as soon as I can this time, regardless of the signs I see,"" Hephner said, adding that he intends to go to Beijing, then home to Israel, and will only return to China once COVID-19 policies are relaxed. Overall, mainland China reported 261 new domestically-transmitted coronavirus infections on Jul 12, versus 347 the previous day. Nomura analysts estimate more than 30 cities are facing COVID-19 curbs. In the northwestern province of Gansu, which reported 69 local cases on Jul 12, the city of Lanzhou with over 4 million residents said on Wednesday that for the next seven days, only one person per household can leave residential compounds to get groceries. Non-essential workers are banned from going to offices. In the central province of Henan, key urban areas in the city of Zhumadian entered a three-day lockdown from Tuesday, with residents only allowed out for COVID-19 tests, hospital visits and shopping for basic necessities. The rules came after the town of Qinyang, which is under Zhumadian's jurisdiction, imposed an indefinite lockdown from Sunday on its nearly 700,000 residents. Infections have also been detected in the southern province of Guangdong, the eastern provinces of Shandong and Jiangsu and elsewhere. "

""Daily infections could soar to as many as 200,000 between mid-August and late September,"" Prime Minister Han Duck-soo told a government COVID-19 response meeting, citing the view of the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) and experts. The figure of 40,266 announced on Wednesday (Jul 13) represents an 8 per cent jump over the previous day and is the highest level since 43,908 on May 11. Levels of 200,000 per day were last seen in April. Han said people in their 50s and those with underlying diseases will become eligible for a second booster shot. Until now, only people aged 60 or above were eligible. The take-up rate has been low, however, with just 32 per cent opting to receive a fourth shot. South Korea in May ditched most of its pandemic-related restrictions, including an outdoor mask mandate, as cases slowed after peaking at more than 600,000 per day in mid-March. The government has no immediate plans to bring back restrictions but does not rule them out if there is a ""critical change"" in the COVID-19 situation, Han said. A seven-day quarantine requirement for those with COVID-19 remains in place, he added. "

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was worried that case numbers were continuing to rise, putting further pressure on stretched health systems and workers. ""New waves of the virus demonstrate again that COVID-19 is nowhere near over,"" he told a news conference, adding: ""As the virus pushes at us, we must push back."" ""The virus is running freely and countries are not effectively managing the disease burden based on their capacity, in terms of both hospitalisation for acute cases and the expanding number of people with post-COVID condition, often referred to as Long COVID,"" he said. ""As COVID-19 transmission and hospitalisations rise, governments must also deploy tried and tested measures like masking, improved ventilation and test and treat protocols,"" Tedros insisted. The WHO's emergency committee on COVID-19 met on Friday via video-conference and determined the pandemic remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern - the highest alarm the WHO can sound. WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan told the meeting global COVID-19 cases reported to the WHO increased by 30 per cent in the last two weeks, largely driven by Omicron sub-variants BA.4, BA.5 and and the lifting of public health and social measures. Ryan said recent changes in testing policies were hindering the detection of cases and the monitoring of virus evolution. The committee stressed the need to reduce transmission of the virus as the implications of a pandemic caused by a new respiratory virus would not be fully understood, the WHO said in a statement on Monday. The group voiced concern over steep reductions in testing, resulting in reduced surveillance and genomic sequencing. ""This impedes assessments of currently circulating and emerging variants of the virus,"" the WHO said, feeding the inability to interpret trends in transmission. The committee said the trajectory of virus evolution and the characteristics of emerging variants remained ""uncertain and unpredictable"", with the absence of measures to reduce transmission increasing the likelihood of ""new, fitter variants emerging, with different degrees of virulence, transmissibility, and immune escape potential""."

The nagging daily case tolls in the commercial hub of 25 million and other outbreaks scattered across China have also unnerved global financial markets in recent days, with investors wary of disruptive COVID restrictions. China's ""dynamic zero-COVID"" policy aims to eradicate all outbreaks promptly, against a global trend of co-existing with the virus. The world's No 2 economy already suffered severe damage from sweeping COVID-19 restrictions in the second quarter, affecting global supply chains and international trade. Shanghai authorities have repeatedly dismissed talk of broader curbs, relying on targeted lockdowns and relentless testing to contain outbreaks, which have included infections with the highly-transmissible Omicron BA.5.2.1 subvariant. But online chat groups used by residents to organise group purchases of basic necessities during the April-May lockdown have livened up again, with people swapping advice over what items were selling out in supermarkets. ""A building nearby was sealed up and I'm thinking of stocking up on some food,"" said Shanghai resident Wang Jie. ""Once my boss allows work from home, I will pack up my luggage overnight and leave Shanghai."" The prolonged isolation has left many mental scars on Shanghai residents, who lost income and struggled with access to basic goods. At times, the frustration led to rare bursts of public anger, with residents banging pots and pans out of their windows in protest. ""When they said last time that we would only be locked down for four days that didn't happen,"" said another Shanghai resident, declining to give their name. ""When they come out and deny rumours we don't believe them now."" More than 200 buildings have been placed under lockdown across Shanghai, which reported 59 new cases for Jul 11, down from 69 the day before. All but three cases were already under isolation orders. Residents in some compounds which are not on the official list of targeted lockdowns say they have also been told not to leave their homes for at least two days because close contacts of an infected person lived in those buildings. The latest testing campaign involves more than half of the city's 16 districts and will take place from Tuesday to Wednesday, with residents asked to test twice over the period. The inconvenience for those getting their nostrils swabbed on Tuesday was compounded by temperatures of around 40 degrees Celsius (102F) as parts of China were hit by a heatwave. The increased demand for goods is causing delays of several hours on online supermarket deliveries, residents in different areas of Shanghai said. Overall, mainland China reported 347 new domestically-transmitted COVID-19 infections on Jul 11, versus 352 the previous day - numbers that other countries would largely ignore. Nomura analysts estimate 31 cities were implementing various COVID-19 restrictions as of Monday, up from 11 a week earlier, highlighting ""the risk of falling growth"". Second-quarter gross domestic product data on Friday and other economic indicators this week are likely to show a sharp economic slowdown from last year. Chinese shares weakened further on Tuesday. The central province of Henan, where two towns with a combined population of roughly 1 million are under lockdown, reported 73 local infections for Jul 11. In the southern province of Guangdong, which reported 42 local cases, the city of Zhuhai said on Tuesday schools must suspend in-person classes, after one kindergarten teacher was confirmed with COVID. Infections have also been detected in the eastern provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, and elsewhere in China."

China began testing the packaging of chilled and frozen food imports for the virus in June 2020, after a cluster of infections among workers at a wholesale food market in Beijing. Six months later, Beijing also advised testing on ambient products too, even as scientists said the risk of coronavirus infection through contact with contaminated surfaces was low. Local governments no longer need to test ambient foods or other goods for the virus, said the National Health Commission on its website, but it was not clear if the products would still be subject to checks at customs. Chilled and frozen foods will continue to be tested, however, but exporters will not face import suspensions when their goods test positive at customs checks, added the NHC. The steps come amid growing efforts to support China's flagging economy. China has linked previous COVID-19 outbreaks among dock workers with the detection of the virus on frozen food. But its intensive scrutiny and testing and disinfection of imported produce has added significant cost and disrupted trade. The virus has been detected on hundreds of chilled and frozen food shipments since 2020, with major suppliers of meat, seafood and other products suspended for weeks. Some local governments have gone beyond national rules, with the city of Lhasa, capital of Tibet, banning imported frozen foods outright in an effort to reduce risk of the virus. "

According to Eurostat, the population of the 27 countries that make up the bloc fell by close to 172,000 from the previous year and over 656,000 from January 2020. ""In 2020 and 2021 the positive net migration no longer compensated for the negative natural change in the EU and, as a consequence, the EU total population has been decreasing,"" it said, pointing to impacts from the pandemic. The number of deaths began outstripping births in the EU a decade ago, but immigration from outside the bloc helped offset the gap until the first year of the pandemic. The previous time the EU had registered a fall in population was in 2011 - the only other time since 1960 - but this rapidly picked up due to net migration. Given the pandemic, an aging population and relatively low fertility rates, Eurostat said deaths should continue to outstrip births in the coming years. ""Should this be the case,"" it said, ""the EU's overall population decline or growth in the future is likely to depend largely on the contribution made by net migration"". While Italy, Poland and Romania recorded the largest population falls, more than half EU member states saw their populations increase, led by France, the Netherlands and Sweden. Eurostat counted 446.8 million people living inside the EU at January 2022."

Previously, users were not required to register with their personal details, and the app was used to enter venues and display vaccination records. Announcing the changes at a news conference on Monday (Jul 11), Lo Chung-Mau, the city's new health secretary, said that he hoped the app would be updated soon and that it would help to enforce quarantine orders for people required to isolate at home. People infected with the virus would be coded red on the app, and people undergoing quarantine would be coded yellow and have to wear tracking wristbands. Residents arriving into Hong Kong from overseas will be able to isolate at home after a set period in hotel quarantine under this system, Lo said, without giving further details. All arrivals into Hong Kong are still mandated to do one week of hotel quarantine and comply with frequent testing orders, including stool samples for babies and a raft of forms. The Chinese special administrative region has some of the strictest coronavirus regulations in the world outside mainland China, which is pursuing a ""dynamic zero COVID"" strategy of eradicating outbreaks as soon as they occur. Hong Kong enforces fewer restrictions, but its policy still contrasts to the rest of the world which is co-existing with the virus. Hong Kong's government last week suspended a rule that suspended specific airline flights if they brought in too many passengers infected with the COVID-19 virus. At the same time, officials have ramped up coronavirus testing across the city. ""We understand the aspiration for better arrangements to connect with the world and to revive economic activities, we are looking at more precise quarantine measures,” Lo said. The flight suspensions and mandatory hotel quarantine have hammered Hong Kong's competitiveness, said business executives who are hoping the city's new leader, John Lee, will scrap quarantine rules. Hong Kong has reported more than 1.2 million coronavirus infections and around 9,400 deaths. Authorities reported 2,863 new cases on Monday. "

While existing coronavirus vaccines continue to provide good protection against hospitalisation and death, vaccine effectiveness has taken a hit as the virus has evolved. EU health agencies have since April recommended a second booster only for those older than 80 and the most vulnerable. The new recommendation is expected to facilitate national decisions to speed up vaccination campaigns, which have been slowing to nearly a halt in recent months. ""We are currently seeing increasing COVID-19 case notification rates and an increasing trend in hospital and ICU admissions and occupancy in several countries mainly driven by the BA 5 sublineage of (the) Omicron (coronavirus variant),"" said Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), in a statement. ""This signals the start of a new, widespread COVID-19 wave across the European Union,"" she said, adding that giving the over-60s and medically vulnerable a second booster now would avert a significant number of hospitalisations and deaths. Vaccine makers, such as Moderna Inc and partners Pfizer Inc and BioNTech, have been testing versions of their COVID-19 vaccines modified to combat the BA.1 Omicron variant. Although they have said those vaccines generated a good immune response against BA.1 and the more recently circulating variants, they did see a lower response against BA.4 and BA.5. The European Medicines Agency (EMA), which is currently reviewing two variant-adapted vaccines, expects to have the first next-generation vaccines approved by September. ""In the meantime, it is important to consider using currently authorised vaccines as second boosters in people who are most vulnerable,"" said EMA executive director Emir Cooke. There is no clear evidence to support giving a second booster dose to people below 60 years of age who are not at higher risk of severe disease, the ECDC added on Monday.   "

The tough curbs by local governments follow China's ""dynamic zero-COVID"" policy of promptly stamping out all outbreaks at a time when much of the world co-exists with the virus. China has said curbs must be as targeted as possible to reduce damage to the world's number two economy, after this year's major disruptions clogged global supply chains and hit international trade. The discovery of a local infection with the BA.5.2.1 subvariant raises the stakes of quickly limiting a small outbreak to avert more disruptive steps similar to the lockdown in April and May that roiled the global economy and markets. The BA.5 lineage, spreading fast in many other countries, has been detected in cities such as Xian in the province of Shaanxi and Dalian in Liaoning province, hundreds of kilometres on either side of Beijing. It was first found in China on May 13 in a patient who had flown to Shanghai from Uganda, the China Center for Disease Prevention and Control said, with no local infections linked to the case that month. China's yuan currency eased against the dollar, with stocks weaker as well. Data from China, including June trade figures on Wednesday (Jul 13) and last month's retail sales, industrial output and the April-June gross domestic product numbers on Friday, are likely to confirm the economy slowed sharply in the second quarter amid coronavirus lockdowns in Shanghai and elsewhere. Shanghai, the most populous city with 25 million people, has told residents of several districts to get tested twice in another round of mass screening from Tuesday to Thursday, similar to last week's. Its residents are already testing every few days to secure access to various locations and public transport. Authorities, and some investors, hope such relentless testing will uncover infections early enough to keep them in check. Early controls had reduced the risk of a prolonged major city lockdown, UBS Global Wealth Management said. ""We expect COVID restrictions, mainly in the form of rolling mini-lockdowns for the rest of the year, which would be less disruptive to production or supply chains, along with the gradual rollout of more supportive policies,"" it said in a note. Daily counts of locally transmitted infections in Shanghai increased to several dozens since Jul 5, up from single digits earlier this month, but are still tiny by global standards. Most of its recent cases have been among those already in quarantine. Mainland China reported 352 new domestically transmitted COVID infections on Jul 10, 46 of these symptomatic and 306 asymptomatic, the National Health Commission said on Monday. In the central province of Henan, the town of Qinyang has almost completely locked down its nearly 700,000 residents from Sunday, with one person in each household allowed a trip every two days for groceries. Authorities in Wugang, another town in Henan, have told its 290,000 residents not to leave home in the next three days, except for COVID tests. Four major districts in the northwestern city of Lanzhou, in the province of Gansu, and the southern cities of Danzhou and Haikou in Hainan province, are under temporary curbs for several days, with a total of 6 million people affected. The city of Nanchang in southern Jiangxi province, with 6.3 million residents, shut some entertainment venues on Saturday, although the duration of the curbs was not specified. In the northwestern province of Qinghai, the city of Xining kicked off a mass testing campaign on Monday after one person tested positive on Sunday. Mass tests also began on Monday in several major districts of the southern metropolis of Guangzhou. "

The end of the free-wheeling briefings, which broke with years of tradition as President Yoon Suk-yeol sought to step up transparency, also comes amid growing questions over scandal and party turmoil. Yoon's approval ratings stood at 37 per cent, pollster Realmeter's survey showed on Monday, down from more than 52 per cent in the first week of June, while 57 per cent now disapproved of his performance. In its statement, Yoon's office said other coverage of the president would also be limited, with spokespersons switching to mainly written comments, along with photographs and videos of his events, rather than holding in-person briefings. ""In view of the vulnerability to the spread of infectious diseases, we ask for your understanding,"" it added. Health authorities have warned the country is facing a new wave of infections, with some experts predicting hundreds of thousands of new cases in coming weeks. Monday's 12,693 new COVID-19 infections took South Korea's tally to 18,524,583, with 18 deaths for a toll of 24,661 since the pandemic began. After holding down infections and deaths for much of the pandemic with strict tracing, tracking and quarantine measures, South Korea dropped most curbs this year despite a huge wave of Omicron-variant infections. Scandal has cost Yoon two nominees for a single ministerial position, a first in South Korea's history, and ethics questions have plagued several other picks for top office. On Friday, his conservative People Power Party (PPP) was forced to suspend its leader Lee Jun-seok, 37, over accusations of sexual misconduct in 2013. "

The city's 30-plus casinos and other businesses will shut for one week and people were ordered to stay at home though short trips for essential services were allowed. Police will monitor flows of people outside and stringent punishments will be imposed for those who disobey, the government said. Although many casinos have been effectively closed for the past three weeks with only minimal staffing allowed, the more drastic measures hit investor confidence hard. Some analysts predicted that any recovery in gaming revenue might not happen until the end of the third quarter or during the fourth quarter. ""We would probably need to write-off July and likely August as well from the models,"" said DS Kim, an analyst at J.P. Morgan. Shares in Sands China plunged 9 per cent, while shares in Melco International, Wynn Macau, SJM, Galaxy, MGM China dropped between 6 per cent and 7 per cent. Macau has recorded around 1,500 COVID-19 infections since mid-June. Around 19,000 people are in mandatory quarantine as the government adheres to China's ""zero-COVID"" policy that aims to stamp out all outbreaks, running counter to a global trend of trying to co-exist with the virus. More than 30 zones in the city that have been deemed high risk are now under lockdown, meaning no one is allowed to enter or exit for at least 5 days. While the government said it was not imposing a citywide lockdown, the stringent measures mean Macau is effectively closed. Casinos were last shut in Macau in February 2020 for 15 days. The government has previously been hesitant to close casinos due to its mandate to protect jobs. The industry employs most of the population directly and indirectly and accounts for more than 80 per cent of government revenues. Frustration is mounting at the government's handling of the outbreak. Fights have broken out at testing centres while some residents have had to queue for more than 20 hours to access healthcare facilities. Residents will be required to take part in mass COVID-19 tests four times this week. They have already been tested six times since mid-June and are expected to do rapid antigen tests daily. More than 90 per cent of Macau's 600,000 residents are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 but this is the first time the city has had to grapple with the fast-spreading Omicron variant. Authorities have added two hotels in popular casino resorts to be used as COVID-19 medical facilities as they try to increase capacity to handle the surge of infections. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/oil-drops-china-covid-19-worries-2801261,Oil drops on China COVID-19 worries,"MELBOURNE: Oil prices fell on Monday (Jul 11) in volatile trade, reversing some gains from the previous session as markets braced for new mass COVID-19 testing in China potentially hitting demand, a worry that outweighed ongoing concerns about tight supply. Brent crude futures fell US$1.02, or 1 per cent, to US$106.00 at 0605 GMT, after climbing 2.3 per cent on Friday. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures declined by US$1.38, or 1.3 per cent, to US$103.41, paring a 2 per cent gain from Friday. Trading was thinned by a public holiday in parts of Southeast Asia, including oil trading hub Singapore. The market was rattled by news that China had discovered its first case of a highly transmissible Omicron subvariant in Shanghai and that new cases had jumped to 63 in the country's largest city from 52 a day earlier. ""The market's just responding to news flow and China has grabbed the most attention so far,"" said Commonwealth Bank commodities analyst Vivek Dhar. Traders were nervous that the discovery of the new subvariant and the highest number of daily new cases in Shanghai since May could lead to another round of mass testing, which would hurt fuel demand, he said. Both benchmark crude contracts traded lower in early trade on Monday, turned positive, then turned back down again after the latest COVID-19 news from China. ""Net long positions in WTI crude futures are now at their lowest level since March 2020, when demand collapsed amid the initial outbreak of COVID-19. This is despite ongoing signs of tightness,"" ANZ Research analysts said in a note. Looking to ease tight supplies, US President Joe Biden will be holding talks this week with Saudi Arabia's leaders to mend ties with the world's largest oil producer following the 2018 murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. ""Just the idea of repairing that relationship between Saudi Arabia and the US is important. But the market's not expecting him (Biden) to come back with immediate supply relief,"" Dhar said. The market remains jittery about plans by Western nations to cap Russian oil prices, with President Vladimir Putin warning further sanctions could lead to ""catastrophic"" consequences in the global energy market. Another key factor traders will be watching is maintenance on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, the biggest single pipeline carrying Russian gas to Germany, due to run from Jul 11 to Jul 21. Governments, markets and companies are worried the shut-down might be extended due to war in Ukraine. Failure of the pipeline to come back on as scheduled on Jul 22 could lead to gas demand destruction in Europe, which would spur an economic slowdown and dent oil demand, said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management. Questions also remain about how long more crude will flow from Kazakhstan via the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC). Supply has continued so far on the pipeline, which carries about 1 per cent of global oil, even after it was ordered by a Russian court last week to suspend operations. "

Both Pfizer and Moderna have been testing retooled versions of their vaccines to include the Omicron variant. Earlier this month, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other global health regulators said that COVID-19 vaccines tweaked to include the Omicron variant strain could improve protection when used as a booster. With vaccine effectiveness taking a hit as the virus evolves, an Omicron-specific booster could ""increase and extend"" protection, the EMA said. In Singapore, about 50 per cent of COVID-19 infections were from the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said in Parliament on Jul 5. He added that the percentage of infections caused by the subvariants “has been doubling every week” and that it is expected to be 70 to 80 per cent this coming week. However, Mr Ong said that the current COVID-19 wave will not be as severe as the Omicron wave earlier this year. On Sunday, MOH also said the ministry and expert committee “strongly recommend” that all persons due to receive their boosters do so ""without delay"". “This is especially so that they can stay protected against COVID-19, particularly in light of the recent increase in cases,” said MOH. Singapore reported 6,423 new COVID-19 infections on Sunday, of which 6,200 were local cases. There have been 1,530,304 COVID-19 cases in Singapore since the start of the pandemic. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/china-shanghai-covid-19-new-omicron-ba521-subvariant-2800386,New Omicron subvariant BA.5.2.1 found in Shanghai,"SHANGHAI: The city of Shanghai has discovered a COVID-19 case involving a new Omicron subvariant BA.5.2.1, an official told a briefing on Sunday (Jul 10), signalling the complications China faces to keep up with new mutations as it pursues its ""zero-COVID"" policy. The case, found in the financial district of Pudong on Jul 8, was linked with a case from overseas, said Zhao Dandan, vice-director of the city's health commission. Shanghai, in eastern China, emerged from a lockdown lasting around two months at the start of June, but it has continued to impose tough restrictions, locking down buildings and compounds as soon as new potential transmission chains emerge. ""Our city has recently continued to report more locally transmitted positive cases (of COVID-19) and the risk of the epidemic spreading through society remains very high,"" Zhao of the Shanghai health commission warned. He said residents in several major Shanghai districts would undergo two rounds of COVID-19 tests, from Jul 12 to 14, in a bid to bring potential new outbreaks under control. The Omicron BA.5 variant, which is driving a new wave of COVID-19 infections overseas, was first discovered in China on May 13 in a 37-year old male patient who had flown to Shanghai from Uganda, according to the China Center for Disease Prevention and Control. Variant BA.5 has been shown to have an accelerated rate of transmission and an improved immune escape capability, said Yuan Zhengan, a member of the city's expert advisory group on COVID-19 prevention, speaking at the Sunday briefing. But vaccination is still effective at preventing BA.5 from causing serious illness or death, he added. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/covid-omicron-surge-tighten-measures-live-music-2796826,Commentary: I’m not taking live music for granted amid this current COVID-19 surge,"SINGAPORE: Viral busking sensation Jeff Ng has been all over the news lately for a variety of reasons. But he originally shot to fame because of the large crowds at his show outside The Cathay last month. Of course, Singaporeans’ love for busking performances is not new. Many of us probably had a soft spot for the visually impaired singer who used to perform at the Orchard Road underpass between Takashimaya Shopping Centre and Lucky Plaza in the pre-pandemic days. Others, like singer-songwriter Jason Yu, got their start in the music business by busking.   Still, Ng’s performances have drawn hundreds, with social media videos showing the audience packing the outdoor plaza of The Cathay as they sang and waved smartphone flashlights along to the music.
Perhaps this shows just how much people miss live music after two years of pandemic-related silence.  I vividly remember feeling emotional the first time I watched a live band after restrictions on live music performances were lifted in end-March. After two long years of dancing on my own in my living room to live streamed music, it was liberating to watch musicians in person once again.  And it’s clear I’m not alone. Fellow music lovers have been flocking to venues that offer performances and DJ acts. Many F&B venues that offer live performances reported a robust response to the lifting of these measures, with fully booked reservations on weekends and sales surging, showing just how much pent up demand there is. How else to describe that shared joy and camaraderie in being among a group of music lovers, getting so caught up in the music that we cannot help but bop along, tap our feet and sing along to familiar tunes?  On a screen, it’s just impossible to replicate how the musicians interact with the crowd. Even with the best headphones, you feel a different beat to the live performance.  That said, after avoiding crowded areas for so long, there is that inadvertent sense of anxiety in immersing oneself back into the midst of large groups – especially as we are “near the peak, if not at the peak” of a fresh COVID-19 wave. Singapore reported 12,784 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday (Jul 5) and the week-on-week infection ratio has been above 1 since Jun 14 – indicating that the number of new weekly cases is rising. It was reported that some spectators at Ng’s performance kept their masks on as a precaution even though mask-wearing in an outdoor setting is currently optional. As somewhat of a germaphobe, I can understand this sentiment.  Even though I am double vaccinated and boosted, I see no reason in increasing my risk of exposure to the virus. Plus, flu and common cold viruses are still circulating and I can certainly do without the uncertainty of picking up a bug and spending days wondering if I have caught COVID-19.  Personally, when I go to venues where there are performances and where I expect there to be crowds, I try to reserve a table so that I have a pocket of “breathing space”. I also prefer outdoor settings like beach bars or make an effort to keep my mask on as much as possible, even if I have a drink in hand.  These efforts allow me to feel less worried about my health so that I can still go out and enjoy life in the “new normal” of these uncertain times. Over the past months, I have celebrated friends’ birthdays at boisterous karaoke sessions and enjoyed dancing in the sunset on the beach while listening to the thumping beats of a live DJ act. In the past, I might have barely remembered these experiences if not for a few snapshots taken with friends to post on social media.  But recently, I have noticed how carefully I savour each music outing I make, almost like I have found a long lost love and am afraid that it might disappear once again. Like many of my fellow music lovers, we request for our favourite songs and cajole the musicians to give us one last encore - and then one more for good measure. Perhaps there is a lingering concern that live music acts may be temporarily curbed again, if this current COVID-19 surge continues or if new threatening variants rear their ugly head. While Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong has recently said that there is no need to tighten safe management measures at this stage, the Government is monitoring the situation closely. If need be, the government will have to make adjustments, he added. We certainly understand that measures may have to be tightened to save lives and to ease the load on healthcare workers who are still valiantly at the frontline of battle. COVID-19 hospitalisations have increased “quite significantly”, to the point that hospitals have started to cut back on non-COVID and elective procedures. So it is no surprise music lovers are savouring every opportunity we can get to revel in the good vibes and support local musicians’ livelihoods as much as we can in the meantime.  I intend to live fully in the moment just in case live music is (temporarily) silenced once again. Karen Tee is a freelance lifestyle and travel journalist based in Singapore."

Essential services including hotels, supermarkets and pharmacies will however remain open, city officials said as they announced the measures at a press conference on Saturday. The announcement came as Macau reported 71 new COVID cases on Saturday (Jul 9), taking the total to 1,374 since mid-June. More than 17,000 people are in quarantine, authorities have said. Local authorities have added two hotels in popular casino resorts to be used as COVID-19 medical facilities from Friday as they try to increase capacity to handle the surge of infections. More than 90 per cent of Macau's residents are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 but this is the first time the city has had to grapple with the fast-spreading Omicron variant. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/china-xi-jinping-deeply-regrets-shinzo-abe-japan-death-2798706,China's Xi Jinping 'deeply regrets' death of Japan's Shinzo Abe,"BEIJING: China's President Xi Jinping expressed his condolences on Saturday (Jul 9) over the death of former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, whom Xi said had worked hard to improve relations between the neighbours, Chinese state media reported. Japan's longest serving modern leader was shot on Friday in the Japanese city of Nara while making a campaign speech for a parliamentary election. A 41-year-old Japanese male suspect has been arrested. ""I deeply regret his sudden death,"" state media quoted Xi as saying on behalf of the Chinese government and people in a message to Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. ""I once reached important consensus with him on building China-Japan relations."" Xi also extended his condolences to Abe's family, state television reported. Ties between Japan and China have been plagued for years by a territorial dispute over a group of East China Sea islets as well as the legacy of Japan's past military aggression. But relations warmed while Abe's was prime minister, particularly during his second term from 2012 to 2020. Abe made a rare state visit to China in 2018 and, in return, Xi was expected to visit Japan in 2020, which would have marked the first trip by a Chinese president to Japan since 2008. But the plan was shelved because of the COVID-19 outbreak. Bilateral ties have become more complex in recent months, with Kishida's government calling for increased defence spending and expressing concern over threats faced by Taiwan. Kishida has also said he was disappointed by efforts by China to develop areas in the East China Sea, saying it was ""unacceptable"". The dispute over the East China Sea islands, which Japan controls but China also claims, and the waters around them, has been a longtime source of tension between the world's second- and third-biggest economies. In his message to Kishida, Xi said he was willing to work with him on developing friendly and neighbourly ties."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/wellness/race-start-line-returning-running-after-having-covid-19-2788121,The race to the start line: Returning to running after having COVID-19,"In March 2020, Dr Niall Elliott was planning for the Summer Olympics with his colleagues at the British Olympic Association. Plans were drawn for what to do if an athlete suffered a catastrophic injury or a mental health crisis in the final lead up to the Games. There were meetings on how to move some of the world’s finest athletes across the globe and how to address logistical snafus. They had plans in place for nearly everything, except a global pandemic, he said. Overnight, Dr Elliott began providing support and care for athletes who were locked out of training facilities and fearful of how this new virus could affect their athletic careers. The questions were endless and the answers scarce. “We were very cautious at the start because it was a new virus,” Dr Elliott said. “We just didn’t know what the impact would be on the body.” The urgent question for athletes: How long would COVID-19 knock you out and when could you get back to training? Olympians and weekend warriors have been asking that question ever since. And the answer continues to shift as doctors learn more about the coronavirus and as its variants wreak havoc on training schedules. The key is resetting expectations and rethinking a timeline for a full return to play or a return to running. “Compared to most viral illnesses, the expectation that athletes should have is that it takes on average twice as long to get back to where you were,” said Dr Tod Olin, the director of the Exercise and Performance Breathing Center at National Jewish Health in Denver, US. “So if someone usually returns to their activity within a week of having a seasonal flu, it may take two weeks to come back after having COVID-19. But it’s also taken some three to four weeks for a lot of people, and a fraction of people take considerably longer.” That’s a hard pill to swallow for athletes looking to return to their previous selves as soon as symptoms subside. And it’s not easy to tell runners to slow down when many of their goals are to speed up. In June 2020, Dr Elliott published a protocol that has evolved and been adopted by other physicians as more data has become available on the virus and how it affects athletes. The initial protocol pointed to a six-stage gradual return to play, starting with a minimum rest period of 10 days and working up to increased frequency, duration and intensity of training sessions. In the two years since, doctors have distinguished how to direct athletes based on above-neck symptoms and below-neck symptoms. Patients who have above-neck symptoms tend to recover more quickly and are able to return to athletics faster than those with below-neck symptoms who may suffer from fatigue, aches, pains and lung or heart issues. That distinction – along with patients who test positive but remain asymptomatic – helped Dr Elliott adjust his guidance to a five-stage protocol, one that better serves athletes looking to return to training. Patients now can skip ahead to different stages of the protocol depending on their symptoms and their severity. And in the year of post-vaccine data, doctors have found that pushing the pace or intensity in training sessions can dramatically backfire. “They are used to solving all problems by trying harder,” Dr Olin, who has worked extensively with Olympic athletes, said. “And COVID-19 is seemingly unique if you push too hard – if you train through this – there’s this phenomenon of the setback, one that’s analogous to a hamstring injury, where if you were getting a little bit better and then you try to drop the hammer for a workout and you are three months back.” It’s a sentiment doctors and experts are sharing even more widely post-vaccines, warning of regression if athletes return to high intensity training or racing before their body is ready. “You will always have another competition, another race, another training session,” Dr Elliott echoed. “But you only have one body,” he added. “You’ve got to look after it.” By Talya Minsberg © 2022 The New York Times

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/omicron-ba5-subvariant-spread-widely-malaysia-2796726,"Omicron BA.5 subvariant likely to spread widely in Malaysia, says Khairy","KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia has been experiencing an increase of COVID-19 cases in the past week with the BA.5 Omicron subvariant believed to be widely spreading in the country, said Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin on Friday (Jul 8). Mr Khairy said that there was a 31 per cent increase in the number of cases in the last five days, compared to the corresponding period a week before.   The number of those admitted to hospitals meanwhile has also increased by 13.7 per cent, although the majority or 54 per cent of these admissions were non-serious cases under categories one and two. The rise in the number of cases had already been predicted, as has been the trend worldwide, said Mr Khairy.  There were several factors causing the increase with the main factor due to the dominant Omicron subvariants, he added.  “At the world stage, the Omicron BA4 and BA.5 sub-lineage variants are dominating … The worrying variant is the BA.5 which has risen from 37 per cent to 52 per cent globally (of cases),” said Mr Khairy.  He said that as of June, a total of 13 Omicron subvariant cases have been detected in the country including six cases of BA.2.12.1, five BA.5, and two BA.5.2.  However, no BA.4 cases had been detected from their genomic sequencing yet. According to Mr Khairy, based on the COVID-19 positive cases that underwent genomic sequencing in May and June, the BA.5 variant is already in Malaysia.   “It is highly likely that BA.5 is spreading widely in the country … We expect that BA.5 will cause an increase in the number of cases in the country,” he added.  He said that based on their information, the variant had immune evasion properties that could cause reinfection of those who were previously diagnosed with COVID-19. “If you have been infected with COVID-19, by the original Omicron variant, you can be reinfected with BA.5. That is why we are hearing of many cases of people being reinfected in a short span of time,” he said. Malaysia recorded 4,020 COVID-19 cases on Thursday, taking the cumulative national tally to more than 4.58 million since the pandemic began. The last time Malaysia reported more daily cases than the 4000 mark was on April 24, when there were 4,006 infections. The number of daily cases peaked above 32,000 infections in March before gradually dropping. Malaysia has reported 35,795 deaths due to the virus since the beginning of the pandemic.  Mr Khairy also advised adults who have not taken their first booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine to do so, saying that 7.3 million eligible Malaysians or 31.4 per cent of adults have yet to do so. He also urged Malaysians to adhere to public health measures such as wearing masks, saying that people were becoming more lax, including not being masked in enclosed areas.  He said that while the public would no longer be issued with compounds for offences such as this, he hoped that everyone would play their part in breaking the chain of infections. “We don’t want to go back to issuing compounds to people,” he said.  Mr Khairy also said that they had yet to detect any case of Monkeypox in the country, although a 45-year-old Malaysian man in Singapore had been infected with the disease.  He said that the man had been to Johor Bahru in early July.  The authorities had identified 14 of his casual contacts and one close contact who is being quarantined for the time being, said Mr Khairy.    "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/shanghai-china-cinema-reopen-2796101,Shanghai reopens cinemas but warns of COVID-19 risks amid outbreaks,"SHANGHAI: Shanghai reopened most cinemas on Friday (Jul 8), sticking to a plan of gradual resumption of daily activities after it lifted a two-month COVID-19 lockdown in June while also trying, like several other Chinese cities, to contain resurgent infections. Seeking to avoid a repeat of the ordeal that the commercial hub of 25 million suffered in April and May, Shanghai's strategy rests on frequent COVID-19 testing, thorough contact tracing and isolated lockdowns of residential buildings and other venues. Tougher restrictions may be needed if it fails to contain the virus. That would be a dire prospect for its residents who are only just recovering from the income losses, mental stress and poor access to basic necessities suffered during the lockdown. The city's latest outbreak is linked to illegal karaoke services in a single building. ""The cluster has a wide distribution of infected people, who had many social activities, and there are hidden transmission risks in the community,"" the city government said in a statement. Several other cities across China were also racing to smother outbreaks early, once again raising concerns about China's economic growth outlook and potential disruptions to supply chains and international trade. The efforts, which have fuelled frustration among Chinese in a sensitive year for the ruling Communist Party, are part of China's ""zero COVID"" strategy to eradicate any outbreaks as soon as they occur, despite the great costs incurred. Premier Li Keqiang was quoted by state media on Thursday as saying that the world's second-largest economy was recovering from the supply shocks incurred while fighting COVID-19 earlier this year, ""but the foundation is unstable"". China is facing geopolitical headwinds, a property market downturn, and rising borrowing costs in most of its export markets, and some analysts say its growth target of around 5.5 per cent this year may be out of reach. President Xi Jinping, who is expected to secure a precedent-breaking third term later this year, has said China should not treat the virus as endemic as much of the world now does, as that would put many lives at risk. With no end in sight to anti-COVID-19 vigilance, residents across China will have to put up with relentless testing and the prospect of facing quarantine at any time, among other inconveniences. Shanghai will conduct another round of mass COVID-19 tests on Saturday and Sunday, in line with a plan to test its entire population every weekend until the end of the month. The city just finished a Tuesday to Thursday testing campaign. Shanghai reported 45 new COVID cases for Jul 7, down from 54 the day before, mostly among people already under isolation orders. The city is gradually reopening cinemas, theatres and other performance venues from Friday according to its post-lockdown plans. Some venues postponed their reopening as a precaution and are now refunding tickets, Chinese media reported. Movie-goers will have to keep at least one seat free between them, with cinemas having to operate at 50 per cent capacity. Cinema tickets sales exceeded 1.4 million yuan (US$208,762) by noon on Friday, and Jurassic World Dominion was the most popular film, according to Maoyan Entertainment. Most of Shanghai's 300-plus cinemas had been closed since early March. China's total caseload for Thursday was 478, higher than Wednesday's 409 - numbers which authorities in most other countries would now largely ignore. Most cases were detected in the eastern Anhui province where more than 1 million people in small towns are locked down. There were dozens of new cases also in the Jiangsu province, and a few in Shaanxi and others. The were no new cases detected in Beijing on Thursday."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/macao-more-casino-hotels-covid-19-medical-facilities-2795931,Macao uses two more casino hotels for COVID-19 medical facilities,"HONG KONG: Macao authorities have added two hotels in popular casino resorts to be used as COVID-19 medical facilities from Friday (Jul 8) as they try to increase capacity to handle a surge of infections in the world's biggest gambling hub. The east wing of Grand Lisboa Palace owned by SJM Holdings and the Grand Hyatt hotel owned by Melco Resorts will together provide close to 800 rooms, they said. Sands China's Sheraton hotel and Londoner resort have already been used as quarantine facilities. The announcement comes as Macao reported 128 new cases on Thursday, taking the total to 1,215 cases since mid-June. More than 15,000 people are in quarantine, according to authorities. Authorities have locked down 22 residential buildings across Macao as they carry out a fifth round of city-wide mass testing for all residents. Sealed buildings include the landmark Grand Lisboa hotel on Macao's bustling main peninsula. More than 500 people were locked inside the hotel for at least five days from Tuesday after infected cases were found there. The former Portuguese colony only has one public hospital for its more than 600,000 residents, and its medical system was already stretched prior to the coronavirus outbreak. Authorities have set up a makeshift hospital in a sports dome near the city's Las Vegas style Cotai strip and have around 600 medical workers from the mainland assisting them. More than 90 per cent of Macao's residents are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 but this is the first time the city is grappling with the fast-spreading Omicron coronavirus variant. Macao adheres to China's ""zero-COVID"" policy that aims to curb all outbreaks at almost any price, running counter to a global trend of trying to co-exist with the virus. While the government has not imposed the type of citywide lockdown seen in mainland Chinese cities, Macao is effectively closed with most facilities shut. Residents have been asked to stay home, public transport is curtailed and restaurants are only providing takeaway. Residents thronged to food markets and grocery stores on Thursday, spooked that the city would be fully locked down. The government denied the rumours and urged the public not to panic and hoard food, according to local broadcaster TDM. Neighbouring global financial hub Hong Kong went through similar chaos after lockdown rumours repeatedly surfaced. Authorities there never imposed a full lockdown and have begun to ease COVID-19 restrictions even as cases hit around 3,000 daily. Frustration is mounting among residents at the government's handling of the outbreak. Some residents have had to queue for more than 20 hours to access healthcare facilities, and many are desperate to go back to work again. ""There is so much anger in the community,"" said one casino executive who declined to be named due to company policy. Casinos are allowed to stay open to protect jobs, but executives said it didn't make sense to have staff on hand despite the lack of business. The gaming industry accounts for more than 80 per cent of government revenue with most people employed directly or indirectly by the casino resorts."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/workplaces-companies-covid19-cases-safe-distancing-measures-omicron-wave-2793966,Some companies keeping current COVID-19 measures but prepared to tighten them if situation worsens,"SINGAPORE: Some companies in Singapore are keeping their current safe-management measures despite the recent spike in COVID-19 cases, but told CNA they will monitor the situation and introduce stricter requirements if necessary.  Chan Brothers Travel, which has measures including staggered work and lunch hours and flexible work-from-home arrangements, said it will continue with its approach.  It is a similar case for Pegasus Travel, although the local firm said it is prepared to revert to a split-team arrangement – where half of its workers work from home while the rest work in the office – if the situation worsens. “Currently, our staff all have to wear masks while in the office unless they have their own rooms, then it’s up to them whether they want to wear it or not,” said the company’s managing director Charles Tan.  Other companies such as local bank OCBC told CNA they were doing the same – keeping current measures but being ready to adapt if necessary. COVID-19 regulations for workplaces in Singapore were eased in June, when all workers were allowed to return to the office with no safe-distancing requirements. While masks continue to be mandatory indoors, employees can remove their masks as long as they are not interacting physically with others and not in customer-facing areas.  Nearly 10,000 new COVID-19 cases were reported in Singapore on Wednesday (Jul 6) – 9,525 local and 464 imported infections. This came a day after the country reported 12,784 daily cases, its highest since Mar 22. The surge in infections has prompted at least one company here to tighten measures to prevent the spread of the virus. On Monday, tourist attraction Madame Tussauds Singapore re-established safe-distancing requirements for its employees, preventing group gatherings and requiring staff members to dine alone at work. They are also now required to wear masks at all times unless they are eating or drinking. Previously, employees were allowed to eat together during their one-hour lunch break and could take their masks off in the office as long as they weren’t interacting physically with others or in customer-facing areas. ""As our business is highly reliant on frontline staff, we cannot afford an internal cluster forming,” said the attraction’s head of commercial operations Sylvia Tan. “We need to ensure business continuity and make sure that our business can continue to run. “The last thing we want to do is to put our workers at risk. We cannot control what they do out of work, but when they are at work, it’s our responsibility to make sure that our staff are safe.” The company is also providing free masks and gloves for employees, especially those who are in customer-facing roles. “We are quite strict on all these sanitising measures to make sure that our teams are safe,” she said, adding that employees are encouraged to change their masks and gloves after coming into contact with high-touch surfaces or areas. None of the companies CNA contacted said they will be reinstating mandatory regular testing.  “There’s no need to do so at the moment, so we’ll only do that if someone is exposed to a COVID-19 infection in the workplace,” said Ms Tan. “So if someone goes out after work with a friend and a friend has caught COVID, we will not cover that. “But we will provide ART kits if someone on-site tests positive and then everyone around them will be issued ART kits too.” Pegasus Travel’s Mr Tan said his company has no plans to reactivate mandatory routine testing and will take the cue from the Government.  “For us, we will follow the guidelines issued by Singapore Tourism Board or the Ministry of Health. There’s no requirement to have mandatory routine testing yet, so we don't have routine testing going on at this point in time,” he said.  ""But if necessary, then of course, we will revert to what we did in the past, such as testing ourselves every week.” "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/hong-kong-suspends-flight-bans-it-eases-covid-19-rules-2793816,Hong Kong suspends flight bans as it eases COVID-19 rules,"HONG KONG: Hong Kong has suspended a rule that banned individual flights for bringing in passengers infected with the COVID-19 virus, as it caused ""unnecessary trouble"" and inconvenience to residents of the global financial hub, the government said on Thursday (Jul 7). Airlines welcomed the move that paves the way for the return of scores stranded overseas by the bans, which exceeded 100 this year and greatly frustrated people accustomed to easy and efficient travel links with the city. ""The social cost caused by the 'circuit breaker mechanism' is quite large, and it also brings unnecessary trouble to ... international students and their families,"" the government said in a statement. All arrivals must still spend at least a week in hotel quarantine and comply with frequent testing orders, providing stool samples for babies and filling out multiple forms. The government aims to improve quarantine arrangements, so as to ease the movement of people ""necessary for social and economic recovery"", it added. Airlines earlier faced a ban of five days if their flights brought in more than five infected people. That was down from as much as two weeks before, making operations tougher as the city's borders were effectively shut for more than two years. The bans brought hundreds of flight cancellations, leading to family separations as people struggled to rebook trips and quarantine hotels at their own expense. Hong Kong's competitiveness had been hammered by the pandemic measures, said business executives who hope the city's new leader, John Lee, will scrap the quarantine rules. Lee, sworn in last week, needs to ""reboot"" the city, such executives have said, as Hong Kong's border has effectively been sealed since 2020 and international arrivals face tough quarantine and testing protocols. Shares of Hong Kong carrier Cathay Pacific rose more than 5 per cent after the news. The airline has been battered by the strict quarantine rules, bringing a fall of 98 per cent in passenger numbers. Cathay said it welcomed the move and was committed to keeping up the flow of people and goods between Hong Kong and the rest of the world, and upholding its status as an international aviation hub. Many airlines have suspended or slashed flights with the city, making it difficult to find flights. Korean Air said that while the move was positive, it was not considering adding flights. ""We've already started to operate a daily flight to Hong Kong since July,"" it said, explaining the reasons. ""The Hong Kong government still requires the seven-day quarantine for all international travellers."" "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/shanghai-chases-karaoke-covid-19-cluster-china-outbreaks-2793831,Shanghai back on alert as China battles COVID-19 outbreaks,"SHANGHAI: Millions of people in Shanghai queued for a third day of mass COVID-19 testing on Thursday (Jul 7) as authorities in several Chinese cities scrambled to stamp out new outbreaks that have rekindled worries about growth in the world's second-largest economy. Unless local officials succeed in preventing the virus from spreading, they could be compelled to invoke prolonged, major restrictions on residents' movement, under China's ""dynamic zero COVID"" strategy. Having just emerged from a painful two-month lockdown, Shanghai was again on high alert as it raced to isolate infections linked to karaoke services that had been taking place illegally. Urging karaoke joints to abide by COVID-19 rules and make sure customers had undergone tests, Shanghai resident Qiu Shijia had a message for their owners: ""Don't push your luck."" Qiu was among a number residents Reuters spoke with in China's most populous city that were wary of a return to restrictions that had caused mental stress, and financial hardship for many people, and disrupted global supply chains and overseas trade. The latest outbreaks in China have weighed on global asset prices this week. ""A resurgence of Omicron is not an issue in most other countries, but it remains a predominant issue for the Chinese economy,"" Nomura analysts wrote in a note, referring to the highly transmissible COVID-19 variant. As China is ""by far the largest manufacturing centre in the world, any new waves of Omicron are likely to have a non-negligible impact"", they added. Residents in many of Shanghai's 16 districts were ordered to take two compulsory COVID-19 tests between Tuesday and Thursday. They frequently take self-administered tests in order to enter shopping malls or travel on public transport, and they also have to take part in city-wide testing every weekend till end-July. Shanghai reported 54 new locally transmitted COVID-19 cases for Wednesday, versus 24 the previous day. Only two of those 54 cases were found in the community, with the rest in quarantine. Another 50 compounds and venues were locked down on Thursday in the commercial hub, taking the total to 81. Overall, mainland China reported 338 new local COVID-19 cases for Wednesday, down from 353, with no new deaths, numbers which most countries would now consider insignificant. Most cases, 167 of them, were in the eastern Anhui province where more than one million people in small towns are locked down. In the capital Beijing, four new infections were reported, down from six the previous day. From Jul 11, most people entering crowded venues, such as libraries, cinemas and gyms, will have to have been vaccinated. After finding one COVID-19 case involving someone who had arrived from Shanghai, the town of Xinjiang in the northern Shanxi province tested almost its entire 280,000 population, suspended taxis, ride-hailing and bus services, and closed various entertainment venues. In a different province, Shaanxi, which reported four new cases, the cultural and tourism authority requested travel agencies to cancel group tours in its capital Xi'an, famed for its Terracota Army. The eastern Jiangsu province, which has cancelled a major sporting event scheduled for November, reported 61 infections. China has said its uncompromising COVID-19 policy, as opposed to a global trend of co-existing with the virus, was saving lives and the ""temporary"" economic costs were worth bearing. Justifying the strategy, officials have contrasted the millions of COVID-linked deaths around the world, compared with China's reported the death toll of 5,226. Analysts warn, however, that some costs may become permanent if China's debt burden increases and if curbs lead to investors and talent reconsidering their presence in the country. China is planning to set up a 500 billion yuan (US$75 billion) state infrastructure fund to revive the economy, two people with knowledge of the matter have told Reuters.  "

One Central shopping mall will be shut for one week, while more than a dozen other zones or buildings, have also been ordered to close, authorities said. Macao locked down one of the city's most famous hotels, the Grand Lisboa on Tuesday, with more 500 people inside. Macao has reported more than 1,000 coronavirus cases since mid-June with more than 14,000 people in mandatory quarantine. The territory had largely been COVID-free since an outbreak in October 2021. A shopping mall inside the Four Seasons hotel owned by Las Vegas Sands Macau unit Sands China was also requested to shut this week after several cases were found. The measures come as the government has stopped short of imposing a full lockdown, seen in Chinese cities such as Shanghai. However, the city is effectively closed with most facilities shut and restaurants only providing takeaway. The more than 600,000 residents in the former Portuguese colony have been asked to stay at home when possible and are required to take part in three citywide COVID-19 tests this week. People are also required to take rapid antigen tests in between. Only Macau's casinos have been allowed to stay open in a move to protect jobs, the government said. Macao gets more than 80 per cent of its tax revenues from the industry with most of the population employed directly or indirectly by the casino resorts. Although casinos are physically open, there are few patrons and only a small number of staff, with many employees asked to stay home to comply with the government's request. Macao adheres to China's ""zero-COVID"" policy which aims to curb all outbreaks, at almost any price, running counter to a global trend of trying to co-exist with the virus. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/us-fda-pharmacists-prescribe-pfizer-covid-19-pill-paxlovid-2793066,US FDA allows pharmacists to prescribe Pfizer's COVID-19 pill,"The US Food and Drug Administration said on Wednesday (Jul 6) it had authorised state-licensed pharmacists to prescribe Pfizer's COVID-19 pill to eligible patients to help improve access to the treatment. The antiviral drug, Paxlovid, has been cleared for use and available for free in the United States since December, but fewer than half of the nearly 4 million courses distributed to pharmacies by the government so far have been administered. Use of the pill, authorised to treat newly infected, at-risk people to prevent severe illness, has, however, jumped in recent weeks as infections rise. ""Since Paxlovid must be taken within five days after symptoms begin, authorising state-licensed pharmacists to prescribe Paxlovid could expand access to timely treatment for some patients,"" Patrizia Cavazzoni, director for the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. The agency said patients who tested positive for COVID-19 should bring their health records for the pharmacists to review for kidney and liver problems. The American Medical Association (AMA) said in a statement prescribing decisions should be made by a doctor wherever possible. ""It (Paxlovid) is not for everyone and prescribing it requires knowledge of a patient's medical history, as well as clinical monitoring for side effects and follow-up care to determine whether a patient is improving,"" said AMA president Jack Resneck. The FDA said pharmacists should refer the patients to a healthcare professional licensed to prescribe drugs if there is not sufficient information to assess kidney or liver function, or if modifications are needed due to a potential drug reaction. Patients with reduced kidney function may need a lower dose of the treatment, the agency has said. People in socially and economically disadvantaged regions are about half as likely to receive antiviral COVID-19 pills like Paxlovid than those in wealthier zip codes, a study by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed.

Public officers will have a crucial role to play in the exercise and will need to work with Singaporeans to come up with innovative and effective responses to tackle challenges ahead and strengthen Singapore’s social compact, he added. Speaking at the Public Sector Transformation COVID-19 awards ceremony, Mr Wong said that Singapore is facing both domestic and external challenges. With growing geo-political contestation amongst the major powers, he said that Singapore will have to gird itself for a more dangerous and troubled world ahead. Domestically, the country will have to do more to sustain social mobility, and care for its growing number of seniors, said Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister. “In the face of these challenges, now more than ever, we must hold together and stay united as a nation. And that is why I had recently launched the Forward Singapore exercise – to refresh and strengthen our social compact for our next bound of development,” he said. The year-long exercise, which will be led by Mr Wong and the fourth generation, or 4G, leadership team, will review and refresh Singapore's social compact and set out a roadmap for the next decade and beyond. The exercise will see the 4G leaders partner Singaporeans to explore how to ensure greater opportunities for all, as well as provide better assurance and care for Singaporeans. It will be organised along six pillars - economy and jobs, education and lifelong learning, health and social support, home and living environment, environmental and fiscal sustainability, and the Singapore identity - each led by 4G leaders. Turning to COVID-19, Mr Wong said Singapore is not out of the woods yet, with the country currently in the midst of a new wave of infections due to the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. While most of the cases are not so severe and hospital capacity is still holding up, Mr Wong warned that there will be new mutations that may be more aggressive and dangerous than Omicron. “We cannot afford to let our guard down,” he said. During his speech, he thanked the public service for their exemplary work in Singapore’s fight against COVID-19. “In our darkest hours, I have always been able to draw strength from all of our public service officers,” he said. “I have met many of you over the last two years, especially those who have been working on the frontlines of COVID-19.” “I have seen many fatigued and tired officers, but you never gave up, and you kept on fighting. You have shown true grit, commitment and dedication in responding to the call of duty and service,” he added. Mr Wong cited the example of how the Community Care Facility at EXPO was set up in less than a month to deal with the surge in cases in April 2020. The Ministry of Health, together with numerous private and public sector partners, managed to convert all 10 halls at the EXPO into a Community Care Facility, providing an 8,500 additional beds. This was almost as many beds as all of Singapore’s hospitals combined, said Mr Wong. “By the end of 2020, the (Community Care Facility) at the EXPO had provided care to more than 34,000 patients – and in doing so, it freed up precious resources in our hospitals for serious COVID cases.” This is just one example of the many inspiring stories across the public service, said Mr Wong highlighting the thousands of officers who were deployed at worker dormitories to look after migrant workers as well as those charged with setting up quarantine spaces to get stay-home notice hotels ready for returning Singaporeans and travellers. He also highlighted those who ran round-the-clock operations at Singapore’s borders and checkpoints, hospitals and vaccination centres across the island, and those who helped to implement and enforce safe management measures. “Everyone worked valiantly amidst tight deadlines and limited manpower. You innovated, you came up with ingenious solutions, and importantly, you got the job done,” he said. “Without your courage, tenacity and hard work, I have no doubt that our fight against Covid would have turned out very differently today.” Beyond the frontlines, officers also played crucial roles in strategising and planning Singapore’s national response, said Mr Wong, pointing to efforts to secure enough vaccines.  Officers had worked closely together to identify the most promising ones and convince pharmaceutical companies to work with Singapore. Mr Wong added that the Government could not have achieved everything on its own, and worked with many stakeholders and local businesses and the community in the fight against COVID-19. “Whether it is working closely with amongst ourselves with other public agencies, or partnering local businesses and the community, we can achieve good outcomes only if we partner and work together.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/china-fights-covid-19-flare-ups-multiple-fronts-shanghai-2791881,China battles karaoke COVID-19 cluster in Shanghai among other outbreaks,"SHANGHAI: China is fighting nascent COVID-19 flare-ups across the country with mass testing and fresh restrictions, including in Shanghai where new cases have been linked to a building which houses a karaoke lounge that was operating illegally. Pressure is mounting on officials to avert a wider spread and disruptions similar to the painful and costly isolation that Shanghai, China's most populous city, suffered in April and May. ""Several Chinese areas are facing local outbreaks and infections have emerged at the community level in Shanghai, to which we should attach great importance,"" city health official Zhao Dandan told reporters on Wednesday (Jul 6). ""There should be no slacking,"" Zhao said. While the country's latest daily caseload of just over 300 infections is insignificant by global standards, worries it could trigger another round of strict curbs weighed on Chinese stocks and markets worldwide. China is the only major economy digging in its heels on a ""zero-COVID"" policy aimed at promptly eradicating all outbreaks, while the rest of the world tries to co-exist with the virus. Its uncompromising approach has led to rare displays of public anger and is weighing on the recovery of the world's second-largest economy. Shanghai, which reported 24 new cases for Tuesday versus eight the previous day, is testing all residents in nine of its 16 districts from Tuesday to Thursday as well as those in parts of three other districts. The commercial hub of around 25 million already requires residents to get tested frequently in order to enter shopping malls or take public transport. City authorities have suspended operations of karaoke lounges, but other recently-reopened cultural venues such as libraries will stay open. Cinemas are due to reopen on Friday. Beijing, which reported six cases on Tuesday, urged transport hubs and hotels to check the body temperature of visitors and proof of negative COVID-19 test results. The caseload in the eastern Anhui province, where more than 1 million people in small towns are under lockdown, declined slightly to 222 on Tuesday from 231 a day before. The province still accounts for most of China's new infections. In the northwestern city of Xian in the Shaanxi province, a seven-day closure of various entertainment venues and suspension of dining-in at restaurants went into effect on Wednesday. The city of 13 million detected 11 new cases on Tuesday. Xian, famed for its Terracota Army, is the first major Chinese city to declare a fight against the BA.5.2 subvariant of the contagious Omicron COVID-19 variant, seen as more infectious than the BA.2 subvariant found in earlier outbreaks in China. Shaanxi governor Zhao Yide said the province's cities should enter a ""war-time"" state and ramp up screening of travellers. In the eastern Jiangsu province, 65 new cases were detected on Tuesday. The Chinese Athletics Association has cancelled the November 2022 World Athletics Half-Marathon Championship that was scheduled to be held in the province, in Yangzhou. President Xi Jinping, widely expected to secure a precedent-breaking third leadership term later this year, reiterated the country's ""dynamic zero-COVID"" policy on a visit last week to the city of Wuhan, where COVID-19 was first reported. Xi said it was better to incur ""temporary"" economic costs than to ""harm the lives and health of the people"" and that accepting COVID-19 as endemic would have ""unimaginable"" consequences in China. Officials have pointed to the millions of COVID-linked deaths around the world, versus the 5,226 reported in China. Minsheng Bank estimates China's economy grew around 0.5 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter, versus 4.8 per cent in the first, weighed down by extensive lockdowns. The data is due next week. The economy still faces a subdued property market, soft consumer spending, and businesses reluctant to hire and invest due to widespread fear of recurring COVID-19 waves. China will soon set up a 500 billion yuan (US$74.69 billion) state infrastructure fund to revive the economy, Reuters exclusively reported on Tuesday. "

At least 16 other buildings across the special Chinese administrative region are also locked down with no one allowed to exit or enter. Authorities reported 146 new infections on Wednesday, taking the total to more than 1,000 cases since mid-June. More than 14,000 people are in quarantine as the city battles to contain its biggest outbreak since the pandemic began. Macao had largely been COVID-free since an outbreak in October 2021. The Grand Lisboa is the second casino hotel locked down in recent weeks. Owned by SJM Holdings, which was started by former Macao kingpin Stanley Ho, the Lisboa is one of the city's best known landmarks. Local media showed photos of the hotel sealed off with people in protection gear and hazmat suits standing outside. SJM Holdings said it was acting in strict accordance with the government and supported the authorities' pandemic control measures. ""SJM stands united with the entire community in this health crisis and wishes Macao a rapid recovery from the pandemic,"" it said in an emailed statement. While the government has stopped short of imposing a full lockdown, seen in Chinese cities such as Shanghai, most facilities in Macao are shut and restaurants can only provide takeaway. The more than 600,000 residents in the former Portuguese colony have been asked to stay at home when possible and are required to take part in three citywide COVID-19 tests this week. People are also required to take rapid antigen tests in between. Only Macao's casinos have been allowed to stay open in an effort to ensure job security. The government relies on the industry for more than 80 per cent of its tax revenue with most of the population employed directly or indirectly by the casino resorts. Although physically open, there are few patrons inside and only a small number of staff, with many employees asked to stay at home to comply with the government's request. Macao adheres to China's ""zero-COVID"" policy which aims to eradicate all outbreaks, at almost any price, running counter to a global trend of trying to coexist with the virus. It has an open border with mainland China, and its economy depends on the inflow of Chinese visitors. Chinese and Hong Kong stocks fell on Wednesday in response to the continued COVID-19 crisis. Macao's cases remain far below daily infections in other places, including neighbouring Hong Kong where they have jumped to more than 2,000 a day this month. However the densely-populated hub only has one public hospital, which was stretched even before the COVID-19 outbreak. Officials have put up a makeshift hospital next to the city's Las Vegas-style Cotai strip to help cope with the rise in cases. Casino revenues are likely to be zero for at least several weeks analysts said, exacerbating tight liquidity caused by the impact of more than two years of pandemic. Macao on Tuesday published draft rules for the rebidding of casino licences ahead of the year-end expiration for Wynn Macao , Sands China, MGM China, Galaxy Entertainment and Melco Resorts and SJM.

There were two fatalities, taking the death toll from coronavirus complications to 1,421. A total of 683 patients are in hospital, according to the latest infection statistics on the Ministry of Health's (MOH) website on Tuesday night. Seventy-seven patients require oxygen supplementation. A total of 16 patients are in the intensive care unit. The week-on-week infection ratio is 1.34. This refers to the ratio of community cases for the past week over the week before, with a figure above 1 indicating that the number of new weekly COVID-19 cases is rising.  The week-on-week infection ratio has been above 1 since Jun 14.  Singapore's recent spike in COVID-19 cases comes after Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said last month that the country can expect a new wave of infections in July or August, as people's antibodies from vaccinations and infections from the last Omicron wave start to wane. Among the local cases reported on Tuesday, 11,446 cases were tested using antigen rapid tests (ARTs). These cases have been assessed by doctors to have mild symptoms and are of low risk, said MOH. The remaining 802 local COVID-19 cases were confirmed via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Of the imported cases, 499 were tested using ARTs and 37 using PCR tests. Singapore has recorded 1,485,964 COVID-19 cases since the start of the pandemic. As of Monday, 96 per cent of Singapore's eligible population have completed their full vaccination regimen under the national vaccination programme. About 78 per cent of the total population have received their vaccine booster shots. Cases tend to increase on Tuesdays, with Mr Ong flagging in Parliament earlier on Tuesday that the day's COVID-19 caseload would be about 10 per cent higher from the previous Tuesday. Mr Ong also said that the current COVID-19 wave would not be as severe as the Omicron wave earlier this year.  At the peak of the earlier Omicron wave, Singapore saw about 18,000 new COVID-19 cases daily.

There will also be a cap on the duration of visits to these facilities, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Tuesday. The measures - which will be in effect from Jul 7 to Aug 3 – are to protect healthcare capacity as well as vulnerable patients and residents during this period, said MOH.  All patients warded in hospitals will be allowed two pre-designated visitors for the duration of their admission, and only one visitor may be allowed at the bedside at any one time.  Critically ill patients will be allowed up to five pre-designated visitors. Two of them may be allowed at the bedside at any one point in time. The duration of a visit will be limited to 30 minutes.  “In exceptional situations, such as for critically ill patients, paediatric patients, birthing or post-partum mothers, and for patients requiring additional care support, visitors may be allowed to stay beyond 30 minutes on a case-by-case basis at the hospitals’ discretion,” said the Health Ministry. All visitors should ensure that they are well, said the ministry, adding that they are ""strongly encouraged"" to test themselves with an antigen rapid test (ART) on the day of the visit.  MOH said hospitals have the discretion to impose stricter visitor limits or testing requirements for visitors of vulnerable or unvaccinated patients. “Visitors are reminded not to eat or drink in the hospital wards, or use the toilets designated for patients in the wards. They should also avoid sitting on patients’ beds,"" it added. At care homes, all residents will be allowed up to four pre-designated visitors, and only one of them may visit at any one time. The duration of a visit will be limited to 30 minutes.  MOH said visitors should continue to schedule the visits with the home ahead of time. These visitors should similarly ensure that they are well, and are strongly encouraged to perform a COVID-19 self-test on the day of the visit.  “Visitors should strictly adhere to prevailing safe management measures within the homes. This includes remaining within the designated visitor areas, outside of the wards. “We also seek the understanding of visitors that visits may have to be suspended if a home is managing active COVID-19 cases. Next-of-kin of residents may approach the home for further details,” added MOH. All visitors must wear face masks with good filtration capability at all times while visiting hospitals or residential care homes, said the ministry. These include surgical masks and reusable masks that are made of two layers of fabric. MOH said it will review and calibrate these measures regularly in line with the evolving COVID-19 situation.  “We seek the understanding and cooperation of patients, residents, their family members and loved ones as we work to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission in our healthcare institutions and residential care homes,” it added. Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said earlier on Tuesday that the number of COVID-19 cases that require hospitalisation has “increased quite significantly” to nearly 700, and hospitals have started to cut back on non-COVID-19 and elective procedures. “The number of hospitalisation cases has reached almost 700 now, so it has increased quite significantly. This is as compared to the height of the Omicron wave earlier this year, where we had about 1,700 hospitalisation cases,” Mr Ong said in Parliament.  The current COVID-19 wave will not be as severe as the Omicron wave earlier this year, the minister said, adding that there are indications that Singapore is near the peak, if not at the peak, of the current infection wave.  Singapore reported 12,784 COVID-19 cases on Tuesday. That's about 10 per cent more than last Tuesday, said Mr Ong, noting that Tuesday is ""always the day where cases spike up"". At the peak of the earlier Omicron wave, Singapore saw about 18,000 new COVID-19 cases daily. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/shanghai-announces-two-new-rounds-mass-covid-19-testing-2790456,Shanghai announces two new rounds of mass COVID-19 testing,"SHANGHAI: The city of Shanghai on Tuesday (Jul 5) announced two new rounds of mass COVID-19 testing of most of its 25 million residents over a three-day period, citing the need to trace infections linked to an outbreak at a karaoke lounge. The city government said on its official WeChat account that all residents in nine of the city's 16 districts would be tested twice from Tuesday to Thursday. People in parts of three other districts would also have to undergo tests. The testing was needed because multiple COVID-19 infections found this week were linked to a karaoke lounge, which had been visited by residents from several districts, it said. ""No household or person should be missed,"" the city government said of the testing. During the testing, people living in the affected districts would be required to show a test taken within the last two days to leave their homes, it said. City lockdowns and repeated mass testing in China, part of its zero-COVID policy that aims to eradicate all outbreaks, have brought case numbers down but many of the measures have fuelled anger and taken a toll on the economy. Shanghai reported eight new local COVID-19 cases on Monday, seven of which it said were found in quarantined areas. The city already requires all of its districts to organise mass testing of residents every weekend until the end of July. Residents also need to test themselves every three days in order to enter public areas such as shopping malls or take public transport. Although China's most populous city has lifted a two month-long lockdown of its 25 million residents, it still imposes targeted curbs on movements whenever a COVID case is found outside quarantined areas. The northwestern city of Xian, which reported 18 local infections in a flare-up driven by the BA.5.2 sub-variant, will from Wednesday suspend operations at various entertainment venues, dining at restaurants and big events for seven days, a government official said.

This is as compared to the height of the Omicron wave earlier this year, where we had about 1,700 hospitalisation cases,” he added.  “At that time we cut back (business-as-usual) by 15 per cent. So we have now started to trigger some cutback of (business-as-usual), mostly electives, and the cutback is about 4 per cent.”  At the peak of the earlier Omicron wave, Singapore saw about 18,000 new COVID-19 cases daily. Tuesday's COVID-19 caseload is expected to be more than 12,000, about 10 per cent more than Tuesday last week, said Mr Ong in his initial response in Parliament.  ""There are indications that we are near the peak, if not at the peak, and we should be relieved that the number this week did not double from last week. Otherwise, we'll be at 24,000 or 22,000 this week,"" he said. In his earlier response to Mr Yip about whether the healthcare settings are ""adequately equipped"" to handle the next wave, Mr Ong said the key to managing the next wave is to ensure that Singapore’s hospital capacity is “not overly stressed”. This includes ensuring high vaccination and booster coverage, as well as making sure healthcare institutions and facilities are prepared and ready to ramp up capacity if there are increased admissions, he added.  “Our hospitals remain ready to ramp up dedicated (intensive care unit) and isolation bed capacity should there be an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients who require hospitalisation,” said Mr Ong.  There are also “sufficient beds” in the COVID-19 treatment facilities for serious cases that do not need hospital care, he said, adding that such COVID-19 treatment facilities are about 25 per cent occupied. The facilities were “recently consolidated” from more than 2,000 beds to about 1,300 beds, with a “higher manning ratio”, said the Health Minister. This makes it easier to transfer patients from hospitals to the facilities without a “significant drop” in levels of care, he added.  However, public hospitals continue to face “high demand” from non-COVID-19 patients. “Over time, we hope more of our (COVID-19 treatment facilities) can be multi-purpose isolation and treatment facilities, for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients,” added Mr Ong.  The COVID-19 treatment facility at Sengkang Community Hospital has been “reconfigured” to this new model, and the authorities will explore converting other facilities, said the Health Minister.  In anticipating the wave of infections, Mr Ong said the Government maintained the indoor masking requirement even when cases were “low and stable” in order to “moderate the infection rate” when the new wave arrived. “If we still want to reduce the infection rate even further, more stringent safe management measures will need to be implemented. And that means reintroducing things like group sizes, capacity limits and masking outdoors,” he added.  ""We cannot rule out these steps if we are hit with a serious infection wave, but as far as possible, we should avoid them, especially if we are reasonably confident that our hospital capacity can hold up, and that we are determined to live with COVID-19 and continue our journey of endemicity."" Mr Yip also asked if hospitals have been able to hire new staff for the wave of COVID-19 infections, to replace the wave of manpower that left the healthcare sector.  “Manpower indeed is a challenge,” said Mr Ong, adding that the current attrition rate is comparable to what hospitals saw in 2019.  “In February there was a slight spike after bonuses (were) received, but otherwise the latest number month-on-month is comparable to what we experienced 2019 pre-COVID,” said the Health Minister.  “Having said that, it is increasingly difficult to hold on and to recruit foreign nurses because with COVID-19 being a global pandemic, hiring of nurses is a matter of international competition.”  Singapore has its “fair share” of healthcare talent, said Mr Ong, noting that courses in schools are often oversubscribed.  “But our cohort size is limited. Our healthcare demand is growing, so therefore, we must be able to accept that over time we have to recruit more foreign nurses from different sources,” he added.  This includes being able to train these talents and pay them competitively, said the Health Minister.  “The good ones over time should be able to be part of our community, become (permanent residents) and live with their family here, go to local schools here,” he continued.  “I think this is the only way for us to not just weather through this wave, but as our population gets older, that profile or that size of our healthcare workforce will have to increase, and we have to tap on both a strong local pipeline as well as foreign recruitment.”  "

These subvariants have a ""significant growth advantage"" over the earlier BA.2 subvariant, he added. “This wave, however, arrived slightly earlier than the July and August timeframe that we anticipated,” the Health Minister said. “For this current wave, our assessment is that it will not be as severe as the Omicron wave we experienced earlier this year. This is because many more of us have gained stronger immunity, either through booster shots or recovery from infections,"" he added. “This will significantly impede the circulation and transmission of the BA.4, BA.5 viruses.”  At the peak of the earlier Omicron wave, Singapore saw about 18,000 new COVID-19 cases daily.

In a supplementary question, Mr Ang asked about the percentage of recent COVID-19 infections caused by the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.  Of all current infections, about 50 per cent are from the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, said Mr Ong.  ""It has been doubling every week. Started at 3 per cent, then 5 per cent, then 8 per cent, then 16 per cent, 30 per cent last week, this week 50 per cent, next week I would expect it to be 70 to 80 per cent. It is clearly a more dominant subvariant compared to BA.2.""  In response to a question from MP Yip Hon Weng (PAP-Yio Chu Kang) if healthcare settings are ""adequately equipped"" to handle the next wave, Mr Ong said the key to managing the next wave is to ensure that Singapore’s hospital capacity is “not overly stressed”. This includes ensuring high vaccination and booster coverage, as well as making sure healthcare institutions and facilities are prepared and ready to ramp up capacity if there are increased admissions, he added.  As of noon on Monday, there were 631 people in hospital, with 74 requiring oxygen supplementation and 14 in the intensive care unit. “Our hospitals remain ready to ramp up dedicated ICU and isolation bed capacity should there be an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients who require hospitalisation,” said Mr Ong.  There are also “sufficient beds” in the COVID-19 treatment facilities for serious cases that do not need hospital care, he said, adding that such COVID-19 treatment facilities are about 25 per cent occupied. The facilities were “recently consolidated” from more than 2,000 beds to about 1,300 beds, with a “higher manning ratio”, said Mr Ong. This makes it easier to transfer patients from hospitals to the facilities without a “significant drop” in levels of care, he added.  However, public hospitals continue to face “high demand” from non-COVID-19 patients, said Mr Ong.  “Over time, we hope more of our (COVID-19 treatment facilities) can be multi-purpose isolation and treatment facilities, for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients,” he added.  The COVID-19 treatment facility at Sengkang Community Hospital has been “reconfigured” to this new model, and the authorities will explore converting other facilities, said the Health Minister.  In anticipating the wave of infections, the Government maintained the indoor masking requirement even when cases were “low and stable” to “moderate the infection rate” when the new wave arrived. “If we still want to reduce the infection rate even further, more stringent safe management measures will need to be implemented. And that means reintroducing things like group sizes, capacity limits and masking outdoors,” said Mr Ong. ""We cannot rule out these steps if we are hit with a serious infection wave, but as far as possible, we should avoid them, especially if we are reasonably confident that our hospital capacity can hold up, and that we are determined to live with COVID-19 and continue our journey of endemicity.""

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/macao-covid-19-outbreak-infections-spread-2789771,Macao COVID-19 outbreak hits more than 900 as infections spread,"HONG KONG: Macao reported 89 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday (Jul 5), taking the total to more than 900 infections since mid-June, as authorities in the world's biggest gambling hub race to contain its largest outbreak since the pandemic began. More than 13,000 people are under quarantine in the Chinese special administrative region, which has effectively shut down to limit the spread of coronavirus. The city's more than 600,000 residents are subject to three citywide COVID-19 tests this week, with people also required to take rapid antigen tests in between. While the former Portuguese colony has not introduced a full scale lockdown seen in mainland Chinese cities like Shanghai, most facilities are shut and restaurants can only provide takeaway. Only Macao's casinos have been allowed to stay open in a move to ensure job security. The government relies on the industry for over 80 per cent of its tax revenue with most of the population employed directly or indirectly by the casino resorts. While casinos are physically open, there are hardly any gamblers inside and very few staff working, with many employees asked to stay at home, as per the government's request. The stringent measures come after Macao has been largely COVID-free since an outbreak in October 2021. It still has an open border with mainland China, with its economy firmly hinged to the inflow of Chinese visitors. Macao adheres to China's ""zero-COVID"" policy which aims to eradicate all outbreaks, at just about any cost, running counter to a global trend of trying to co-exist with the virus. Its cases are still far below daily infections in other places, including neighbouring Hong Kong where cases have jumped to more than 2,000 a day this month. However, Macao only has one public hospital, whose services are already stretched on a daily basis. Officials have put up a makeshift hospital next to the city's Las Vegas style Cotai strip to help cope with the rise in cases. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/covid-19-supply-chain-reshoring-us-china-trade-war-tariff-vietnam-2788266,Commentary: COVID-19 has not disrupted supply chains as much as assumed,"SINGAPORE: The resilience of global supply chains in manufacturing has been under scrutiny following COVID-19 and geopolitical shocks. Global supply chains are robust or resilient when they can sustain economic shocks and continue producing an unchanged level of output. The operational and locational dimensions of resilience need to be appreciated amid calls for the “reshoring” of production, which shortens supply chains by bringing them home to reverse the “export of jobs”. The disruption to global supply chain operations is being used as a pretext to reshore production, but diversifying supply chains actually lowers risk. The ongoing digitalisation of global supply chains – accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic – also increases resilience while reducing the cost of distance, diminishing the case for reshoring. But the reshoring prerogative is so great that it was one of many factors that drove the United States to initiate a trade war with China. Japan has also offered generous subsidies to its affiliates to return from China. COVID-19 was a global shock that disrupted production in every country that locked down, irrespective of their global supply chain integration. But it mattered not whether the goods were produced from start to finish in one of those lockdown countries or across several of them. The more recent output disruptions may have more to do with the explosion in pent-up demand and the unevenness of the recovery that preceded the war in Ukraine and associated sanctions on Russia, than the way goods are produced. The pandemic has actually demonstrated how resilient global supply chains can be, with manufacturing production bouncing back so quickly after lockdowns were eased. This was particularly true in Southeast Asia, where trade was about 30 per cent above pre-pandemic levels by 2022 despite China’s continued lockdowns. The vulnerability of global supply chains have been exposed less by global shocks than by country or region-specific shocks. The 2011 Thai floods and the 2011 Fukushima earthquake in Japan highlight how a disruption to just one segment of production reverberates throughout the supply chain, leading to a sharp contraction in final output. The China-US trade war is another country-specific shock because discriminatory tariffs are only applied to each other’s trade. Although the bilateral tariffs of the China-US stand-off are relatively small, ranging from 10 per cent to 25 per cent, their impact on competitiveness can be much greater. While the tariff is levied on the total value of the product, it can be completely negated by simply removing the share of value added in the tariff-targeted country. To illustrate, the domestic value added of Chinese total manufacturing exports to the United States in 2018 was estimated to be 30 per cent. Imported inputs account for US$70 of a US$100 made-in-China shirt, while the final production processes in China add US$30. It follows that a 25 per cent tariff on the US$100 shirt is really a US$25 tax on the US$30 value added in China. Other countries, such as Vietnam, effectively receive a “buffer” of US$25. If Vietnam can add the same value while keeping total costs less than US$55 – within the buffer provided by the tax – it would be more profitable to produce there. This multiplier effect of the discriminatory tariff is termed the effective rate of spillover protection because it creates a magnified and unintended advantage to all competitors, not just the United States. It also explains why the relocation of global supply chains could happen in response to a relatively small tariff if the value-added share is small. But in practice, global supply chains overall have remained remarkably resilient to price rather quantity disruptions. While there have been shifts in global supply chains out of China into neighbouring countries like Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, these have mostly involved labour intensive industries.  The key industries that dominate global supply chains – electronics, transport equipment and machinery – have not seen much relocation. Considering how the effective rate of spillover protection magnifies protection, global supply chains are more resilient than they appear. The conundrum involving the effective rate of spillover protection is resolved when factor intensity and technology are taken into account. Electronics, transport and machinery industries are capital intensive with high shares of fixed costs. These technologies are generally less divisible such that fewer segments of the supply chain can be separated and transferred across borders. Such complex production processes operate within an ecosystem that is both less divisible and more difficult to recreate elsewhere. Factories must be rebuilt, while training new workers and developing relationships with new suppliers adds substantially to costs. There is little evidence that the trade war has resulted in the significant reshoring of production. If punitive tariffs have failed to reshore production, direct subsidies have not fared any better, even though subsidies can be better targeted because they can be tied directly to reshoring, avoiding the spillover to third countries. But since the subsidies are directly related to the value added returned, they yield no effective rate of spillover protection-related multiplier effects, reducing their potency. The evidence from Japan is that firms that availed of the subsidies to reshore production were quick to return to China after observing a grace period, diminishing any long-term impact on supply chains. When reshoring is engineered through discriminatory taxes or targeted subsidies, global welfare is reduced by a loss of efficiency due to a misallocation of resources. Using resilience as a pretext to promote the reshoring of production is not only likely to fail, but it will incur costs even if it is successful.

Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau posted a blog on Hong Kong's Health Bureau website expressing hope that relatives separated by the border between Hong Kong and mainland China could reunite in time for the ""Qixi"" Festival, China's equivalent of Valentine's Day, to be held this year on Aug 4. ""I hope that the epidemic will be controlled and that with the joint cooperation between Hong Kong and Shenzhen, more people who need to return to the Mainland for family reunions ... can enter Shenzhen via the Shenzhen Bay Bridge,"" wrote Lo, whose appointment was announced by China's State Council last month. While this is not the first time a Hong Kong official has hinted at a potential border reopening, Lo's statement comes after China halved the quarantine time for inbound travellers last week, a major easing of COVID-19 curbs that have deterred travel to China for two-and-a-half years, including from Hong Kong. In Lo's blog post, which was only published in Chinese, he noted that despite the new quarantine time of seven days in centralised facilities, followed by three days' self-monitoring, entering mainland China from Hong Kong was still cumbersome. Lo wrote that the demand for quarantine hotels in Shenzhen had only increased with the cutting of quarantine times. Lo also pointed out other recurring issues, such as booking a seat on the bus from Hong Kong to Shenzhen. Lo noted that the opening of the border between Hong Kong and mainland China would depend on Hong Kong's epidemic situation and the reduction of community infections. Hong Kong on Monday reported 1,645 local coronavirus infections, and 196 imported infections. Lo's post generated some discussion on China's Weibo social media platform, with some users expressing opposition to the measure due to fears of imported infections and the resulting lockdowns that could trigger in mainland China. ""You can't open up so much ... the moment there is a problem it will implicate a lot of people, the transmission rate of the virus is so high right now,"" wrote user Ci1027. Other Weibo users expressed hope that Lo's blog post signalled a reopening soon, while reserving skepticism that the Aug 4 deadline was feasible. ""If this actually comes true it would be the best piece of news this year,"" one user from neighbouring Guangdong province wrote. "

China continues to demand local authorities detect and contain new infections as soon as possible in its ""dynamic COVID zero"" strategy, although it has warned against expanding strict curbs unnecessarily as it struggles to revive the economy. Daily numbers of locally transmitted infections in China increased to more than 300 over the weekend compared with a few dozens in late June. While tiny by global standards, local officials have still closed some businesses and locked down more than a million people. In the eastern province of Anhui, which reported most of China's local cases in the latest flare-up, its provincial capital Hefei said late on Sunday (Jul 3) it is doing citywide testing every three days, after last month briefly scrapping weekly test requirements. Anhui's Si town, where its 760,000 residents were told to stay home except for going out to do COVID-19 tests, mandated citywide testing on Monday, its seventh round of mass testing. Lingbi town, also in Anhui, locked down its nearly 1 million residents and said it had cancelled an event for local businesses to meet government officials. In the southeastern province of Fujian, the Jiaocheng district and the town of Xiapu in the city of Ningde ran mass testing on Sunday. Ningde, where the world's largest battery maker CATL is headquartered, reported 10 domestically transmitted COVID-19 infections for Sunday, data from Fujian health authority showed on Monday. China reported a total of 380 new local infections for Jul 3, of which 41 were symptomatic and 339 were asymptomatic, the National Health Commission said on Monday.

All residents face three rounds of tests this week, in addition to rapid antigen tests, as Monday's 68 new infections took the tally in the former Portuguese colony to 852 since the middle of June. About 12,000 people are in quarantine. Although the Chinese special administrative region has not ordered a full-scale lockdown of the kind imposed in mainland cities such as the business hub of Shanghai, Macao is already largely closed. Non-essential government services are shut, with schools, parks, sports and entertainment facilities closed, while restaurants may only provide takeaway items. However, Macao has allowed casinos to stay open to ensure job security in an industry that generates more than 80 per cent of government income by employing most of the city's population, whether directly or indirectly. Still, punters are scarce and the casinos have very few staff, with many employees staying home in line with a government directive. Analysts said the six operators, Sands China, Wynn Macao, MGM China, Melco Resorts, Galaxy Entertainment, SJM Holding are likely to have no income for several weeks because of the measures. Macao had been largely free of COVID-19 since an outbreak in October 2021. It follows China's ""zero-COVID"" policy that aims to eradicate all outbreaks at just about any cost, but runs counter to a global trend of trying to co-exist with the virus. Its infections are still far below those elsewhere, including the neighbouring global financial hub of Hong Kong, which has seen daily cases jump to more than 2,000 this month. However, the services of its sole public hospital are severely stretched. The territory has an open border with mainland China, with many residents living and working in the adjoining city of Zhuhai.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/covid-booster-breakthrough-infection-vaccine-confusion-2786776,Commentary: Fuzzy language is setting back the fight against COVID-19,"PROVIDENCE, Rhode Island: People no longer know what to do about the COVID-19 pandemic. Part of the problem is the very language we use to talk about it.  Words such as “breakthrough,” “booster” and even “sick” mean different things to different people — and to experts and the general public. The solution is for experts to be mindful of words that have various popular meanings and to avoid others altogether.  Public health officials who wonder why the public is ignoring them — or who blame scientific illiteracy for their own muddy communication — should consider adopting a new glossary for the pandemic’s third year.  The language problem really hit me when Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said in a video talk that he wished experts had never used the term “breakthrough infection.” This descriptor makes it sound as if the COVID-19 vaccines failed. But in other diseases, asymptomatic or mild infections often coexist with vaccination.  Offit also suggested jettisoning the term “booster” and redefining fully vaccinated simply as two, three or four shots, depending on various risk factors and age. That might encourage people to get the additional shots they need.  Last winter, the critical care physician Roger Seheult told me that most patients he was seeing in the intensive care unit during the Omicron surge had serious health conditions (one was a kidney transplant recipient) but had not gotten that third dose of vaccine. Thirty percent of Americans over 65 never got a booster, though they are vastly more likely to be hospitalised or die from COVID-19 than younger people.  Even very basic terms can highlight a disconnect between the public and public health. Take the word “sick.” “A recent CDC announcement regarding international travel advised travelers to ‘get tested for current infection … and not travel if they are sick,’” notes risk communication consultant Peter Sandman.  But does “sick” mean having symptoms or just testing positive? When scientists estimate that a quarter or even half of Americans have been infected with Omicron, do they mean tested positive or got symptoms? Does this include people who didn’t test but would have been positive if they had?  “Airborne” is another term Sandman considers confusing. Most people think of airborne as any transmission via air, in contrast with transmission via infected surfaces.  But the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention differentiate between airborne and droplets, which also travel through the air but are larger and less likely to travel more than six feet (1.8m). The distinction is critical.  With a droplet-borne disease, even cloth masks are likely to help, and staying six feet apart keeps people safer. If a virus is technically airborne, then being outside, having good ventilation and wearing respirator masks make more sense.  Even the term “mask” has lost some meaning. Masks encompass everything from a bandana tied bank robber-style around the face to an N95. The former hasn’t been shown to protect the wearer or others, while the latter does both. So when we talk about “wearing masks” or say “masking works,” people have wildly varying interpretations. “Long COVID” also encompasses too much, lumping together any lingering symptoms with a disabling neurological syndrome. This makes it hard to judge the risk of severe long COVID.  To understand the difference, think about skin cancer. There are many kinds of skin cancer and the common ones are the least deadly. There’s a good reason that most of us who’ve had something zapped off our skin don’t consider ourselves cancer survivors.  The word “emergency” also highlights the growing gulf between the public and public health, since most people no longer see the pandemic as an emergency and haven’t for some time. “To qualify as an emergency, an event normally should be important, bad, sudden and short-term,” Sandman wrote to me.  The pandemic is still an official public health emergency, which gives drug companies the ability to fast-track drugs and vaccines through emergency use authorisations. But the situation is no longer sudden or short-term.  “It’s not surprising that much of the public is highly motivated to “get over” COVID-19 and return to normal life, while many public health professionals are inclined to stay focused (and want the public to stay focused) on the biggest public health emergency of their careers,” Sandman wrote.  Finally, the word “pandemic,” when contrasted with “endemic”, has unleashed a new wave of confusion. People think of a pandemic as something very serious and scary and endemic as a problem that fades into the background.  Oxford University biologist Aris Katzourakis has called “endemic” one of the most misused terms of the pandemic because many endemic diseases, such as malaria, can be extremely deadly and debilitating.  To most of us, however, the idea of a permanent pandemic or a permanent emergency feel oxymoronic. When people say they think the pandemic is over, they’re describing the way things feel now. That might be subjective, but it’s no less real — and public health professionals would be wise to pay attention."

""A system involving family doctors will be prepared to administer this far too rarely-used COVID life saver more routinely,"" he wrote on Twitter on Sunday, adding that sufficient stockpiles were available. The pill, which won conditional European marketing approval in January, is given to infected people who are at high risk of progression to severe illness. In his tweet, Lauterbach mentioned trial results that the oral treatment course can cut the risk of hospitalisation in the elderly by 90 per cent, when taken early after infection. Pfizer said on Thursday it is seeking full US approval for Paxlovid, which is currently available under an emergency use authorisation there. Deaths and intensive care treatments after COVID-19 infections have been on the rise again in Germany since late June, driven by more infectious subvariants of Omicron, after falling steadily for about three months. The drug was not found to ease symptoms among younger adults. German chancellor Olaf Scholz, a member of centre-left SPD like Lauterbach, on Sunday said schools and non-essential businesses would not be shut again if infection rates rose significantly this year, but that face masks would play a bigger role.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/canada-hospital-emergency-rooms-perfect-storm-covid-19-staff-2787536,Canada's emergency rooms bear the brunt of a 'perfect storm',"TORONTO: Health authorities across Canada have cut the hours of hospital emergency departments and urgent care clinics in recent weeks, a move that in some cases may extend through the summer, due to a surge in patients and staff shortages. The situation, clinicians say, is tied to a resurgence of viral infections such as COVID-19 among adults and children and a push by others to seek care delayed by the pandemic, and exacerbated by the high number of healthcare workers who are sick or burned out. The strain has led to scenes of clogged hospital hallways and overflowing clinic waiting rooms, hours-long waits for inpatient care and occupancy rates of more than 100 per cent at children's hospitals. It also has rekindled debate about systemic problems in the government-funded healthcare system. On Thursday (Jun 30), the Perth and Smiths Falls District Hospital in eastern Ontario announced that its emergency department in Perth would be closed from Saturday to Thursday due to a COVID-19 outbreak affecting its staffing. ""It's like the four horsemen of the apocalypse all descending on us in health care at once,"" said Alan Drummond, a family and emergency physician based in the town, which is home to about 6,000 people. Drummond, who spoke with Reuters before the closure was announced, sees patients waiting 20 hours to be admitted, a situation that can lead to a deterioration in their condition or even medical errors. He blames the situation on years of inadequate funding of hospital beds and community care. While hospitals in small towns and cities in Canada do sometimes reduce their hours, it is rarer for regional health hubs to do so. Ontario's health ministry would not say how many hospitals in the province, Canada's most populous, are affected by partial or temporary closures, but said it has taken measures to address the issue, including retaining nurses and other healthcare workers. ""Sometimes hospitals must make the difficult decision to close their emergency departments temporarily so that operations can continue throughout the rest of the hospital,"" a ministry spokesperson said. Hospitals in Quebec, the country's second-largest province, New Brunswick and Manitoba also have partially shut departments or temporarily cut hours for anywhere from a couple of weeks to a number of months, according to statements from the hospitals. In Kingston, Ontario, the Hotel Dieu Hospital's Urgent Care Clinic reduced its hours over the Canada Day long weekend. A spokesperson for the Kingston Health Science Centre described the move, which began on Friday, as a planned one-time reduction, but added it was expected that ""staffing shortages and the current surge in patient volumes will continue throughout the summer"". Children have been hard hit by the healthcare crunch as youngsters with no prior exposure to a number of viruses succumbed to illness during the spring as many people abandoned face masks used to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa, the nation's capital, ran at between 110 per cent and 120 per cent capacity for weeks in May and early June. Occupancy was a record high for the month of May, a spokesperson said. Low staffing and surging patient loads is ""kind of like that perfect storm,"" said Katharine Smart, a pediatrician who is the president of the Canadian Medical Association. Canada has the fourth-lowest number of funded acute care beds per capita among countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, according to the OECD, and the Commonwealth Fund ranked Canada's health system second-last among 11 rich countries. Some blame underfunding of the healthcare system dating back to the 1990s, when Canada's federal government cut spending to get the country's deficit under control. Others, such as the right-leaning Fraser Institute, say the government-funded system itself is the root cause of the problems, suggesting moving toward a privately-paid model. Canada may have little time to waste. Rami Rahal, a vice president at the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer, said there is a danger that cancer illness and deaths could worsen in the country due to lengthy periods in which screening was skipped or delayed and treatment postponed. ""We can't hire our way out of this crisis,"" he said. ""We have to find innovative ways of delivering care."""

Wuxi, a manufacturing hub in the Yangtze Delta on the central coast, halted operations at many public venues located underground, including shops and supermarkets. Dine-in services in restaurants were suspended, and the government advised people to work from home. City authorities urged residents not to leave Wuxi unless necessary, after reporting 42 new asymptomatic cases on Saturday. China continues to try to stamp out new infections as part of the strict approach taken in the country where the coronavirus was first detected in late 2019. But the lockdowns and other measures have taken a heavy toll on the world's second-biggest economy. Si county in Anhui province locked down its 760,000 residents and suspended public traffic as it reported 288 cases on Saturday. Anhui accounted for most of China's new infections, reporting 61 symptomatic and 231 asymptomatic cases for Saturday. Mainland China recorded 473 new COVID-19 cases, of which 104 were symptomatic and 369 were asymptomatic, the National Health Commission said on Sunday. That compares with 268 new cases a day earlier - 72 symptomatic and 196 asymptomatic infections, which China counts separately. Yiwu, China's export capital for small commodities, cancelled flights to the capital, Beijing, for an unspecified period, state TV said, citing COVID-19 prevention measures. Yiwu has reported three COVID-19 cases in the past week. Shanghai, China's most populous city and financial hub, reported one positive case outside of quarantine areas in the city from midnight to 5pm on Sunday, officials told a news press conference. The city lifted a lockdown on Friday after two months of shutdown that hit output and consumer spending. China's industrial production fell 2.9 per cent in April from a year earlier. There were no new deaths, keeping the nation's death toll to 5,226. As of Saturday, mainland China had confirmed 225,851 cases with symptoms. For Saturday, Beijing reported no new local cases, and Shanghai reported two local symptomatic cases, according to local government data. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/omicron-specific-covid-19-shots-increase-protection-boosters-2785536,Omicron-specific COVID-19 shots could increase protection as boosters: EMA,"Coronavirus vaccines tweaked to include the Omicron variant strain can improve protection when used as a booster, the European Medicines Agency and other global health regulators said on Friday (Jul 1). Following a meeting on Thursday, the EMA said global regulators had agreed on key principles for updating COVID-19 shots to respond to emerging variants. While the existing coronavirus vaccines continue to provide good protection against hospitalisation and death, the group said, vaccine effectiveness has taken a hit as the virus has evolved. As such, an Omicron-specific or bivalent booster - meaning a vaccine that includes both the new strain and the original coronavirus strain - could ""increase and extend"" protection, a statement from the EMA said. The statement refers specifically to the mRNA vaccines. Both Pfizer and Moderna have been testing retooled versions of their vaccines to include the Omicron variant. Vaccines which include other variants, for example the Beta variant, might also be considered for use as boosters if clinical trial data demonstrate an adequate level of neutralisation against Omicron and other variants of concern, the statement said. It follows guidance from the World Health Organization that Omicron-specific boosters could restore protection against emerging strains of the coronavirus. But it stops short of the position of the regulator in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which said on Thursday that it would seek the inclusion specifically of the newer BA.4 and BA.5 strains of Omicron, currently driving a surge in new infections globally, in any new shots for use domestically. On Tuesday, the head of a WHO advisory committee that has considered the modified shots said the group preferred BA.1-based boosters, arguing that the variant is more distinct and could generate a broader response than the more recently circulating subvariants. Top US FDA official Peter Marks said in an interview that regulators from other countries were seriously considering using new boosters based on the BA.1 Omicron variant that caused the massive surge in cases last winter, because those shots can be available sooner than the BA.4 or BA.5 based booster the United States plans to use. The EMA said it would provide more details in coming days. "

The TraceTogether token vending machines found in malls will also cease operations from Aug 1.  SingPost's direct delivery service for TraceTogether tokens issued for the first time has been ended on Friday. ""We have scaled back the operations as there is no longer such high demand for tokens,"" said SNDGO in a Facebook post. Members of the public who need a new token or a replacement may visit the TraceTogether counters during operating hours. They can also replace their old tokens at vending machines placed in community clubs/centres.  SNDGO also said members of the public can switch to, or continue to use the TraceTogether App if there is a need to reactivate contact tracing.  The list of counter and vending machine locations can be found at token.gowhere.gov.sg. Singapore relaxed its COVID-19 curbs in April, with contact tracing measures such as TraceTogether and SafeEntry no longer needed for most venues from Apr 26.  However, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said the public should not delete their TraceTogether apps or discard their tokens as Singapore will step up its vaccinated-differentiated safe management measures if necessary.  ""We are taking a cautious, ‘step down but not dismantle’ posture for our public health measures. If the situation requires, we will have to step up (vaccinated-differentiated measures), and reactivate TraceTogether and SafeEntry,"" Mr Ong had said in Parliament in May. "

However, it did not rule out re-introducing restrictive measures if the situation deteriorates. Consumer watchdog Rospotrebnadzor said it was ""suspending previously introduced restrictions, including the mask regime, a ban on public catering at night, and a number of other measures"". It said the dynamics of the virus were consistent with global trends and 93 per cent of confirmed cases were mild or asymptomatic. Since the start of the pandemic in Russia in April 2020, over 800,000 people have died from coronavirus or causes related to COVID-19, Reuters calculations show, with the country recording over 18 million infections. Russia was quick to develop and launch its Sputnik V vaccine when the pandemic struck but take-up was slow, with many Russians citing distrust of the authorities and fear of new medical products. About 52 per cent of the population has been fully vaccinated. "

The two cruise ships are homeported in Singapore.  Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia are the first Southeast Asian countries to resume port calls since cruising was halted in March 2020, said STB in a media statement on Friday.  ""Coupled with positive discussions to resume similar calls in more ports and the alignment of health protocols across the region, STB expects the cruise industry in Singapore to return to pre-pandemic levels between 2023 and 2024,"" it added.  STB chief executive, Keith Tan said the resumption of port calls is an important milestone for Singapore and the region. ""Cruising is a key tourism driver, and as ASEAN’s lead coordinator for cruise development, Singapore will continue to work with our counterparts to strengthen the region’s attractiveness as a cruising destination and source market.” STB said Singapore's cruise industry enjoyed ""robust growth"" prior to the pandemic, with more than 400 cruise ships across 30 cruise brands calling at the country's ports in 2019.  Singapore restarted cruising in November 2020 without any port calls. Since then, more than half a million passengers have sailed on nearly 370 ""cruise to nowhere"" sailings.  Amid the resumption, STB said cruising saw a ""new wave of interest"", especially among first-time passengers who did not consider cruising as a leisure option prior to COVID-19.  ""As more ships offer varied itineraries for cruising out of Southeast Asia, these new cruisers are expected to support a strong rebound for the industry."" STB added that Singapore is currently rebuilding its pipeline of cruise ship deployments. The country is also working with cruise lines to expand their customer base - from regional markets such as Indonesia and Malaysia, to mid and long-haul markets such as India, Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.  The fly-cruise segment, where international passengers fly to Singapore to board a cruise, is also expected to rebound strongly.  Prior to COVID-19, 70 per cent of Singapore’s cruise passengers were international visitors travelling to Singapore to take a cruise to explore Southeast Asia, said STB. To prepare for the return of fly-cruise travellers, STB said it will continue to offer the Cruise Development Fund to encourage cruise lines to homeport in Singapore. Cruise agents can also tap on this grant to develop and market cruise packages. "

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/covid-19-outbreak-north-korea-blames-alien-things-border-south-2784406,North Korea blames 'alien things' near border with South Korea for COVID-19 outbreak,"SEOUL: North Korea claimed on Friday (Jul 1) that the country's first COVID-19 outbreak began with patients touching ""alien things"" near the border with South Korea, apparently shifting blame to the neighbour for the wave of infections in the isolated country. Announcing results of an investigation, the North ordered people to ""vigilantly deal with alien things coming by wind and other climate phenomena and balloons in the areas along the demarcation line and borders,"" the official KCNA news agency said. The agency did not directly mention South Korea, but North Korean defectors and activists have for decades flown balloons from the South across the heavily fortified border, carrying leaflets and humanitarian aid. South Korea's unification ministry, handling inter-Korean affairs, said there was ""no possibility"" of the virus entering the North through leaflets sent across the border. According to KCNA, an 18-year-old soldier and a five-year-old kindergartner who contacted the unidentified materials ""in a hill around barracks and residential quarters"" in the eastern county of Kumgang in early April showed symptoms and later tested positive for the coronavirus. The KCNA said all other fever cases reported in the country until mid-April were due to other diseases, but it did not elaborate. ""It's hard to believe North Korea's claim, scientifically speaking, given that the possibility of the virus spreading through objects is quite low,"" said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the risk of people getting infected with COVID-19 through contact with contaminated surfaces or objects is generally considered low, though it is possible. The North also said the first two patients touched the unspecified objects in the eastern town in early April, but the first time a defectors' group is known to have sent balloons across the border this year was in late April from the western Gimpo region. The North's first admission of a COVID-19 outbreak came months after it eased border lockdowns enforced since early in 2020 to resume freight train operations with China. But it would have been difficult for Pyongyang to point fingers at China, said Lim Eul-chul, a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies at Kyungnam University. ""If they concluded the virus was from China, they would have had to tighten quarantine measures on the border area in a further setback to North Korea-China trade,"" Lim said. The North has claimed the COVID-19 wave has shown signs of subsiding, although experts suspect under-reporting in the figures released through government-controlled media. North Korea reported 4,570 more people with fever symptoms on Friday, with the total number of fever patients recorded since late April at 4.74 million. Pyongyang has been announcing the number of fever patients daily without specifying whether they had contracted COVID-19, apparently due to a lack of testing kits. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/omicron-5th-wave-covid19-coronavirus-infection-clinics-singapore-2784941,Clinics in Singapore see rise in COVID-19 patients in new wave of infections,"SINGAPORE: Clinics in Singapore are seeing a greater number of COVID-19 positive patients as coronavirus cases here start climbing again. Dr John Cheng, the head of primary care at Healthway Medical Group, said there was a gradual increase of about 10 per cent in patients with acute respiratory infections at their clinics in the past two weeks. Healthway has more than 50 general practitioner clinics. But he added: “It is different from the last wave where there was a sudden surge that made it difficult for clinics to cope. Having said that, it may be too early to comment as the peak is projected to be in July or August.” Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said last month that Singapore could expect a new Omicron wave in July or August, likely to be driven by subvariants BA.4 and BA.5. Fullerton Health clinics and affiliates, which number more than 800, have also seen an increase in patients with acute respiratory illness (ARI) from May through June, said a spokesperson. “We will be closely monitoring the ARI rate in July as more individuals have returned from overseas travel following the June holidays and it is also the tail end of the southern hemisphere influenza season,” said the spokesperson. Dr Lee Joon Loong from Paddington Medical Clinic said that in the last week, he saw more COVID-19 patients on average than during the earlier Omicron wave, which peaked in March. Dr Zhang Hao Tian from 1 Bishan Medical Clinic said he has seen an uptick of about 20 to 30 per cent in coronavirus cases, but the increase is “still quite manageable” compared to earlier waves. On Tuesday, Singapore reported 11,504 new COVID-19 cases – the highest daily number of infections in more than three months. There were more than 9,000 daily cases on Wednesday and Thursday. This is a marked increase from May and earlier in June when the number of infections ranged from 1,000 to more than 6,000 a day. At the peak of the last Omicron wave, daily cases topped 25,000. Then, the primary healthcare system comprising general practitioners, polyclinics and hospital emergency departments was stretched, although the number of patients with severe disease or in intensive care was lower than during the Delta wave. Dr Lee said that he recommends patients who have symptoms consult a doctor for an assessment, as he has seen more people with “increased severity” and complications from the infection, he said. He added that he has treated symptomatic patients who tested negative with an antigen rapid test kit at home, but was positive when tested at the clinic.  “We do a proper test and we also assess for the complications of COVID-19. That's why it's very important to see your doctor,” he advised. Dr Cheng said that people who test positive but are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms can recover at home, according to Ministry of Health (MOH) guidelines. “If they are unwell, they are advised to see a doctor,” he said. While studies and data overseas have reported more breakthrough infections due to BA.4 and BA.5, clinics here have not seen a clear trend of this happening in Singapore. “But do keep in mind that we have not reached the peak of the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariant wave yet,” said Dr Cheng. Professor Paul Tambyah, deputy director of the Infectious Diseases Translational Research Programme at the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, said that the rate of reinfection with BA.4 and BA.5 is still low.  “The problem with BA.4 and BA.5 is that they are more transmissible but not necessarily more virulent. This happens with all pandemic viruses. They become more transmissible and less virulent over time,” said Prof Tambyah. Associate Professor Natasha Howard from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at NUS said that people who have been fully vaccinated and boosted or recently had COVID-19 can still get infected. “Unless you can avoid people entirely, and most of us wouldn’t want to, it will be almost impossible to avoid any COVID infection (or reinfection) as we adjust to endemicity,” she said.  “This is why we so strongly recommend being fully vaccinated and getting boosted once you’re eligible. If you are fully vaccinated you are less likely to experience severe disease.” Dr Zhang, whose Bishan clinic offers vaccinations, has also noticed more people enquiring about and taking booster jabs. ""We do see quite a lot of people asking and walking in for vaccinations, which is quite heartening and which we strongly encourage,"" he said. For those who are concerned about reinfection, they should still get their booster vaccination 90 days following recovery, said the Fullerton Health spokesperson. Assoc Prof Howard said that most seniors should take an mRNA vaccine as a booster, unless they are medically ineligible, in which case they can take Novavax's Nuvaxovid. “While these don’t specifically target BA.4/5 subvariants they still provide good protection against severe infection,” she said.  Booster vaccine candidates in the pipeline, such as Moderna's bivalent booster candidate (mRNA-1273.214) that showed a good response against BA.4 and BA.5, are not yet approved for use. Assoc Prof Howard expects the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants to “soon overtake” the currently dominant BA.2 Omicron subvariant in Singapore.  In May, 97 per cent of local COVID-19 cases sequenced were all Omicron, with the majority being subvariant BA.2 and its lineages. While there were cases of BA.4 and BA.5, they made up 1 to 2 per cent of the cases. The new subvariants do not appear to cause more severe disease than earlier mutations. But she warned: “People should remember that more cases means more hospitalisations and deaths due to basic maths, even if the total proportions of these to cases remain unchanged.”  Besides getting a booster shot, Dr Cheng encouraged people to practise basic hygiene and wear a mask, avoid crowded places and practise social responsibility by staying home if feeling unwell. Prof Tambyah added that the virus will continue to adapt to evade the immune system and “infect the last few people who remain uninfected”.  “In practical terms, this means that we need to continue with the approach we have taken of ‘living with the virus’,” he said.  “We know that most people will eventually get infected but as long as we concentrate on treating those who are vulnerable and at risk, we will be fine.” "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/us-supreme-court-nixes-religious-challenge-new-york-covid-19-vaccine-mandate-2783916,US Supreme Court nixes religious challenge to New York COVID-19 vaccine mandate,"WASHINGTON: The US Supreme Court on Thursday (Jun 30) declined to hear a challenge to New York's mandate that healthcare sector workers be vaccinated against COVID-19 brought by a group of doctors, nurses and others who objected on religious grounds. Turning away an appeal by 16 healthcare workers, the justices left in place a lower court ruling that rejected their claim that the mandate violates the US Constitution's First Amendment prohibition against religious discrimination by the government. Most of the workers either resigned from their jobs, lost hospital admitting privileges or were fired for refusing the vaccine. Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, dissented from the decision to deny the appeal. The Supreme Court previously rejected other challenges to vaccine mandates including one focusing upon Maine's lack of a religious exemption for healthcare workers. New York's Department of Health last Aug 26 ordered healthcare professionals who come in contact with patients or other employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 as a safety measure during a pandemic that has killed more than a million Americans. The state allows a narrow medical exemption for the small number of people with a serious allergic reaction to the COVID-19 vaccines. The state has said that under the policy employers can consider religious accommodation requests and employees can be reassigned to jobs such as remote work. Healthcare workers in the state have also been subject to similar vaccine mandates measles and rubella, which also have no religious exemptions. The dispute began when a group of doctors, nurses, therapists and other healthcare workers - mostly Catholics - sued in federal court under pseudonyms. Among the plaintiffs, three doctors lost admitting privileges, seven providers were fired or resigned, five chose to be vaccinated ""under protest"" and one eventually received a medical exemption. Overall, nearly 37,000 New York healthcare workers either resigned, retired or were fired or furloughed for being unvaccinated, according to state data. The plaintiffs have said they object to any COVID-19 vaccine whose testing or development relied on cell lines from aborted fetuses. The COVID-19 vaccines used in the United States do not contain aborted fetal cells. Laboratory-grown cells that descended from the cells of an aborted fetus obtained decades ago were used in testing during the vaccine development process. The Vatican issued guidance to Catholics in 2020 that it is morally acceptable to use COVID-19 vaccines. New York noted in a legal filing that use of such cell lines for testing is common, including for the rubella vaccination, which healthcare workers already take. The Manhattan-based 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a bid by the plaintiffs for a preliminary injunction, finding last November that the mandate neutrally applied to everyone and likely was not biased against religion.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/fda-asks-covid-19-boosters-fight-omicrons-ba4-ba5-subvariants-2783781,"FDA asks for COVID-19 boosters to fight Omicron's BA.4, BA.5 subvariants","The US Food and Drug Administration on Thursday (Jun 30) recommended COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers change the design of their booster shots beginning this fall to include components tailored to combat the currently dominant Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the coronavirus. If authorised, the changes would mark the first major retooling of the COVID vaccines, but also could slow their rollout as the FDA has recommended a design somewhat different from what the companies had already tested and started producing. The FDA also has suggested it could authorise the new shots before studies testing them in humans are completed. Annual changes to flu vaccines do not require new trials. ""In a sense, we are chasing the virus, just as we do with influenza, and how close we can get to the variants that are prominent at the time, we'll have to wait and see,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, adding that the redesigned vaccines could provide better protection than the current ones. The FDA said companies would not need to change the vaccine for the primary vaccination series, saying the coming year will be ""a transitional period when this modified booster vaccine may be introduced."" The new booster shots would be bivalent vaccines, meaning doses would target both the original virus as well as the Omicron subvariants. The decision follows a recommendation by the agency's outside advisers to change the design of the shots this fall in order to combat more prevalent versions of the coronavirus. BA.4 and BA.5 are now estimated to account for more than 50 per cent of US infections, according the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and have also become dominant elsewhere. The FDA said in a statement on Thursday that it hoped the modified vaccines could be used in early to mid-fall. Scientists have suggested that introducing redesigned boosters could spur broader range of immune responses that might also protect against future variants, even if they are not the ones currently circulating. ""Predicting the future with COVID-19 in particular is hazardous, because COVID has faked us out on a number of occasions,"" Schaffner said. Pfizer Inc with partner BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc have been testing versions of their vaccines modified to combat the BA.1 Omicron variant that caused the massive surge in cases last winter. Although they have said those vaccines generated a good immune response against BA.1 and the more recently circulating variants, they did see a lower response against BA.4 and BA.5. The companies had already been manufacturing their BA.1 vaccines, and said on Tuesday switching to a BA.4/BA.5 design could delay their introduction. Pfizer-BioNTech, which on Wednesday announced a US$3.2 billion contract to supply more COVID-19 vaccine doses to the United States, said they would have a substantial amount of BA.4/BA.5 vaccine ready for distribution by the first week of October. Moderna said it would be late October or early November before it would have the newly modified vaccine ready. The exact authorisation process for the new shot is not yet clear. The FDA directed manufacturers to launch clinical trials to study the BA.4/5 vaccines, but said they would evaluate data on their previous BA.1-based vaccines to support authorisation of the modified shots.

Health, police and fire services staff are among the more than 570 infected cases, the government said on Thursday (Jun 30). Residents must test daily for the virus using Rapid Antigen kits. The Chinese special administrative region carried out three city-wide mass coronavirus tests for its more than 600,000 residents in the space of a week. More than 7,000 people are in mandatory quarantine. Macao, a former Portuguese colony, destroyed 100kg of mango fruit from Taiwan after a sample tested positive for the coronavirus, the government said on Thursday. Imports of mangos from the Taiwanese manufacturer would be banned for one week, it said. Sands China's Sheraton hotel located on Macao's Las Vegas style Cotai strip has allocated 2,000 rooms to asymptomatic patients. More than 20 zones across the city are locked down as authorities try to cut the chains of transmission for the rapidly spreading BA.5.1 Omicron variant. Authorities have asked people to remain at home as much as possible with most of the city effectively closed, including bars, hair salons and outdoor parks. Only takeaway is allowed from dining facilities. Casinos, while mostly deserted, are allowed to stay open, the city's government said, in a move to protect local jobs. The stringent measures come after Macao has been largely COVID-free since an outbreak in October 2021. Macao adheres to China's ""zero COVID"" policy which aims to eradicate all outbreaks, at just about any cost, running counter to a global trend of trying to co-exist with the virus. Macao's cases are still far below daily infections in other places, including neighbouring Hong Kong where cases have jumped to close to 2,000 a day this month. Macao only has one public hospital with its services already stretched on a daily basis. The territory has an open border with mainland China, with many residents living and working in the adjoining city of Zhuhai."

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/hong-kong-emigration-exodus-singapore-asian-financial-hub-zero-covid-finance-business-jobs-economy-2780811,Commentary: The gap between Singapore and Hong Kong as financial hubs is narrowing,"SINGAPORE: Amid volatile times of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and COVID-19 lockdowns in China, there is a notable wave of Hong Kong emigration. This might have begun as early as 2020 after the city passed the National Security Law. Hong Kong’s population declined by 1.2 per cent in 2020, its first recorded fall in 60 years, losing 93,000 residents. In February and March alone this year, it lost another 129,000 residents. Hong Kong’s long-celebrated status as an Asian financial hub seems to be diminishing too. New visas issued to foreign workers in the financial sector plummeted by 49 per cent between 2018 and 2021. Spooked by strict COVID-19 rules and diminishing political freedom, bankers from Citigroup to JPMorgan are talking about relocating. While the face of Hong Kong is changing, it seems Singapore would end up benefitting. The exodus is unlikely to lose momentum with rising geopolitical tensions between China and the West.  Could Singapore catch up to or even overtake Hong Kong as an international financial hub in the long term? Currently, Hong Kong is still a larger and more active market than Singapore given its older history as a business centre. According to the 2022 Global Financial Centres Index, Hong Kong ranks third after New York and London, while Singapore ranks sixth. Despite all its challenges, Hong Kong also ranks in the top four for business environment, human capital infrastructure and general reputation. However, the gap between the two cities is narrowing given the recent outflow of capital and talent from Hong Kong. The Hong Kong dollar was at its weakest level in over three years, driven by traders selling to buy the US dollar to enjoy rising US interest rates. This prompted the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to intervene in May, when it bought the Hong Kong dollar back from the currency market to keep the currency’s tight peg to the US dollar.  As the city cut its growth forecast to a range of 1 per cent to 2 per cent in 2022 – down from the previous 2 per cent to 3.5 per cent – this capital outflow could reinforce itself as the gloom spreads across the market, leading to a downward spiral of the financial hub. Unlike previous waves of staff relocation that Hong Kong has gone through since the British handover to China in 1997, this time the most experienced executives are flocking elsewhere for business stability and quality of life improvements. As of March, JPMorgan is moving top executives and key staff from Hong Kong to Shanghai, given restrictions on business travel to mainland China. Citigroup said in February that it will shift senior equities staff and directors to Singapore for their family reasons and client coverage – around the same time Singapore authorities streamlined COVID-19 travel and social restrictions. More broadly, multinational companies, such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo, were reported to have been reviewing their Hong Kong businesses and looking to relocate employees or operations to Singapore. As more companies look outside Hong Kong’s horizons, Singapore will contend with Hong Kong as the first choice for their Asia headquarters. Especially once a few major firms start to make a fully committed move, there might be a herding effect that will result in laggard firms following suit. This was likely the case to some extent after Brexit – an EY tracker indicated that the number of financial services firms which moved or planned to move UK operations, staff and assets nearly doubled between March 2017 and March 2021. Meanwhile, Singapore is strengthening its status as a financial hub as more affluent investors worldwide set up base here. Billionaire entrepreneurs from James Dyson to Haidilao co-founder Shu Ping have established family offices in Singapore, drawn in by attractive tax rates and a stable regulatory environment. The Monetary Authority of Singapore approved more than 100 applications for family offices in the first four months of this year.  In addition to the capital brought to Singapore by family offices, these investors typically demand sophisticated financial services, creating jobs for wealth managers. The accumulation of financial and human capital goes towards increasing Singapore’s competitiveness as a financial hub. Regional economic development is another tailwind for Singapore. China’s zero-COVID policies have triggered manufacturers to shift supply chains to countries like Vietnam, whose exports jumped by 13.4 per cent in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the previous year. Singapore can potentially facilitate such relocations, given its longstanding business presence across Southeast Asia and familiarity with Chinese processes. Financial institutions can connect clients with investors, legal firms can support the opening of new branches, and consultancies can advise on sourcing regional suppliers and training staff. Until then, Singapore needs to accommodate the inflow of foreign talent while maintaining the social balance and keeping inflation down. The demand for living and working in Singapore can increase quickly but the supply of housing, education, and transportation takes much longer to catch up. In the short term, there can be bottlenecks in travel from Hong Kong to Singapore, with major airlines offering fewer flights to and out of Hong Kong due to the city’s stringent quarantine rules. Nonetheless, the senior executives are wealthy enough to make the trip.  Their sudden arrival in Singapore, however, heats up high-end markets for private housing and education.  Rentals for private homes in Singapore surged 4.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2022 compared to a rise of 2.6 per cent in the previous quarter, according to the Urban Redevelopment Authority. Spots in international schools are scarce too, with each available slot receiving up to 15 applications from interested families, according to a Financial Times report in March. Before these shortages ease, the needs of new expats could crowd out that of locals, though this could be somewhat limited given the niche demands.  But with inflation felt everywhere from food to energy prices, locals will be eyeing the attractive white-collar jobs these firms bring with them. It might be challenging for policymakers to curb the demand in the short term without killing it in the long run. Singapore will raise the minimum qualifying salary for incoming finance professionals from S$5,000 to S$5,500 in September – though it is a bar senior bankers can easily clear. But with more than 9,400 new jobs in finance on offer this year, coupled with a tight labour market, such high-powered immigration to Singapore could be a good problem to have for now.

The daily number of infections on Wednesday was a fall from the 11,504 cases reported on Tuesday, which was the highest in more than 3 months.  Cases tend to increase on Tuesdays, with Health Minister Ong Ye Kung previously referring to such a pattern, writing on Facebook in October 2021 that numbers would ""always spike after the weekends"". A total of 455 patients are in hospital, according to the latest infection statistics on the Ministry of Health's (MOH) website on Wednesday night. Forty-six patients require oxygen supplementation. Seven patients are in the intensive care unit. The week-on-week infection ratio rose to 1.65 from Tuesday's 1.62. This refers to the ratio of community cases for the past week over the week before, with a figure above 1 indicating that the number of new weekly COVID-19 cases is rising.  The week-on-week infection ratio has been above 1 since Jun 14.  Singapore's recent spike in COVID-19 cases comes after Mr Ong said earlier this month to expect a next wave of infections, as people's antibodies from vaccinations and infections from the last Omicron wave start to wane. Among the local cases reported on Wednesday, 8,075 cases are tested using antigen rapid tests (ARTs) and have been assessed by doctors to have mild symptoms and are of low risk, said MOH. The remaining 714 local COVID-19 cases were confirmed via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Of the imported cases, 568 were tested using ARTs and 35 using PCR tests. Singapore has recorded 1,434,563 COVID-19 cases since the start of the pandemic. As of Tuesday, 96 per cent of Singapore's eligible population have completed their full vaccination regimen under the national vaccination programme. About 78 per cent of the total population have received their vaccine booster shots. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/china-eases-covid-19-curbs-airline-tickets-domestic-international-travel-surge-2780791,"China's easing COVID-19 curbs spark travel inquiry surge, and caution","BEIJING: Online searches for Chinese airline tickets on domestic and international routes surged on Wednesday (Jun 29), after Beijing said it would slash COVID-19 quarantine requirements and made changes to a state-mandated mobile app used for local travel. The unexpected moves mark a significant easing of rigid curbs that have severely curtailed travel and battered China's economy, although tough measures remain in place including a scarcity of international flights, and many social media users voiced caution. The industry ministry said on Wednesday that a Chinese mobile app that shows whether a person has travelled in a Chinese city with COVID-affected areas will no longer mark that history with an asterisk, one of the many means China has of tracking and curbing the virus's possible spread. The asterisk helped local authorities to impose curbs such as quarantines and COVID-19 testing, and sparked widespread complaints. ""It looks like a small step, but is a rather big step,"" a user wrote on the Twitter-like Weibo, where the announcement quickly became the top topic with more than 200 million views. It came a day after Beijing eased quarantine rules and as Shanghai resumed restaurant dining following a two-month lockdown that brought China's largest city to a halt and infuriated residents. The two policies triggered a surge in travel inquiries. The Qunar platform reporting that searches for air tickets rose 60 per cent and doubled for hotels in the 30 minutes after Wednesday's announcement. Rival Ly.com reported a similar rise, and flagged a jump in interest for tickets to China from locations including Japan, Singapore and South Korea. China's zero-COVID policies have almost completely wiped out international business and leisure travel, while domestic travel has also been hit hard by China's response to outbreaks in April and May of the highly infectious Omicron variant, which brought drastic lockdowns in several cities. This week's easing measures follow a recent dramatic decrease in locally transmitted infections. ""It's too soon to tell how much this will inspire people to travel as in all likelihood they will still need to deal with fairly stringent testing requirements wherever they travel domestically,"" said Ben Cavender, managing director at China Market Research Group. While the rest of the world tries to live with the virus, China has vowed to stick to its tough curbs, with President Xi Jinping reiterating that the strategy was ""correct and effective"" and should be firmly adhered to. Many would-be travellers said on social media and in chatrooms they were taking a wait-and-see approach before trying to book tickets, citing a shortage of flights and government limits on new passports for Chinese looking to go abroad for reasons deemed non-essential. Depending on their destination, airlines flying into China must limit their load factors to between 45 per cent and 75 per cent. The country also has a ""circuit breaker"" system requiring carriers to suspend flights if they have a certain number of COVID-positive passengers. On Tuesday, the number of international flights, including to Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan, for this year stood at about 4 per cent of pre-COVID levels, according to consultancy Variflight. Ticket prices are far above normal. One-way tickets from Singapore to China's business hub of Shanghai cost between 50,000 and 70,000 yuan (US$7,460 and US$10,590) on China Eastern Airlines for the period between July and September, for example. ""There are very few flights, air ticket prices are sky high. In fact it is not possible to arrange international group travel,"" said Zhou Weihong, deputy general manager of Shanghai-based travel agency Spring Tour. "

The SKYCovione vaccine was authorised for a two-dose regimen on people aged 18 or older, with shots given four weeks apart, according to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. In a phase III clinical trial of 4,037 adults, SKYCovione induced neutralising antibody responses against the SARS-CoV-2 parental strain, SK bioscience said in a statement. It is not yet known how effective it is against Omicron and other COVID-19 variants. The vaccine was jointly developed by the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design, with the support of global drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). SK bioscience said it would seek authorisations for distribution of SKYCovione in other countries and through global vaccine sharing facility COVAX, and for emergency use listing at the World Health Organization. South Korean authorities have agreed to a 200 billion won (US$155 million) deal to buy 10 million doses of the vaccine, which can be stored under normal refrigeration conditions, and previously said they expected it to be rolled out from the second half of the year. SK bioscience is now looking into its possible use for booster shots, and planning trials for adolescents and children, it added. Nearly 87 per cent of South Korea's 52 million population are fully vaccinated, with 65 per cent having also had a booster shot, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency data. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/shanghai-covid-19-dining-restrictions-lifted-restaurants-2776711,Widespread relief for Shanghai's restaurant sector as dine-in resumes,"SHANGHAI: Restaurants and eateries in China's largest city Shanghai began reopening their doors to diners on Wednesday (Jun 29), bringing widespread relief to an industry that was badly hit by the city's two-month COVID-19 lockdown. Large chains such as hot pot brand Haidilao, fine dining establishments and family-owned eateries had started scrubbing tableware and getting uniforms laundered since Saturday when authorities announced the curbs were lifting, a month after the city's lockdown eased on Jun 1. ""It's a very good feeling,"" said Oli Liu, co-owner of tapas restaurant chain Brownstone as he prepared to open his five outlets for indoor dining on Wednesday. ""With indoor dining, we can make money ... Until now we could do takeaway and delivery but the commissions we have to pay (to delivery platforms) means we can't make money from that."" Many restaurants in the city of 25 million were forced to suspend dine-in services as early as mid-March when the number of COVID-19 cases in Shanghai began rising. While some were able to resume food deliveries in the midst of the lockdown, others remained shut throughout. The reopening, however, is far from straightforward. Some owners said they had not yet received the green light from their districts and are required to cap customer numbers at 50 per cent as well as a limit each session to 90 minutes. All restaurant staff will also be required to undergo daily COVID-19 testing, while diners have to show proof of a PCR test taken within three days to enter. Local media reports have also suggested dining parties should nominate a ""leader"" who will be responsible for their table, though it's unclear what might happen if guests later test positive. Complying with such onerous rules will not be easy, and many eateries already have or are expected to call it quits, said Stefan Stiller, chef-owner of fine dining restaurant Taian Table, who added that he expects restrictions to be in place in some form for the rest of the year. For his three-star Michelin restaurant that only seats 30 at capacity and specialises in 10 to 12-course tasting menus that typically take several hours to complete, meeting the criteria is ""not so easy ... but we will manage somehow"", he said. But many diners are eager to get back into restaurants after months of mostly eating at home. One of the first customers through the door at Brownstone's Lujiazui location at lunchtime on Wednesday was a Shanghai resident surnamed He. ""Normally at home, I don't cook ... I have especially missed eating out,"" he said. ""For so long I missed eating many things - crayfish, barbecue, drinking beer."" "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/us-fda-advisers-recommend-inclusion-omicron-component-covid-19-vaccine-boosters-2776021,US FDA advisers recommend inclusion of Omicron component for COVID-19 vaccine boosters,"Advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday (Jun 28) recommended a change in the design of COVID-19 booster shots this fall in order to combat more recently circulating variants of the coronavirus. The FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee voted 19-2 that the next wave of COVID-19 booster shots should include a component that targets the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. The FDA plans to decide by early July on what the design of the boosters should be. FDA scientists at the meeting suggested they preferred vaccines that will target the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants that are currently dominant rather than the BA.1 Omicron variant that led to a massive surge in infections last winter. Dr Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said the regulator would hope to launch a booster campaign with a retooled vaccine by October. ""The better the match of the vaccines to the circulating strain we believe may correspond to improved vaccine effectiveness, and potentially to a better durability of protection,"" Marks told the meeting of outside expert advisers to the agency. Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax presented data at the meeting. All three companies have been testing versions of their vaccines updated to combat the BA.1 Omicron variant. Moderna said it would be ready with a ""couple of hundred million"" of bivalent, or double targeted, vaccines designed to combat BA.1 by September. It would be late October or early November if it needs to design a vaccine targeting the newer subvariants, the company said. Pfizer said that it and partner BioNTech already has a significant amount of BA.1 vaccine ready and is preparing to produce a large amount of vaccine targeting BA.4 and BA.5. It said either could be ready for an early October rollout. Dr Kanta Subbarao, representing a World Health Organization advisory committee that also considered the issue, said she preferred BA.1-based vaccines, suggesting they could generate a broader immune response because that variant is more distinct from the original virus than its successor subvariants. ""Our goal here is to achieve broader immunity against circulating and emerging variants,"" Subbarao said, noting that trying to match what variant might be circulating in the fall is difficult because of uncertainty about the trajectory of the evolution of the virus. Both Moderna and Pfizer have said that their respective BA.1 inclusive vaccines generated a better immune response against Omicron than their current shots that were designed for the original virus that emerged from China. They have said their new vaccines also appear to work against BA.4 and BA.5, but that protection is not as strong as against BA.1. The International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities, a group of global drug regulators that includes the FDA, will meet to discuss the issue on Thursday. "

Italian eighth seed Matteo Berrettini, the runner-up at last year's Wimbledon, joined 2017 finalist Marin Cilic of Croatia on Tuesday to pull out of this year's Championships after testing positive for COVID-19. Czech players Barbora Krejcikova and Marie Bouzkova withdrew from the French Open after contracting the virus. ""At some point ... we all might have had the flu,"" former world number 11 Cornet told reporters at Wimbledon, according to French daily L'Equipe. ""At Roland Garros, yes, I think there have been a few cases and it's a tacit agreement between us. We are not going to self-test to get into trouble. Afterwards, I saw girls wearing masks, maybe because they knew and didn't want to pass on."" Wimbledon organisers the All England Club (AELTC) have not put COVID-19 restrictions in place this year and vaccination and testing is not mandatory for players to participate. Cornet, who defeated 27th seed Yulia Putintseva 6-3 7-6(5) on Tuesday in her record-equalling 62nd consecutive appearance in a Grand Slam main draw, feared the health regulations might change following the Berrettini and Cilic cases. ""We paid the price, we were in a bubble for a year and a half, we all got vaccinated, it's good,"" the 32-year-old said. American Coco Gauff, 18, said she was comfortable with the responsibility of testing being on the players at the grasscourt Grand Slam. ""I think for the most part I feel like it's okay that players are doing it themselves,"" she said. ""That's, like, the regulations in the government now, if you feel symptoms, test. ""That's what I would do if I felt any COVID-19 symptoms, I would test. I think it's also good that we don't have to test every day or every other day. I don't want to go back to that. Not being scared to be tested, but it's also, like, a hassle,"" Gauff added. ""I think with the vaccines and everything, we kind of know that the viral load is low and it's very hard to transfer if you're a vaccinated individual. I would encourage everybody if you're feeling symptoms to test."" "

Cases tend to increase on Tuesdays, with Health Minister Ong Ye Kung previously referring to such a pattern, writing on Facebook in October 2021 that numbers would ""always spike after the weekends"". The last time Singapore reported more daily infections than Tuesday was on Mar 22, when 13,166 COVID-19 new cases were reported. A total of 437 patients are in hospital, according to the latest infection statistics on the Ministry of Health's (MOH) website on Tuesday night. Thirty-six patients require oxygen supplementation. Nine patients are in the intensive care unit. On Monday, MOH said about 45 per cent of COVID-19 cases in the community in the past week were those of the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, up from 30 per cent in the week before. The BA.5 subvariant alone is estimated to have contributed to 40 per cent of all COVID-19 cases in the past week. However, international and local data show that the two subvariants do not result in more severe outcomes as compared to the earlier Omicron strains, said MOH on Monday. ""Coupled with our population’s high vaccination coverage, the number of severe COVID-19 infections has remained manageable,"" said the Health Ministry. Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who is also co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force, said on Monday that there was no need to tighten COVID-19 safe management measures at this stage, but adjustments will be made ""if need be"". He said cases are expected to continue rising in the coming weeks, although the hospital situation remained stable. Earlier this month, Mr Ong said that Singapore could expect a new Omicron wave to emerge in July or August, as COVID-19 antibodies start to wane.  Among the local cases reported on Tuesday, 9,989 cases are tested using antigen rapid tests (ARTs) and have been assessed by doctors to have mild symptoms and are of low risk, said MOH. The remaining 743 local COVID-19 cases were confirmed via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Of the imported cases, 748 were tested using ARTs and 24 using PCR tests. The week-on-week infection ratio is 1.62. A number above 1 indicates that the number of new weekly COVID-19 cases is rising. The week-on-week infection ratio has been above 1 since Jun 14.  Singapore has recorded 1,425,171 COVID-19 cases since the start of the pandemic. The Health Ministry will be conducting a third national distribution of 10 ART kits to each residential household from Jul 18 via post.  As of Monday, 96 per cent of Singapore's eligible population have completed their full vaccination regimen under the national vaccination programme. About 78 per cent of the total population have received their vaccine booster shots. People aged 50 and above who want to get their second booster shot can do so by walking into any vaccination centre offering mRNA vaccines. The mRNA vaccines used in Singapore are Pfizer-BioNTech's Comirnaty vaccine and Moderna's Spikevax vaccine. The expert committee on COVID-19 vaccination has assessed that people aged 50 to 59 who wish to take their second booster may also do so about five months after their first booster shot.  “This is in view of data indicating that the risk of severe COVID-19 increases in the age group of 50 to 59 as well,” said MOH. ""This is also around the age when chronic diseases start to set in."" There are currently 10 Joint Testing and Vaccination Centres, and eight vaccination centres.

Quarantine at centralised facilities has been cut to seven days from 14, and subsequent at-home health monitoring has been reduced to three days from seven, the National Health Commission said in a statement. The latest guidelines from the health authority also eased quarantine requirements for close contacts of people who have tested positive for the new coronavirus. China has cautiously eased its COVID curbs on cross-border travellers in recent months, with health officials saying the shorter incubation period of the Omicron variant allows for an adjustment of quarantine periods. The Chinese capital Beijing in recent months has already reduced the quarantine period at centralised facilities to 10 days from 14. China, last month, also removed some COVID-19 test requirements for people flying in from countries such as the United States. ""We believe that today's announcement will be welcomed by the American business community,"" the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai said on its official WeChat account. The quarantine adjustment will make it easier for companies to bring staff to China, and for Chinese companies and their executives to visit the United States, AmCham said. Stock markets rose in Hong Kong and China, with the Hang Seng Index reversing losses and ticking up roughly 0.4 per cent and the CSI300 Index gaining 0.7 per cent. Shares in Chinese tourism companies jumped more than 5 per cent. China's aviation regulator said this month it had been in touch with some countries to steadily increase the number of flights in the second half of 2022. Beijing and Shanghai reported on Tuesday no new local COVID-19 infections, the first time both cities were in the clear simultaneously since late February, after months of fighting their worst-ever outbreaks. The milestone for the two cities, achieved on Monday, came after their daily caseloads dropped to single digits over the past week, allowing Shanghai to gradually resume eating in at restaurants and Beijing to reopen some leisure venues including the Universal Beijing Resort. Shanghai Communist Party chief Li Qiang declared on Saturday that authorities had ""won the war to defend Shanghai"" against COVID-19, after a crushing two-month citywide lockdown that was finally lifted in early June. The Walt Disney Co's Shanghai Disney Resort said on Tuesday that it would reopen the Disneyland theme park on Jun 30; it had been shut for more than three months. Authorities, however, were adamant the government's so-called dynamic zero COVID policy, which aims at blocking flare-ups from spreading as they crop up, remains in place. Beijing would ""fight against any new outbreaks at the outset and with speed and resolutely break their transmission channel"", Cai Qi, the city's top Communist Party chief, was quoted as saying in a report by the party-backed Beijing Daily. Earlier on Monday, the Beijing Daily apparently misquoted Cai as saying the city would maintain its COVID control effort for ""the next five years"". The newspaper afterwards removed the reference and its chief, Zhao Jingyun, said it was an error but that did not prevent some suspicion among the public. ""Surely it wasn't a mistake! It's meant to gauge public opinion!"" said a user of the Weibo social media platform. Another Weibo user said even if it was a mistake, ""at least the higher-ups are now aware of how helpless we all feel and how we detest the current counter-epidemic policies"".  "

Today, my strong, brave son had passed on to the next world ... after fighting for his life,” Mr Farath Shba wrote in a post on LinkedIn on Monday. “In this difficult time, I’ve chosen to spend time with my loved ones and won’t be responsive on LinkedIn or any social media for a while. “Thanks for all the support.” The post ended with “Zaheer Raees Ali”. The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported on Monday that a toddler had died from encephalitis due to COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus and enterovirus infections, adding that the Singaporean boy had no other past medical history and was previously well. The boy was the first person under the age of 12 to die of COVID-19 in Singapore. The toddler was taken to the children’s emergency department at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) on the night of Jun 21. He had a high fever and recurrent seizures, with a subsequent drop in consciousness, said MOH. He was admitted to the children’s intensive care unit in critical condition on Jun 22 and was diagnosed with severe meningoencephalitis. This is a neurological condition that involves encephalitis or inflammation of the brain, and infection of the meninges or membranes that cover the brain. His polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was positive for COVID-19 as well as two other viruses – rhinovirus/enterovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. Mr Farath wrote about his son’s worsening condition around that time in a post on LinkedIn. He was asking for further medical assistance, saying: “The doctors are saying that his brain is swollen and there’s nothing much that (they) could’ve done to alleviate the (swelling) which is due to inflammation and to save him.”  “Can anyone get me to a neurosurgeon or a medical professional who could save my dear boy please,” he asked. On Monday, Mr Farath wrote on LinkedIn that his ""strong, brave son had passed on ... after fighting for his life"". MOH noted that COVID-19 can result in severe disease, even in children and those without pre-existing medical conditions. “Vaccination substantially reduces the likelihood of severe disease when one is infected,” the ministry said. “All children aged five to 11 years are recommended to be vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine, especially children with underlying chronic medical conditions.” MOH added that authorities will study the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines for children under the age of five. This comes after the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Jun 18 recommended COVID-19 vaccines for children as young as six months old. "

""Our hospitals and COVID-19 Treatment Facilities are prepared to cope with the projected surge in cases. We also have contingency plans to ramp up our healthcare capacity quickly, if needed,"" said the Health Ministry.  MOH added that it will not be making any changes to safe management measures at this juncture. Masks will be still be required indoors as a key line of defence. Current vaccination-differentiated safe management measures for some higher-risk activities will also remain unchanged.  ""However, we are monitoring the situation closely, and do not rule out the need to tighten safe management measures should the need arise."" The Health Ministry will be conducting a third national distribution of 10 antigen rapid test (ART) kits to each residential household from Jul 18 via post.  ""Due to the high volume of ART kits being distributed, we seek the public’s patience and understanding that it could take a few weeks for some households to receive the kits,"" said MOH.  For lower-income households who require more test kits for self-testing beyond what MOH will be providing, beneficiaries of Social Service Offices and Family Service Centres may continue to request for additional kits at these locations. Additionally, MOH will be working with the Ministry of Education and the Early Childhood Development Agency to provide ART kits on request to students from lower-income households. ""More information on the provision of these ART kits to be distributed by schools and educational institutions will be separately shared with students and parents,"" said MOH.  MOH also reminded those who have yet to receive their booster shots to do so without delay.  ""Three doses of mRNA vaccine (two primary series plus a booster) are needed to properly protect ourselves against the Omicron variant."" Currently, there are still close to 70,000 eligible seniors aged 60 and above who have not received their third shot or first booster. The Health Ministry also said a second booster is not recommended for all individuals.  ""This is because after the first booster, the protection against severe illness remains very strong for most people, likely for a longer term. ""However, international studies show that some groups, even after the first booster, are at an increased risk of severe disease and will be most affected by waning vaccine efficacy over time,"" said MOH.  A second COVID-19 booster is recommended for individuals aged 80 years and above, those living in aged care facilities, as well as medically vulnerable persons aged 18 and above who are at higher risk of severe COVID-19.  ""For persons who do not fall into these groups, for now, there is no recommendation for them to receive a second booster. They continue to be well-protected against severe disease after their first booster dose,"" said MOH.  MOH added that it will still continue to offer the second booster to all those aged 50 to 79 years. ""They can choose to take a second booster if they are concerned about their individual risk of severe COVID-19 as this is around the age where risk increases as chronic diseases start to set in."" Those who live with elderly or medically vulnerable family members, or intend to travel overseas, should consider taking up the second booster, added the ministry.  All those who are eligible for their primary series vaccination, first booster or second booster may receive their doses by walking into any of the 10 Joint Testing and Vaccination Centres (JTVCs) located islandwide. Residents may also book an appointment at the centres, participating Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) or polyclinics via their SMS invitation. From Jun 27, mobile vaccination teams will also be deployed to selected heartland locations to make it more convenient for seniors to get vaccinated and boosted.  The teams will be deployed at certain Residents’ Committee Centres at residential blocks and Community Centres. Each team will be deployed at a given site for two days before moving on to the next location, said MOH.  Alongside the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination, MOH said it will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation and the level of protection against the disease in various segments of the population. ""We will make recommendations for the second booster in younger age groups when there is a need to do so. In the meantime, such persons are strongly encouraged to receive their primary series and first booster dose if they have not yet done so,"" said MOH. The Health Ministry added that Singapore remains ""well positioned"" to be a COVID-19 resilient nation. ""We have sufficient resources and are well prepared to ride the impending rise in cases. While MOH continues to monitor the situation closely, living safely with COVID-19 is a collective effort."" Members of the public were also urged to take the necessary precautions and remain socially responsible by observing safe management measures, conducting regular self-tests, and avoiding social interactions if one has a fever or respiratory symptoms, or tests positive for COVID-19.

He had a high fever and recurrent seizures, with a subsequent drop in consciousness, said MOH. He was admitted to the children’s intensive care unit in critical condition on Jun 22 and was diagnosed with severe meningoencephalitis. It refers to a neurological condition that involves encephalitis or inflammation of the brain, and infection of the meninges or membranes that cover the brain. His polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was positive for COVID-19 as well as two other viruses – rhinovirus/enterovirus and respiratory syncytial virus.   The ministry noted that COVID-19 can result in severe disease, even in children and those without pre-existing medical conditions.  ""Vaccination substantially reduces the likelihood of severe disease when one is infected,"" said MOH. “All children aged five to 11 years are recommended to be vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine, especially children with underlying chronic medical conditions."" The ministry added that authorities will study the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines for children under the age of five. This comes after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Jun 18 recommended COVID-19 vaccines for children as young as six months old. “MOH extends our deepest condolences to the patient’s family,"" said the ministry. ""We understand that KKH is in contact with the family to provide the necessary support.” Singapore reported 5,309 COVID-19 cases on Monday amid a recent surge in infections mainly driven by the newer Omicron subvariants known as BA.4 and BA.5. The two subvariants accounted for about 45 per cent of the community COVID-19 cases in the past week, said the Health Ministry on Monday, up from about 30 per cent the week before.

The police arrested 71 men and 32 women, aged between 16 and 53, for various offences such as being members of unlawful societies, possessing offensive weapons in a public place, causing annoyance while drunk and working without a valid work permit. Twenty-seven of these women were arrested under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act for purportedly working at nightlife establishments as freelance hostesses by providing companionship and drinking with patrons without a valid work permit. The women were of Thai, Chinese and Vietnamese nationalities, said the police.  Forty-eight licensed and unlicensed public entertainment and nightlife outlets were found to have committed various breaches.  Seven of these outlets were found to have flouted COVID-19 regulations. Among the offences were failing to minimise physical interaction between patrons and staff members, as well as failing to implement a system of checks for vaccination-differentiated safe management measures. Some of these outlets also did not ensure patrons remained masked while indoors. Four closure orders and six composition fines of S$1,000 each were also issued to operators for breaching safe management measures.  During a check on Apr 24, an outlet located in a shopping centre along Outram Road was found to have permitted a group of 11 unmasked patrons to gather within its premises. As the operator had failed to ensure that the group size of unmasked patrons did not exceed the prevailing limit of 10, it was issued with a 10-day closure order and fined S$1,000.  A separate check on a shophouse along Jalan Besar on May 14 found an outlet that was furnished with five private rooms. The rooms were equipped with karaoke systems, speakers, microphones and televisions.  ""Patrons were purportedly permitted to sing karaoke in these rooms even though the operator did not possess a valid public entertainment licence,"" said the police, adding that the operator is being investigated.  The offence of providing public entertainment without a valid licence carries a fine of up to S$20,000. For non-compliance with safe distancing measures under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Reopening – Control Order) Regulations 2022, individuals and operators found guilty may be jailed for up to six months, fined up to S$10,000, or both.  ""The police and agencies will continue to carry out enforcement operations at public entertainment outlets to suppress illicit activities,"" said the police.  The police added that members of the public and businesses should remain vigilant and continue to take the prevailing safe management measures seriously. ""The police have zero tolerance for irresponsible behaviour relating to the flouting of these measures, and offenders will be dealt with firmly in accordance with the law,"" they added. All nightlife businesses, including nightclubs and discotheques, were allowed to fully reopen from Apr 19 with Singapore further easing COVID-19 restrictions on Apr 26, with group size limits removed and safe distancing no longer required.  Nightlife establishments with dancing among patrons were no longer subjected to a capacity limit from Jun 14. Patrons are also no longer required to obtain a negative antigen rapid test (ART) result to enter such venues. "

A third dose of its vaccine candidate SCB-2019 resulted in a 19-fold increase in neutralising antibody levels against the Omicron BA.2 subvariant from pre-booster levels, Clover said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange. The booster shot also elicited a 12-fold rise in the neutralising antibody level against the BA.1 subvariant, the company said, citing preliminary analysis without providing detailed readings. The results came from a cohort of participants, who had no natural infection of the coronavirus and showed waning antibodies before the booster, in a clinical trial that has enrolled 3,755 participants in Brazil, the Philippines and Columbia, Clover said. SCB-2019, which is backed by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), has yet to be approved for commercial use. Antibody-based readings differ from a vaccine's efficacy, a rate that reflects how well it could lower the risk of COVID-19 disease or death. Data from a large clinical trial conducted before the spread of Omicron showed SCB-2019 was 67 per cent effective against symptomatic COVID-19 of any degree of severity and 79 per cent against the Delta variant. Clover did not discuss cell-based responses elicited by the booster, another important part of the human immune system different from antibody-based responses. Clover is also testing a separate candidate SCB-2020S in an early-stage trial and working on a bivalent vaccine candidate targeting variants of concern including Omicron. "

The order comes a day after Pakistan's biggest city, Karachi, reported that its COVID-19 positivity ratio, or the rate of positive cases out of all tests conducted, rose to 21 per cent compared with a national rate of 2.8 per cent. ""With immediate effect, mask wearing will be mandatory onboard domestic flights,” the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) said in the statement late on Sunday (Jun 26). Pakistan has had very few COVID-19 cases over recent months and had done away with almost all precautions. But over the past 24 hours, the national COVID-19 positivity ratio had risen to 2.85 per cent with 382 positive cases and two deaths, according to data released on Monday by the National Institute of Health, Islamabad (NIH). A month ago, the positivity ratio was 0.54 per cent with 79 positive cases and no deaths. According to the NIH, 85 per cent of eligible Pakistanis have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Pakistan disbanded the National Command and Operations Center, which was overseeing the COVID-19 response, on Mar 31 as infections fell to the lowest since the outbreak began in 2020. "

Singapore began administering the Nuvaxovid vaccine to the public on May 18 and 2,792 doses have been administered as of May 31, said HSA in a safety update. This is the 12th such update, covering the period since the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines on Dec 30, 2020 to May 31, 2022. An adverse event is classified as serious when the event results in, among others, hospitalisation, a life-threatening illness or death. HSA said it has so far not received any reports of myocarditis, an inflammatory condition of the heart, though ongoing global clinical trials of Nuvaxovid have reported a ""small number"" of cases.  While the risk of myocarditis cannot be excluded, the benefits of the Nuvaxovid vaccine continue to outweigh the risks in the Singapore context, said the authority.  HSA granted the Nuvaxovid vaccine interim authorisation in February as part of the national vaccination programme. It is available to those who have not taken their primary doses or booster shots. In this latest report, HSA also provided updates on mRNA vaccines. Twenty-one cases of appendicitis following the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine have been reported in Singapore, HSA said.  This is after more than 11 million doses of the vaccine have been administered here.  Appendicitis can be caused by various factors such as infections in the digestive tract or blockage of the opening of the appendix, causing it to become sore and swollen.  HSA said rare cases of appendicitis following COVID-19 vaccination have been reported globally.  In Singapore, HSA found ""a small increased incidence"" of appendicitis occurring within 21 days after the primary vaccination series - and mainly in those aged 12 to 17.  ""No increased incidence of appendicitis has been observed with the booster dose of the vaccine,"" HSA said.  It added that all 21 cases were hospitalised, but have since been discharged.  HSA said it had nothing new to report in terms of adverse events of interest - anaphylaxis, myocarditis, pericarditis and cerebral venous thrombosis - following the use of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Incidence rates have stabilised, HSA said. The rates of adverse events and serious adverse events for the Sinovac-CoronaVac and Sinopharm vaccines have also remained stable, with no new safety updates at this time, HSA said.  "

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-safe-management-measures-lawrence-wong-2772426,"No need to tighten Singapore's COVID-19 measures for now, adjustments will be made 'if need be': Lawrence Wong","SINGAPORE: There is no need to tighten Singapore’s COVID-19 safe management measures at this stage, but adjustments will be made ""if need be"", said Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on Monday (Jun 27).  The recent surge in cases has been mainly driven by the newer Omicron subvariants known as BA.4 and BA.5, he said. While they are more transmissible, the severity of infections linked to these subvariants appears to be similar to that of earlier strains of Omicron.  “We must expect cases to continue rising in the coming weeks. Fortunately, there is no evidence of increased severity with this subvariant and the overall hospitalisation situation remains stable,” said Mr Wong, who is also co-chair of the multi-ministry taskforce on COVID-19.  “So, for now, our assessment is that we will be able to ride through this wave based on our current posture. In other words, we do not need to tighten our safe management measures at this stage,” he said, adding that the country will monitor the situation closely, including the infection trajectory over the coming weeks, disease severity and the hospital situation. If needed, the Government will have to make adjustments, he added.  Mr Wong said the hospital situation currently remains stable. ""We think it will be so with this wave but we will monitor closely and provide further updates as and when necessary."" He added that there will be another round of ART kit distribution sometime next month, with every household to receive 10 kits. “It’s always a highly fluid and dynamic situation and we will have to be prepared for any contingencies,” said Mr Wong. “What's important, of course, is that all of us must continue to do our part to ride through this wave safely. Vaccinations and boosters remain very effective and they offer good protection against these Omicron subvariants,” he said. “In fact, for most people, you will need to do at least three shots of the vaccine.” To date, 70,000 seniors have yet to receive their third vaccine shot.  On Monday, three mobile vaccination teams were deployed to locations in the heartlands - Ansar, Telok Blangah and Nee Soon - for seniors to walk in and get their shots.  To encourage more to get vaccinated, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said this will be expanded to 25 mobile vaccination teams in the next two to three weeks to make it more convenient for seniors to get their COVID-19 vaccination or booster shots. These teams will stay in one location for two to three days, before moving to another spot, eventually covering up to 50 sites. Seniors aged 60 and above will be given priority to walk in and get their shots with the mobile vaccination teams.  As for those aged 59 and below, their vaccination slots will be allocated on a first-come-first-served basis, subject to venue space and vaccine availability. The deployment of mobile vaccination teams to the heartlands was first announced in July last year, as part of efforts to intensify outreach to seniors and encourage them to get vaccinated. At the time, less than half of the total population had completed both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to the MOH’s COVID-19 situation report dated Jul 15 last year. While around 80 per cent of those aged between 60 and 69 had completed their vaccination, the percentage for those aged 70 and above was lower, with figures hovering around 65 per cent.  Last week, five new Joint Testing and Vaccination Centres (JTVCs) began vaccination and COVID-19 testing operations, bringing the total number of such centres across the island to 10. Located in Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Merah, Sengkang, Woodlands and Yishun, the five new JTVCs offer the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty and Moderna/Spikevax vaccines. Those aged 12 and above may walk into any of the centres to receive their vaccination and booster. When asked if the rest of the population would require a fourth jab, Mr Wong said there will come a time when that becomes necessary. “There will be a need eventually but as of now, we are not recommending the fourth jab for everyone. We are focusing on the seniors first, 80 and above,” he said. For those aged between 50 and 80, the fourth jab will be offered though it is not recommended yet, he added.  “But even before we talk about offering a fourth jab to everyone or recommending it for everyone, let us get the people who have not even gotten their third jabs first because we want the vast majority of Singaporeans, those who are eligible, to get at least three jabs.” "

Authorities in Macao have locked down multiple buildings and put more than 5,000 people in quarantine in the past few days, the city's government said. Health authorities said 38 new COVID-19 cases were recorded on Sunday, taking the total number of infections to 299 in the latest outbreak. Two rounds of COVID-19 tests were conducted in Macao in the past week. The latest round is expected to end on Tuesday. Authorities have asked people to remain at home as much as possible with most of the city effectively closed, including bars, hair salons and outdoor parks. Only takeaway is allowed from dining facilities. Casinos, while mostly deserted, are allowed to stay open, the city's government said, in a move to protect local jobs. The stringent measures come after the Chinese special administrative region has been largely COVID-free since an outbreak in October 2021. It has not previously had to deal with the highly transmissible Omicron variant. Macao adheres to China's ""zero-COVID"" policy which aims to eradicate all outbreaks, at just about any cost, running counter to a global trend of trying to co-exist with the virus. Macao's cases are still far below daily infections in other places, including neighbouring Hong Kong where cases have jumped to close to 2,000 a day this month. Hong Kong's outbreak this year saw more than 1 million confirmed infections, and more than 9,000 deaths, swamping hospitals and public services. Officials there are looking to ease some restrictions. Macao only has one public hospital with its services already stretched on a daily basis. The territory's swift plan to test its population comes as it keeps open the border with mainland China, with many residents living and working in the adjoining city of Zhuhai. "

Kindergartens will be allowed to reopen from Jul 4, the commission added. Beijing shut its schools in early May and asked students to move to online learning amid a spike in locally transmitted COVID-19 cases. Senior year students at middle and high schools were allowed to return to classrooms from Jun 2. The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Sports said separately that sports activities for the young can resume at non-school locations on Jun 27 in areas where no community cases have been reported for seven consecutive days, with the exception of basement venues, which will remain shut. Participation should be limited to 75 per cent of normal capacity and participants should show a negative COVID-19 test taken within the last 72 hours, it also said. Beijing was among several cities in China that implemented curbs to stop the spread of the Omicron wave from March to May. The efforts have brought cases down but have taken a heavy toll on the country's economy. Shanghai, which endured a two-month lockdown that was lifted on Jun 1, on Saturday reported no new local cases - both symptomatic and asymptomatic - for the first time since Feb 23. Shanghai is continuing to conduct mass PCR testing for its 25 million residents every weekend until the end of July and dining indoors remains banned in most of the city. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/covid-19-next-booster-shots-likely-updated-omicron-2768886,Analysis: The next COVID-19 booster shots will likely be updated for Omicron,"NEW YORK: COVID-19 vaccines this fall are likely to be based on the Omicron variant of the coronavirus rather than the original strain, although some experts suggest they may only offer significant benefits for older and immunocompromised people. Moderna, Pfizer and Novavax have been testing vaccines based on the first BA.1 Omicron variant that became dominant last winter, driving a massive surge in infections. On Wednesday (Jun 22), Moderna said its updated vaccine worked well against more recent Omicron subvariants, and that it was moving forward with plans to ask regulators for approval. Vaccines that can bridge the gap between the original version of coronavirus and the Omicron variant would likely be ""far, far better"" for the fall, according to Trevor Bedford, a biologist at the University of Washington who has closely tracked mutations of the SARS-coV-2 virus. Bedford said it would take too long to meet regulatory requirements for a switch to tailor the next vaccine to versions of Omicron spreading quickly now. ""Catching up to any of the Omicrons is really important,"" he said, noting the enormous jump in the number of mutations from the original strain that emerged in China to Omicron on the spike protein part of the virus the vaccines target. The World Health Organization (WHO) plans to assess the effectiveness of vaccines built for Omicron, as do national health regulators like the US Food and Drug Administration. A group of WHO advisers said last week an Omicron-based vaccine may broaden immunity after the Omicron variant evaded much of the protection against infection generated by the vaccines designed for the original virus, a view other experts share. FDA scientific advisers will meet on Jun 28 to make a recommendation on the issue. Important questions remain, including whether vaccines designed for variants circulating last winter will work well against significantly different subvariants that may emerge. Experts also want to know if the new shots will increase protection against severe disease and death for younger, healthier people or merely offer a few months additional safeguard against mild infection. Scientists who have questioned the value of booster shots for young and healthy people say a broad campaign is not needed with an updated shot either. Unlike annual adjustments for influenza vaccines that manufacturers are allowed to try to align with circulating strains, regulators have asked companies to run clinical trials to prove their new COVID-19 vaccines work better. But nearly three years into the pandemic, vaccine makers are pushing for a flu-like model that would allow them to nimbly retool their shots to combat new variants. At stake are billions of dollars in contracts with countries around the world. Moderna is already manufacturing the shots, with deals signed in some countries. Moderna is asking regulators to greenlight a version of their COVID-19 shot targeting both the BA.1 Omicron variant and the original version of the virus, armed with fresh evidence it may be effective against more recently circulating subvariants. ""The challenge we have is the virus continues to evolve really quickly,” Moderna President Stephen Hoge said in an interview, noting that millions of doses of the updated vaccine could be ready in August. If the drugmaker needs to tweak the vaccine further and restart manufacturing, new shots may not be available until the middle of the fourth quarter, he said. Pfizer and partner BioNTech are testing variant-adapted COVID-19 vaccines but have yet to release any data. Novavax, whose vaccine is not yet authorised for US use, launched a trial of its own Omicron-based vaccines in late May. Dr Jesse Goodman, a professor at Georgetown School of Medicine and a former top FDA scientist, said unlike for flu, regulators do not have enough experience with COVID-19 vaccines to match them to circulating strains without clinical trials. Dr Luciana Borio, former acting chief scientist of the FDA, said the science generally supports the idea that it would be better to have vaccines that more closely match the currently circulating virus. ""We see that with people that have hybrid immunity from vaccination plus infection,"" Borio said. ""The immune response that is generated is very rich."" Still, Borio and others are not convinced everyone should be vaccinated again. ""There's no evidence that a healthy 27-year-old person needs to be revaccinated,"" Borio said. "

The so-called bivalent vaccine targets the Beta variant - first identified in South Africa - as well as the original Wuhan strain of the virus. In a trial involving 13,000 adults, the vaccine demonstrated an efficacy rate of 64.7 per cent against symptomatic COVID-19, and 72 per cent efficacy against infections specifically caused by the Omicron variant. When used in people who previously had COVID-19, the results were stronger. The vaccine generated an efficacy rate of 75.1 per cent against symptomatic COVID-19 and 93.2 per cent in Omicron-confirmed symptomatic cases, the companies said. ""Sanofi-GSK’s vaccine is the first candidate to demonstrate efficacy in a placebo-controlled trial in an environment of high Omicron variant circulation,"" Sanofi said in a statement. Sanofi's Paris-listed shares and GSK's London-listed shares were both up more than 1 per cent in morning trading. Earlier this month, the bivalent vaccine showed potential in two trials to protect against the virus' main variants of concern - the Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 strains - when used as a booster shot. Sanofi and GSK, two of the world's biggest vaccine makers, are hoping to gain a foothold in the market for next-generation variant-focused COVID shots, after falling behind competitors including Moderna, AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech, in the original race to contain the pandemic. The new data supporting the bivalent vaccine will be submitted to regulatory authorities with the hope of making the shot available later this year, the companies said on Friday. Sanofi and GSK's original COVID-19 vaccine is already under review by the European Medicines Agency. The companies have bet that this bivalent vaccine moulded on the now-supplanted Beta variant will confer broad protection against future viral strains on the basis that Beta expresses similar mutations across multiple variants of concern, including Omicron.

Although it was open earlier this month, the three-storey building in downtown Shanghai was on Friday (Jun 24) boarded up with its H&M signage gone. The world's second-biggest fast-fashion retailer entered China in 2007 with the opening of the Shanghai flagship store and rapidly expanded. It had more than 500 stores in mainland China early last year but its website currently only lists 376, including the flagship Shanghai store. The company declined to comment, citing a blackout period prior to its first-half earnings report on Jun 29. Although nearly a month has passed since Shanghai lifted a strict two-month lockdown, consumers have yet to return to malls in significant numbers. Chinese consumers have also beat a retreat from its products after a letter in which H&M expressed concerns about allegations of forced labour in the Xinjiang region came to light in 2021. Other brands that publicly disavowed Xinjiang cotton such as Inditex's Zara, Nike and Adidas have also suffered with Chinese netizens calling for boycotts and Chinese celebrities refusing to work with them. But the backlash against H&M, the first foreign retailer to express concerns, has been particularly harsh. Unlike other brands, its products remain unavailable on major Chinese e-commerce sites such as Tmall and JD.com. UN experts and rights groups estimate over a million people, mainly Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities, have been detained in recent years in a vast system of camps in China’s western Xinjiang region. Many former inmates have said they were subject to ideological training and abuse in the camps. China denies all accusations of abuse."

""The wearing of hygienic or cloth masks shall be voluntary,"" read the announcement, which was published in the Royal Gazette on Thursday (Jun 23).  The lifting of the mask requirement applies to both indoor and outdoor spaces, an official source at the Public Health Ministry told CNA. However, the ministry still advised people to wear masks at crowded places or areas, where social distancing is not possible or the ventilation is not good, according to the announcement in the Royal Gazette. For those who are at high risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms or death such as people aged 60 and above, pregnant women, and persons with cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases or chronic kidney disease, they are still advised to keep wearing masks properly whenever there are other people around. The same advice applies to COVID-19-infected individuals and high-risk contacts as well as people with respiratory diseases. According to the announcement, the public is encouraged to consider the benefits of proper mask wearing when it comes to preventing the transmission of diseases, including COVID-19 and other respiratory tract infections, and reducing other health risks.  Besides easing the mask requirement, the announcement added that entertainment venues, pubs, bars and eateries selling alcohol are allowed to operate with adherence to the law and disease prevention measures.  Before this, the businesses could only operate and serve alcohol until midnight. The announcement on Thursday also stated that the COVID-19 situation in Thailand has improved and that the numbers of infections and related deaths have declined. As a result, various restrictions and measures have been relaxed to allow the public to live and carry out social and economic activities in a manner that is close to normal, it added.  On Friday, the Department of Disease Control reported 2,313 new COVID-19 infections and 16 deaths.

The former Portuguese colony reported 39 new infections on Friday (Jun 24), bringing the total for its current outbreak to 149, with around a dozen buildings locked down and residents banned from leaving, the local government said in a statement. More than 5,000 people are in mandatory quarantine, the government said. Macao, a Chinese special administrative region, is testing its more than 600,000 residents for the coronavirus for a second time this week. Testing is due to finish on Friday. A makeshift hospital, located next to Macao's Las Vegas modelled Cotai Strip, is also expected to open on Friday. Macao shut down most of its city, including bars, cinemas, hair salons and outdoor parks on Thursday. Only takeaway is allowed from dining facilities. The stringent measures come after Macao has been largely COVID-free since an outbreak in October 2021. It has not previously had to deal with the highly-transmissible Omicron variant. Macao adheres to China's ""zero COVID"" policy which aims to eradicate all outbreaks, at just about any cost, running counter to a global trend of trying to co-exist with the virus. Casino revenues are likely to be close to zero in the coming weeks, analysts said. Only one of the territory's more than 30 casinos has been closed as an anti-COVID measure, but the others have few customers, residents said. Macao's cases are still far below daily infections in other places, including neighbouring Hong Kong where cases have jumped to over 1,000 a day this month. Hong Kong's outbreak this year saw more than 1 million confirmed infections, and more than 9,000 deaths, swamping hospitals and public services. Officials there are looking to ease some restrictions. Macao only has one public hospital with its services already stretched on a daily basis. The territory's swift plan to test its entire population comes as it keeps open the border with mainland China, with many residents living and working in the adjoining city of Zhuhai. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/shanghai-fashion-stores-struggle-clear-lockdown-stock-2767581,Shanghai's fashion stores struggle to clear lockdown stock hangover,"SHANGHAI: Almost a month since Shanghai lifted its strict COVID-19 lockdowns, fashion retailers are stuck with piles of unsold stock as cautious consumers stay away from the commercial hub's glitzy shopping districts. Curbs to stop the virus in Shanghai, China's fashion capital, ground the city of 25 million to a halt in April and May, leaving clothing and beauty product displays in stores untouched and containers of imported apparel stranded at port. The city's re-opening this month saw a flood of goods ship from warehouses to store shelves already laden with merchandise unsold during two months of lockdown. Normally around a fifth of all imported goods coming into China pass through Shanghai's port. Days after COVID-19 curbs eased, large ""sales"" signs went up across Shanghai, with retailers from Lululemon to Victoria's Secret offering discounts to lure shoppers. Even online retailers have struggled to clear a glut caused by lockdowns and supply interruptions. ""This affected us a lot,"" said Josh Gardner, founder and chief executive of China market e-commerce partner Kung Fu Data, which manages online stores for 10 fashion brands, including G-Star Raw. ""In April, May on (China's major e-commerce) platforms, there wasn't a t-shirt to be found, we were sold out of summer stock and so was everyone else, there was just no product,"" he said. ""Now, everyone's just bleeding and stuck with a lot of inventory they can't move."" China is a major market for personal luxury goods companies with sales reaching US$74.4 billion in 2021, according to Bain. One consultancy estimated that sales during ""618"" – a major shopping event in China from May 31 to June 20 - across the main e-commerce sites, such as Tmall and JD.com, were flat year-on-year. In the event's opening week, data from Tmall showed men's wear sales had dropped 22 per cent and women's wear was down 4 per cent, although activewear sales rose 26 per cent, possibly due to an increased focus on fitness during the lockdown. For now, some retailers are warehousing inventory and ordering less for the fourth quarter when they will try to clear existing stock through November's Singles' Day. ""For the apparel category, due to the epidemic and sluggish consumption, there is a high level of inventory backlog of spring collections,"" JD.com chief executive Lei Xu said following the online retailer's first-quarter earnings. ""As a result, many factories are considering skipping their ... summer collections."" Flash sales specialists OnTheList, which sells luxury products for brands including Versace, Jimmy Choo and Lanvin at discounts of 70 per cent or more, re-opened its physical Shanghai showroom last weekend with a sale from Salvatore Ferragamo. The high-end Italian fashion brand and almost all other retailers in Shanghai closed stores closed throughout April and May. Salvatore Ferragamo declined to comment. Jean Liang, OnTheList's China managing director, said luxury brands are now more open to online sales, as well as offline sales, while cosmetics brands are pro-actively looking to hold sales to clear excess inventory. ""Before it was always us pitching asking them about their plans and now they approach us, which means they have inventory they need to clean out to have a healthy stock situation,"" she said. OnTheList's calendar of flash sales, which run every few days, is already booked through to September. Sending products abroad to be distributed in Europe or America is another solution but is currently complicated by surging shipping and air transport costs, said Benny Wong, supply chain director at online wholesale marketplace, Peeba. ""Now the main hurdle is transportation ... that creates a big problem for the inventory owner,"" he said. ""Inventory can kill (and) some product categories have huge inventory to move."" Weeks after re-opening, retail sentiment is downbeat with Shanghai's consumers yet to return to malls in significant numbers and footfall around half its usual levels in major downtown malls, according to retail staff. People in Shanghai are reluctant to return to indoor public areas largely out of fear of being locked down again, as China's dogged zero-COVID policies demand each time new infections emerge. A continued ban on in-restaurant dining also means malls remain without their usual food and beverage attractions. Across China, retail sales slipped 6.7 per cent in May from a year earlier, extending the previous month's 11.1 per cent decline, as a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy discouraged consumer spending. ""In terms of inventory clearance, there's not really a good solution in China,"" Kung Fu Data's Gardner said. ""I mean, what are you going to do that's not going to destroy your brand?"" "

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/china-zero-covid-lockdowns-vaccination-mass-testing-xi-jinping-ccp-crisis-mentality-2763186,Commentary: Why China is more willing to test millions than trust vaccination,"SINGAPORE: Shanghai emerged from a gruelling two-month lockdown on Jun 1, to the relief of its residents. But worries about further “closed management” movement restrictions persist as all districts are required to conduct mass COVID-19 testing every weekend until the end of July. The spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant has inflicted enormous socioeconomic losses upon China since the beginning of this year, with lockdowns in large cities like Shanghai, Changchun and Jilin shutting factories and production lines.  The Chinese government is now trying to strike a balance between maintaining economic growth and containing COVID-19, as the next chapter in the country’s zero-COVID policy. And officials are doubling down on mass testing and quarantine measures. Already, a negative test result in the past 72 hours is needed to enter shopping malls and offices or take public transport in Shanghai and Beijing. Macao has also started mass testing after 12 locally transmitted COVID-19 cases were discovered, and it closed schools, parks and museums. The rest of the world has gradually reopened to live with the virus, drawing courage from increasing vaccination rates.  With about 88 per cent of the total population fully vaccinated, why is China still more willing to test and lockdown millions of people instead? Crisis mentality has captured policymakers who would rather normalise testing than trust protection from vaccines. The focus seems to be on the worst-case scenario and the preparations and precautions that must be made to avert it – regardless of time, financial resources or emotional distress. Though China’s vaccination rate is high when compared globally, the government worries that in a population of 1.4 billion, the smallest fatality rate can still lead to a large number of deaths. Over 1.5 million COVID-19 deaths could occur if the zero-COVID policy is dropped without additional safeguards, according to one study. Only about half of people aged 80 and older had received their primary vaccinations by March. This has likely gone up a little after China introduced insurance against vaccine-related side effects for those aged 60 and above.  Could China allocate resources for testing to getting more people vaccinated instead? Besides the fact that there will always be people who cannot get vaccinated on medical grounds, China has preferred to keep vaccination voluntary and even urged local authorities to stop mandatory vaccinations in April 2021.  The marginal costs of pushing all citizens to receive vaccines, especially booster doses, can be extremely high given the population size and vast territory.  This is a concern when China has already become an ageing society, with 18.7 per cent of the population aged 60 and above and a population growing more slowly than before. Urban-rural and regional disparities can make the elderly more vulnerable in some regions, where medical services and capacity are not sufficient to handle the outbreak of a pandemic.  Even with the protection from the vaccines, the elderly are at higher risk of severe illness, complications and death if infected. Since none of the current vaccines can provide complete immunity against infection, the Chinese government appears to have decided that the safest choice is the normalisation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. This includes mass testing, enhanced surveillance and quarantine measures. Fearing that the numbers of deaths and infections may still surge despite vaccination, local governments are busy building more testing booths and makeshift hospitals, trying to turn many of them into permanent sites. But even though Chinese homegrown inactivated virus vaccines have been shown to confer less protection than the mRNA vaccines, the Chinese government does not deem it the main reason for adhering to the zero-COVID policy.  Former health minister Gao Qiang, aligning with Beijing’s official view, has called countries living with the virus “reckless”, suggesting that even if mRNA vaccines were used, China would not change its approach. The thinking seems to be that no vaccine can provide 100 per cent protection against COVID-19.  Both Sinovac and Sinopharm have put new vaccines with the Omicron variant in clinical trials, and China’s Walvax vaccine candidate, which uses mRNA technology, is said to be showing promise. So even if China succeeds in developing its own mRNA vaccines now, it is unlikely to give up its zero-COVID policy overnight given the size of its population and insufficient medical resources.  But progress in this area may help China at least gradually loosen travel restrictions and reduce testing. In both conventional Chinese wisdom and the Communist Party of China’s discourse, crisis mentality is valued as a virtue. But preparing for crisis comes with huge costs, so it was reeled in at the beginning of the Chinese economic reform, launched in the late 1970s, for the sake of efficiency and economic growth. This has slowly shifted in recent times. Chinese President Xi Jinping had rallied cadres to meet great “struggles” in a speech at the Central Party School in September 2019. Officials were told to be prepared for all kinds of crises and challenges as there were no quick solutions to many of the problems.  Xi has said, even before the COVID-19 pandemic started, that China must be on guard against “black swan” risks and “grey rhino” events. Some analysts considered the debt crisis of China’s biggest property developer Evergrande in 2021 as a grey rhino event – an obvious but neglected threat. Whether COVID-19 is a black swan event – unforeseen and with serious consequences – or not, the global public health crisis that first broke out in the Chinese city of Wuhan, was a wake-up call that re-ignited crisis mentality among the CPC cadres at all levels.  No official wants to be blamed for failing to contain the outbreak due to their wariness or complacency. Xi recently told party cadres to “overcome paralysing thoughts” and “resolutely consolidate the hard-won results of epidemic prevention and control”.  Of course, there is fear that lockdowns throttle economic activity and cause social grievances. But the government is still prioritising pandemic control over economic growth right now, given the risk of a next wave of virus variants or subvariants.  The rationale is simple: Quick containment of outbreaks will halt the spread and avoid long lockdowns, and only when the virus is under control can economic recovery be sustained. China officials increasingly have to consider the potential risks that are both domestic and international, conventional (such as financial crises and military conflicts) and non-conventional (such as epidemics and climate change).  Officials these days can lose their positions due to poor crisis management rather than an underperforming economy. Wuhan officials were removed after the mishandling of the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 and Henan officials were sacked after a deadly flood in 2021.  Given Nomura's estimate that China’s mass testing programmes could cost 1.8 per cent of gross domestic product, the government is likely betting on the deferred revenue after a complete victory against the pandemic. “Persistence is victory,” Xi said recently.  Ultimately, even if the global situation convinces China to ease restrictions by the end of the year, the momentum of this crisis mentality will likely push many local governments to normalise testing and quarantine measures in the foreseeable future.   Dr Chen Gang is a senior research fellow and assistant director of the East Asian Institute, National University of Singapore."
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/moderna-updated-covid-19-booster-candidate-omicron-subvariants-strong-response-2763361,Moderna booster candidate shows strong response against Omicron subvariants,"Moderna said on Wednesday (Jun 22) that an updated version of its COVID-19 vaccine designed to target the Omicron variant also generated a strong immune response against the fast-spreading Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5, which have gained a foothold in the US in recent weeks. The updated vaccine, which Moderna is hoping will be approved for use as a booster shot for the fall, is a bivalent vaccine, meaning it contains vaccine designed to target two different coronavirus variants - the original variant from 2020 and the Omicron variant that was circulating widely last winter. Moderna said that while the shot elicited a weaker response versus BA.4 and BA.5 than it does against the BA.1 subvariant it was specifically designed to combat, the data suggests the new shot could produce ""lasting protection against the whole family of Omicron variants"". ""This is a strong, powerful antibody response,"" Moderna Chief Medical Officer Paul Burton said at a news conference. ""It is probably long lasting and I think the conclusions are that boosting or primary vaccination with (the updated vaccine) really could be a turning point in our fight against SARS-cov-2 virus."" Moderna has been producing the updated vaccine on its own dime ahead of any regulatory approvals, and Chief Executive Stéphane Bancel said the company could begin supplying the shot in August. The company plans to submit applications to regulators in the coming weeks to ask for approval of the shot - which it calls mRNA-1273.214 - for the fall season. The two sublineages, which were added to the World Health Organization's monitoring list in March and designated as variants of concern by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, accounted for more than a third of US cases last week. The US Food and Drug Administration plans to hold a meeting of outside experts next week to discuss the best composition of booster shots for the fall. Pfizer and BioNTech are also testing several possible variant-adapted COVID-19 vaccines, including a bivalent candidate similar to Moderna's. The European Medicines Agency last week launched a rolling review of their candidates, although the companies have yet to release any data on how well they work. BioNTech this month said market clearance could come as early as August but could also take until September or later in the fall. "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/covid-19-vaccine-scheme-pushes-delivery-slowdown-2762761,COVID-19 vaccine scheme for world's poorest pushes for delivery slowdown,"LONDON: Leaders of the global scheme aiming to get COVID-19 vaccines to the world's poorest are pushing manufacturers including Pfizer and Moderna to cut or slow deliveries of about half a billion shots so doses are not wasted. COVAX, the World Health Organization-led scheme, wants between 400 and 600 million fewer vaccines doses than initially contracted from six pharmaceutical companies, according to internal documents seen by Reuters. While at first the initiative struggled for shots as wealthy nations snapped up limited supply, donations from those same countries later in 2021, as well as improved output from manufacturers - alongside delivery challenges and vaccine hesitancy in a number of countries – has led to a glut of vaccine in 2022. ""COVAX has called for manufacturers to acknowledge the global oversupply situation, and support collective efforts to meet the timing of countries' needs and avoid unnecessary wastage,"" said a spokesperson for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which runs the initiative alongside WHO. Gavi wants manufacturers to either reduce the size of the initial orders or at least ""re-phase"" them, meaning they are delivered at a later date that is more aligned with when countries need them. Future negotiations might also include getting the variant-specific vaccines currently being tested by manufacturers including Moderna and Pfizer. While Gavi is close to an agreement with some manufacturers, contract negotiations with other companies are not as advanced, according to sources close to the talks. No deals have yet been agreed. The biggest orders are with Moderna and Pfizer, alongside the Serum Institute of India, Novavax, Johnson & Johnson and Clover Biopharmaceuticals . ""Being cognisant of local needs, we are seeking to provide pragmatic solutions to requests whenever possible,"" Pfizer said in an emailed statement, while Novavax said the status of its COVAX deliveries was currently ""unclear"". Moderna said it had nothing to add at this time. COVAX follows in the steps of other vaccine buyers in trying to cut deliveries agreed at the height of the pandemic, including European Union governments. Pfizer and Moderna have agreed to delay some shipments. In total, COVAX has delivered more than 1.5 billion doses in the last 18 months. However, its initial aims of contributing towards the goal of vaccinating 70 per cent of the population of every country in the world by this month have now effectively taken a back seat to protecting 100 per cent of the most vulnerable – namely, health workers and the elderly. While 66.3 per cent of the world's population has now had at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, the proportion falls to 17.8 per cent in low-income countries, according to Our World In Data. ""What is critical for the global pandemic response now is not a high volume of doses, but tailored supply and support to lower-income countries,"" said Gavi. Documents ahead of the organisation's board meeting this week, reviewed by Reuters, also show COVAX is considering extending its work to ""leverage dose donations"" from high-income countries to provide COVID-19 vaccines for children, as well as adults, in some of the countries the scheme supports.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/covid-vaccine-booster-side-effects-fever-fatigue-antivax-2760351,Commentary: Anticipating COVID-19 vaccine side effects makes it likely you’ll experience one,"DUNEDIN, New Zealand: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted several interesting features of modern medical practice – most recently the “nocebo” response, which may account for a significant number of side effects people experience following vaccination. Nocebo responses (from the Latin “noci”, which means to harm) are the opposite of the better-known placebo. While the latter describes improvements in symptoms following inert medication, the nocebo response heightens symptoms if a person anticipates them. It can increase pain if someone expects something will hurt. A fascinating meta-analysis examined data from 12 clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines, involving over 45,000 participants, and found that about two-thirds of common side effects people experience after vaccination could be due to a nocebo response, rather than the vaccine itself. Nocebo responses can be troublesome and significant. They include headaches, fatigue, muscle pains, nausea or diarrhoea. Such symptoms may be related to anxiety or negative expectations, or day-to-day sensations being incorrectly attributed to treatment. While previous analyses in other fields had already confirmed the presence of nocebo responses in randomised trials, COVID-19 vaccine research dramatically highlights its frequency. The latest study found up to 35 per cent of patients in the placebo arm of vaccine trials had adverse events, such as headaches and fatigue. Mathematical analysis showed that 50 to 75 per cent of patient symptoms after the real vaccination (not placebo) may have been caused by those nocebo responses. A different group of researchers from Italy reviewed other COVID-19 vaccine trials and confirmed these conclusions. These findings are potentially significant, as vaccine hesitancy and refusal have been linked to patient concerns about side effects or major adverse events.  Knowing how frequently self-limiting nocebo responses happen may reduce vaccine hesitancy. Together, the placebo and nocebo effects are better understood as two aspects of what medical practitioners call a “meaning response”. Both occur in relation to the importance and meaning patients place on their illness, their relationship with their healthcare providers, and their thoughts and beliefs about proposed treatments. Nocebo responses are now being recognised as potentially important contributors to patient outcomes. For example, if a doctor or nurse gives pessimistic or negative information about pain, various studies have demonstrated that the patient’s pain can worsen, regardless of the degree of tissue damage. Not feeling validated or respected by the doctor may also inhibit the efficacy of medications and increase side effects. Previous research in New Zealand has also illustrated how negative media coverage may increase patients’ experiences of adverse events after compulsory changes to their medication regimes. For example, brand switches of thyroxine in 2007 and of an antidepressant in 2018 were followed by increased reporting of side effects and adverse events. Acknowledging and publicising the potential contribution of nocebo responses may be useful for further generic substitutions. Vaccinators need to avoid inadvertently contributing to nocebo responses when advising their patients. They could use positive framing about the very low risk of serious adverse events. They could also briefly explain that nocebo responses are common and self-limiting. However, my own experience as a patient receiving three COVID-19 vaccinations was disconcerting. No one in the various vaccinating teams said anything positive about the vaccine or its efficacy in preventing me or my family from catching the virus, or reducing the severity of the illness if we did. And just after receiving the third injection, I was further disquieted by warnings about chest pain and reminders that I should seek immediate medical attention if I experienced any. This extra information on heart problems as a potential adverse event followed recent concerns about rare cases of myocarditis after vaccination. All the vaccinating staff were conscientious and kind, but it seemed odd they hadn’t been instructed to discuss the benefits of vaccination. It might have been a useful approach to country-wide vaccine hesitancy. While well-intended, it is possible that their emphasis on serious side effects from the vaccine may increase the incidence of nocebo responses in a population already primed for them. This could mean more patients will present to their doctors or emergency departments with symptoms unrelated to the vaccine itself. Anecdotally, advice from vaccinators appears to be quite variable. It may be helpful if they incorporated an understanding of potential placebo and nocebo responses into their vaccination advice to each patient. Health authorities and health professionals need to understand meaning responses and their role in clinical practice. Incorporating those insights into healthcare communication may prevent unnecessary patient anxiety, worrisome symptoms and considerable healthcare expenditure. Respecting autonomy means patients need to be asked if they want to receive information about side effects or adverse events. The juggle is how to inform patients about the very low risk of serious harm while not increasing their apprehension. Pandemic research is now also exploring potential parallels between long-COVID and other chronic conditions, such as Myalgic Encephalitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, as well as tentative associations between adverse childhood experiences and vaccine hesitancy. Without intending to minimise the pandemic’s devastating impact, it is providing us with useful insights into wider current medical and sociological issues.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/us-covid-19-vaccines-start-roll-out-young-children-2760861,US COVID-19 vaccines start to roll out for young children,"The United States has begun distributing COVID-19 vaccines for children as young as six months around the country, and availability of the shots will improve in the coming days, according to White House COVID-19 response coordinator Dr Ashish Jha. US regulators authorised Moderna's two-dose vaccine for children aged six months to five years and the Pfizer-BioNTech three-shot regimen for children aged six months to four years late last week. It is unclear how many parents will vaccinate their youngest children. Just one-in-five parents with children under age five said they intended to vaccinate them ""right away"" after they become eligible, a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation published in May showed. Only about 29 per cent of children aged five to 11 have been fully vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine since it was authorised in October, according to US data. Chinmay Hegde, father of a 14-month old daughter, told Reuters outside Children's National Hospital in Washington that the US authorisation was a huge relief. His daughter was the first to be vaccinated at the hospital on Tuesday. ""I feel like we can just now go travel and do our trips without feeling as much stress,"" he said, mentioning a planned family reunion in Canada in July. Children who begin their vaccinations with the Pfizer shot this week could receive their third dose the week of Sep 12 or later. Those who receive a first Moderna shot this week could complete their inoculation as soon as Jul 19. Dr Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist and editor-at-large for Public Health at Kaiser Health News, said parents will need to consider a trade-off between the number of shots and risk of side-effects. Moderna's vaccine uses a larger dose and has a higher likelihood of inducing fever than Pfizer's. ""These are not dangerous side effects and they are manageable with medications like acetaminophen,"" said Gounder, a former member of President Joe Biden's COVID transition team. But some parents may feel like ""'well, even if it's a three-dose vaccine, it will minimise the risk of fever'"", she said. Jha said on Twitter on Monday that the rollout for younger children differed from those for other age groups in that there were no mass vaccination sites, but there would be more inoculations done in doctors' offices. ""Parents are clear they want to vaccinate their littlest ones in familiar settings - doctors offices, pharmacies, health clinics, and children's hospitals,"" he tweeted. The vaccines began shipping on Friday and Saturday, Jha said, adding that more doctors' offices and hospitals would begin receiving them on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week. Not all pharmacies will offer the shots to everyone in this age group.

It added that the vaccination centre at Raffles City Convention Centre will be closed on Jul 18, as Singapore “step(s) up more JTVCs and consolidate our resources and free up this space for other uses”. The centre will accept bookings made via the national appointment system and walk-ins for vaccination until Jul 18. The other five existing JTVCs are located in Bishan, Commonwealth, Jurong East, Kaki Bukit, and Pasir Ris. The centre in Bishan, located at the former Bishan Park Secondary School, also offers Novavax’s Nuvaxovid COVID-19 vaccine.  Novavax’s Nuvaxovid COVID-19 vaccine was given interim authorisation in February for use in Singapore as part of the national vaccination programme. It is the fourth vaccine available under the Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR), after the ones by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Sinovac. It will be available to individuals who have not taken their primary doses or booster shots.  Those who are medically ineligible to receive the mRNA vaccines should consider the Nuvaxovid vaccine, said MOH.  MOH previously announced that vaccination centres will be stepped down progressively with the majority of the population vaccinated. The joint testing and vaccination centres are set up to ensure that COVID-19 testing and vaccination services remain accessible to the general public. “Vaccinations are critical to protect us against severe illness when infected with COVID-19, especially given the uptick in cases. In this regard, we strongly recommend that seniors aged 70 years and above (and especially those aged 80 years and above) take their second booster shot,” said MOH. Those who are eligible should complete their primary vaccination series and get at least their first booster as soon as possible, said the ministry. It added that mobile vaccination teams will soon be deployed to help seniors get boosted. On Tuesday, MOH also said that there has been a 23 per cent week-on-week increase in COVID-19 community cases, “largely driven” by the increased spread of Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5. The surge in BA.4 and BA.5 cases is likely to continue, driven by their higher transmissibility compared to BA.2, said the ministry. Singapore recorded 7,109 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, with 6,393 of them being locally transmitted cases. There have been 1,378,090 COVID-19 cases in Singapore since the start of the pandemic.  "
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/covid-19-omicron-subvariants-23-cent-increase-cases-moh-2760881,"23% week-on-week increase in COVID-19 community cases, driven by rise in BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants: MOH","SINGAPORE: Singapore has seen a 23 per cent week-on-week increase in COVID-19 community infections, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Tuesday (Jun 21). ""The rise is largely driven by increased spread of newer Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5,” it added.  Although the BA.2 subvariant still accounts for the bulk of Singapore’s COVID-19 infections, the Health Ministry said the proportion of BA.4 and BA.5 infections is rising.  About 30 per cent of the COVID-19 cases in the community in the past week were cases with BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, as compared to 17 per cent, 8 per cent and 3 per cent for the previous three weeks respectively.  MOH added that BA.5 alone is estimated to contribute to 25 per cent of all cases this week.  “The surge in BA.4 and BA.5 cases is likely to continue, driven by their higher transmissibility compared to BA.2,” said MOH.  The Health Ministry said current international and local evidence shows that the severity of BA.4 and BA.5 infections is similar to that of earlier Omicron strains.  “The current safe management measures, including the requirement to wear masks while indoors and vaccination-differentiated (safe management measures) for some higher-risk activities, will remain.” MOH said it will continue genomic surveillance for circulating subvariants in Singapore, including requiring some infected individuals to take an additional government-funded polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab for genomic sequencing. “Vaccinations are critical to protect us against severe illness when infected with COVID-19, especially given the uptick in cases. In this regard, we strongly recommend that seniors aged 70 years and above (and especially those aged 80 years and above) take their second booster shot,” added the ministry. All other eligible individuals should complete their primary vaccination series and get at least their first booster as soon as possible. MOH said it will soon be deploying mobile vaccination teams to help seniors get boosted. The Health Ministry also said five new Joint Testing and Vaccination Centres (JTVCs) will begin vaccination and COVID-19 testing operations from Jun 23.  Located in Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Merah, Sengkang, Woodlands and Yishun, the five new JTVCs will bring the total number of such centres across the island to 10.  These centres will offer the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty and Moderna/Spikevax vaccines.  The existing centre in Bishan will offer the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty and Novavax/Nuvaxovid vaccines.  Those aged 12 years and above may walk into any of the centres to receive their vaccination and booster. ""As we step up more JTVCs and consolidate our resources and free up this space for other uses, we will be closing the vaccination centre at Raffles City Convention Centre on Jul 18,"" said MOH. The vaccination centre will accept appointments made via the national appointment system and walk-ins for vaccination until Jul 18.  Singapore has not seen a significant increase of severe COVID-19 cases in its hospitals. The number of cases in the intensive care units also remains low, said MOH.  But the Health Ministry said that the public hospitals remain busy caring for non-COVID patients, and many hospitals experience high bed occupancies.  ""To ensure that precious emergency department resources are available to patients who need urgent emergency care, we strongly advise the public to only seek medical treatment at a hospital’s (emergency department) for serious or life-threatening emergencies. ""Patients with minor ailments are strongly urged to seek medical attention at general practitioner clinics,"" said MOH.  While the population in Singapore is now more resilient against COVID-19, MOH said all individuals must continue to play their part in observing the safe management measures.  They should also exercise individual and social responsibility. Examples include self-testing especially when symptomatic, as well as avoiding social interactions if one has fever or respiratory symptoms, or tests positive for COVID-19. ""As persons with early COVID-19 symptoms may test negative on the antigen rapid test (ART), they should consider repeating an ART test the next day if symptoms continue or worsen. This is because it takes time for a person’s viral load to reach the threshold for detection by the test kit,"" said MOH.  Singapore reported 7,109 new COVID-19 cases as of noon on Tuesday, comprising 6,393 local infections and 716 imported ones. There were no fatalities on Tuesday. The last time Singapore reported more cases than this was on Mar 29, when infections hit 8,164. The weekly infection growth rate is 1.23, the highest since May 24 when the weekly infection growth rate hit 1.35. A number above 1 indicates that the number of new weekly COVID-19 cases is rising. Cases tend to increase on Tuesdays, with Health Minister Ong Ye Kung previously referring to such a pattern, writing on Facebook in October 2021 that numbers would ""always spike after the weekends"". There have been 1,378,090 COVID-19 cases in Singapore since the start of the pandemic.  Editor's note: This article has been amended to clarify the date that Singapore had more COVID-19 cases than the number reported on Jun 21.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/hong-kong-jumbo-kingdom-floating-restaurant-tow-capsize-zero-covid-china-2759826,Commentary: Demise of Jumbo floating restaurant symbolic to many Hong Kongers,"HONG KONG: Oscar Lai was 12 when he first visited Hong Kong’s Jumbo Floating Restaurant in 2006, part of the Jumbo Kingdom that had served the Queen and Hollywood stars. Back then, China was preparing to host the Beijing Olympics and Hong Kong’s stock market had reached a record high, passing 20,000 points. The 27-year-old former student campaigner, who fought for democracy alongside veteran activist Joshua Wong, mourned Jumbo’s departure as yet another victim of the Chinese territory’s tough zero-COVID regime.  Last week residents flocked to take pictures as tugboats towed it out of Hong Kong after the restaurant’s marine licence expired. It represented, Lai told the FT, the loss of a piece of history from Hong Kong’s good old days. Then, just a few days later, it capsized. On Monday night, the operator Aberdeen Restaurant Enterprises said Jumbo “began to tip” over the weekend while being towed through the South China Sea to a secret new home. It said salvaging the vessel would be very difficult. Ever since Macao casino tycoon Stanley Ho, in 1976, opened the doors of the three-storey restaurant, an imitation of imperial Chinese architecture, the floating palace charmed residents, celebrities and tourists with its glitz and glamour. Jumbo Kingdom, which owns the Jumbo and its sister Tai Pak (also closed) floating restaurants, has served more than 30 million customers over the past four decades. Queen Elizabeth II visited Tai Pak in the 1970s on a trip to Hong Kong, when it was still a British colony. Jumbo appeared in movies such as the 2011 science thriller Contagion. In the film, Gwyneth Paltrow plays “patient zero”, a character who is infected with an unknown virus by a chef at the restaurant and spreads it to the rest of the world. But even before the real pandemic, Jumbo Kingdom had recorded an accumulated loss of HK$100 million (nearly US$13 million) since 2013, according to Aberdeen Restaurant Enterprises, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-listed casino group Melco.  Then, as tourists disappeared from the city as it strove for zero-COVID and social distancing measures kept residents away, the restaurant ceased operations in March 2020. Lai and many social media users lamented a lacklustre effort to save Jumbo amid the collapse of Hong Kong’s civil society, with activists from rights groups and many opposition lawmakers either jailed or fleeing the city under the Beijing-imposed sweeping national security law implemented in 2020.  Hong Kong artists and cartoonists, such as “Ah To”, portrayed its demise as a symbol of the loss of political freedoms and judicial independence undermined after the 2019 citywide protests. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s leader, rejected using public money to save the private venture, saying there was no need to “force through an infeasible plan”. A senior business figure told me the government did discuss preserving the restaurant with property developers but the latter felt there were “difficulties to sustain its management”. A plan facilitated by Lam to donate Jumbo to Hong Kong’s not-for-profit Ocean Park also “did not work out as anticipated”, Aberdeen said. The theme park group claimed they could not find a suitable third-party body to operate it. “To many Hong Kongers, it is a great loss with a part of its collective memory being cut off,” Lai, whose parents held their wedding on Jumbo decades ago, told me. This is not the first time the public has been disappointed by the city’s failure to preserve its most recognisable spots. In 2008, local authorities dismantled Queen’s Pier, located in Central district, despite activists’ fierce opposition to preserve it.  As development minister, Lam pledged to reassemble the pier elsewhere, but 14 years later, that has yet to happen. City resident Phyllis, an education administrator in her 40s, said she was “desperate” to find ways to push authorities to save Jumbo, but felt there were increasing restrictions on how people could express their views to those in power.  “If not for the collapse of Hong Kong’s civic society, lawmakers and politicians would have more actively followed up and residents would probably have staged protests against its fate,” she said. “All these freedoms, gone.”"
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/macao-hotel-casino-locked-down-covid-19-case-mass-testing-2760116,"Macao hotel locked down after COVID-19 case, 700 people to be quarantined: Report","HONG KONG: A hotel and casino resort in the world's biggest gambling hub of Macao was locked down by authorities with 700 people inside on Tuesday (Jun 21) due to a coronavirus infection outbreak on the property, local broadcaster TDM reported. The lockdown comes as the Chinese special administrative region carries out a two-day mass testing of its more than 600,000 population after dozens of locally transmitted coronavirus cases were discovered over the weekend. Footage obtained by the broadcaster and industry publications showed police officers in protective gear sealing the complex to prevent people from entering or leaving. Government officials were also preparing COVID-19 tests for the hundreds of people inside. Fortuna, an aged gaudy property located on Macao's main peninsula, is a satellite casino under the umbrella of SJM Holdings the entity created by former Macau kingpin Stanley Ho. Its casino was headed by local businessman Sio Tak Hong, who was arrested last year for alleged corruption and money laundering. The hotel and the government did not immediately respond to request for comment. Macau's previous coronavirus outbreak was in October last year and the city has not previously had any large-scale quarantine or lockdowns. Dozens of cases have emerged since the weekend but still far below daily infections in places including neighbouring Hong Kong where infections have jumped to more than 1,000 in recent days. The Chinese-ruled former Portuguese colony adheres to China's ""zero COVID"" policy which aims to eradicate all outbreaks, at just about any cost, running counter to a global trend of trying to co-exist with the virus. Most residents are asked to stay at home, restaurants are shut for dine-in and border restrictions have been tightened, meaning casino revenues are likely to be close to zero for at least a week and likely in the coming weeks, analysts said. Hong Kong's outbreak this year saw more than 1 million confirmed infections, and more than 9,000 deaths, swamping hospitals and public services. Officials there say they are unlikely to further tighten restrictions as the pressure on medical services has not increased. Macao only has one public hospital with its services already stretched on a daily basis. The territory's swift plan to test its entire population comes as it keeps open the border with China, with many residents living and working in next door Chinese city Zhuhai. "

The study comes as China, which has approved only locally developed COVID-19 shots including the Sinopharm vaccine, strives to improve vaccination rates, maintaining a ""dynamic zero-COVID"" policy aimed at eradicating all outbreaks while many countries have adopted an approach of learning to live with the virus. The vaccine, BBIBP-CorV, is one of the two Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine shots approved for use in China, and is also the main shot that the state-owned firm has exported. Among 25 individuals who received two doses of BBIBP-CorV vaccine, the neutralising activity against sub-variants such as BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5 ""was not or only minimally detectable"", researchers said in correspondence published on Monday. Neutralising activity against those sub-variants was observed in just 24 per cent to 48 per cent of subjects who received a BBIBP-CorV booster shot after the two-dose product, researchers said, citing results from a group of 25 participants. The rate improved slightly to 30 per cent to 53 per cent for those who received a third shot made by a unit of Chongqing Zhifei Biological Products, another vaccine approved for use in China, according to data from another group of 30 subjects. The study did not discuss the boosters' efficacy, a rate that reflects how well they could lower the risk of COVID-19 disease or death, which is usually observed in large clinical trials. "

The CDC's move came after a panel of advisers voted to recommend COVID-19 vaccines for those children. The US Food and Drug Administration on Friday authorised Moderna's shot for children aged six months to five years, and Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine for children aged six months to four years. Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine is already authorised for children over the age of five in the US. The Health Ministry began its vaccination exercise for children aged five to 11 on Dec 27 last year.  In an update in January, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) said no serious adverse effects were reported for those in that age group who received their jabs as of end-December.  All individuals regardless of age, who are eligible for COVID-19 vaccination, can walk in for their primary vaccination series and booster doses every day of the week, before 7pm.  No prior appointment is necessary, according to the MOH website.  Children aged five to 11 can walk in with their parents or guardians to any paediatric vaccination centre to receive their vaccination doses. Those aged 12 to 17 can visit any vaccination centre offering the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. As of Sunday, 92 per cent of the total population have completed their full COVID-19 vaccination regimen. About 77 per cent have received their booster shots.  "
