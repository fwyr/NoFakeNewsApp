# NoFakeNews (NFN) (NO LONGER IN DEVELOPMENT)

NoFakeNews is an AI-powered browser extension that detects fake news.

This repository contains the code for the back-end parts of NoFakeNews, where we implement a NLP artificial intelligence model into a deployed Flask web application so that necessary data can be easily sent and retrieved through the browser extension.

[NoFakeNewsExt](https://github.com/objecteds/NoFakeNewsExt) is the repository that contains the code for the front-end browser extension.

### Why?

Fake news can be extremely malicious, inculcating misinformation into those who believe it. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, fake news has spread rapidly within many communities. As more people pay attention to news, during the pandemic, the general population is more susceptible to the intake of fake news. 

Therefore, NoFakeNews was created to prevent the spreading of fake news and improve the quality of social perspectives held by social citzens. 


### Project Status
