### Why?

Fake news can be extremely malicious, inculcating misinformation into those who believe it. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, fake news has spread rapidly within many communities. As more people pay attention to news, during the pandemic, the general population is more susceptible to the intake of fake news. 

Therefore, NoFakeNews was created to prevent the spreading of fake news and improve the quality of social perspectives held by social citzens. 


### Project Status

NFN is extremely early in development. As such, relevant documentation and functionality may not be available. Nonetheless, development is still ongoing.
